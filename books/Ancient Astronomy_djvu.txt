The Wonder of the Skies 


The sight of a truly dark night sky is simply breathtaking. In the modern world 
it is denied to all but those who still live, or might occasionally venture, well be- 
yond the glare of city lights and the effects of atmospheric pollution. For people 
in the past, though, the panoply of thousands of stars was a familiar sight. Some 
twinkled particularly brightly; others hovered on the borderline of visibility. A 
few were tinted orange or blue. They formed distinct patterns that moved 
around but never changed. The Milky Way was a familiar sight to all, snaking 
across the heavens with its light and dark patches forming recognizable shapes. 
The sky also contained numerous isolated faint and fuzzy objects (nebulae), fixed 
among the stars, as well as bright wandering stars (planets), and of course the 
moon, dominating the night sky, lighting the way by night, and rendering many 
of its fainter companions temporarily invisible. Added to all this was the occa- 
sional appearance of something rare or totally unexpected: a shower of meteors 
(shooting stars), a lunar eclipse, an aurora (at high latitudes), or—more seldom 
still—a comet (often perceived as a tailed or plumed star) or a new star (nova). 

The exact appearance of the heavenly vault differed from place to place and 
time to time. Whether it was visible on a particular night was dependent, of 
course, upon local weather conditions. However, the visual impact of the sky on 
a clear night was always stunning, and even in the cloudiest and wettest of places 
there were a good many clear periods. As a result, homan communities the world 
over, and for many thousands of years, have recognized familiar patterns and cy- 
cles of change in the skies, as well as unexpected sights and events, and struggled 
to make sense of them. The inhabitants of the night sky—whether perceived as 
animals, fantastical creatures, legendary characters, ancestors, or other entities— 
were ever present. The cycles of their appearance and disappearance provided the 
basis for, and reinforced, countless creation stories and cultural myths. 

The lack of opportunity to experience the true night sky is, for a great many 
people in the modern Western world, something beyond their control. The same 
cannot be said, though, of the daytime sky, and yet few people pay much atten- 
tion to it beyond worrying about the weather. Only a meager proportion—and 


this does not just apply to city-dwellers—could, for example, orient themselves 
from the time of day and the position of the sun, or could accurately describe the 
way in which the sun’s daily arc through the sky changes with the seasons. 

As a result, it can be difficult for us to imagine just how great an impact the 
sky, whether by night or day, had upon human cultures in the past. Yet we need 
look no further than the many indigenous peoples today for whom the sky con- 
tinues to be of immense importance. In addition to this, certain world religions 
such as Islam continue to tie daily and annual observances very explicitly to the ap- 
pearance of the sun and moon (see ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY). And one only has to talk 
to some of the older people living in rural areas, even in the world’s most densely 
populated and developed nations, to discover that an immense amount of practi- 
cal, everyday sky knowledge was possessed even within living memory. Who, sky 
watchers of the past might wonder, could fail to notice the regular cycle of lunar 
phases keeping time with the human menstrual cycle? Who could fail to recognize 
the changing path taken by the sun through the sky, higher in summer and lower 
in winter? Who, even in an unfamiliar place, could fail to be able to tell directions 
and hence find their way about by night or day using the sun or stars? 


Perceptions of the Skies in the Past 

ARCHAEOASTRONOMY can be defined as the study of beliefs and practices con- 
cerning the sky in the past, especially in prehistory, and the uses to which peo- 
ple’s knowledge of the skies were put. It has been recognized in recent years as a 
legitimate and worthwhile academic pursuit, but it also strikes a popular chord, 
bringing together two of the most attractive sciences, archaeology and astron- 
omy. It combines the excitement of the cosmos with the romance of the past. 
Books making spectacular claims about ancient astronomical knowledge often 
find themselves on bestseller lists. But why should studying people’s perceptions 
of the skies in history, let alone in prehistory, be of particular interest or impor- 
tance to scholars, not to mention anyone else, in the twenty-first century? 

One reason is that archaeoastronomy gives us important insights into how 
people in the past made sense of the world within which they dwelt. People’s lives 
were governed by observations of objects and events in the world around them. 
On one level, it is obvious that human communities needed to keep track of var- 
ious seasonal markers in order to control and maintain their food supply through 
the year. This would be true whether they subsisted by harvesting plants, fruits, 
and tubers, by fishing, by hunting, by herding animals or by growing crops, or 
(most commonly) by a combination of these. CALENDARS, however rudimentary, 
were necessary for survival in all types of human society: for the smallest bands 
of hunter-gatherers; for farming villages controlled by local chiefs; and for com- 
plex urban societies seeking to support the higher social echelons of elite special- 
ists, craftsmen, priests, and kings. 


But humans share a deeper need to understand the world that they inhabit. 
This does not necessarily mean seeing humankind (or the human mind) as exist- 
ing within the “objective reality” of the natural environment, as is the modern sci- 
entific view, but more generally perceiving the cosmos as a conceptual whole with 
oneself and one’s own community embedded within it. In such a view of the 
world, the human body, or the dwelling house, or the sacred temple, is often seen 
as a microcosm reflecting and reinforcing the nature and structure of the cosmos 
as a whole. Such a worldview makes people strive to be at one with the cosmos 
of which they are a part and achieve a harmony of existence that enables indi- 
viduals and whole communities to survive and flourish. This harmony is sustained 
by continually observing what is happening in the world and keeping one’s own 
actions in tune. 

The sky was an integral and prominent part of the perceived cosmos. Its fa- 
miliar sights and unceasing cycles were part of the fabric of life. Its rhythms were 
correlated with the time of day and with the seasons. In fact, although we know 
these cycles to be unfailingly regular and reliable, to past peoples they may not 
have appeared any more so than a host of other seasonal indicators in the world 
around them. The important point for us is that, unlike the rest of their perceived 
world, the sky is a part that we can visualize directly. Landscapes change: patterns 
of settlement and land use alter, people move around, plants constantly grow and 
die. We only have indirect knowledge of the appearance of past landscapes. But 
thanks to modern astronomy, we can reconstruct mathematically the actual ap- 
pearance of the sky (or, at least, the regular aspects of it—that is, the appearance 
of the sun, moon, planets, and stars) at any place on earth at any time in the past 
and visualize it on a computer display or in a planetarium. This gives us a “direct 
view” of a prominent part of the world that was perceived by peoples in the past. 

By studying knowledge passed down orally through myth and story, as well 
as a variety of other types of evidence available to the historian and the archaeol- 
ogist, we can begin to appreciate the many different ways in which human soci- 
eties came to understand what they saw in the skies, and how they came to “use” 
that knowledge for cultural ends. The sky could, for instance, affirm the POWER 
of cultural elites, as in the case of the Inca rulers, whose right to rule stemmed 
from their avowed relationship to the sun god himself (see CEQUE SYSTEM; CUSCO 
SUN PILLARS). Then again, it could reinforce the status of a shaman or priest who, 
by performing the appropriate rites at the appropriate times, could be seen as able 
to affect what happened in the sky—for example by reversing the direction of the 
sun at the winter solstice and preventing the days from getting ever shorter and 
colder. Likewise, people tend to lay out buildings in tune with the cosmos, in other 
words, reflecting perceived links with the wider world (see, for example, NAVAJO 
HOGAN; PAWNEE EARTH LODGE). Where these links relate to the sky—for instance, 
to the rising or setting position of the sun, moon, or stars—then we have partic- 
ular hope of recognizing them, since we know where these celestial bodies ap- 


peared in the past (see HOW THE SKY HAS CHANGED OVER THE CENTURIES). By study- 
ing architectural alignments upon sky phenomena, we can obtain valuable in- 
sights into the worldviews that engendered them. 

There is no reason investigations of people’s perceptions of the skies should 
be limited to past societies, and a field known as ETHNOASTRONOMY has emerged 
in recent years alongside archaeoastronomy, concerned with studies of beliefs and 
practices relating to the sky among modern indigenous peoples. Since there is no 
hard line between past and present, many scholars prefer to merge the two fields 
and to speak instead of cultural astronomy. Regardless of how the subject is di- 
vided up, the study of people’s perceptions of the skies has a deep resonance and 
helps us appreciate the richness and diversity of human cognition and belief (see 
COGNITIVE ARCHAEOLOGY). 

This said, our knowledge of particular practices is always indirect, whether 
the evidence we are working with is ethnographic, historical, or archaeological, 
and questions of METHODOLOGY are highly important. For example, when study- 
ing an astronomical alignment (such as a building or temple oriented upon solsti- 
tial sunrise) it is necessary to have reasonable confidence that the alignment was 
actually intentional. This is not self-evident, since everything must, after all, point 
somewhere. In the 1970s, an abyss developed between two groups of academics 
regarding the interpretation of British megalithic monuments (see MEGALITHIC 
MONUMENTS OF BRITAIN AND IRELAND). On the one side were those who paid great 
attention to STATISTICAL ANALYSIS but little to anthropological theory and tended 
to argue that “MEGALITHIC ASTRONOMY” was highly mathematically sophisticated. 
On the other were those who did the reverse and reached the diametrically oppo- 
site conclusion: that ancient peoples had no interest in the sky at all. 

To get past this impasse, it is important to distinguish between “our” sci- 
ence, which provides tried and tested methods for fairly selecting and assessing ev- 
idence, and “their” science, the worldview (ancient, historical, or indigenous) we 
are interested in (see PALAEOSCIENCE; SCIENCE OR SYMBOLISM?). Those who are 
mathematically adept but anthropologically naive tend to try to show, in a pro- 
prietary way, that people in the past were our intellectual equals by demonstrat- 
ing that they were capable of sophisticated mathematics and astronomy. The flaw, 
and also the irony, in this approach lies in the desire to measure the achievements 
of a past society against the yardstick of our own. This tendency, well known to 
anthropologists as ETHNOCENTRISM, amounts to putting our own culture on a 
pedestal. It is necessary to recognize that the worldview we are studying might 
well be logical enough in its own terms even though it does not conform in every 
respect to our rationality, since it is built upon different assumptions and princi- 
ples. A few thousand years is nothing in human evolutionary terms, and thus peo- 
ple living a few thousand years ago were undoubtedly our intellectual equals: 
however, their way of thinking was different. We pay respect to that difference by 
trying to understand their way of thinking in its own terms rather than trying to 


make it conform to ours. It is for this reason that many prefer to avoid using the 
singular term astronomy to describe ancient peoples’ interest in the skies, speak- 
ing instead, if they use the term at all, of ancient astronomies. 

All people develop a personal view of the world. It is influenced by their own 
memories and experiences in which any things that may be perceived—objects, 
places, events, people and their actions, other living creatures, and plants—can ac- 
quire particular meanings, as can the relationships perceived to exist between 
them. What is more, among the countless things that make up an individual’s ex- 
perience, some come to acquire more significance than others, in a selection 
process that can seem, to an outsider, highly arbitrary. A “discovery” that seems 
important to one person may be entirely overlooked or simply of no interest to 
another. Thus one of the Mursi, a modern group of cultivators and herders living 
in southwestern Ethiopia, determined the number of days that had elapsed be- 
tween the planting and first harvesting of his sorghum crop by wearing a cord 
round his ankle and tying a new knot in it each day. However, those to whom he 
proudly announced the result were mildly surprised that anyone should have 
taken so much trouble to deduce something so irrelevant to their daily lives— 
something that added nothing to their total stock of knowledge about the world. 

Groups of people living together do, however, tend to develop common 
mindsets—sets of common perceptions and understandings. These worldviews 
are reinforced by shared experiences and social convention, and by regular com- 
munication, which in small groups is likely to take place by means of a common 
language. In the framework of modern Western thought, we organize what we 
perceive in nature according to the principles of Linnaean classification (deriving 
from the work of the eighteenth-century Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus)— 
that is, into a hierarchical structure of groups (taxa) based upon their observable 
characteristics. We also tend to believe that the universe is an empirical reality ex- 
isting independently of the human mind that can progressively be understood 
through rational argument and scientific experimentation. Other worldviews, 
however, do not generally classify objects and phenomena into taxa familiar from 
a Western viewpoint: categories and relationships are not determined by “objec- 
tive” criteria but simply by whether enough people agree on them. As a result 
there is generally no clear distinction between the sacred and the mundane, the 
animate and the inanimate, the empirically real and the fantastic; nor indeed be- 
tween the terrestrial and the celestial. In traditional cultures, creatures such as 
fish-man or bird-woman may be seen as fellow beings, every bit as much a part 
of the perceived universe as entities a Westerner would identify as physically real. 
As an example, Old Star, chief protector of the inhabitants of the sacred He world 
of the Barasana of the Colombian Amazon, is at once a short trumpet, a constel- 
lation corresponding to ORION, the fierce thunder jaguar, and a human warrior. 

The sky is a crucial component in practically every indigenous worldview. 
For earlier peoples and for many indigenous groups around the world today, what 


we in the modern Western world separate out and categorize as astronomical and 
meteorological phenomena were an integral part of the environment as a whole. 
This total environment, including things both real and imagined, was the cosmos; 
the words COSMOLOGY (as widely used in anthropological literature) and cosmo- 
vision are broadly synonymous with worldview. In non-Western worldviews, direct 
associations between the terrestrial and the celestial are commonplace. A good ex- 
ample of this is the BARASANA “CATERPILLAR JAGUAR” CONSTELLATION, whose be- 
havior is believed to relate directly to that of earthly caterpillars, which fall out of 
trees and provide an important food source at a certain time of the year. 


Myths and Monuments 

Where we have first-hand informants or can actually still witness long-standing 
cultural practices, we are in the strongest position to recognize aspects of other 
worldviews. Examples such as the modern Yucatec Maya village of Yalcoba in 
southern Mexico, where the structure of the cosmos is reflected in a whole vari- 
ety of aspects of social behavior, show just how rich and complex these practices 
can be. Yet ethnographers can be misled by informants, especially if they ask the 
wrong questions—all too easy if they have very little initial understanding of the 
nature of the worldview they are studying. Added to this, sacred information is 
often withheld, or the anthropologist may not be at liberty to pass it on. There 
is also the additional danger that the ethnographer may succeed, unwittingly, in 
influencing the very worldview he or she is trying to investigate, so that a subse- 
quent investigator is misled into thinking that certain modern knowledge was in 
fact indigenous. Finally, most of us are limited to approaching the cultural in- 
formation indirectly, at best at second hand, which imposes a selectivity that is 
not of our choosing and a filter—that of the ethnographer’s interpretations— 
through which we are forced to view everything. 

Historical accounts, whether by indigenous people themselves or by past 
ethnographers, are subject to all the problems just mentioned together with some 
additional ones. For one thing, an author who is no longer alive cannot be ques- 
tioned, so there is no possibility of clarification or elaboration. For another, in in- 
terpreting a historical account it may be critical to appreciate the context in which 
it was produced. 

Ancient written records directly relating to astronomy exist not only among 
the civilizations of the Middle and Far East (see for example CHINESE ASTRON- 
OMY). Perhaps the most extraordinary example produced in the American conti- 
nent is the Maya DRESDEN CODEX, a pre-Columbian astronomical (or, more accu- 
rately, astrological) almanac. Both its complexity and level of detail are 
exceptional. In some cultures, other types of recording device encapsulated sacred 
information, including astronomical knowledge or calendrical data. One intrigu- 


ing example is the QuIPU, bundles of knotted strings used in the Inca empire. A 


much more widespread practice, which did not produce any form of written 
record, was to embed sky knowledge and cosmological beliefs within myths that 
were transmitted from generation to generation orally. Storytelling may have been 
entertaining, but it could also have the deeper purpose of passing on wisdom. Cre- 
ation myths often served to confirm a community’s rightful place in space and 
time, or to establish the genealogical credentials, and hence the social standing, of 
a king or leader. (Genealogies were not limited to homan forbears. The KUMULIPO, 
a 2,000-line long Hawaiian creation chant composed in the eighteenth century, re- 
counted in detail how chief Ka-‘I-i-mamao was related, ultimately, to everything 
in the world.) Some sacred stories were carefully learned and recounted, often in 
the context of formal ceremonies. Other tales might change in the telling, bring- 
ing many variations down to us but leaving intact the essential underlying sub- 
stance and meaning. 

The further we delve into the past, the more we find ourselves limited to the 
archaeological record—the material remains of past human activity. Silent align- 
ments of stone temples and tombs, interplays of sunlight and shade that light up 
dark spaces only on rare occasions, symbols with unfathomable meanings but 
which resemble the sun or moon or familiar groups of stars—these form many of 
the most famous manifestations of ancient astronomy. But they also present the 
serious scholar with serious methodological problems. Every oriented structure 
must point towards some point on the horizon, and in all likelihood to one or 
more identifiable astronomical targets. Similarly, the majority of entrances and 
openings will let in a shaft of sunlight at some time of the year and day. The mere 
existence of (say) a solar alignment is no guarantee that this meant anything to 
the builders of a house, temple, or tomb. Since astronomical alignments can—and 
frequently will—occur completely by chance, we must do more than simply “but- 
terfly collect” them if we are interested in what they actually meant to people in 
the past. There are two ways of proceeding: either to seek statistical confirma- 
tion—for example, by identifying a group of several monuments in which a cer- 
tain type of astronomical alignment occurs repeatedly—or by finding corroborat- 
ing archaeological evidence of different forms. An example of the former is the 
RECUMBENT STONE CIRCLES of northeast Scotland, which have a consistent orien- 
tation relating to the moon. Two different examples of the latter, also from Ne- 
olithic and Bronze Age Britain, are the THORNBOROUGH henges (large round em- 
banked enclosures) in Yorkshire, England, and the cairns at Balnuaran of Clava 
in Inverness, Scotland (see CLAVA CAIRNS). 

In some cases, such as pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, we have both archaeo- 
logical and other forms of evidence, including ethnohistory (accounts recorded 
during the early years of European contact), iconography, and written records (see 
“BROWN” ARCHAEOASTRONOMY). Integrating these diverse forms of evidence can 
be a considerable challenge. This problem is illustrated by the prolonged contro- 
versy that surrounded the putative Venus alignment at the so-called Governor’s 


Palace at the Maya city of Uxmal (see GOVERNOR’S PALACE AT UXMAL). Inscriptions 
on the building attest to a strong interest in the planet Venus, but the apparent 
orientation of the building toward an extreme rising point of the planet has gen- 
erated much debate. In ancient Mesoamerica in general, the historical evidence re- 
lating to astronomy and calendrics is strong, and the archaeological evidence—for 
example in the form of alignments—tends to strengthen and corroborate this. If 
it were not for the accounts of the early Spanish chroniclers, the calendrical in- 
scriptions, and the vital bark books (codices), we would simply have no idea of 
the sophistication and complexity of Mesoamerican astronomy. 

In other places there can be a finer balance. The origins of a piece of oral his- 
tory are typically much more obscure than the historical context of written 
records or inscriptions. It can be extremely difficult to separate genuine traditions 
and stories that stretch back over many generations from more modern inventions 
or infiltrations. In Hawai’i, a very rich oral heritage existed until the early nine- 
teenth century, of which only fragments now survive (see HAWAIIAN CALENDAR; 
POLYNESIAN AND MICRONESIAN ASTRONOMY). Yet in assessing the significance of 
temple alignments in these islands, some of those surviving fragments may con- 
tain vital gems of information (see POLYNESIAN TEMPLE PLATFORMS AND ENCLO- 
SURES). They are of uncertain provenance, so must be used with extreme caution, 
but one would be unwise to simply ignore them and revert to statistics alone. 

Where the only available evidence is archaeological, it is possible to use 
analogies from different cultures where other forms of evidence exist to suggest 
interpretations. Thus in the 1970s, the Scottish archaeologist Euan MacKie at- 
tempted to use the analogy of Maya society to argue (in support of theories, pop- 
ular at the time, that many of the British megaliths were high-precision observa- 
tories) for the existence of highly skilled astronomer-priests in Neolithic Britain 
(see “MEGALITHIC ASTRONOMY”; “MEGALITHIC” CALENDAR). However, this direct 
use of ethnographic or historical analogy is generally fraught with problems. 
Most archaeologists concluded, for a variety of reasons, that MacKie’s efforts 
were badly misguided. On the other hand, analogies can be very useful in chal- 
lenging assumptions that might have been made too unquestioningly, and hence 
in suggesting new interpretative possibilities. It is generally assumed, for example, 
that any people who observed the changing rising and setting position of the sun 
on the horizon over the year must have understood that this regulated seasonal 
events. Yet while it is true that some of the Mursi, already mentioned, track the 
changing rising position of the sun on the horizon, the MURSI CALENDAR is based 
upon the moon. The sun is regarded as no more reliable a seasonal indicator than 
the behavior of various birds, animals, or plants. The Mursi example stops us 
leaping to conclusions about practices in the past by showing us that the range of 
possibilities is wider than we might have imagined. 

In summary, where we have only archaeological evidence to go on, it may be 
possible to gain insights into prehistoric worldviews by recognizing symbolic as- 


sociations in the material record. Analogy may be useful in the process of inter- 
pretation, but our conclusions will never be categorical. We can only ever have a 
certain degree of belief that a specific association had meaning to a particular 
group of people, although our belief may be strengthened or weakened by further 


evidence. 


From Tally Marks to Calendars 
How did people begin to make links between different cycles of activity they ob- 
served around them and hence begin to understand and control the periodic 
changes in the natural world as they perceived it? At what stage did they start 
consciously to plan their own actions in accordance with those perceptions? 
Groups of people from the earliest times would certainly have varied their 
subsistence activities in accordance with the seasons, whether these involved 
searching for edible plants and animals, fishing, or hunting. But in this alone they 
were little different from many others in the animal kingdom: many birds, after 
all, undertake seasonal migrations. Two characteristics that have distinguished 
humankind for several tens of thousands of years are people’s capacity for ab- 
stract thought—making connections between things in order to satisfy the desire 
to make sense of them—and the use of symbolic representation to express ideas. 
There is ample evidence of the latter in the Upper Palaeolithic, in the form of sys- 
tematic markings on many small portable objects such as pieces of bone. Their 
meaning is much debated, but it has been suggested that some at least represented 
rudimentary lunar calendars—tallies of days or some other sort of symbolic no- 
tation relating to the lunar phase cycle. The most famous example is a fragment 
of eagle’s wing found in a cave at Abri Blanchard in southern France, dating to 
around 30,000 B.c.E. (see ABRI BLANCHARD BONE). Some much more recent, and 
less controversial, examples of possible lunar tallies among hunter-gatherers are 
found in rock art from northeastern Mexico. The site of PRESA DE LA MULA, near 
Monterrey, is one of two petroglyphs that seem to record counts of days stretch- 
ing over seven synodic (lunar-phase-cycle) months, divided up according to the 
appearance of the moon. However, these designs were not calendars: they were 
clearly not intended for regulating future activities. Rather, they were first-hand 
observational records, with all the vagaries and imperfections this implies. 
Counting days, as such, is unlikely to have been an overriding issue for most 
people in the past. They had to be aware of many different cycles of activity in 
their lives. One of the most effective ways of keeping track of things is through 
myth and appropriately timed ritual performance. These were invariably tied in, 
along with many aspects of living and being, with the unchanging entities in the 
sky and the ceaseless cycles in which they were seen to move. Stories help describe 
the world and explain why things are as they are. Ceremonies serve in a very ac- 


tive way to affirm the natural order. Stories and ceremonies also involve an ele- 


ment of control, in that their successful performance, with adherence to strict pro- 
tocols, is often seen as necessary—even vital—in order to ensure continuity, re- 
newal, and growth. The appropriate rituals may ensure the arrival of the sun on 
a given morning, or bring about the reversal of the sun’s winterward movement 
so that it will return and give greater warmth again each spring. Whether per- 
formed by a lone shaman, by whole communities working in unison, or by a pow- 
erful priest with the active participation of a controlling elite, rituals, ceremonies, 
and other performances can ensure that the order of the cosmos, and of the lives 
of the people within it, is duly maintained. The Blessingway and other sacred rites 
of the Navajo people are just one example of performances of this kind recorded 
in modern times and, in some cases, continuing to the present day, both among 
native Americans and among indigenous peoples around the world. The Bless- 
ingway ceremony serves to ensure good health, prosperity, and so on by prevent- 
ing misfortune, and involves detailed renditions of the Navajo creation story (see 
NAVAJO COSMOLOGY). 

What may be an extremely old tradition of myths and performances relates 
to the identification of two bears circling around the northern celestial pole. The 
evidence to support this assertion, paradoxically, is found in modern oral tradi- 
tions across Europe. In the Basque country, the bears’ motions around the celes- 
tial pole are linked to an annual cycle of storytelling and song and dance per- 
formances involving whole communities. Other variants are found throughout 
Europe. Constellation myths within the framework of Greek and Near Eastern 
thought form an integral part of the modern Western heritage, but the prevalence 
of indigenous bear myths suggests that two circumpolar bears are star figures em- 
anating from much older cosmological traditions (see SKY BEARS). 

In the 1969 book Hamlet’s Mill, Giorgio De Santillana and Hertha Von 
Dechend suggested that specific astronomical knowledge—namely the gradual 
shifting of the entire mantle of stars over the centuries due to a phenomenon 
known as PRECESSION—had been systematically “encoded” in mythological narra- 
tives all over the world over a period of many millennia. There are various prob- 
lems with the evidence presented in support of this idea, but there is also a funda- 
mental difficulty with the idea itself. It presupposes an almost universal concern in 
ancient times with a particular concept (precession) familiar to ourselves. This is 
very different from arguing that some communities in certain places and times 
might have had stable enough cosmologies—sky knowledge passed down accu- 
rately enough over several generations—to have noticed the gradually changing ap- 
pearance of the sky and attempted to come to terms with it in one way or another. 

The point about the sky bears, on the other hand, is that we may be glimps- 
ing an ancient framework of understanding very different from the Western one. 
According to the American linguist Roslyn Frank, who has investigated the rele- 
vant European folk traditions in detail, it was a framework in which earthly bears 
were venerated. She argues that a human individual playing the role of a bear 


shaman acted to maintain the cosmic order, organizing the cycle of earthly cere- 
monial in tune with the annual cycles of the stars. If Frank is right, then we should 
not look back to some sort of universal, all-prevailing myth or cosmology, diluted 
with time, but rather to one that always coexisted with many others. One would 
have to argue that it achieved particular prevalence at high northern latitudes be- 
cause it brought together what was seen on earth and in the sky in a particularly 
effective and understandable way; thus it tended to propagate, encountering and 
mixing with other traditions, and eventually leaving traces visible in folk tradi- 
tions to this very day. 

Another way in which a people can affirm the perceived cosmic order is by 
carefully timed movement through the landscape. The Lakota people of South 
Dakota, for example, traditionally keep their subsistence activities in tune with 
other seasonal cycles by moving from one place to another in an annual pattern 
that, as they see it, reflects the sun’s movement through the constellations (see 
LAKOTA SACRED GEOGRAPHY). Their annual round combines subsistence activities 
focused upon the terrestrial movements of the buffalo, with sacred rites focused 
upon the celestial movements of the sun. In doing so, it ties together earth, sky, 
and people into a comprehensible whole, thereby keeping everything in harmony. 
The Mursi of Ethiopia perceive a direct connection between the successive disap- 
pearance of four bright stars in the southern sky and events on the ground related 
to successive floods of the river Omo. This enables them to time their annual mi- 
gration to the banks of the Omo precisely enough to carry out the vital planting 
of their crop of cowpeas within a few days of the river’s final flood. 

Can we hope to find, in the material record, evidence of astronomically 
timed movement through the landscape in the past? If we could determine the 
times of year when certain sites or locations were occupied, and if we could spot 
symbolic links between these places and the sun or stars, then it is certainly pos- 
sible that this could give us some clues. Symbolism relating to a solstice, at a site 
that is occupied around the time of solstice, is one possibility. It has been sug- 
gested that CHACO CANYON in New Mexico was a focus for sacred pilgrimage for 
Anasazi (ancestral Pueblo) communities in the surrounding area around the 
eleventh century C.E. The archaeological evidence for this is supported by ar- 
chaeoastronomical evidence that people in the outlying communities used astro- 
nomical observations to synchronize their convergence upon Chaco. Another, 
much older, example of a similar phenomenon occurs at THORNBOROUGH, a group 
of Neolithic henges in Yorkshire, England. Here the archaeoastronomical evi- 
dence consists of a series of alignments upon the rising position of the three stars 
of ORION’s belt, suggesting that it might have been the first predawn appearance 
(HELIACAL RISE) of this asterism that triggered an annual PILGRIMAGE for an autumn 
festival at the henges. 

In modern indigenous societies, we see ample evidence of the various ways 


in which people strive to harmonize what they do with cycles of events in the nat- 


ural world. Studies of tally counts, astronomically related myth and ritual per- 
formance, and patterns of ritual movement have begun to reveal some of the 
ways in which this may have been done in the past. CALENDARS—self-consistent 
systems of marking time—developed from these more rudimentary perceptions 
of correlations between different cycles of activity in nature, and the desire to 
keep human activities—ones that we might identify as sacred, mundane, or hav- 
ing aspects of both—in tune with natural events. The cycles of change of the ce- 
lestial bodies—regular, immutable, and reliable—are clearly of particular impor- 
tance in this context. 

It is commonly assumed that there is a natural progression of calendrical 
development relating to astronomical observation. The first step is to develop a 
simple month-by-month calendar based on the phase cycle of the moon, the 
most obvious cycle in the night sky. However, because there are between twelve 
and thirteen synodic (phase-cycle) months in a solar year, it follows that in or- 
der to keep in phase with the seasons, one needs to have twelve months in some 
years and thirteen in others. The second step, then, is to take note of phenom- 
ena that are related to the seasons, including astronomical ones, using them to 
keep lunar calendars in pace with the seasonal year by inserting or omitting a 
month from time to time as required (see LUNAR AND LUNI-SOLAR CALENDARS). 
The ancient Egyptians, for example, used the first predawn appearance (helia- 
cal rise) of Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, to keep the start of the new year 
in step with the annual flood of the Nile. Sirius would have been first seen ap- 
proximately eleven days later in the twelfth month each year. Whenever it did 
not appear until the last few days of the twelfth month, then an extra or inter- 
calary month was added so that it would continue to rise in the final month of 
the following year. 

A seasonally related phenomenon of particular importance is the changing 
rising or setting position of the sun along the horizon (see SOLSTICES, SOLSTITIAL DI- 
RECTIONS). Once a society recognizes this, they can use it to regulate a solar cal- 
endar that is entirely independent of the moon. If the horizon is sufficiently dis- 
tant and contains a good many distinctive points, then such a calendar can quite 
easily be kept accurate to within two or three days of the “true” solar year. One 
of the classic modern examples of a solar horizon calendar is that of the Hopi peo- 
ple of Arizona. As first recorded by the ethnographer Alexander Stephen at the 
end of the nineteenth century, solar horizon observations were used by the Hopi 
both to regulate crop-planting activities and to pinpoint events within an elabo- 
rate ceremonial calendar (see HOPI CALENDAR AND WORLDVIEW). 

The final step in the development of luni-solar calendars is to replace the ad 
hoc insertion or omission of intercalary months by a systematic procedure. By 
about the fifth century B.c.E., the Babylonians had developed a fixed system 
whereby a thirteenth month was inserted into seven different years, in a fixed pat- 
tern, within every period of nineteen years (see BABYLONIAN ASTRONOMY AND AS- 


TROLOGY). This Metonic cycle, named after the Greek astronomer Meton, keeps 
the lunar calendar in step with the solar year to within an error of just one day in 
every 200 years. 

The Babylonian calendar was an impressive achievement made possible by 
systematic astronomical observations recorded over many generations. However, 
ancient calendars do not inevitably follow the progression just described (and 
even in Babylonia itself, calendrical developments were more complicated). The 
Mursi yet again provide a good example. They have what, to an outsider, looks 
like a thoroughly haphazard calendar in which no one ever seems to know for cer- 
tain what month it is, although everyone believes there are “experts” around. In 
practice, different opinions always exist, and the calendar is effectively adjusted 
“on the fly” according to various seasonal markers—though no one is aware that 
these adjustments are being made. The calendar is completely self-consistent in its 
own terms, and there is no need for intercalary months. The nearby Borana have 
a completely different and utterly distinctive luni-stellar calendar that reckons the 
time of the month and year by observing the moon in relation to the stars, com- 
pletely ignoring the sun (see BORANA CALENDAR). The Works part of HESIOD’s 
Works and Days describes farmers’ rules of thumb in eighth-century B.c.E. Greece 
that related exclusively to seasonal astronomical phenomena such as the heliacal 
rising of stars; the lunar phases are only mentioned in the separate Days part. The 
Roman civic calendar, upon which the modern (Western) calendar is based, only 
emerged from chaos when it ignored the moon completely (see ROMAN ASTRON- 
OMY AND ASTROLOGY). On the other hand, uncorrected lunar calendars remain of 
considerable importance to this day, one of the most obvious examples being the 
Islamic calendar (see ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY). Finally, the ancient Mesoamerican cal- 
endar, arguably the most sophisticated and complex of all the world’s calendars, 
operated by combining cycles as diverse as the 365-day year, a 260-day cycle 
(whose astronomical derivation, if it is astronomically derived at all, remains un- 
clear), and the 584-day synodic cycle of the planet Venus (see MESOAMERICAN CAL- 
ENDAR ROUND). 

In short, there is no inevitable path in the development of calendars. Instead, 
they advance in diverse ways according to local conditions and needs. This means, 
for one thing, that they cannot be used as yardsticks of cultural achievement. It 
also means that they cannot be considered as abstractions, divorced from the so- 
cial context in which they developed and the social needs that they fulfilled. The 
Hopi calendar, for example, had (as we would see it) both a pragmatic and a sa- 
cred function, but from the Hopi perspective it functioned holistically to ensure 
the well-being of the community in all respects. Different calendars can have dif- 
ferent purposes and even run alongside one another, as—it appears—did the reli- 
gious and administrative calendars in ancient Egypt (see ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CAL- 
ENDARS). To the historian or archaeologist, understanding the technical aspects of 


an ancient calendar is often of limited interest. It is much more intriguing (and of- 


ten much more challenging) to understand how a calendar operated in its social 
context, what it meant to people, and what its social implications were. 

Modern folk calendars and associated traditions that still exist in many parts 
of the world, particularly in rural communities, often preserve an inherently ho- 
listic worldview, integrating earth and sky in a mixture of what the modern sci- 
entist would be inclined to view as rationality and superstition. In the Baltic States 
of Latvia and Lithuania, for instance, a mixture of prognostications survives that 
relate people’s character, health, and happiness to the phase of the moon at the 
time of their birth and at important moments in their lives. This Baltic tradition 
leads to a related issue: the role of ASTROLOGY. The history of astronomy is clearly 
intimately bound up with the history of astrology; the distinction between the two 
is only an issue in the context of the modern scientific way of understanding the 
world. Taking an anthropological viewpoint, we must realize that systems of 
thought including beliefs that we might describe as “astrological” may themselves 
constitute ways of understanding the world that are perfectly coherent and logi- 
cal in their own terms. Thus by considering the biblical skies from the point of 
view of the astrologers of the time, rather than simply as modern astronomers, a 
very plausible solution has recently been suggested to the riddle of the identity of 
the STAR OF BETHLEHEM, which has perplexed astronomers for years. 

Ancient peoples generally did not share the modern conception of time as an 
abstract entity, as a line along which we move through our lives (see SPACE AND 
TIME, ANCIENT PERCEPTIONS OF). The earliest calendars almost certainly did not 
come into being as a result of simply conceived astronomical observations under- 
taken in order to mark the passage of abstract time. They emerged in the context 
of complex views of the universe in which many aspects of natural and human ac- 
tivity were seen as tied together in fundamental ways. This concept is of vital im- 
portance when we try to interpret archaeological monuments that appear to have 
incorporated alignments marking sunrise or sunset on particular calendrical 
dates. A fundamental question is: Which regular astronomical events might have 
been significant to people in the past? Alongside the sOLsTICEs, the EQUINOXES are 
widely assumed to have had inherent significance, yet many investigators have 
been surprised to discover the absence of equinoctial markers in the culture they 
are studying. From the point of view of the observers themselves, however, there 
is a clear difference between the two. The solstices are tangible: at these times, the 
sun reaches the physical extremes of its motions along the horizon. The SOLSTITIAL 
DIRECTIONS mark the boundary between those parts of the horizon where the sun 
can rise or set, only passes over, or is never seen. These define a natural division 
of the world, as seen from any central point of observation, into four parts. The 
equinoxes, on the other hand, would in practice only have been observable as 
halfway points between the solstices. They would generally have been no more 
likely than any other date in the year to be correlated with any of the other sea- 
sonal events that would actually have meant something to people. The midpoint, 


whether in time or space, seems significant only if one views time and space in the 
abstract. This is not to deny that particular groups of people in the past may have 
chosen to divide the year into four roughly equal divisions, but we can not sim- 
ply assume that the equinox was a significant calendrical date for all. 


Interpreting the Archaeological Record 

As we have seen, astronomy helps us learn how the cosmos was perceived and 
understood in the past based on evidence we can retrieve from the material 
record. The “raw resource” is directly accessible to us: within certain boundaries 
of error we can reconstruct the positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets in 
the night sky at any place and any time in the past. This means that we can read- 
ily identify ways in which ancient architecture could have made reference to ce- 
lestial objects and events. But we must retain a sense of proportion. The astro- 
nomical ORIENTATION of a monument, to take an example, might only have 
conveyed meaning to a few people around the time of its construction, whereas 
the monument would also have been significant to people in many other ways, 
communicating meaning by way of its form, the materials used, and other as- 
pects of its location. 

In recent years archaeologists have applied a variety of interpretative ap- 
proaches to the study of how people in the past conceptualized the LANDSCAPE. Yet 
landscape itself is a limiting if not excluding term. Its use reinforces a Western 
conceptualization of space that divides the world into three distinct parts—land, 
sea, and sky—and then, more often than not, leads us to ignore two out of three 
of these. Contrast this concept of landscape with that of the indigenous person 
who would, without hesitation, identify numerous connections between objects 
and events in the sky and many other aspects of his or her experience. In dealing 
with past as well as modern indigenous societies, the term worldview should 
mean exactly that: a people’s understanding of the totality of the perceived envi- 
ronment. 

The evidence available to the archaeologist consists of a present-day land- 
scape containing scattered traces of past human activity, the end result of cen- 
turies—even millennia—of processes of attrition that have served to modify and 
to destroy. Archaeologists can look at the remains of permanent structures such 
as houses, tombs, and temples, and examine their location as well as architectural 
features that seem to express associations with features in the visible landscape 
and objects in the sky. Other human activities leave traces that are fixed in space, 
such as rock art (see PRESA DE LA MULA; SWEDISH ROCK ART). Beyond this are nu- 
merous types of material evidence, such as small artifacts, which are not fixed in 
space but may still tell us a great deal in various ways. 

A well-tried approach is to try to identify alignments that were deliberately 


incorporated in architecture or in the location of manmade structures in relation 


to other prominent features in the landscape. The latter approach has been suc- 
cessful in central Mexico, where the day of sunrise or sunset behind prominent 
mountains as viewed from certain pyramids and palaces has been found to corre- 
late with calendrical ceremonies performed in sanctuaries built on those moun- 
tains. The hilltop palace of CACAXTLA, built in what is now the Mexican state of 
Tlaxcala in the seventh century C.E., was located directly on a preexisting align- 
ment connecting an older ceremonial site with La Malinche, a prominent volcanic 
peak still important today as a source of rain and symbol of fertility. The times in 
the year when the sun rose behind this mountain from Cacaxtla and other temples 
in the alignment marked two important calendrical festivals and times of ritual pil- 
grimage. The observances survive, in the form of Christian festivals, to this day. 

In this instance ethnohistoric and ethnographic evidence confirms the mean- 
ing of symbolic alignments. Where such evidence does not exist, identifying mean- 
ingful alignments is much more problematic. Clearly, it is possible to identify 
alignments between manmade structures and natural features that are in fact to- 
tally fortuitous and had no meaning whatsoever to anyone in the past. One pos- 
sibility is to look for (what seem to us to have been) the most prominent man- 
made and natural features in the landscape in order to examine possible 
alignments of significance between them. But even this may be misleading. Mursi 
sun watchers stand by a favorite boulder or tree to make observations rather than 
erecting a more permanent marker that would be evident in the archaeological 
record of the future. Many important dates in the Hopi solar horizon calendar are 
marked by tiny, inconspicuous skyline notches, while many more conspicuous 
horizon features are unused. Furthermore, there is generally no obvious natural 
feature (such as a prominent notch or peak) in the solstitial directions, important 
as these actually were and are to the Hopi. The reason is that traditional Hopi vil- 
lages from which observations were made were not located with regard to as- 
tronomy and calendrics. Walpi, for example, is perched on a narrow cliff-top 
mesa: its inhabitants had a given horizon and could not move their position of ob- 
servation except within very narrow margins in and around the village. They did 
make precise horizon observations, but this fact would not be recoverable from 
the archaeological record alone. Any future archaeologist proposing that these 
particular alignments were significant would be open to the accusation of being 
highly selective with the data. 

In other cases, however, evidence of horizon observations might be more 
readily identifiable in the archaeological record of the future. The Zuni, for ex- 
ample, had sun-watching stations used for horizon observations prior to the sum- 
mer solstice. And the inhabitants of the Polynesian island of MANGAREVA estab- 
lished observation places for noting the summer and winter solstices against 
suitable landmarks, such as adjacent islets or mountain ridges, often erecting 
stones upon them as foresights. This example bears some similarity to the inter- 
pretation of many of the British megaliths, erected in the third and second mil- 


lennia B.C.E., put forward in the mid-twentieth century by the Scottish engineer, 
Alexander Thom (see THOM, ALEXANDER). Basing his conclusions upon surveys of 
many hundreds of STONE CIRCLES, SHORT STONE ROWS, and single standing stones, 
Thom concluded that “megalithic man” had undertaken high-precision observa- 
tions of the sun and moon using distant mountainous horizons as the observing 
instrument. The megaliths, according to Thom, marked where to stand and, in 
many cases, pointed out the horizon foresight (such as a conspicuous notch be- 
tween two mountains) that was to be viewed. 

Thom’s results did not stand the test of time. One reason is that his data set 
included a wide variety of sites spanning a wide geographical area and a period of 
some two millennia (see MEGALITHIC MONUMENTS OF BRITAIN AND IRELAND). Subse- 
quent analyses that have been restricted to certain areas during particular periods, 
and have taken account of a wider range of archaeological evidence, have been 
more successful. The Scottish RECUMBENT STONE CIRCLES (RSCs) are particularly en- 
lightening in this respect. These are a group of several dozen stone circles confined 
to an area within about fifty kilometers (thirty miles) of Aberdeen in northeastern 
Scotland. Their distinguishing feature is a single recumbent stone flanked by two 
tall uprights, which are without exception oriented between west-southwest and 
south-southeast, that is, within a quarter of the available horizon. Furthermore, 
they are consistently aligned upon the midsummer full moon, suggesting that cer- 
emonials were carried out there when the midsummer full moon was passing low 
over the recumbent stone. This is a conclusion backed up at one excavated site, 
Berrybrae, where scatters of quartz and burned flint—white stones whose color is 
similar to the light of the moon—were found in the vicinity of the recumbent stone. 
However, more recent excavations at other sites have confounded the issue. 

The RSCs were modest monuments, apparently serving relatively small 
farming communities around 2000 B.c.£. Aligning them upon the moon at an im- 
portant time, and also if possible upon a conspicuous feature in the landscape 
such as a prominent hill (as is the case at many but not all of the circles), tied them 
into nature in two different ways. This almost certainly served to reinforce the sa- 
cred status of the monuments for the people they served. It seems likely that soci- 
ety in this area at the time never became centrally organized and controlled, and 
this has bequeathed to us a set of small, similar monuments among which we can 
easily spot repeated patterns. This enables us to catch a glimpse of some aspects 
of ritual tradition and worldview—a glimpse that points strongly to the moon as 
a principal focus of attention. Similar conclusions have been reached in investiga- 
tions of SHORT STONE ROWS in southwest Ireland. 

A step on from identifying and interpreting monumental alignments is to ask 
why the monuments were placed where they were and not elsewhere. Answering 
this question involves a detailed investigation of whole landscapes to identify po- 
tential alternative locations. Such an investigation was carried out in the late 
1980s in the northern part of the Isle of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland. It 


showed that a set of five stone rows found there, apart from being consistently 
aligned upon the moon, were all placed so that Ben More—the most conspicuous 
mountain on the horizon in the area—was on the very margin of visibility, clearly 
in sight to one side of each row but completely hidden by intervening ground from 
the other. One suggestion is that the stone rows’ main significance was as some 
sort of symbolic boundary marker between areas from which this (sacred?) moun- 
tain was, and was not, visible. 

One supposition that emerges from these studies of monuments incorpo- 
rating astronomical alignments is that many of them became “special” when the 
astronomical body in question appeared at the appointed place. At these times, 
their sacred power was surely reinforced. Another way in which a similar effect 
could be achieved—creating a very considerable visual impact at certain special 
times—was through the interplay of sunlight and shadow. Widespread evidence 
indicates an interest in creating carefully orchestrated interplays of shadow and 
light at sacred places, sometimes producing special effects visible on only very 
rare occasions. A famous example occurs at the passage tomb of NEWGRANGE in 
Ireland. Here, for a few precious minutes after sunrise on a few days around 
winter solstice, the dark interior of the tomb becomes lit up by sunlight shining 
directly down the passage. Even in the present day, such hbierophanies can cap- 
ture the imagination and become the focus of great public spectacles, whether 
or not they were actually intended by the builders. A case in point involves the 
pyramid of KUKULCAN (El Castillo) at Chichen Itza. It contains a staircase on 
each of its four sides, and at the base of the northern staircase is the carved head 
of a serpent. On days close to the equinoxes, the light of the late afternoon sun 
falling across the stepped corner of the pyramid creates the effect of a serpent’s 
body, which only “appears” at these times. This spectacle now attracts tens of 
thousands of visitors. In contrast to Kukulcan, no serious doubts exist that the 
Newgrange hierophany was actually intentional; though, by its nature, it could 
never have formed a great public spectacle, since the space inside the tomb was 
confined. This dramatic effect was intended for the ancestors, or for ancestral 
spirits. 

What was the purpose and meaning of such hierophanies? There is no sim- 
ple answer, but further clues can be found by looking at more modest examples, 
often to be found in rock art. By carefully placing rock art designs, sunlight could 
be made to play across them at certain times, with impressive effect. A number of 
interesting examples are to be found in California, which was densely populated 
by hunter-gatherer groups prior to the European conquest. The Luisefio, for ex- 
ample, had an intense ceremonialism, a rich sky lore, and a calendar regulated by 
various astronomical observations. Although their seasonal calendar was lunar- 
based, they observed and celebrated the solstices, attaching particular importance 
to the winter solstice, which they regarded as a time of cosmological crisis. Solar 


imagery is evident at various Luisefio rock art sites, and light-and-shadow effects 


have been discovered at three or four of them, more than one involving daggers 
of sunlight that bisect painted discs. 

One of the most famous shadow-and-light phenomena concerns a petroglyph 
situated toward the summit of Fajada Butte, in Chaco Canyon (see FAJADA BUTTE 
SUN DAGGER). A carved spiral hidden away behind three slabs of rock leaning 
against a vertical rock face is occasionally lit up by the light of the sun shining 
through cracks in the rocks in front of it. Around noon on the summer solstice, 
however, a thoroughly distinctive dagger of light suddenly appears and bisects the 
carving. How should this be interpreted? Assuming that the slabs were carefully 
placed rather than falling into their positions naturally (and there has been some 
debate on this issue), it appears that a good deal of care was taken in positioning 
the spirals so that the summer solstice, and possibly other times of the year also, 
were clearly marked. The location is difficult to access but good for astronomical 
observation. Comparisons with the practices of historic Pueblos suggest that it 
might have been a sun shrine—a sacred place where a sun priest came to deposit 
offerings at certain important times in the ceremonial year. In this sense it would 
have been far more than a simple calendrical device. It was more likely something 
that, through its powerful symbolism, helped to affirm the sacredness of this in- 
accessible place, and by so doing helped to reinforce the power of the person or 
people who understood its meaning and had the privilege of using it. 

As with astronomical alignments, we again encounter a methodological 
problem: just because we observe a shadow-and-light phenomenon does not 
mean that it was intended by the builders or had any special significance before 
our “discovery” of it. Given any pattern carved on a rock, what are the chances 
that the sun will play across it at some time, quite fortuitously, creating an unin- 
tentional effect? In the case of the Chaco petroglyph, more secure interpretations 
can only stem from wider evidence about Anasazi culture, perhaps with valuable 
clues from historic and modern Pueblo groups. 

A different form of shadow-and-light phenomenon has been noted in Meso- 
america: the so-called zenith tube. ZENITH TUBES are vertical tubes incorporated in 
specialized ceremonial structures that marked the biannual passage of the sun 
through the zenith at noon, at which time sunlight could pass directly down the tube 
and light a chamber below. One of the most impressive examples is found at the ru- 
ins of Xochicalco in Mexico, where a tube more than five meters (sixteen feet) long 
opens into the roof of a natural cave artificially extended to form a rectangular 
gallery with three central pillars. The use of such tubes for the purposes of astro- 
nomical observation cannot be established with certainty but seems likely given the 
known significance of the ZENITH PASSAGE OF THE SUN in Mesoamerica, both from 
studies of the ancient Mesoamerican calendar and from modern ethnography. 

Displays of light and shadow, especially if they occur only infrequently, can 
be highly impressive. It is easy to see how they could have conveyed symbolic 
power, reinforcing sacred associations that formed part of the fabric of the pre- 


vailing worldview. Their presence in the archaeological record has the potential to 
reveal aspects of that worldview to us. The power to impress is conveyed to the 
modern investigator through direct experience—“being there” and experiencing 
the event for oneself has proved popular and is useful in generating tentative in- 
terpretations. But it also brings dangers. There is considerable potential for us to 
experience shadow-and-light phenomena that had no significance whatsoever to 
people in the past. 

Great monuments also have the power to impress, none more so than STONE- 
HENGE in England. Over the years it has attracted more than its fair share of the- 
ories, from the plausible to the plainly ridiculous. However, the general percep- 
tion prevails that there was some sort of connection between Stonehenge and the 
skies, which accounts for its frequent appearance on the front covers of books on 
ancient astronomy. In the meantime, archaeological excavations have put some of 
these theories in a more secure context. The bluestone and sarsen circles, con- 
structed around the middle of the third millennium B.c.£., replaced earlier timber 
constructions built within a circular ditch and bank that had been completed 
some 500 years earlier. The later stone monument was certainly a place of great 
power, and the solstitial alignment of the main axis, which all commentators agree 
was deliberate, represented a shift of several degrees from the earlier orientation. 
The transformation of the monument from timber into stone, the use of exotic 
stones from faraway places, and the sheer size and scale of the edifice strongly 
suggest a process of enriching the ritual symbolism of the site around 2500 B.c.E. 
to legitimize its place at the center of the cosmos and hence its ultimate power. 
This transformation probably served in turn to reinforce the earthly power and 
influence of a social elite. The change in the axis to incorporate the solar align- 
ment was almost certainly part of the same process. 

Modern Western science is only one of many frameworks of thought within 
which people all over the world, from Palaeolithic times to the present day, have 
gained an understanding of natural phenomena, including what could be seen in the 
sky. Modern science only seems the pinnacle of intellectual achievement from a 
Western perspective, and seeing it as such creates a tendency, when trying to com- 
prehend non-Western modes of understanding, to single out particular “advances,” 
seeing them as steps along the road. From an anthropological point of view, it seems 
stiflingly restrictive to proceed in this way when we can seek a much broader ap- 
preciation of different developments in human thought. This can only be achieved 
by studying the great many ways in which people have striven to comprehend the 
world that they inhabit and the many different contexts—physical and social— 
within which particular developments in thought have occurred. This applies just as 
much to sky knowledge as to all other knowledge. Above all, we need to recognize 
the magnificent diversity of human worldviews that has existed through time, and 
to respect them for what they were and are, even though we will inevitably continue 
to describe them, and try to make sense of them, in the framework of our own. 


Using This Book 

The entries in this encyclopedia fall into three categories. First, there are those 
that elaborate upon some of the key themes and issues relating to ancient as- 
tronomy, many of which have been introduced above. They include, for exam- 
ple, LUNAR AND LUNI-SOLAR CALENDARS, PALAEOSCIENCE, and ASTRONOMICAL DAT- 
ING. Other entries in this category relate to particular objects or phenomena in 
the sky and their cultural significance (for example, ORION and LUNAR ECLIPSES). 
Also included are broad definitions and explanations of key concepts (such as 
ARCHAEOASTRONOMY, COSMOLOGY, and ALIGNMENT STUDIES), brief descriptions of 
procedures and techniques (for example, FIELD SURVEY and STATISTICAL ANALYSIS), 
and a few people who have been important in the overall development of the 
subject, such as SIR NORMAN LOCKYER and ALEXANDER THOM. The second cate- 
gory comprises case studies of a variety of types of human society, from hunter- 
gatherer groups to urban city-states, and spanning a chronological and geo- 
graphical range that stretches from Upper Palaeolithic Europe through Polynesia 
and other remote parts of the world prior to European contact. Though the case 
studies are far from exhaustive, they have been carefully selected to illustrate 
particular issues and themes, with an emphasis upon cultures and places that are 
less well known outside the specialist literature of archaeoastronomy. The final 
category of entries consists of short, nontechnical explanations of basic concepts 
like SOLSTICES, HELIACAL RISE, and DECLINATION. At the end of each entry is a list 
of related entries divided into three parts: themes, case studies, and basic con- 
cepts. Straightforward definitions of terms are given in the glossary. 

We have avoided drawing sharp divisions between ancient and modern—di- 
visions that only serve to mask the rich variety of human ways of understanding 
and appreciating the sky. For this reason, we include topics such as CHURCH ORI- 
ENTATIONS and ASTROLOGY, which extend into relatively recent and even modern 
times, together with examples of traditions that live on still among modern in- 
digenous peoples, such as BARASANA “CATERPILLAR JAGUAR” CONSTELLATION, MURSI 
CALENDAR, and PAWNEE COSMOLOGY.

Aboriginal Astronomy 
When Captain James Cook first sailed up the east coast of New Holland 
(what is now Australia) in 1770, he encountered native people who had lit- 
tle interest in their strange visitors and none whatsoever in trading—peo- 
ple who surprised him by being generally unclothed, constructing little in 
the way of shelter around their camp fires, and even sleeping in the open. 
Yet their lifestyle, while short of so many of the conveniences viewed by Eu- 
ropeans as essential, also seemed free from many of the cares that accom- 
panied them. As Cook saw it, the earth and sea satisfied all their needs. 
As we now know, the Aboriginal way of life had gradually developed 
over many thousands, and indeed tens of thousands, of years. Australia’s first 
inhabitants traveled to the continent more than 50,000 years ago from Asia, 
via the islands of what is now Indonesia. Despite lower sea levels at that time, 
the journey still involved crossing straits as wide as eighty kilometers (fifty 
miles) or more. During the long history of the Aboriginal peoples, factors 
such as climate change almost certainly caused significant upheavals, but by 
the time the Europeans arrived, Aboriginal groups were to be found in all 
corners of this vast and largely arid continent. Their lifestyle had become well 
adapted to an environment that, from a European perspective, was im- 
mensely inhospitable. Never settling for long in one place, they lived by gath- 
ering food, hunting, and (for people in the coastal fringes) fishing. This 
hunter-gatherer style of subsistence had never been superseded by agricul- 
ture, let alone affected by technological innovation such as metallurgy. 
Since Aboriginal culture and tradition had developed independently of 
the rest of the world for millennia, it is tragic that much of it was utterly de- 
stroyed in such a short time after the arrival of the Europeans. It is estimated 
that at the time of contact there were more than 750 different Aboriginal 
languages, few of which now survive. Though our knowledge of the ways 
in which different native Australians viewed the world in pre-contact times 
is extremely fragmentary, there was clearly considerable diversity between 
different groups. Yet it is evident that certain fundamental concepts and

principles underlay most Aboriginal systems of thought. The most important 
of these is the Dreamtime or Dreaming. The Dreamtime is sometimes por- 
trayed as a sort of parallel, more fundamental reality in which ancestor spir- 
its created the world and continue to exist within it. Certain places and paths 
through the landscape have deep significance within the Dreamtime. The ac- 
tions of ancestors are re-enacted in many aspects of life, and oftentimes these 
re-enactments involve being at certain places and following certain paths. 

Aboriginal peoples identified strongly with the landscape. Some of the 
places charged with sacred power were natural, such as distinctive rocks, ter- 
mite mounds, or water-holes. Others were created, such as “ringed” euca- 
lyptus trees (branches growing apart were trained together again until they 
rejoined, forming a ring in the trunk). In some locations, “stone configura- 
tions”—constructed arrangements of rocks and boulders—also appear to 
mark sacred places in the landscape, especially in regions devoid of other 
prominent natural landmarks. 

However, to see the Dreaming as something in the Aboriginal mind that 
is superimposed upon the physical world is a quintessentially Western view 
of things. From an Aboriginal perspective, the motions and actions of the an- 
cestors are an integral part of the world and can be perceived in places, in 
the objects that are found there, in the pathways between them, and in 


> 


events that are constantly happening (“signs,” which must be perpetually 


watched for). Living people also leave their mark by their passage and con- 
duct, not necessarily in a way that a Westerner would recognize as “physi- 
cal,” but by ascribing new meanings to places and pathways in the world, 
Naturally that world includes the sky. The actions of the ancestors can also 
be perceived in the appearance and motions of the sun, moon, and stars: sky 
events affect people, and people affect sky events. 

Celestial mythology features extensively in the surviving Aboriginal 
cultural heritage. A wealth of stories relate to sky objects, including Orion, 
the Pleiades, the Southern Cross and Pointers, and the Magellanic Clouds. A 
recent collaboration between ethnographer Hugh Cairns and Yidumduma 
(Bill Harney), a senior elder of the Wardaman community in Northern Ter- 
ritory, has shown how the night sky acts as a repository of ancient traditions 
and learning in this community. This learning was taught using song lines 
that cross through the constellations just as the so-called dreaming paths 
pass through the earthly landscape below. 

Extrapolating back in time is much more difficult. Among the few tan- 
gible remains from earlier epochs, the most ubiquitous are the rock art sites 
found in several parts of Australia: over 100,000 such sites have been 
recorded. Their dates are generally indeterminable within wide bounds, al- 
though some may be several thousand or even tens of thousands of years old. 
Some include what are clearly depictions of ancestor spirits, people, animals, 
and activities such as hunting and dancing, while others are more abstract. 
To what extent modern practices can inform us about the meaning and use 
of art in the past is a contentious issue. Some contemporary bark paintings 
certainly include depictions of the sun, moon, Venus, various constellations, 
the Milky Way, or the Magellanic Clouds, although in many cases it would 
be impossible to recognize them for what they are if we did not have in- 
formants to tell us. In some cases we know something of the stories to which 
they relate and the context in which they were used to tell those stories. Rock 
art, on the other hand, is tied to a particular place. For Yidumduma, rock 
art sites are places (but by no means the only places) where ancestor spirits 
reside, and the significance of each is revealed in the context of the whole 
Wardaman creation story. The sky is an intimate part of this story: 


Dreaming for the cosmos, the land and sky together for peo- 
ple that travel. The Creation routes connected to the people 
on the wall of the rock, and the connection up on the top, 
on the sky, down the bottom, and how everything is chang- 
ing in this country. All the animal[s] and... the ceremony 
of the people in the rock . . . and all these other ones divided 
from the bottom and up to the top in the sky, with all the 
stars all part of human life from the sky. (Cairns and Yidum- 
duma 2003, p. 31) 


Taken out of context, as this example shows, the complexity of the con- 
nections between the content of rock art, its location, and the sky would 
be quite unfathomable to an archaeologist without an informant to inter- 
pret them. 

Can more direct links between rock art and the sky sometimes be evi- 
dent, even where we lack “the big picture”? A number of rock art sites con- 
tain inexplicable groupings of round holes or cup marks, which have not, it 
seems, arisen naturally; and some of these, it has been suggested, could rep- 
resent constellations. However, it is disconcertingly easy to fit random collec- 
tions of cup marks with patterns of stars in the sky if one is prepared to be 
sufficiently flexible in one’s selection criteria, so the case remains unproven. 
There is little other evidence of direct relationships between rock art motifs 
and the appearance of celestial objects, although it has been suggested that the 
stylized forms of emu on some panels reflect the shape of the emu in the sky, 
a conglomeration of dark clouds in the Milky Way recognized as such in a 
number of places across Australia. John Morieson, an Australian archaeoas- 
tronomer, has suggested that a number of stone configurations in northwest- 
ern Victoria related directly to the rising or setting sun and incorporated de- 
liberate alignments toward sunrise or sunset in particular seasons in the year. 

There is certainly evidence that a number of different Aboriginal groups 
took note of the annual changes in the position of certain stars or constella- 
tions as indicators of seasonal events that affected their food supply. Arc- 
turus is the fourth brightest star in the sky. For the Boorong people of north- 
ern Victoria, this star was Marpeankurrk, the ancestor who discovered 
bittur, or termite larvae, a delicious and valuable source of protein available 
at a time of year (August and September) when other food sources were 
scarce. Every year Marpeankurrk taught the living people when to find the 
bittur by appearing in the north during the evening. But night by night she 
appeared for a shorter and shorter time until she disappeared completely— 
and so did the bittur. 

Although this is one of many similar examples, there is no evidence of 
any Aboriginal group having reckoned time using a calendar based, for ex- 
ample, on the phase cycle of the moon. Another curious feature of Aborig- 
inal astronomy—at least, as far as we can tell from the available evidence— 
is that, despite living in wide open landscapes and having an intimate 
knowledge of the skies, Aboriginal peoples do not seem to have used the 
stars to navigate at night. Their astronomical knowledge, and their knowl- 
edge of the world in general, was qualitative rather than quantitative. It 
consisted of a rich network of associations confirmed in myth and tied to 
places and pathways both in the land and in the sky. Their worldview inte- 
grated land, sky, and social structure and kept human action intimately in 


tune with the cosmos. 


Despite our fragmentary knowledge of Aboriginal astronomy, it is of 
great importance in showing how sky knowledge among hunter-gatherers 
can be rich and complex, despite leaving little or no trace in the material 
record. This fact has implications for how we interpret what extremely frag- 
mentary archaeological evidence we have pertaining to astronomical knowl- 
edge in Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic times.

Abri Blanchard Bone 


The earliest indications of the use of a symbolic notation to represent or vi- 
sualize an astronomical cycle come from the Upper Palaeolithic period. At 
this time, in addition to striking cave art, engravings were made on small 
portable objects such as stones and pieces of bone and antler. Thousands of 
examples are known. A number of these are in the form of series of marks, 
and several were subjected to meticulous microscopic analysis by the Amer- 
ican researcher Alexander Marshack. He concluded that the marks were 
not a simple decoration but carefully accumulated, often using different 
tools and techniques, over a period of time. 

One famous example is part of an eagle’s wing discovered in a cave at 
Abri Blanchard in the Dordogne valley, France. Dated to around 30,000 
B.C.E., it contains a series of notched marks in a serpentine pattern. Mar- 
shack proposed that these represent a tally of days. The assumption is that 


the earliest marks are those in the center of the pattern, and that marks were 


accumulated around existing ones. By following the line outwards and back 
and forth, we discover that there are about fifteen marks in each sweep be- 
fore the direction changes. 

The most prominent astronomical cycle is the phase cycle of the moon. 
In addition to being readily observable, it coincides with the female men- 
strual cycle. The moon’s phase cycle is certainly recognized among modern 
hunter-gatherer groups, although not necessarily universally (an apparent 
exception being Australian Aboriginals). The period of the lunar phase cycle 
(synodic month) is between twenty-nine and thirty days, so one interpreta- 
tion of the Abri Blanchard bone is that it represents a tally in which the days 
of the waxing moon are marked off in one direction and those of the wan- 
ing moon in the other; in other words it forms a rudimentary lunar calendar, 
maintained for about two months. Marshack suggested a similar lunar-cal- 
endar interpretation for patterns on a number of other Upper Palaeolithic 
portable artifacts. 

Several criticisms can be made of the interpretation of the Abri Blan- 
chard bone as a lunar calendar. Two assumptions upon which it rests are 
that the number of marks between each “turn” in the line was significant 
and, second, that this represented the period between successive new or 
full moons. How easy might it be to fit other explanations? How can we 
judge a particular interpretation against the alternatives? At least one of 
the turns is not sharp, which gives greater flexibility in interpretation. Two 
of the lines could easily be interpreted as separate straight lines rather than 
part of the serpentine pattern. And there is the question of what exactly we 
mean by “new moon”: there is a one- or two-day period each month when 
the moon is not visible at all (astronomical new moon occurs in the mid- 
dle of this), but it is the first reappearance of the crescent moon in the 
evening sky (the popular concept of “new moon”) that is the most signif- 
icant event in visual terms, widely recognized even in the today’s world, 
from small indigenous groups to major religious calendars. Finally, al- 
though some of the marks appear round and others crescent-shaped, there 
is no apparent correlation between the shape of the marks themselves and 
the lunar phases. 

All of these points introduce doubts in the interpretation of the Abri 
Blanchard bone as a lunar calendar. It is possible to address them by in- 
creasing the complexity of the explanation: for example, the left-to-right se- 
quences contain more marks and can be taken to represent the days from full 
moon to new moon in the popular sense. But the potential for speculative ar- 
gument seems endless. Indeed, the underlying microscopic evidence that the 
engravings represent tally marks or some other form of notation in the first 
place has been vigorously questioned, 


And yet the underlying idea—that certain people in the Upper Palae- 


olithic would have recognized the phase cycle of the moon and may have at- 
tempted to record it—seems plausible enough. One approach would be to 
try to ascertain, hypothetically, how easy we would find it to “recognize” 
patterns in sets of markings that were in fact unintentional (for instance, 
caused by people sharpening tools) or had other meanings entirely. The con- 
clusions could then be used as the basis for a formal statistical test. Yet even 
if lunar tallies or calendars were quite commonplace in the Upper Palae- 
olithic, they may not have been recorded at all consistently, in which case 
any attempt to identify sets of calendrical tallies recorded in a systematic way 
would be doomed to failure. 

Studies of some of the many other Upper Palaeolithic engraved artifacts 
may clarify the issue. One example, another bone fragment known as the Tai 
plaque, has been interpreted by Marshack as a more sophisticated lunar cal- 
endar. And yet more complex designs give us greater flexibility in interpre- 
tation. This is not to say that such explanations are necessarily misguided, 
but rather that assessing them is no trivial matter. Identifying a methodology 
that will satisfy both scientists and social scientists is a challenge that has yet 
to be met by archaeologists.

Alignment Studies 

Archaeoastronomy owes its emergence in the 1970s largely to the furor 
caused by the controversial and often spectacular claims made by Alexan- 
der Thom and others about astronomical alignments at British megalithic 
monuments. Although archaeoastronomy itself soon grew to encompass a 
much wider range of evidence, “alignment studies” remain at the heart of 
a great many archaeoastronomical investigations, particularly those con- 
cerning prehistoric Europe. 

Where we are searching for evidence of astronomical concerns in pre- 
history, alignments of monumental architecture remain at the forefront of 
most investigations. Yet alignments can arise fortuitously, since every ori- 
ented structure must point somewhere. Hence the importance of repeated 
trends, which can be identified and/or verified statistically; good exemplars 
are the short stone rows in western Scotland and the recumbent stone circles 
in eastern Scotland. (The stone circle at Drombeg in Ireland provides a cau- 
tionary case study.) On the other hand, where other types of evidence are 
available to us (such as written documents or ethnohistory), studies of the 
significance of particular alignments may be carried out in a broader context 
with little or no need for statistical verification. A good example of this is the 
alignment of the so-called Governor’s Palace at the Maya site of Uxmal. 

The term alignment studies is not limited to the architecture of large 
monuments and public buildings but also includes studies of the layout of 
cities, as in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica (Teotihuacan, for example) or 
the ancient classical civilizations, and their possible relationships to celes- 
tial objects.

Altitude 


Altitude is the vertical angle between a given direction—such as the direc- 
tion toward a particular point on the horizon from a given place—and the 
horizontal plane through the observer. A positive altitude indicates that the 
point being observed is above the observer; if it is below, then the altitude 
will be negative. Thus the altitude of a horizon point level with the ob- 
server is 0°. That of the summit of a high or nearby hill might be as much 


as 5° or 10°, but that of a sea horizon viewed from a high place might be 
—0.5° or -1°. 

One can also speak of the altitude of a star in the sky, but this will not 
generally be the same as the angle of the star above the horizon, since the 
horizon altitude will not normally be 0°. 

There is considerable confusion between the terms altitude and eleva- 
tion. Elevation is normally taken to mean the height of a given place above 
sea level, but the two terms are quite often transposed, for example when pi- 
lots speak of the altitude of an airplane to mean its height above sea level 
and use an altimeter to measure it, while some engineers and astronomers 
use “elevation” to mean “altitude” as we have defined it here.

Ancient Egyptian Calendars 

The kingdom of Ancient Egypt existed for over three millennia and for 
much of this time was remarkable in having two different calendars in si- 
multaneous operation. Each arose in response to different social needs and 
developed a distinct function. At least, this is the standard interpretation of 
the evidence. 

The oldest Egyptian calendar was lunar. It arose in Predynastic times 
(prior to c. 3000 B.c.£.) from the simple need to keep agriculture in track 
with the seasons. Twelve lunar phase-cycle (synodic) months only amount 
to 354 days, so a mechanism is needed for adding an additional (inter- 
calary) month every two to three years in order to keep the calendar in 
track with the seasons. It is generally supposed that in Upper Egypt (the 
Nile valley) the calendar was regulated by Sothis, or Sirius, whose first ap- 
pearance before dawn each year (heliacal rise) coincided with the regular 
annual flood of the Nile, the most critical event in the agricultural year. 
Whenever Sothis was not seen until late in the twelfth month, an additional 
(intercalary) month was added. 

Some scholars have argued that a lunar calendar had also developed in- 
dependently in Lower Egypt (the Nile Delta), but that there it was regulated 
by observations of the sun. A myth of central importance for the Egyptians 
was the daily rebirth of the sun god Ra by the sky goddess Nut, who 
stretched from one side of the sky to the other. This legend was played out

in the sky. If the Milky Way was seen as Nut herself, as has been suggested, 
the legend would doubtless have accounted for its shifting position with re- 
spect to the rising and setting positions of the sun, according to the time of 
year. This would have provided the conceptual basis for what we might too 
easily see as the purely pragmatic process of keeping track of the seasons 
by tracking the movement of the sunrise and sunset along the horizon. When 
the two parts of Egypt became unified into a single kingdom, these luni- 
stellar and luni-solar calendars would have merged. 

The Early Dynastic period (c. 3000-2600 B.c.E.) was the time of the 
first pharaohs and the development of written records. The lunar calendar 
was fine for regulating agricultural activity on a local scale but became un- 
workable for satisfying the needs of a complex economy and state bureau- 
cracy. Recording and regulating the movement of perishable commodities, 
for example, demanded absolute agreement about the date. Yet the begin- 


ning of each month, and the insertion of intercalary months, was determined 


by observation, and observations could differ; as a result, it was often diffi- 
cult to be certain either about the month or the day in the month. The result 
was the development of a quite independent civil calendar used for adminis- 
tration purposes. This comprised twelve “months” of exactly thirty days 
each, divided into ten-day periods known (rather confusingly, given that the 
word is commonly taken to mean “ten years”) as decades, followed by a 
five-day period known as the additional or epagomenal days, making a to- 
tal of 365. Once the calendar was set up, it was defined indefinitely; there 
was no need to regulate it by observations of nature. It was so fit for its pur- 
pose that it survived well beyond the end of ancient Egypt itself and was still 
being used by astronomers in medieval times. 

It may seem surprising to suggest that the lunar calendar did not die out 
when the civil calendar was introduced. Yet this is precisely what has gener- 
ally been believed for many years, following the work of the great Egyptian 
scholar R. A. Parker in the 1940s. According to this view, the purpose of the 
lunar calendar became the regulation of religious observances. Responsibil- 
ity for determining the correct month and day within this calendar, and with 
it the timing of religious festivals, became the responsibility of certain priests. 
At some stage, and possibly as early as Old Kingdom times (c. 2600-2100 
B.C.E.), Egyptians started to use the heliacal rise of other stars to help regu- 
late the calendar and to develop the system of decans. These were thirty-six 
stars or star groups whose heliacal risings occurred in succession, roughly 
ten days apart—in other words, marking successive decades (ten-day peri- 
ods) in the civil calendar. This meant that the two calendars could easily be 
synchronized. 

Only recently has a different view emerged, proposed by the Spanish 
archaeoastronomer Juan Antonio Belmonte. This is that different Egyptian 
calendars did not in fact coexist. In Belmonte’s view, sun observations were 
used initially to establish the 365-day calendar, but thereafter the dates of lu- 
nar-related religious festivals were simply established within this calendar, 
rather as Christians determine the annual date of Easter to this day. 

Whatever the outcome of this debate, it is clear that the decans also her- 
alded a hugely important innovation: they could be used as “clocks” to mark 
the passing of time during the night. Instead of focusing just on the heliacal 
rise, that is, on the decan rising immediately before dawn, one simply had to 
view the risings of successive decans through the night. On this basis, the 
Egyptians were the first to divide the night into approximately equal time in- 
tervals. Theoretically, at the equinoxes, when sunrise and sunset are exactly 
twelve hours apart, eighteen ideally placed decans should rise between sun- 
set and sunrise at intervals of 40 minutes. In practice, however, the length of 
the night varies through the year, and twilight renders the first and last ris- 


ings invisible. Furthermore, it could not have been possible to find stars to 


use as decans that were precisely evenly spaced across the sky. Finally, the 
Egyptian kingdom stretched sufficiently far from north to south for latitude 
to make a difference. The most decans that could actually be seen in one 
night, during the longest nights of the year around the winter solstice, was 
twelve. This fact, it is widely believed, led to the concept of the night being 
divided into twelve “hours,” whose length varied through the year, but 
which were nonetheless a precursor to the modern concept of dividing the 
day-night cycle into twenty-four equal hours. There is a scholarly consensus 
on the identification of several of the decans, but the identification of others 
remains extremely speculative. 

The Egyptian civil calendar was simple, useful, and all-pervasive. It 
worked unfailingly for almost three millennia, and although it gradually 
slipped with respect to the seasons (historical sources confirm that the civil 
new year once more coincided with the heliacal rising of Sirius in C.E. 139), 
this never seems to have created a problem during any particular epoch. Not 
until the third century B.C.E. was any attempt made to add leap years.

Andean Mountain Shrines 

Traditional belief systems that still persist in a number of remote Andean 
villages link mountains, ancestor worship, ritual pilgrimage, and the sea as 
the ultimate source of water and fertility. The landscape is “animated” in 
the sense that unusual or prominent features are perceived to have a super- 
natural aspect. Local communities often regard themselves as the descen- 
dents of mountain deities; consequently mountain peaks—and especially 
volcanoes—occupy a prominent place in their cosmic beliefs and commu- 
nal rituals. Mountains and mountain gods are seen as the controllers of 
rain, and their summits sometimes remain an important focus of ceremo- 
nial activity today. These metaphysical convictions do have a foundation in 
the physical world, in that prominent mountains have a strong effect on lo- 
cal meteorological phenomena. 

These modern mythologies represent the remnants of belief systems 
stretching back at least as far as Inca times. Numerous shrines, both Incaic 
and more modern, have been discovered on hills and mountain peaks in 
Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. Sea shells and river stones were com- 
monly offered to deities for water, but more macabre offerings have also 
been uncovered: human (including child) sacrifices. We know from the ac- 
counts of Spanish chroniclers that elaborate pilgrimages were involved in 
reaching these sacred places. But the intensity of conviction that motivated 
the expeditions still defies the imagination. Offerings have been found on 
mountain peaks as high as 6,000 meters (20,000 feet). 

There is every reason to believe that some of the mountain pilgrimages 
were tied to specific calendrical rituals and that they were astronomically 
timed. Broadly similar sets of beliefs and practices in central Mexico provide 
more concrete evidence of calendrical and astronomical associations. How- 
ever, the specific associations that regulated the Andean rituals remain 
largely unknown.

Angkor 

The ancient Khmer civilization flowered in southeastern Asia for over five 
centuries. A number of interacting and competing kingdoms had existed in 
the area since the early centuries C.E., and both the Buddhist and Hindu re- 
ligions had been widely adopted. But in C.E. 802, several of these kingdoms 
joined together to form a powerful state. The capital, Angkor, situated in 
modern Cambodia, became the center of an empire that, at its height, 
stretched over 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from what is now Burma in the 
west across Thailand and Laos to central Vietnam in the east, and a similar 
distance north to south, from the Khorat plateau in northern Thailand both 
to the tip of southern Vietnam and down the long isthmus toward the 
Malay peninsula. After the early fourteenth century, the Khmer empire 
went into decline and Angkor collapsed. However, a new capital emerged 
downstream. Khmer culture endured and in many respects thrived until the 
arrival of the Europeans and the establishment of the French Protectorate 
in the mid-nineteenth century. 

The word Angkor means “Holy City” in Sanskrit. The arrangement of 
magnificent buildings and reservoirs (barays) that survives to this day re- 
sulted from construction projects initiated by a succession of rulers, and in- 
cludes both Buddhist and Hindu temples, according to the religious persua- 
sion of the king in question. At its heart is Angkor Thom, a huge square 
compound—some 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) on a side—containing a royal 
palace surrounded by numerous public buildings, platforms, and courts, and 
including two temple-pyramids, the Baphuon and the Bayon. Angkor Thom 
is flanked both to the east and west by enormous rectangular reservoirs, each 
over 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) long and 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) wide. To the 
south is a small hill, Phnom Bakheng (Mighty Mount Ancestor), with a tem- 
ple on its summit. Beyond that to the south is the most magnificent temple 
complex of all: Angkor Wat, arguably the largest and most impressive reli- 
gious structure ever built. Although it has been a Buddhist temple (wat) for 
many centuries, it was originally dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. Scat- 
tered in its vicinity, but mostly found close to the western and southern sides 
of the East Baray, are a number of additional temple enclosures, including 
three that functioned as Buddhist monasteries. 

Although it is Angkor Wat’s artistic and architectural splendor that so 
impresses the modern visitor, many of the temples built there also expressed 
vital principles of cosmic harmony. Some of these expressions are obvious: 


the large numbers of towers pointing at heaven; the cardinal orientation of 


Angkor Wat, Cambodia. (PhotoDisc, Inc.) 


the temple precincts and barays; and the westward orientation of Angkor 
Wat, generally supposed to express a link between death and the setting 
sun, but possibly symbolizing the direction associated with Vishnu. The 
central tower of the Bayon—at the center of Angkor Thom, which is itself 
at the center of Angkor—represented Mount Meru, the dwelling place of 
the gods, placed at the center of a symbolic model of the cosmos. Other 
principles and relationships may have been expressed more subtly, encoded 
numerically and geometrically in a variety of ways. Thus the Bakheng tem- 
ple, with seven levels to represent the layers of heaven, takes the form of a 
stepped pyramid supporting 108 towers, symmetrically arranged. The visi- 
tor mounting the central staircase on any side, however, can only see thirty- 
three of the towers—the number of principal gods in the Hindu pantheon. 
The design of Angkor Wat incorporated alignments upon solstitial and 
equinoctial sunrise, and it has even been suggested that the dimensions of 
the central structure encoded, in Khmer units of measurement, the number 
of days in the year. Although many of the specific suggestions are unproven 
and controversial, they remain plausible, given the ways in which cosmo- 
logical principles are known to have been encapsulated in Hindu temples 
throughout history and still are today. 


The author Graham Hancock has gone further, arguing that the entire 


layout of temples at Angkor had another purpose. It formed a gigantic 
model on the ground of the constellation Draco, just as (he and others have 
supposed) the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt modeled Orion’s Belt. Although 
this may sound like a simple extension of the idea of human constructions 
modeling the cosmos, it is ill conceived at a number of levels. For one thing, 
the idea of producing literal “maps” of the stars in the sky, as opposed to 
symbolic models of the gods in heaven, has no known place in Hindu beliefs 
and practice. In other words, this is an idea totally divorced from the social 
context in which it is supposed to have operated. Second, the construction 
of successive temples would have needed to have conformed to a very spe- 
cific grand plan conceived before any of the building started and strictly ad- 
hered to by one ruler after another. Third, in order to make the orientation 
fit the appearance of the constellation in the sky, one has to assume that the 
plan was conceived around the year 10,500 B.c.E. Though it is not beyond 
the bounds of possibility that sacred sites might have been recognized for 
one reason and then retained their sacredness, it is sheer fantasy to suggest 
that a fixed plan could have been perpetuated for more than 11,000 years. 
Likewise, the idea of a “lost golden age” at such an early date flies in the face 
of well-established archaeological evidence from all over the world. 

But how, then, does one explain the apparent fit of the temple posi- 
tions with the pattern of stars in Draco? The answer is that apparently im- 
pressive matches like this can easily arise fortuitously, especially if one is 
prepared to be selective with the data. There are many temples at Angkor, 
many bright stars in the sky to choose from, and one can project the curved 
surface of the sky onto the flat surface of the ground in various ways. Cer- 
tain temples, such as the Baphuon and Bayon, do not fit stars, and certain 
bright stars in the relevant part of Draco, such as Eltanin (y Dra) and Altais 
(8 Dra), do not fit temples. Furthermore, the fit in the remainder of cases is 
not always impressive. It is possible to argue that there were inevitable er- 
rors in the process of identifying the correct location, multiplicities of pur- 
pose, and other difficulties in practice. But these possibilities (for which 
there is no direct evidence) provide no justification for selecting data arbi- 
trarily in order to obtain more impressive fits. This is a flawed game that 
one plays at one’s peril. 

The example of Angkor serves to show the severe dangers of seeking 
astronomical correlates of spatial patterns in archaeological data too keenly 
and taking interpretations far too far without heeding the constraint of cul- 
tural evidence. We do not need to go to such lengths to acknowledge that as- 
tronomical and cosmological symbolism was deeply engrained in this ex- 
traordinary group of monuments.

Antas 


Antas are a distinctive type of dolmen concentrated in the Alentejo region 
of central Portugal and the bordering provinces of western Spain. Anta in 
Portuguese simply means “dolmen,” but the word has been appropriated to 
signify a particular method of construction. A large, flattish stone was set 
in the ground on its side to act as the backstone. Two further slabs were 
then placed upright leaning against it, one on each side, then a further pair 
was added with each one leaning against one of the earlier pair, and so on, 
to form a chamber with a single entrance. Most commonly, seven stones 
were used in total. A flat capstone was finally placed horizontally on top. 
Antas vary considerably in size, the smallest chambers being under 2 meters 
(6 feet) wide and no more than 1.5 meters (5 feet) high, while the largest 
measure over 5 meters (16 feet) wide and 4 meters (13 feet) high. A magnif- 
icent example of the latter is the Anta Grande do Zambujeiro near Evora. 
A remarkable feature of the antas is their pattern of orientation. 
Michael Hoskin, a British historian of astronomy, surveyed 177 of them in 
the 1990s, using a compass and clinometer to determine their axial orienta- 
tion (the direction along the axis of symmetry toward the entrance) and their 
astronomical potential in terms of the declination of the indicated horizon 
point. According to Hoskin, not a single orientation falls outside that part of 
the horizon on which the sun rises at some date in the year. Many different 
groups of later prehistoric monuments within western Europe show distinc- 
tive orientation signatures, but the implications of this group’s signature 


seem particularly clear: the antas faced sunrise on some day in the year, per- 


The seven-stone anta at Mellizo, one of a number found near Valencia de Alcantara in Extremadura, western Spain, 
close to the border with Portugal. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


haps the day on which construction commenced. 

If so, then we must add a qualification. The spread of orientations does 
not correspond to what one would expect if these dolmens were constructed 
at random times in the year. If that were the case, we would expect more ori- 
entations to fall toward the two ends of the solar range (where its rising po- 
sition changes less from day to day, and so it spends more days) than in the 
middle. The actual anta orientations, on the other hand, fall mainly toward the 
middle of the range. This could be explained in one of two ways. The first pos- 
sibility is that they were merely oriented roughly eastwards. In this case, the 
fact that the most extreme orientations happen to fall close to the edges of the 
solar range, that is, in the solstitial directions, would be seen as purely fortu- 
itous. The other possibility is that tombs were constructed preferentially at cer- 
tain times of the year, namely spring and/or autumn. Hoskin suggests the lat- 
ter, arguing that in the spring and summer the needs of agriculture or animal 
herding would take precedence, but if work on dolmen construction com- 
menced in the fall, it could reliably be completed during the ensuing winter.

Antizenith Passage of the Sun 

Just as the sun passes through the zenith, that is, directly overhead, twice a 
year as viewed from any location within the tropics, so it also passes twice 
a year through the point directly beneath the observer. This point is known 
as the antizenith or nadir. The dates of solar antizenith passage occur six 
months away from those of zenith passage so that, for example, the anti- 
zenith passage dates at a location a little way south of the Tropic of Cancer 
will be shortly before and after the December solstice. 

The antizenith passage of the sun may seem a totally esoteric event 
since, unlike zenith passage, it is not directly observable. Yet some human 
cultures do seem to have had an interest in identifying the dates of solar an- 
tizenith passages and marking them with appropriate observances. It has 
been suggested, for example, that some of the pillars erected on the western 
horizon at the Inca capital city of Cusco were aligned upon sunset on the 
day of antizenith passage.

Archaeoastronomy 

Archaeoastronomy is best defined as the study of beliefs and practices con- 
cerning the sky in the past, and especially in prehistory, and the uses to 
which people’s knowledge of the skies were put. It can be misleading to 
think of archaeoastronomy as the study of ancient astronomy, since people 
in the past might have related to the sky in very different ways from people 
in the modern Western world. For this reason many people prefer to avoid 


the word astronomy altogether. Some speak of astronomies to emphasize 


this point, as is evident in the title of books such as Astronomies and Cul- 
tures (Ruggles and Saunders 1993). 

There have been scientific investigations of the possible astronomical 
significance of spectacular ancient monuments ever since the later nineteenth 
century—in the work of Sir Norman Lockyer and Alexander Thom, for ex- 
ample. However, the term archaeoastronomy has only been in existence 
since 1969 and soon thereafter came to take on a much broader meaning. 
Some popular authors such as Gerald Hawkins, whose book Stonehenge De- 
coded brought Stonehenge into the limelight in the mid-1960s, preferred the 
term astro-archaeology, and this for some became synonymous with align- 
ment studies, causing a good deal of confusion that has still not entirely 
abated. Nonetheless, it was archaeoastronomy that emerged as a recognized 
academic “interdiscipline” a decade later, marked most significantly by the 
appearance of two academic journals: Archaeoastronomy: The Journal of 
the Center for Archaeoastronomy in the US and, in the UK, the Archaeoas- 
tronomy supplement to the Journal for the History of Astronomy. It was also 
signaled by a landmark international conference in archaeoastronomy at 
Oxford in 1981, the first of a series that has continued ever since. 

By that time, archaeoastronomy had already expanded beyond the 
mere study of monumental alignments. This development was led from the 
Americas in the 1970s, particularly by studies of astronomy in pre- 
Columbian Mesoamerica. These studies leaned heavily upon ethnohistorical 
evidence—the writings of chroniclers in the early years after European con- 
tact and conquest—and also, at least in the case of the Maya, upon written 
evidence in the form of native “books,” most notably the Dresden Codex. 
Alignment studies formed an important part of the new integrated approach 
to studying Mesoamerican archaeoastronomy but did not drive it. On the 
other hand, European and especially British archaeoastronomers in the 
1970s were largely obsessed with archaeological and statistical reappraisals 
of Alexander Thom’s work and were busy developing formal fieldwork pro- 
cedures and quantitative techniques for resolving the huge controversy sur- 
rounding Thom’s conclusions. The American archaeoastronomer Anthony 
Aveni would later come to characterize these two contrasting approaches 
within archaeoastronomy as “brown” and “green,” after the colors of the 
covers of the two volumes (Archaeoastronomy in the New World and Ar- 
chaeoastronomy in the Old World, respectively) that emerged from the 1981 
Oxford conference. Finding the right balance between these two method- 
ological approaches remains one of the major challenges for archaeoastron- 
omy to this day. 

Archaeoastronomers, then, are prepared to consider a range of types of 
evidence—not simply archaeological—and they certainly do not restrict 


themselves to alignments of monuments. In this sense the word archaeoas- 


tronomy is misleading, even though it is the term that has stuck. Further- 
more, there is no clear boundary between the past and present. Almost from 
the outset, “brown” archaeoastronomers who studied astronomical tradi- 
tions within North America realized that myths and traditions surviving in 
modern indigenous Native American groups could be highly relevant to our 
understanding of astronomical traditions of the past. When we study reports 
of ethnographers who worked, say, fifty years ago on a tradition that has 
since died out, it is clearly pointless to worry about whether to classify this 
as ethnohistory or ethnography. We may even be able to identify longer 
threads of continuity stretching from the past into the present, so that, for 
example, the study of a modern Andean village such as Misminay in Peru 
may give us some insights into worldviews prevailing in Incaic or even pre- 
Incaic times. In short, what was once (and sometimes still is) identified as 
ethnoastronomy blends seamlessly into archaeoastronomy. Many would 
prefer simply to combine the two fields of study, referring to them together 
by a term such as cultural astronomy. 

Why was archaeoastronomy so controversial in its formative days in 
the 1960s and 1970s? Partly because Thom’s own interpretations, though 
based upon high-quality surveys of many hundreds of British megalithic 
sites and supported by rigorous statistical analysis, struck most archaeolo- 
gists as clear examples of ethnocentrism. In seeing prehistoric Britain as 
populated by “megalithic man” whom he described as “a competent engi- 
neer with an extensive knowledge of practical geometry,” Thom was merely 
seeing his own reflection in the past, the skeptics claimed. In like manner, 
they pointed out, several prominent astronomers were seeing their own re- 
flections when they described Stonehenge as a sophisticated observatory 
and eclipse predictor. But there was also a deeper reason. In the 1970s, most 
archaeologists in the forefront of theoretical developments were trying to 
describe the actions of human communities in prehistory and the processes 
of social change in terms of human responses to ecological or environmen- 
tal constraints. These “processual archaeologists” saw no reason why pre- 
historic people would have bothered incorporating astronomical align- 
ments into communal monuments. 

In the decades that followed, both archaeoastronomy and theoretical 
archaeology moved forward. Archaeoastronomy ceased to be dominated by 
astronomers and began to incorporate more archaeologists and anthropol- 
ogists. This would, at the very least, help to avoid naive pitfalls such as eth- 
nocentrism. As a result, archaeoastronomy began to lose its cavalier atti- 
tude toward the body of theory that had been developed (and was 
continuing to develop) within archaeology and anthropology for interpret- 
ing the actions of any past community from what we can find in their ma- 


terial remains. At the same time, the so-called “post-processual” revolution 


was taking place in theoretical archaeology. A new generation of archaeol- 
ogists was beginning to confront issues such as cognition. What was going 
on in people’s minds, claimed these interpretative archaeologists, was just 
as vital in determining people’s actions in the past as any environmental 
constraints. Put another way, how a group of people viewed the world— 
their cosmology—was just as important in determining their actions as 
what a modern archaeologist might consider “rational” considerations. 
This conclusion was supported by numerous case studies from modern in- 
digenous communities such as the Hopi and Pawnee in North America. To 
speak of “rational” behavior is itself ethnocentric, since what we consider 
rational is a product of our own worldview. 

Why are archaeoastronomy (and ethnoastronomy) worth doing? If we 
want to understand more about why certain human communities did what 
they did in the past, then we need to try to understand aspects of their cos- 
mologies—the ways in which they perceived the world. Astronomy is an es- 
sential part of nearly every cosmology, because all human communities have 
a sky, and the sky and the objects in it form an integral part of the perceived 
world. The objects in the night sky are immutable, regular, reliable, pre- 
dictable; for communities who did not live inside brightly lit buildings and 
whose skies were not polluted by modern city lights, they were there for peo- 
ple to watch and contemplate night after night, season after season. They be- 
come imbued with meaning. 

But what different groups of people perceive as important in the sky, 
and what significance they ascribe to it, is highly culture-dependent. Two 
good examples that illustrate this in different ways are the calendar of the 
Borana of Ethiopia, and the emu “dark cloud constellation” recognized 
by certain Aboriginal groups in Australia. Nevertheless, people generally 
try to keep their actions in harmony with the cosmos as they perceive it, 
which may be the reason many prehistoric monuments were deliberately 
aligned with objects in the wider landscape, including objects in the sky. 
Recognizing associations that certain homan communities considered im- 
portant can help us understand something of the worldviews that gave rise 
to them. 

The advantage that the sky holds for us in trying to spot such associ- 
ations is that it forms a part of the ancient environment that is directly ac- 
cessible to us, unlike the terrestrial landscape, which is often transitory. We 
can use modern astronomy to reconstruct, with considerable accuracy, the 
appearance of the night sky at any place and time, including the motions 
of the sun, moon, stars, and planets. And this capability offers a consider- 
able advantage, whether we are concerned with myths and beliefs relating 
to the sky, monumental alignments upon celestial objects, or other kinds 


of evidence.

Archaeotopography 

One of the criticisms of archaeoastronomy is that archaeoastronomers who 
investigate the reasons why ancient buildings and monuments were situated 
and oriented as they are often seem concerned only with the possibility that 
the main influencing factors were astronomical. But many different consid- 
erations, some quite unrelated to astronomy, can determine the orientation 
of a monument. One possibility is alignment based on prominent topo- 
graphic features in the surrounding landscape. Accordingly, the term ar- 
chaeotopography was coined by Michael Hoskin in 1997 to describe the 
collection of orientation data, as opposed to its (exclusively astronomical) 
interpretation. However, since the term would seem, similarly, to imply a 
necessarily topographical interpretation, and since topographical and as- 
tronomical motivations are only two among numerous possible reasons for 
orienting a structure in a particular direction, the term is rather misleading 


and has not been adopted widely.

Astro-Archaeology 

This confusing term has sometimes been used as an alternative to ar- 
chaeoastronomy and sometimes to mean the study of astronomical align- 
ments at ancient monuments—in other words, to represent only a segment 
of the wider endeavor of archaeoastronomy. It has now largely fallen into 
disuse, at least among academics working in this area.

Astrology 

To a modern astronomer, astrology is anathema. The idea that there can be 
any direct connection between the configuration or appearance of distant 
heavenly bodies in the sky and current or future events in the terrestrial 
world flies in the face of laws of physics that have been established beyond 
question over many centuries. This is not to deny that in a few cases an as- 
trological relationship might actually have a physical basis: some claim, for 
example, that a correlation can exist between the growth of plants and the 
phase of the moon, because the level of moisture in the soil is related to the 
lunar phase through a tidal effect. 

From the perspective of the archaeologist or anthropologist, whose ul- 
timate interest is in human behavior rather than the laws of the universe, 
whether such an argument is scientifically verifiable or not is not the point. 
What interests these scientists is the fact that people throughout the ages 
have drawn direct connections between the appearance of the sky and events 
on earth, and that this forms an integral part of their understanding of how 
the world works. Even in the modern Western world, popular astrology rep- 
resents a widespread perception of how celestial events influence terrestrial 
ones and challenges the “institutional” view represented by scientific as- 
tronomy. Modern astronomers may dismiss astrology as nonsense, but the 


direct associations it presupposes between celestial and terrestrial events may 


well be far closer to the ways people throughout history have managed to 
make sense of the world than the explanations provided by modern science. 

Outside the Western scientific tradition there is no meaningful distinc- 
tion between astronomy and astrology; indeed, archaeoastronomy might 
equally well be named archaeoastrology. Modern indigenous worldviews 
(cosmologies) commonly feature the idea that good fortune on earth de- 
pends upon keeping human action in harmony with what is happening in 
the skies, and there is every reason to assume that this has been true since 
early prehistory. 

The term astrology can be applied to three rather different but not en- 
tirely separable ways in which people have perceived connections between 
the configuration of the heavens and events on earth: the belief that partic- 
ular celestial configurations can portend future events; the belief that they 
can determine or influence the characteristics and lives of people, most com- 
monly at their moment of birth; and the belief that they are directly con- 
nected to (that is, influence and/or reflect) current terrestrial events. Each 
type of perceived connection could provoke a variety of actions in response 
to certain observed celestial events. 

The belief that what is seen in the sky may foreshadow the future—typ- 
ically stemming, as for the ancient Greeks, from a belief that it can indicate 
the intentions of the gods—underlies celestial divination: the use of observa- 
tions of sky phenomena to predict future earthly events. Such a belief is very 
widespread in human history. Unique, unexpected, and imposing events such 
as solar and lunar eclipses were widely seen as portents of disaster. But more 
regular celestial events also indicated auspicious or inauspicious times for 
planting crops, having children, going to war, and so on. In city-state or em- 
pire, astronomers and astrologers were employed to identify good and bad 
omens for the benefit of their nations and their rulers. This happened in an- 
cient Babylonia, China, Greece, and Rome, as well as in pre-Columbian 
Mesoamerica. Observation was followed by prognosis (interpretation) and 
then by action (prescription). A good example of celestial divination is found 
in the early Chinese artifacts known as oracle bones. Oracle bone inscrip- 
tions (a subset of which relate to astronomical observations) followed a pre- 
scribed format: a preface describing the action taken by the diviner was fol- 
lowed by the resulting prognostication and then by a verification describing 
what actually came to pass. 

Predictability did not necessarily detract from the divinatory power of 
a celestial event. The motions of the five visible planets are regular and pre- 
dictable, though quite complex. Planetary astrology, which can assign div- 
inatory significance to the cycles of appearance of particular planets as well 
as to their positions with respect to the background stars and constellations 


and even to one another, extends back to Babylonian times. The Maya went 


to extraordinary lengths to reduce the workings of the cosmos to a series of 
interacting regular cycles. The Dresden Codex—a surviving almanac con- 
taining tabulations of the cycles of appearance of the moon, Venus and pos- 
sibly Mars, and even of lunar eclipses—seems to have been an attempt to 
make the various motions of the heavenly bodies predictable. In doing so, 
the Maya reached a remarkable level of mathematical sophistication, yet 
their ultimate motive seems to have remained divinatory. For the ancient 
Chinese, on the other hand, predicting celestial events through systematic 
observations and recording fell within the domain of calendrics. This disci- 
pline acted almost independently of, and in some senses in competition with, 
astrology. Here, once lunar eclipses began to become predictable around the 
year 0, they lost their divinatory significance. 

The idea that people’s lives can be permanently influenced by the ce- 
lestial—and particularly the planetary—configurations at the moment of 
their birth is one of the defining characteristics of modern astrology, and 
also one that modern scientists find particularly indigestible. (It should be 
said that planetary birth charts go far beyond, and are considerably more 
complex than, the popular perception of horoscopes based solely upon the 
sun’s position within the zodiac at birth [“birth sign”].) Planetary birth 
charts have their origins in ancient Babylonia and reached an apex in 
Greece and Rome. When astrologers began to generate horoscopes, this 
fundamentally altered their role. Instead of observing the skies and waiting 
for calamitous astronomical events, they were now required to work out 
planetary configurations at specified moments in the past, something that 
demanded considerable technical skill. Given the particularity of the idea of 
the planetary birth chart as against the myriad ways one might envision the 
influence of the celestial bodies on human lives, it is surprising that the 
practice has proved so persistent. 

Insofar as it maintains that a person’s destiny is determined or influenced 
by the configuration of the heavens at the time of their birth, horoscopic as- 
trology is actually a form of divination. It also introduces awkward issues 
about free will: if one’s fate is already sealed, there seems little point in trying 
to alter it. However, variants are evident in modern folklore that largely over- 
come this problem. Thus in the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia, well into 
the twentieth century, it was commonly believed among rural communities 
that the phase of the moon at birth influenced various aspects of a person’s 
character—their propensity to strength or timidity, cleverness, long life, a joy- 
ful or gloomy disposition, and so on. But such characteristics could be mod- 
ified throughout life by choosing, for example, the correct phase of the moon 
for weaning, baptism, marriage, or building a house. 

The most fundamental connection between objects and events in the 


sky and those on earth that we might term astrological relates to the here 


and now. Belief in the direct interconnectedness of things is evident among 
modern indigenous communities and surely extended far back into prehis- 
tory. Modern examples include the Barasana of the Colombian Amazon, 
who understand that the celestial caterpillar causes the proliferation of 
earthly caterpillars; the Mursi of Ethiopia, for whom the flooding of the river 
they call waar can be determined, without going down to the banks, by the 
behavior of the star of the same name; and those native Hawaiians who still 
carry on the ancient practice of planting taro and other crops according to 
the day of the month in the traditional calendar (i.e., the phase of the moon). 
The extent to which such mental connections might be considered astrolog- 
ical is arguable, but if our interest is in the practices themselves, and what 
was going on in the minds of the people who practiced them, then the ques- 
tion is largely irrelevant—as irrelevant as the question of which practices 
might have a rational basis in modern scientific terms. What one might 
choose to term science and what one might choose to term astrology are 
both rather subjective in the context of an alternative rationality, and the dis- 
tinction between them is certainly meaningless.

Astronomical Dating 
Is it possible to date an archaeological site by astronomical means? In the- 


ory, the answer is yes, for if we can identify an alignment and the intended 


astronomical target, measure where the alignment points, and then use 
modern astronomy to calculate where that event occurred at different times 
in the past, then we can fit the best date to the alignment. Stellar alignments 
would seem to be most promising, because the rising and setting positions 
of most stars change significantly over the centuries owing to precession. 
The rising and setting position of the sun at the solstices and the moon at 
the standstill limits also alter with time, although by much less, owing to 
the slow change in the obliquity of the ecliptic. 

In practice, however, astronomical dating is rife with pitfalls. The main 
one is that we rarely have reliable (e.g., historical) evidence to tell us either 
that a particular alignment was actually deliberate, or what is was aligned 
upon in the first place. Where we do have historical evidence, we are likely 
to know the date fairly accurately already. (A case where we do have some 
historical evidence, but not as much as we might like, and the alignment does 
tell us something, is the Venus alignment of the Governor’s Palace at the 
Maya city of Uxmal.) 

More often, we are dealing with prehistoric structures where we have 
no evidence other than the alignments themselves. If we find an alignment 
that we suspect to be stellar, we can try different stars and different dates to 
see if any combination fits particularly well. The problem here is that if, say, 
we are willing to consider the fifteen brightest stars and a five-hundred-year 
date range, then there is approximately a one-in-three chance that we will be 
able to find a star and a date to fit any alignment. It is frighteningly easy, 
then, to fit a star and a date fortuitously and made all the easier when we 
consider that only rarely does one single alignment at a particular monument 
stand out as the obvious astronomical candidate. In order to be fair with the 
data—one of the most fundamental methodological principles—we should 
consider all possible alignments. Added to this is the problem of extinction 
(the dimming of a star at low altitude due to the earth’s atmosphere), which 
may mean that most if not all of our fifteen stars wouldn’t have been visible 
all the way down to the horizon in the first place. If we are willing to pos- 
tulate (as some people have done) that structures were aligned upon the 
point of appearance or disappearance of a star rather than its actual rising 
and setting point, it increases the chances of our being able to fit a date and 
star fortuitously to any given alignment (especially at high latitudes, where 
the astronomical bodies rise and set at a fairly shallow angle). Overall, the 
potential for circular argument is obvious. 

Yet despite these problems, there have been cases where postulated stel- 
lar alignments can help in the process of dating a site. One relates to the 
Pyramids of Giza in Egypt and another to a perplexing later prehistoric sanc- 
tuary in Mallorca, Son Mas. 


Solar and lunar alignments don’t suffer from these problems but have 


others of their own, mainly that the change over time is very small. The 
change in the declination of the solstitial sun, for example, amounts to 
only about one arc minute per century. This means that only if we have 
good reason to suspect that a solstitial alignment had very high precision, 
such as that envisaged by Alexander Thom at British megalithic sites, can 
such an alignment be used to indicate a date accurate to within a few cen- 
turies. Even then, variations in refraction may provide an insurmountable 
obstacle.

Avebury 
Situated in Wiltshire, England, a few kilometers south of the modern town 
of Swindon, Avebury is one of the largest and most impressive Later Ne- 
olithic henge monuments in Britain. Built around the middle of the third mil- 
lennium B.C.E., it measures some 350 meters (1,150 feet) across and sur- 
rounds an entire modern village. The outer ditch and bank, when first 
constructed, were some 9 meters (30 feet) deep and 8 meters (25 feet) high, 
respectively, and it is estimated that almost a hundred stones encircled the in- 
terior. There were also two inner circles, each around 100 meters (300 feet) 
in diameter. At the center of the northernmost of these was a configuration 
of three massive stones arranged like three of the four sides of a huge rec- 
tangular box, known as the Cove. Running away from two of the four en- 
trances of the henge, to the west and south, were two long stone avenues. 
Much of the first 800 meters (half mile) of the latter (the Kennet Avenue) sur- 
vives, but it originally ran for over 2.3 kilometers (1.5 miles), connecting 
Avebury to a site whose construction had commenced many centuries ear- 
lier: a set of concentric timber circles (possibly a roofed building) later re- 
placed by two circles of small stones, known as the Sanctuary.

scape in and around Avebury in Later Neolithic times, few astronomical

alignments have ever been claimed here. Alexander Thom’s only interest in 
the site was geometrical. The British archaeologist Aubrey Burl has sug- 
gested that the Cove was aligned upon the most northerly rising position of 
the moon, but the few other known examples of coves show no astronomi- 
cal consistency.

Axial Stone Circles 


Axial stone circles (ASCs), or more correctly axial-stone circles, are a dis- 
tinctive type of stone circle found only in the southwestern corner of Ire- 
land, in counties Cork and Kerry. Only one other regional group of stone 


circles bears any resemblance to the axial stone circles: the recumbent stone 


circles (RSCs) found several hundred kilometers away on the opposite side 
of the British Isles, in northeastern Scotland. The Irish axial stone circles 
(ASCs), like their Scottish counterparts, consist of a single stone placed on 
its side, with all the other stones being set upright. Without exception, this 
recumbent stone is found in the southwestern or western part of the circle, 
But unlike the typical Scottish RSC, the recumbent in Irish ASCs is modest 
in size. The remaining stones in the circle tend to increase (not decrease, as 
with the RSCs) in height around to the opposite side, where we find a pair 
of uprights, generally the tallest, known as portals, because it is easy to 
imagine them forming an entrance into the circle. All of the remaining 
stones are placed symmetrically in pairs about the axis passing between the 
portals, across the circle and through the middle of the recumbent stone. 
This distinctive symmetry means, for one thing, that there is always an odd 
number of stones in these circles (from five to nineteen). Perhaps more im- 
portantly, it also emphasizes the axial orientation. This raises the intriguing 
question of why it seems to have been so important to orient this axis in a 
westerly or southwesterly direction (taken from the portals toward the re- 
cumbent stone). 

The nature of the link between the two groups of monuments is un- 
known. The Scottish RSCs appear to be older, dating perhaps toward the 
end of the third millennium B.c.£., while the ASCs appear to extend well into 
the second millennium. However, secure archaeological dating evidence is 
still scarce. Postulating a direct link, some authors refer to the axial stone cir- 
cles as recumbent stone circles; others warn against prejudging the nature of 
the interrelationship between the two groups and argue in favor of a dis- 
tinctive term for a distinctive group of monuments. 

Despite some systematic differences, the strong resemblance—both in 
form and orientation—between these two geographically separate groups of 
stone circles is undeniable. It is perhaps surprising, then, that when we look 
more closely at the individual orientations of the ASCs we find that—quite 
unlike the RSCs—they were not guided by particular topographic or astro- 
nomical considerations in any consistent way. Unlike their Scottish counter- 
parts, where there is a clear preference for a reasonably distant horizon be- 
hind the recumbent, the ASCs are found in a variety of topographic 
situations, some with high ground rising close behind the recumbent and 
blocking the distant view completely. And unlike the RSCs, where there is a 
consistent pattern of orientation in relation to the moon, the Irish sites show 
no consistent pattern in relation to any astronomical body. 

The lesson to be learned here is that a variety of considerations may 
have influenced the location and orientation of any prehistoric ritual monu- 
ment, including topographic factors (relationships to prominent natural fea- 


tures such as visible mountains, sacred places, water sources, and so on) as

tals towards the recumbent stone. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


well as the heavenly bodies. In different places and different times, different 
considerations might have held sway according to the dominant tradition. 
While some elements of prevailing traditions may be carried forward from 
place to place and through time, others may be modified or be abandoned. 
The sky forms only one part of a much bigger picture, even where we do 
have clear and consistent astronomical alignments. Whatever the links be- 
tween these two very distinctive stone circle traditions at the opposite sides 
of Scotland and Ireland, it is clear that the strong astronomical (and specifi- 
cally, lunar) associations of the Scottish RSCs were not transmitted across to 
their Irish counterparts. 

The lack of consistent astronomy among the axial stone circles does not 
necessarily mean that one or two individual examples could not have been 
deliberately astronomically oriented, for reasons specific to a particular 
place and time. The most quoted examples are Drombeg, near Ros O gCair- 
bre (Ross Carbery) on the south coast of County Cork, a well-preserved cir- 
cle whose axis points toward midwinter sunset; and nearby Bohonagh, 
which faces more or less due west and has been claimed as aligned upon sun- 
set at the equinox. However, the fact that Drombeg is the only one of sev- 
eral dozen large axial stone circles with a clear solstitial alignment must raise 


the possibility that this could have arisen by chance, and the equinoctial in- 


terpretation of Bohonagh is subject to certain difficulties that pertain to all 
putative equinoctial alignments.

Azimuth 


Azimuth means the bearing of a direction—such as that toward a particular 
point on the horizon from a given place—measured clockwise around from 
due north. Thus the azimuth of due north is 0°, that of due east is 90°, that 
of due south 180°, and that of due west 270°. The azimuth of a point one 
degree to the west of north is 359°. Azimuth is measured in the horizontal 
plane through the observer. To fully specify the direction of an observed 
point, one must also specify the vertical angle or altitude of the point. 

It is possible to specify the position of a star or other object in the sky 
by its azimuth and altitude, but this will change with time owing to the di- 
urnal motion of the celestial sphere. Even at a given moment, the azimuth 
and altitude values of a particular star will be different for observers at dif- 
ferent places on the earth.

Aztec Sacred Geography 

The Aztec (also known as the Nahua, or Mexica) empire—the last of the 
great Mesoamerican civilizations—dominated the highlands of central 
Mexico at the time of the arrival of Hernando Cortés in 1519. It had risen 
to power following a series of military conquests just a century or two ear- 
lier and maintained economic control by extracting tributes in the form of 
foodstuffs and raw materials (as well as personal services) from conquered 


populations. The Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, situated at the center of 


present-day Mexico City on an island approached along three long cause- 
ways, had an estimated population of 250,000. The mass sacrifices to their 
war and sun god Huitzilopochtli, which took place at the great Templo 
Mayor in the center of the city, are legendary. 

The landscape around the Aztec capital is characterized by strings of 
mountains and towering volcanoes that surround and dominate flat valleys, 
creating obvious associations between mountains, clouds, rains, fogs, thun- 
derstorms, springs, and rivers. Under the valley floors and mountain slopes 
are numerous caves created by ancient lava flows. And before time took its 
toll and the suburbs of Mexico City spread through the landscape, the terrain 
was also peppered with magnificent human constructions, both the temples 
of the Aztecs themselves and the conspicuous remains of earlier temples dat- 
ing back to the Preclassic period (at least as far as the mid-first millennium 
B.C.E.). This combination created, in the Aztec mind, a vibrant perceived 
world strewn with the abodes of powerful spirits: mountains were sources of 
water and rain; caves were entrances to the underworld; and the huge cere- 
monial center of Teotihuacan with its enormous pyramids, a thousand years 
old by this time, was itself seen as a magnificent creation of the gods. 

Tributes to the gods had to be made in the appropriate place but also 
at the correct time. One of the most critical actions was to appease Tlaloc, 
the god of rain and fertility, and persuade him to send water for the year’s 
maize crop. Petitions to Tlaloc were timed in relation to calendar festivals 
and often involved the sacrifice of children. Thus on the first day of the 
month Atlcahualo (in the 365-day calendrical cycle or xibuitl), or around the 
middle of February in the Gregorian calendar at the time of the Conquest, 
the bodies of sacrificed children were thrown into caves close to mountain 
sanctuaries, since the water was thought to remain there, inside the moun- 
tain, until released by the gods as rain. On the summit of Mount Tlaloc it- 
self, at an elevation of more than 4,000 meters (13,000 feet), was a shrine 
containing an idol of the rain god where the nobles from Tenochtitlan and 
adjacent cities converged during a great festival in the month Hueytozoztli, 
at the end of April. Here, a young boy was sacrificed while, in a comple- 
mentary ceremony taking place at a nearby lake, a similar fate awaited a 
young girl, who was appropriately dressed in blue. 

Many different calendrically timed rituals such as these, taking place all 
over the Aztec empire, generated a network of relationships in people’s 
minds between sacred places in the landscape (particularly mountains), the 
activities that took place there, and the timing of those activities. Evidence 
suggests that those perceptions were reinforced both by the positioning of 
temples in the landscape and by solar alignments deliberately built into those 
temples. It has been proposed that the Templo Mayor was (at least approx- 


imately) aligned upon Cerro Tlaloc on the horizon to the east, that the sun 


would have risen more or less behind that mountain on the equinox, and 
that two prominent mountains on the eastern horizon from Cerro Tlaloc it- 
self, across the next valley, aligned with sunrise on two important days when 
mountain ceremonies were taking place on that peak. More recent work sug- 
gests that the later phases of the temple were in fact oriented upon sunset at 
the feast of Tlacaxipehualiztli, which coincided with the Julian vernal equi- 
nox in 1519 and was duly recorded by the chronicler Motolinia. Whatever 
the details in this case, the combination of ethnohistorical accounts relating 
to the nature and timing of ceremonies, archaeological evidence of votive of- 
ferings at sites such as mountain shrines, and archaeoastronomical data on 
orientations and alignments makes a convincing case that many relation- 


ships such as these were real enough in the Aztec mind.

Babylonian Astronomy and Astrology 

Ancient Babylonia occupies a pivotal place in the history of modern sci- 
entific astronomy. In great part this is due to the conscientious nature of 
the astronomical observations that were made there and the meticulous 
way in which they were recorded for generation after generation. In time, 
the existence of a huge, cumulative database of past observations made 
possible the development of mathematically based rules for predicting fu- 
ture events. The Babylonian legacy of careful observation and recording 
combined with mathematical modeling went on to influence developments 
in ancient Greece and beyond. The other reason ancient Babylonia is so 
important to modern historians of astronomy is the fortunate choice of 
medium on which many of the ancient astronomical observations (along 
with many other documents) were recorded. The method used was to 
press wedge-shaped marks into smooth, damp tablets of clay using a sty- 
lus. Subsequently, the tablets were dried in the sun or fired in kilns for per- 
manence. Clay tablets do not tend to disintegrate with time like (say) 
parchments or papyri and are unaffected by subsequent fire, so they fre- 
quently survived the looting or destruction of buildings and other cata- 
clysmic events of history. The Babylonian cuneiform script was deciphered 
in the nineteenth century. In short, many high-quality records have sur- 
vived, and they can be read. 

The ancient city-state of Babylon lay some 90 kilometers (55 miles) 
south of modern Baghdad. Its power and influence came to cover all of 
lower (southern) Mesopotamia—the region of modern Iraq between the 
Tigris and Euphrates rivers down to the Persian Gulf—in the eighteenth cen- 
tury B.C.E., after which it followed a turbulent history under a succession of 
dynasties until its conquest by the Persians in 539 B.c.E. Subsequently, Baby- 
lon became part of greater empires: the Persian until 331 B.C.E., when it was 
conquered by Alexander the Great; then (after Alexander’s death) the Se- 
leucid Empire; it ultimately fell to the Romans in 63 B.c.£. The latest known 
cuneiform tablet dates to C.E. 75. 


Most of the written evidence that comes down to us is in the form of 
clay tablets from the Seleucid period from 311 B.c.E. onwards. Those in- 
cluding astronomical data are of various types: astronomical diaries con- 
taining nightly observations; records of sightings of astronomical events such 
as planetary conjunctions and eclipses; and (increasingly with time) al- 
manacs containing predictions of the length of the month, the positions of 
the planets among the fixed stars, and many other things. These documents 
demonstrate beautifully how the systematic accumulation of carefully 
recorded passive observations led in time to the ability to predict using math- 
ematical models. One thing that made this development possible was the 
Babylonian system for representing numbers: like ours it used a fixed base, 
but instead of ten, the base was sixty. In other words, each “digit”—itself a 
set of strokes representing tens and ones—represented a value from zero to 
fifty-nine, with subsequent digits representing “units,” multiples of sixty, 
multiples of sixty times sixty, and so on. (The Maya, in contrast, used a base 
of twenty.) 

In the Babylonian calendar, the new day began at sunset and the new 
month began when the thin crescent moon was first sighted in the evening 
sky after sunset. Back in the third millennium B.c.E., two calendars seem to 
have existed in parallel: an “ideal” calendar that was theoretical, with each 
month containing thirty days, and a common calendar based on actual lu- 
nar observations. The first of these calendars is used in early clay tablets that 
are essentially business documents: this is hardly surprising, since people had 
to agree on the day something had been signed or a commitment had been 
made, and this could not be dependent upon the vagaries of whether or not 
the new crescent moon had been seen (which could be a matter of some dis- 
pute, especially if it had been cloudy in certain places at critical times). This 
civil calendar needed to be the same all over Babylonia and not subject to 
disputes between different local officials. 

Nonetheless, it seems that the actual astronomical calendar (rather than 
the abstract “ideal” calendar) was used for civil purposes from the second 
millennium B.c.E. onwards, despite the attendant problems. Gradually, the 
analysis of accumulated observations of first sightings of the new crescent 
moon enabled Babylonian astronomers to develop mathematical “rules of 
thumb” that permitted month lengths to be accurately and reliably pre- 
dicted. Furthermore, by about the fifth century B.C.E., the nineteen-month 
(Metonic) intercalation cycle had been discovered and established. It pro- 
vided a rule whereby the additional (intercalary) months needed to keep the 
lunar calendar in step with the seasonal (solar) year could be added in a me- 
chanical, deterministic, yet reliable way. Astronomers no longer had to de- 
pend upon independent astronomical observations, such as the heliacal ris- 


ing of Sirius. 


One of the most remarkable consequences of the Babylonian as- 
tronomers’ attention to detail and the sheer volume of records that they ac- 
cumulated over many generations was the recognition of the so-called Saros 
cycle: it described the fact that if a lunar eclipse occurs, others will tend to fol- 
low at regular intervals of eighteen years and eleven days for many centuries 
thereafter. This discovery was no mean feat, since approximately forty differ- 
ent Saros cycles run simultaneously, and the conditions for visibility of any 
particular eclipse vary considerably—many are completely invisible from any 
given location on the earth (if they occur during daytime, for example). They 
simply cannot be revealed by casual observations of lunar eclipses over a few 
years or even decades, even if clear skies were permanently assured. 

In view of its undoubted influence on the development of modern as- 
tronomy, it is tempting to view the Babylonian tradition as the birthplace of 
scientific investigation of the heavens. But this would be highly misleading. 
The main motivation for the Babylonians’ intense interest in the skies was 
astrological. Different days in the common calendar were associated with 
different prognostications, and by the seventh century B.c.E., scholars were 
advising the Assyrian king of the calendrical omens. A particular concern 
was the issue of whether the forthcoming month would have twenty-nine or 
thirty days. Other concerns included the length of day and night, the helia- 
cal events of stars, the positions of the planets, and of course the occurrence 
of solar and lunar eclipses. One of the most important series of celestially re- 
lated clay tablets has become known as the Enuma Anu Enlil, meaning 
“When [the great gods] Anu and Enlil...” (the first line of the text). This 
document, which dates to around the end of the second or the beginning of 
the first millennium B.C.£., runs to seventy tablets, and multiple copies exist. 
It contains around seven thousand omens accumulated from past experience 
and provides advice as to whether certain celestial configurations and 
events—signals from the gods—would indicate their pleasure or displeasure. 

This was not astrology in the sense that celestial configurations were 
perceived as the direct cause of terrestrial events (although this did become 
a widespread philosophy from the fourth century B.c.E. onwards in Hel- 
lenistic Greece) but rather that they provided portents of events that could 
then, if necessary, be averted by taking appropriate action. In this, astro- 
nomical predictions were used along with a variety of other forms of div- 
ination. 

Ancient Babylonia was also the birthplace of modern horoscopic as- 
trology, or at least the earliest known example of the belief in the predictive 
capabilities of charts recording planetary positions at the moment of a per- 
son’s birth, (Actually, the horoscopes of modern popular astrology represent 
a revival of this belief rather than any sort of continuity of tradition.) An im- 


portant prerequisite was the division of the zodiac (through which the plan- 


ets move) into twelve regions of equal size. Birth charts began to appear in 
the second half of the first millennium B.c.E. and represented a move away 
from the astrologers having to watch the skies passively, waiting for omens 
to appear, to the more active pursuit (performed on demand) of calculating 
where the planets would have been among the stars at a particular time. It 
also represented a shift away from observational astronomy toward inten- 
sive mathematics. It is ironic, in view of the way in which modern astrology 
is seen as the very antithesis of modern science—irrational and unscientific— 
that this astrological innovation in Babylonian times necessitated making 
full use of the most up-to-date scientific knowledge and methods that had 
been developed by this time. 

From the late third century B.c.E. onward, two fundamentally different 
schools of thought emerged for generating predictions from the extensive 
records of existing observations. These seem to have coexisted throughout 
the final few centuries of ancient Babylon (until the late first century C.E.), to 
judge by two types of works—mathematical ephemerides and almanacs 
known as Goal Year Texts—that were evidently produced in parallel. The 
ephemerides represent the height of Babylonian scientific achievement, using 
sophisticated mathematical models to predict phenomena of the moon and 
planets with remarkable accuracy. The Goal Year Texts, on the other hand— 
each one a sort of astrological handbook for a given year—seem to represent 
an independent tradition of prediction based upon repeating cycles that had 
been discovered by studying the existing diaries of observations (the Saros 
cycle was one of these). 

There is a great deal still to be learned about the nature of astronomi- 
cal and astrological knowledge in ancient Babylonia and the social context 
in which it operated. Though about three thousand fragments of clay tablets 
containing astronomical information are currently known to exist, a huge 
amount of basic data simply remains unexplored. There are tens of thou- 
sands of fragments of clay tablets in the British Museum alone, many tens of 
thousands more in other museums around the world, and untold quantities 
still buried under the ground in modern Iraq. Since a sizeable proportion of 
the clay tablets that have been studied contain astronomical information, 
there is every reason to expect the same to be true in the future. And while 
many of the museum specimens are of unknown provenance, only eventu- 
ally having found their way into the public domain after progressing along 
tortuous routes, some of those still waiting to be discovered may be exca- 
vated in a context that will yield valuable archaeological information about 
their broader function and significance.

Ballochroy 
Ballochroy is one of many hundreds of small megalithic monuments found 
in western Britain. The casual visitor is unlikely to be greatly impressed at 
the sight of it: a row of three standing stones, one broken off, occupying an 
unassuming location in a field behind a barn at Ballochroy farmhouse on 
the west coast of the Kintyre peninsula, Argyll, Scotland. There is, however, 
a good view over the coast to the west, and this view is key to understand- 
ing its significance, for this modest monument is one of the earliest and 
most famous examples of a megalithic “observatory” put forward by 
Alexander Thom, during the 1950s. It assumed a central place in the con- 
troversies that raged for more than two decades over Thom’s theories. 
Ballochroy encapsulates Thom’s idea that prehistoric Britons used 
features on distant horizons as astronomical foresights in order to observe 
and record the motions of the sun and moon to remarkable precision. The 
central stone at Ballochroy has a broad, flat face oriented across the align- 
ment that points northwest, directly at the slopes of Corra Bheinn, a 
mountain on the Island of Jura some 31 kilometers (19 miles) away. On 
the summer solstice, the tip of the sun’s disc twinkled down the indicated 
slope; a couple days before or after, when the sun’s path was just slightly 
lower, it would not have been visible. The row of three stones itself points 
southwestward toward a small island called Cara Island about 12 kilome- 
ters (7 miles) away. Close to the winter solstice, the tip of the sun’s disc 
gleamed to the right of the island as it set; on the solstice itself this would 
not have been the case. 


The best evidence supporting the theory that Ballochroy was a “solar 
observatory” is that there are not one but two foresights at the same site, 
marking the setting sun at both of the solstices. Surely such a coincidence 
could not have arisen by chance? And yet many critics raised doubts. One of 
the other standing stones in the row also has a broad, flat face pointing 
northwestwards, but this one points at a different mountain. And the align- 
ment along the row is very broad, encompassing not only the right-hand end 
of Cara Island but also its left-hand end and central peak as well. If we are 
fair with the data, then we should admit the existence of at least a few other 
candidates for foresights that are equally plausible but have no ready astro- 
nomical explanation. 

On the other hand, the fact that the claimed alignments are so precise 
means that we can use the slow change in the setting path of the solstitial sun 
century by century (due to the gradual change in the obliquity of the eclip- 
tic) to calculate the best-fit dates for the two foresights and see if they coin- 
cide. The result is stunning: the best-fit date is pretty much the same for both 
foresights, around 1600 B.c.E., and this is a date that is certainly plausible 
archaeologically. 

Yet archaeological and historical evidence has all but destroyed the 
idea that Ballochroy is a precise solstitial observatory. There is, and was, 
more to this monument than three stones in a row. A drawing by the anti- 
quarian Edward Lhuyd in 1699 clearly shows three cairns in line with the 
three stones, one of them so large that it would have blocked the view to 
Cara Island, together with a fourth stone beyond. The burial cist (a box- 
shaped tomb with four side slabs) that was originally covered by this 
mound is still visible at the site, although the mound and the other features 
sketched by Lhuyd have been destroyed. The remains of this cairn were ex- 
cavated in the 1960s, and the archaeological evidence indicates that it is 
very unlikely to have been constructed as late as the mid-second millennium 
B.C.E. If the stones were erected at the date indicated by the two alignments, 
then one of them was always blocked by the cairn. Though a few have ar- 
gued that people might have stood atop the cairn to make the observations, 
this is special pleading. Being realistic, we are forced to conclude that the 
solstitial alignment of the stone row at Ballochroy, if intentional at all, was 
only of a low precision: it was not an observing instrument. 

The example of Ballochroy remains important to archaeoastronomers 
because it demonstrates the dangers of enthusiastically endorsing alignments 
that seem to fit an astronomical theory while ignoring other possibilities be- 
cause they don’t. This isn’t being fair with the evidence. It also shows the im- 
portance of the broader context of archaeological and, where we have it, his- 


torical evidence.

Barasana “Caterpillar Jaguar” Constellation 

The Barasana are a group of forest-dwellers in the Colombian Amazon. 
They survive by a mixture of fishing, hunting, and gathering, supplemented 
by slash-and-burn agriculture. June, July, and August (in our calendar) are 
difficult months for them, since their regular food sources are scarce. But at 
this time of year pupating caterpillars fall down from the trees and provide 
a much-needed source of nutrition. The date this happens coincides with 
the time when the Caterpillar Jaguar, a constellation regarded by the 
Barasana as (among other things) the Father of Caterpillars, rises higher 
and higher in the sky at dusk. Since the Caterpillar Jaguar is formed by stars 
in our constellations of Scorpius and Cetus, it is easy to explain, from a 
Western perspective, the association that the Barasana observe: the time of 
year following the acronical rising of Scorpius and Cetus happens to be the 
time of year when several species of caterpillar pupate. 

The Barasana can explain the phenomenon too. They say that the Fa- 
ther of Caterpillars, by rising higher and higher in the sky at dusk, is directly 
responsible for the increasing numbers of earthly caterpillars. In the 
Barasana worldview, there exists a direct correspondence between two enti- 
ties that from a Western perspective are quite distinct: the position of a con- 
stellation in the sky and the behavior of terrestrial creatures. 

This is a good example of how a non-Western worldview can make 
sense of the cosmos by drawing direct connections between things that we 
would regard as quite unconnected. It is also a good example of a way of un- 
derstanding the world that (at least potentially) has predictive capability: 
when the constellation rises, then the caterpillars will start to appear. This 
characteristic of Barasana cosmology, some would argue, means that we 
could regard it as a rudimentary form of science. However, it might also be 
described by others as astrology in the sense that events of earth are per- 
ceived to be determined by, or at least directly linked with, the configuration 
of objects in the sky.

Beltany 

The very name of this large stone circle in County Donegal, northwest Ire- 
land, is of astronomical interest because it suggests an association with the 
Celtic calendrical festival of Beltaine, or Bealltaine, which is associated with 
the mid-quarter day of May 6. A conspicuous alignment at the site backs 
up the idea of such an association. If one stands by the tallest stone in the 
circle, which is on the southwestern side, then one can see on the far side a 
distinctive triangular stone covered with several cup marks. This stone is 
aligned with a point on the horizon where the sun rises on May 6. As a con- 
sequence, the cup-marked stone is often dubbed the Beltane Stone. 

This combination of a 5,000-year-old astronomical alignment and a 
more recent mythical tradition that may have given rise to the name, and 
their possible linkage through Celtic calendrical festivals, is an attractive 
possibility. However, we cannot be sure. Several other astronomical align- 
ments have been postulated at the circle, showing that the Beltane alignment 
may not be the most convincing. For example, there is a small hill summit at 
the relevant point on the horizon, but a much more conspicuous hill, Bin- 
nion Hill, appears just to the left, where the sun rises on about May 21. The 
idea of a precise Celtic calendar and its linkage back to an earlier “mega- 
lithic” calendar is also problematic in a number of ways. The Beltane align- 
ment at Beltany may, after all, just be a coincidence. 

Nonetheless, cup-marked stones do seem to be associated with astro- 
nomical alignments elsewhere—for example, at the Scottish recumbent 
stone circles—so the idea may not be so far-fetched that this particular 
springtime sunrise alignment was significant, for some reason, back in the 
Neolithic.

Borana Calendar 

The Borana are a group of nomadic cattle herders inhabiting an area that 
lies partly in southern Ethiopia and partly in northern Kenya. Their calen- 
dar, which regulates both subsistence and ceremonial activities, is of vital 
importance to them and is regulated by experts on sky observation known 
as ayantu. The Borana calendar is conventional in some respects. It is based 
upon the phase cycle of the moon, with each new month signaled by the ap- 
pearance of the new, crescent moon in the evening sky. Both months and 
days are named, and the ayantu generally know the current month and day 
from memory. But if there is any uncertainty they make observations of the 
moon and stars. Seven months of the year are identified by a star or group 
of stars that rises side by side with the crescent moon when it first appears 
in the evening sky. The seven stars and asterisms used are Triangulum, the 
Pleiades, Aldebaran, Bellatrix, Orion’s belt and sword, Saiph, and Sirius. 
During the other half of the year, at least some of the ayantu watch to see 
at what phase the moon is side by side with the first star group in the list, 
Triangulum (although others may use different asterisms for this purpose). 
“Side by side” is a concept that only makes sense because the Borana live 
very close to the equator. This means that all celestial objects rise vertically 
somewhere in the eastern sector of the horizon and set vertically in the west- 
ern sector. On any particular night, all the stars and asterisms that rise to- 
gether continue to climb up into the sky “side by side.” 

The Borana’s obsession with Triangulum is interesting in itself. It is of- 
ten argued that the brightest stars and asterisms are likely to have been the 
most important to prehistoric peoples. Thus, people who seek stellar align- 
ments at prehistoric monuments tend to examine the brightest stars. The Bo- 
rana show that this is not necessarily the case. Triangulum is a relatively faint 
group of three stars, yet it is of prime importance to them. 

What renders the Borana calendar highly distinctive, and confused an- 
thropologists and archaeoastronomers for over a decade, is that day names 
do not start afresh with each month but progress in an endless cycle of 
twenty-seven names. Since the phase-cycle (synodic) month is between 
twenty-nine and thirty days long, two or three days appear twice in each 
month, once at the beginning and again at the end. The reason for this seem- 
ingly incomprehensible practice becomes clear when we consider the monthly 
passage of the moon through the stars. Night by night, the moon moves 
slowly relative to the stars, completing a circuit through the stars in 27.3 days. 


This is known as the sidereal month. At the equator, this means that if the 


moon rises on one night side by side with a certain set of stars, by the next it 
will have progressed and rise level with a different set. After 27 nights, it will 
be rising side by side once again (more or less) with the original set of stars. 
The Borana day is determined by the stars that the moon is level with on a 
given night, regardless of its phase. Twenty-seven day names suffice, with one 
being repeated in roughly every third cycle as observations dictate. 

The fact that the ayantu ignore the sun in determining the time of year 
seems surprising until we realize the implications of their location close to 
the equator. Here, the sun’s behavior changes little through the year: the 
length of the day is effectively the same all year round, and the annual swing 
in the sun’s rising or setting position between the solstices is relatively small. 
On the other hand, the vertical motion of the celestial bodies at night makes 
it natural to notice which stars are level with the moon, especially just after 
the moon has risen or before it sets.

Boyne Valley Tombs 

The northern banks of the river Boyne in County Meath, Ireland, at a spot 
called the Bend of the Boyne, are the site of a remarkable concentration of 
Neolithic tombs dating to the late fourth millennium B.c.£. These include 
three large passage tombs: Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth. 

At Newgrange a single 19-meter (60-foot) passage leads in from an en- 
trance on the southeast side of a huge mound (some 80 meters [260 feet] 
across), famously oriented so that the sun shines directly along it, lighting up 
the central chamber, just after dawn on days around the winter solstice. Each 
of the other major tombs has two passages. Those at Knowth run deep into 
the interior from entrances opposite each other, facing more or less due east 
and west respectively. Dowth has passages of different lengths, both in its 
southwestern quarter. The longer one runs in from an entrance in the west- 


southwest, the shorter one from the southwest. 


Apart from Newgrange, only the shorter passage at Dowth could 
conceivably be interpreted as aligned upon the solstitial sun, and the tar- 
get here is winter solstice sunset rather than sunrise. However, it has also 
been pointed out that the three monuments, taken together, might have a 
broader calendrical significance. Each of their five passages is oriented 
close to sunrise or sunset on a solstice, equinox, or mid-quarter day: that 
is, upon one of the dates obtained by dividing the year into eight exactly 
equal parts starting at either of the solstices. This division is reflected in the 
traditional Celtic calendrical festivals, which fall close to these dates. It is 
also reflected in the precise alignments upon sunrise or sunset on these 
dates at many British megalithic sites that were claimed by Alexander 
Thom in the mid-twentieth century and seemed to imply that a calendar 
dividing the year into eight equal parts had been in extensive use through- 
out Neolithic Britain. 

However, as later reassessments showed, the archaeological and statis- 
tical evidence simply does not support Thom’s “megalithic” calendar, and 
the idea of any all-pervasive Celtic calendar in later, Iron Age times has 
proven highly questionable. Astronomical and calendrical practices through- 
out later prehistory were much more variable and localized. Furthermore, 
the supposedly calendrical alignments of the Boyne valley tomb passages 
(Newgrange aside) are not exact. All this suggests that the Boyne valley 
tombs may have done no more than to fit within a broad general pattern of 
orientation practice that prevailed locally and perhaps extended to Irish pas- 
sage tombs further afield. This much would accord with what one finds 
among local groups of later prehistoric tombs and temples throughout west- 
ern Europe. Indeed, we need look no further than the sixteen smaller passage 
tombs that surrounded Knowth in order to see a broad range of passage ori- 
entations varying from northeast around through east and south to south- 
west, but avoiding the northwest and north. 

Yet it remains possible that more particular practices relating to the sea- 
sons and the skies may show up archaeologically in other ways, as “one-off” 
phenomena, such as the solstitial hierophany at Newgrange itself. Thus, one 
of the decorated kerbstones at Knowth resembles a sundial, while another 
contains a cyclic arrangement of twenty-nine circles and crescents that could 
be a representation of the phase cycle of the moon.

Brainport Bay 

The landscape of much of the western highlands of Scotland is one of 
mountains dissected by long narrow lakes, similar to Norwegian fjords, ex- 
tending inland from the coast. Loch Fyne in Argyll is one of the longest of 
these, stretching for more than 50 kilometers (30 miles). On its shores, 
about halfway along, is one of the most convincing candidates for a pre- 
historic solar observation platform. 

The site known as Brainport Bay or Minard occupies a spectacular set- 
ting on a low eminence jutting out into the lake. It achieved notoriety in the 
late 1970s when, following excavations by the local archaeological society, a 
curious alignment of artificial structures came to light, dating to the Bronze 
Age in the mid second millennium B.c.£. It includes a back platform, a flat 
area built around a natural rock outcrop; two large boulders standing on end, 
known as the observation boulders, with a flat cobbled area between; and a 
main platform, again artificially enhanced. The main platform contains what 
appears to have been an extraordinary sighting device. Two slender standing 
stones a little over 1 meter (3 feet) tall stood upright in clefts between rocks 
(they had fallen and been moved but were re-erected after the excavations had 
located the stone-holes). As viewed from the observation boulders, these 
stones would have lined up, with the precision of a rifle barrel, upon a notch 
between two mountains on the only distant horizon visible from the site, 
some 45 kilometers (30 miles) along the lake to the northeast. 

In the Bronze Age, the midsummer sunrise would have occurred just a 
little to the left of this notch. As the sun moved steadily upwards and to the 
right, it would have crossed the exact alignment, passing just above the notch, 
a few minutes later. Furthermore, the appearance of the sun in the alignment 
would not have been confined to the solstice itself, but would have been 
equally impressive for a period of several days, like the famous midwinter 
alignment at Newgrange. This means that unreliable weather is unlikely to 


have prevented at least one successful sighting of the event in most years. 


As far as the evidence goes, this is one of the most convincing cases of 
a monumental solstitial alignment constructed in the Bronze Age in the 
whole of Britain and Ireland. Compared with the possible observing plat- 
form at Kintraw, for example, the structures at Brainport Bay show clear ev- 
idence of human activity and enhancement of the natural features, but not 
of habitation or burial. It is a prime candidate, in other words, for a cere- 
monial or ritual site. We are still a long way from knowing what the solstice 
meant to the people who, we assume, came and observed or worshipped 
here at dawn on or around the longest day of the year. It is tempting, though, 
to imagine a priest or two, or perhaps a couple of other people of special so- 
cial standing, observing the event from the special vantage of the observa- 
tion boulders while a larger audience had to content themselves with stand- 
ing on the back platform up the hill behind. On the basis of current evidence, 
though, this remains speculative. 

Despite this relatively straightforward and impressive alignment, the 
site nevertheless became controversial. This is because of additional sugges- 
tions by Euan MacKie, the archaeologist who had originally excavated at 
Kintraw and was also responsible for bringing Brainport Bay to the atten- 
tion of a wider audience. One of MacKie’s ideas was that the Brainport Bay 
alignment was not imprecise and not just used for ceremonial purposes: it 
was a precision observing instrument for determining the exact date of the 
solstice. It is difficult to determine the exact date of the solstice, because the 
change in the rising position of the sun on days near to the solstice is only 
minuscule. The horizon notch that the “rifle barrel” stones align upon actu- 
ally marked the first gleam of sunrise about fifteen days before and after the 
solstice. The prehistoric observers, according to MacKie, would have deter- 
mined the solstice by counting the number of days between the two times 
when the sun rose in the notch and halving the difference. 

The problem with this argument is that it cuts both ways. Counting in 
its favor is the fact that if prehistoric people were trying to determine the sol- 
stice, then using a horizon notch displaced from the actual solstitial rising 
position of the sun and halving the difference would have been a very sensi- 
ble way to do it, because they were focusing on a place on the horizon where 
the day-to-day change in the position of sunrise was easily perceptible. 
Counting against the idea, though, is the fact that any notch within a short 
distance of the solstice is susceptible to a similar argument, since we do not 
have direct knowledge about the interval of time around the solstice that 
would have to be halved. In mountainous country there are lots of notches, 
and the chances of a fortuitous alignment are very considerable. The upshot 
is that on the basis of the evidence available to us we can only return one 
verdict—and fortunately it is one that is allowed in the Scottish legal sys- 


tem—namely, “not proven.” 


MacKie went further still. There are a variety of other signs of human 
activity in the immediate area around the Brainport Bay alignment, includ- 
ing a 3.4 meters (11 feet) long fallen standing stone and cup markings on 
rock outcroppings. The whole area, MacKie suggested, formed a “calen- 
drical complex,” with several precise alignments upon sunrise or sunset on 
epoch dates in the “megalithic” calendar. But critics have pointed out a 
number of difficulties, particularly the fact that the alleged calendrical 
alignments at Brainport Bay are marked in very different ways: across a 
platform to a pyramid-shaped stone; from a standing stone to a cup mark 
on a rock; and along the line of a cup-and-groove mark (but not along a 
similar cup-and-groove mark on another stone). A great many potential 
alignments of various types exist here, which implies that the calendrical 
ones could easily have arisen fortuitously.

Brodgar, Ring of 

The Ring of Brodgar is one of the most impressive, and one of the two most 
northerly, examples in Britain of a henge monument containing a stone cir- 
cle. The stone circle is over 100 meters (330 feet) across, standing within a 
ditch over 120 meters (400 feet) in diameter (the outer bank has now al- 
most completely disappeared). Several of the stones rise to a height of over 
3 meters (10 feet). Located on the largest of the Orkney Islands (Mainland 
Orkney) off the northern coast of Scotland, it occupies a magnificent situa- 
tion toward the end of a long, narrow isthmus projecting into a large fresh- 
water lake (the lochs of Harray and Stenness). Just 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) 
away are the even taller Stones of Stenness, another henge and stone circle 
in a matching situation: Stenness occupies a shorter isthmus on the other 
side of a 200 meters (700 feet) gap that one can now cross by a road bridge. 
The Ring of Brodgar was clearly of paramount importance in the prehis- 
toric landscape in around 3000 B.c.£., when it was probably constructed. 
Standing sentinel over what was almost certainly an important route across 
the island, and clearly visible from all around, it occupied a position of 
great power and influence. That it remained a conspicuous ancestral mon- 


ument revered for many generations seems evident from the numerous

round cairns that were built around it in the Bronze Age, more than a mil- 
lennium later. 

The site achieved astronomical notoriety in the 1970s when Alexander 
Thom and his son Archie first published the theory that it was a sophisti- 
cated lunar observatory. According to the Thoms, various alignments at the 
site, mostly between the outlying cairns, were deliberately aligned upon hori- 
zon foresights that marked limiting rising and setting positions in the moon’s 
complex cycles. So precise were the alleged alignments—to less than two arc 
minutes—that the Thoms were forced to conclude that programs of obser- 
vation lasting many generations must have been needed. 

The Ring of Brodgar, more than any other single monument, demon- 
strates the dangers of over-enthusiastic interpretation in archaeoastronomy. 
Time has dealt harshly with the “lunar observatory” hypothesis. The prob- 
lem lies in the selection of data: the selection of alignments, the selection of 
foresights, and the selection of lunar “targets” deemed significant are all 
highly questionable. The four foresights, for example, are of varying degrees 
of conspicuity, varying from the crest of the impressive distant cliffs of Hel- 
lia 13 kilometers (8 miles) away on the island of Hoy, down to an almost im- 
perceptible blip on the horizon at a place called Ravie Hill. There is no rea- 
son (other than their lunar potential) to pick out the four chosen from the 


many dozens, if not hundreds, of other possibilities. 


Above all, the example of Brodgar shows the paramount importance of 
a field methodology that ensures the fair selection of data and its critical as- 
sessment. It is all too easy, even for a professional academic working outside 
his or her own discipline, to end up—unwittingly—merely picking out the 
evidence that seems to support a favored theory while ignoring the rest.

“Brown” Archaeoastronomy 

This term denotes an approach in archaeoastronomy that is not primarily 
focused upon alignment studies but is concerned with a much broader 
range of types of evidence, such as written documents or ethnohistorical ac- 
counts. This approach emerged in North America during the 1970s, partic- 
ularly in the context of studies of astronomy in native North America and 
pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. It involved attempts to integrate approaches 
from a range of humanities and social science disciplines such as history, 
cultural anthropology, art history, ethnography, folklore studies, history of 
religions, and many more. This broad, multidisciplinary approach con- 
trasted starkly with the pursuit of statistical rigor that absorbed most Old 
World archaeoastronomers at the time.

Bush Barrow Gold Lozenge 

The Bush Barrow is one of a number of spectacular burial mounds in the 
vicinity of Stonehenge in southern England, many of them clustering along 
the low ridges that surround the famous site itself. These round barrows, 


the burial places of prominent Bronze Age chieftains in the Wessex region, 


were built around 2000 B.c.£., several centuries after the main construction 
activity had ceased at Stonehenge. Few doubt that their position, at the 
boundary between the “lived-in” landscape and the low bowl of the sacred 
landscape centered upon the ancestral place of power, in clear sight of both, 
was in itself an expression of the power and influence of the dead chiefs. 

Rich assemblages of grave goods accompanied the chieftains to the af- 
terworld. One of the most impressive was the Bush Barrow lozenge, a mag- 
nificent diamond-shaped plate of thin sheet gold 18 centimeters (7 inches) 
across. Finely decorated with distinctive patterns of incised lines, it is gener- 
ally interpreted as an ornamental breast plate—an imposing mark of status. 
In the 1980s, Archie Thom and two colleagues claimed that the lozenge was 
a sophisticated astronomical observing instrument. By holding the plate hor- 
izontally and lining it up in the correct orientation, the various markings 
could have been used to indicate the sunrise and sunset positions on signifi- 
cant epoch dates in the “megalithic calendar” that Archie Thom’s father, the 
Scottish engineer Alexander Thom, had proposed. It could be used in a sim- 
ilar manner to determine significant rising and setting points of the moon. 
The claim appeared to vindicate his father’s theories. 

But attractive as the idea seemed, problems emerged when it was ex- 
amined in detail. For one thing, there would be various practical difficulties 
using such a device, not least in determining its correct orientation. The most 
serious problem, however, is that the directions supposedly marked by the 
patterns on the lozenge do not really fit very well. Several of the alignments 
actually fall between the markings, while many of the markings do not fit 
any of the alignments at all. The fact that the markings actually form a reg- 
ular and symmetrical design (while the astronomical targets are not regular) 
argues strongly in favor of their being purely decorative rather than astro- 
nomically functional. And as if this were not enough, other lozenges exist in 
nearby burials with a similar form of decoration but different dimensions. 
Why should only this one function additionally as a calendrical device? 

By the 1990s it had become clear that the other evidence supporting the 
idea of a “megalithic calendar” did not stand up to critical evaluation. How- 
ever, the most direct blow to the calendrical interpretation of the Bush Bar- 
row lozenge was delivered, ironically, when the historian John North at- 
tempted to interpret the lozenge independently as part of his own 
astronomical interpretations of prehistoric monuments and artifacts in 
southern England. Vehemently criticizing the existing astronomical interpre- 
tation, he proposed an equally complex but entirely different one of his own, 
thereby showing how easy it was to do so and in the process undermining 
confidence in both theories. 

The example of the Bush Barrow lozenge demonstrates very clearly the 


dangers of trying to mould the evidence to fit a favored theory rather than 


letting the evidence speak for itself. Most likely the lozenge was simply a dec- 
orative artifact. It is impressive nonetheless and can be recognized as a con- 
siderable technological achievement without recourse to sophisticated calen- 


dars and astronomy.

Cacaxtla 

The citadel of Cacaxtla is prominently located on a hilltop in the highlands 
of Mexico, in the state of Tlaxcala, about eighty kilometers (fifty miles) 
southeast of Mexico City. It dates to the Epiclassic period (c. C.E. 650-850), 
a time when great cities such as Teotihuacan had collapsed and independent 
highland kingdoms had begun to develop. It was the main seat of the rulers 
of a group known to archaeologists as the Olmeca-Xicalanca (not connected 
with earlier Olmecs on the Gulf Coast). 

The most impressive feature of Cacaxtla for the modern visitor is its 
huge murals, colorful and dramatic, reflecting a mixture of stylistic influ- 
ences. These bear witness to tumultuous times. One of them vividly depicts 
the aftermath of battle and sacrifice, with the victorious dark-skinned war- 
riors shown in jaguar pelts and the defeated lowland army in bird costumes. 
In one scene, the defeated captain is draped with Venus symbols and is be- 
ing publicly humiliated prior to his execution. The archaeoastronomer John 
Carlson has argued convincingly that this episode was one manifestation of 
a wider cult of warfare and ritual sacrifice related to the patterns of ap- 
pearance of the planet Venus. A small chamber discovered in 1987 con- 
tained two stuccoed pillars, each painted with a life-sized figure rich in sym- 
bolism relating to blood, water, and the planet Venus. One is male and one 
is female, but they also have scorpion, bird, and jaguar features and wear 
Venus skirts, kilts ornamented with a huge depiction of the glyph known to 
represent Venus. They are thought to represent deities strongly related to 
Venus, who had a vital role in the process of turning blood into water 
through ritual sacrifice (feeding the gods with human blood would encour- 
age them to reciprocate by providing rain), thus ensuring fertility and re- 
newal. It is possible that this room was the place where some of the most 
important sacrifices took place. 

About one and a half kilometers (one mile) to the west of Cacaxtla, on 
an adjacent and higher hilltop, is the ceremonial center of Xochitecatl, a 
much older site that was occupied from about 700 B.c.E. and in use until an 


eruption of the volcano Popocatepetl forced its abandonment around C.E. 
150. (Later, at the time of the dominance of Cacaxtla, parts of it were reoc- 
cupied.) One of its most distinctive features is a spiral pyramid built around 
700 B.c.E. But it is the rectangular Pyramid of the Flowers that is most re- 
markable. It contains more than thirty infant burials (yet only one adult) and 
over two thousand clay figures, the great majority representing females of all 
ages. The obvious conclusion is that the latter were votive offerings related 
to fertility rites. The infant burials evoke practices known in (later) Aztec 
times, when children were sacrificed at mountain shrines on particular cal- 
endar dates to petition for rain. 

Ascending the temple’s western staircase to the large central platform— 
140 by 100 meters (460 by 330 feet)—reveals a striking view to the east and, 
directly ahead, the 4,600 meter (15,000 foot) volcano La Malinche, which 
dominates this region. The deposits of clay figures were found near this spot, 
which is scarcely surprising. Rain and fertility are clearly associated, and 
clouds tend to loom over the mountain even when the sky is otherwise clear. 
The later Aztecs certainly associated mountains with rains, believing (some 
have argued) that mountains were hollow “houses” filled with water—a 
conviction that is likely to reflect a much longer-standing element of 
Mesoamerican worldview. In pre-conquest times La Malinche was known as 
Matlalcueye, the great female mountain of sustenance. It is fair to conclude 
that rain and fertility rites at Xochitecatl might have been associated with 
this mountain for many centuries into the past, and possibly as far back as 
the Middle Formative Period when the pyramids were first built. 

The view from the platform of the Pyramid of the Flowers reveals one 
more remarkable fact. From here, the palace of Cacaxtla sits immediately be- 
low and directly in line with the volcano. Is it too far-fetched to suggest that 
Cacaxtla was deliberately placed in an alignment whose significance was al- 
ready long established? Possibly not; and it is even possible that cult prac- 
tices related to this alignment have survived into modern times. Each year on 
the festival of St. Michael, September 29, the people of the village of San 
Miguel del Milagro, close to Xochitecatl, set out on a pilgrimage to the 
archangel’s shrine. Chanting to celebrate the feast begins at sunrise. Around 
this day, as viewed from the Pyramid of the Flowers, the sun rises behind the 
summit of La Malinche, along the alignment of monuments and mountain. 
According to Carlson, these activities that still take place in a small Mexican 
village represent, in Christianized form, a living tradition of sacred geogra- 
phy, timed pilgrimage, and mountain veneration related to rain and fertility 
rites that extends well back into pre-conquest times. Such a continuity of tra- 
dition might seem unthinkable if we did not have good evidence that other 
fundamental aspects of Mesoamerican thought were remarkably durable— 


in particular the calendar itself. 


Threading together in this way strands of evidence of different types— 
from archaeology, history, archaeoastronomy, and modern ethnography— 
raises many methodological issues, and if done carelessly can lead to quite 
unsustainable conclusions. Yet if done carefully it can bring some remark- 
able insights.

Cahokia 

The many huge earthworks or mounds that remain visible in the Mississippi 
and Ohio valleys form a conspicuous testimonial to the technical achieve- 
ments of indigenous North Americans before the arrival of European set- 
tlers. Inevitably, a number of them have attracted interest in potential as- 
tronomical alignments, and it is scarcely surprising that this includes the 
great Mississippian site of Cahokia. 

The Mississippian culture flourished from about c.£. 1000 to 1400 in 
the central Mississippi valley, where the fertile floodplains were ideal for 
growing maize and other staple crops. Cahokia was not only the main eco- 
nomic and political focus of this culture but also the largest pre-Columbian 
town—worthy in fact of being called a city—north of Mexico. At the height 
of its development it covered over fifteen square kilometers (six square miles) 
and had an estimated population of more than twenty thousand. The city it- 
self was laid out on a roughly cardinally aligned grid. At its heart was a cer- 


emonial center containing over a hundred earthworks—temple or house 


platforms together with burial mounds. Most of this “mound center” is now 
preserved in Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site near East St. Louis. 

The rectangular, flat-topped earthwork known as Monks’ Mound is at 
the center of the ceremonial grid. It is the largest earthen mound in the 
whole of the Americas, some thirty meters (a hundred feet) high and cover- 
ing around seven hectares (seventeen acres). But it was the discovery in the 
early 1960s of rings of postholes marking the sites of five timber circles to 
the west of Monks’ Mound that triggered intense astronomical interest in 
the site. By analogy to Woodhenge—a set of concentric, oval-shaped timber 
rings found near Stonehenge in England—the discoverers named them 
woodhenges, although it is dangerous to draw close similarities between su- 
perficially similar sites from completely different cultural contexts. The five 
original woodhenges at Cahokia, identified by extrapolating from strings of 
postholes forming circular arcs running through excavated areas, appear to 
have had diameters ranging from thirty-seven meters (120 feet) to seventy- 
one meters (233 feet). They were good approximations to true circles, with 
evenly spaced posts. Most remarkably, initial estimates of the numbers of 
posts in the five circles—twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-eight, sixty, and sev- 
enty-two—implied that numerology was vitally important, and that strict 
design principles were operating. Four of the five posthole circles overlap, 
suggesting that they represent successive constructions fulfilling a particu- 
lar purpose. Since this time, a number of other postholes and posthole 
structures have been discovered at Cahokia. 

The original suggestion made by archaeologist Warren Wittry in the 
early 1960s was that the various circles of timber posts functioned as devices 
for observing the rising position of the sun at the solstices and equinoxes, 
perhaps for the purpose of regulating an agricultural or ceremonial calendar. 
However, this involved the totally arbitrary selection of data: for instance, 
three posts—indistinguishable in any other way from all the remaining posts 
in one of the circles—were identified as putative solar foresights as viewed 
froma central post. Other corroborating evidence presented at the time—for 
instance, relating to the orientation of the ramps used in setting each relevant 
timber post in its place—has proved totally fallacious, as have various fur- 
ther astronomical speculations. 

An obvious question to have asked at the outset was: why, if sunrise ob- 
servation was the primary purpose, was a whole circle of posts needed? In- 
deed, circles of this size—unless supplemented by the use of distant horizon 
foresights—cannot define the relevant alignments at all precisely. It is possi- 
ble that the circles had a cosmological function or meaning, but the public- 
ity given to the unfounded astronomical speculations has undoubtedly ham- 
pered serious consideration of this issue. 


Instead, Cahokia stands as an unfortunate example of bad practice— 


uncritical spotting of alignments upon preconceived astronomical targets un- 
dertaken without due consideration to the broader interpretative context.

Calendars 

The regular motions of celestial bodies can be used to keep track of the pas- 
sage of time, and observations of different cycles in the sky have underlain 
many different types of calendars developed and used from early prehistory 
to the present. The moon is an obvious tool for this purpose: it is conspicu- 
ous in the sky, and its cycle of phases is easily tracked and of a convenient 
periodicity (between twenty-nine and thirty days). The sun is another obvi- 
ous candidate: the annual passage of its rising and setting position along the 
horizon, and its changing arc through the sky, which gives rise to days of dif- 
ferent lengths, is directly related to the seasonal year. The stars follow the 
same track through the sky day after day, the changing time of night of their 
appearance and disappearance are also correlated with the seasonal year. 
Even the planets follow regular cycles, more complex but nonetheless recog- 
nizable and readily observable. 

The diversity of human calendars, and the complexity of many of them, 
arises partly because these natural cycles do not fit together neatly. The 
length of the lunar phase cycle (synodic month) is not a whole number of 
days, the length of the seasonal year is not a whole number of lunar phase 
cycles, and so on. Sometimes nature provides, by chance, a reasonably close 
fit—thus five synodic cycles of the planet Venus are very close to eight sea- 
sonal years—and some human cultures seem to have gone out of their way 
to identify such correlations. A prime example is the Maya, as is clear from 
the almanac known as the Dresden Codex. Others observe certain cycles in 


the heavens and seem to ignore the rest. It is scarcely surprising that there is 


a broad correlation between calendars and latitude, since the general ap- 
pearance of the skies and of the celestial cycles depends upon it. For exam- 
ple, the annual variation in the length of the day, and in the horizon position 
of sunrise (or sunset), is much greater, and hence more obvious, at higher lat- 
itudes than near to the equator. 

These are convenient categorizations for us and for the modern as- 
tronomer, but they may have made no sense to peoples in the past. To un- 
derstand the nature of a calendar we must understand the needs it fulfilled— 
practical, ideological, and social. In some cases more than one distinct 
calendars fulfilling different needs may have run in parallel. We must also 
understand that a calendar may have been conceptualized within a very dif- 
ferent framework of understanding from our own. It then comes as less of a 
surprise that calendars are commonly regulated using astronomical cycles 
observed in combination with a multitude of other natural cycles, many of 
which (to our way of thinking) are less regular or reliable. 

One of the greatest pitfalls is to try to identify “stages” in the develop- 
ment of the modern Western calendar, seeing these as a progression along an 
inevitable path of calendrical development. This encourages a form of intel- 
lectual imperialism (or ethnocentrism) in which we attempt to measure the 
achievement of others in relation to our own. This stepped approach is easily 
refuted by a number of indigenous calendars recorded in modern times. The 
calendar of the Mursi of Ethiopia is particularly valuable in this respect. What 
we actually find, rather than a single progression, is considerable diversity 
combined with remarkable ingenuity and adaptability to local circumstances. 

Another pitfall is to simplify calendrical developments in the distant 
past, postulating the existence of calendars in common use over great swaths 
of the prehistoric world and/or changing little over many centuries. Notori- 
ous examples of this kind of oversimplification are the “megalithic” calen- 
dar in Neolithic Britain and the “Celtic” calendar in Iron Age Europe. An- 
other is the proposition that the modern Borana calendar represented a 
calendar that had been propagated, without variation, through two millen- 
nia since being encapsulated in a set of alignments at Namoratung’a in 
northern Kenya. Research has shown, instead, that calendars are very often 
adapted rapidly to changing circumstances. 

On the other hand, broad calendrical principles can be preserved with 
remarkable consistency, as happened amongst the scattered islands of Poly- 
nesia. Yet even here, considerable local variations developed: even between 
individual islands and parts of islands within the Hawaiian group. There 
were variations, for example, in the naming of months, the timing of months 
within the seasonal year, and rules for inserting intercalary months. A simi- 
lar degree of variation is evident between different city-states in Classical 


Greece and also within pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.

Callanish 


In one of the most remote corners of Britain stands one of the country’s most 
impressive megalithic monuments. The standing stones of Callanish (an an- 
glicization of the Gaelic name, Calanais) can be found on the western shores 
of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides off western Scotland. They occupy 
a commanding situation overlooking what is now a stark landscape of 
heathery peat bogs and, to the west, the sea inlet of East Loch Roag. The site, 
dating to the third millennium B.c.£., consists of a ring of tall menhirs—the 
ring is 13 meters (43 feet) across and the stones vary from 3 meters (10 feet) 
to 4 meters (13 feet) in height—surrounding a small, chambered tomb. Rows 
of four or five stones radiate out to the east, west, and south. Northwards, 
but displaced by about ten degrees to the east, runs a longer double row or 
avenue. Several smaller stone circles and settings of standing stones are 
found in the vicinity. 

The site first achieved astronomical notoriety when a survey was pub- 
lished by Vice-Admiral Boyle Somerville in 1912. It included the first-ever 
suggestion that a megalithic monument might have been aligned upon the 
moon at an extreme rising or setting point in its 18.6-year cycle, known as 
the lunar node cycle. As Somerville pointed out, the avenue is aligned south- 
wards in the direction of the most southerly possible setting point of the 
moon, which the moon can only reach every eighteenth or nineteenth year. 
This idea was elaborated in the 1960s and 1970s by Gerald Hawkins, the 
author of Stonehenge Decoded, and by the Scottish engineer Alexander 
Thom. The Greek historian Diodorus of Sicily, writing in the first century 
B.C.E., referred to a sacred precinct or circular temple in the island of the 
Hyperboreans where the moon appeared close to the earth and the god re- 
turned every nineteen years, and it has been suggested by some people, in- 


cluding the British archaeologist Aubrey Burl, that Diodorus referred to 


The standing stones of Callanish, Isle of Lewis, Scotland. (Corel Corp.) 


Callanish rather than Stonehenge, as was more generally assumed. (Both in- 
terpretations are problematic.) 

Thom proposed that Callanish was one of several “lunar observato- 
ries” marking significant lunar rising and setting points very precisely (down 
to a small fraction of the moon’s diameter) using distant foresights—in this 
case, the mountain of Clisham on Harris, some 26 kilometers (16 miles) 
away. However, there is no clear view of Clisham from the avenue—it is ob- 
scured both by the taller stones of the central ring and by a small rocky out- 
crop just to the south of the site. Thom’s high-precision “lunar observato- 
ries” in general have not stood the test of time. 

However, the failure of mid-twentieth-century attempts to populate the 
prehistoric past with an intellectual or priestly elite prepossessed with high- 
precision astronomical observations should not blind us to the basic rela- 
tionship with the moon that exists at the Callanish stones, or with what this 
might actually have meant to the Neolithic populations of this area. The full 
or nearly full moon scraping uncommonly low over the hills to the south and 
then—as viewed along the avenue—passing behind and setting among the 
stones of the circle, casting them into silhouette, would have been a truly 
spectacular sight, one that could only have been seen once or twice in a gen- 


eration. If this was intentional from the outset, then it would certainly ex- 


plain the skewing of the avenue away from the meridian. It would also have 
ensured that this location was charged with tremendous sacred power at 
these special times. 

It has been suggested that the standing stones of Callanish and the var- 
ious smaller megalithic monuments in the surrounding area incorporated nu- 
merous alignments upon prominent horizon features and extreme lunar ris- 
ing and setting positions. The Callanish stones, it was proposed, stood at the 
heart of a complex that encapsulated a variety of relationships between built 
monuments, prominent natural features in the landscape, and the motions of 
the moon. The general idea is not implausible: indigenous societies com- 
monly organize sacred space to reflect cosmic relationships perceived in the 
wider visual setting, and the visible environment included the sky. But in the 
absence of corroborating evidence, it is almost impossible to argue convinc- 
ingly for any particular scheme. We have no way of knowing which rela- 
tionships actually were perceived as significant in the past, and any choice 
that we make is ultimately subjective. Whether the Callanish stones really 
represent a temple whose significance related to the moon appearing in a 


special way in every nineteenth year remains an open question.

Caracol at Chichen Itza 

An extraordinary feature of Mesoamerican astronomy, given the complex- 
ity and sophistication evident from the ethnohistory and written sources 
such as the Dresden Codex, is the apparent lack of any observatories or ob- 
serving instruments apart from the cross-sticks depicted in various codices, 
widely interpreted as a naked-eye sighting device. One of the very few seri- 
ous candidates for a building used as an observatory is the Caracol at 
Chichen Itza. 

Chichen Itza is one of the most famous Maya cities. Like Uxmal, it 
flourished around c.£. 800, but its influence appears to have persisted while 
many other cities were abandoned and fell into ruin. During the Postclassic 
period (C.E. 900-1300), before Chichen Itza itself fell into ruin, its sphere of 
influence became greatly extended and the constructions forming its cere- 
monial center became bigger and more impressive than ever. Even so, the 
Caracol stands out as exceptional. The reason is not so much its size as its 
shape: it is round, while every other visible construction here is straight- 
sided. As such the Caracol is almost unique, and certainly uniquely pre- 
served. The round tower was ascended by a curved staircase running inside 
its double outer walls, leading to a small upper chamber with windows on 


various sides—or so it is supposed, since less than half of it now survives. 


The openings are little more than niches, which means that they provide re- 
strictive sighting devices. They do look out just above the horizon, which has 
led numerous researchers to measure alignments and speculate on their pre- 
cise function, This anomalous and unaesthetic building seems an ideal can- 
didate for an observatory where Maya priests observed the heavens to regu- 
late the calendar. 

To the person seeking statistical verification that the tower was used for 
astronomical observations, the results are disappointing. There are no con- 
sistent alignments on the sun, moon, or planets. And while stellar observa- 
tions might have been important, there are too many possibilities—too many 
bright stars—to place much credence on any apparent stellar alignments that 
have been found. Further progress must consider the cultural context. Given 
the close association of various nearby structures at Chichen Itza with the 
planet Venus, the claim that two of the three surviving windows were ideally 
placed for observing the furthest northerly and southerly settings of this 
planet deserves closer scrutiny. But in view of the total lack of cultural evi- 
dence attesting to its use as an observatory, the strong possibility remains 
that the Caracol had nothing to do with astronomical observations at all.

Carahunge 
In a mountainous region of southern Armenia, near the town of Sisian, is 
an impressive stone setting consisting of over 150 standing stones varying 
from about one meter (three feet) to 2.8 meters (nine feet) in height. Ap- 
proximately fifty more stones have now fallen. Of Neolithic date, probably 
built no later than the third millennium B.c.£E. and possibly considerably 
earlier, the site broadly resembles many better-known megalithic monu- 
ments on the Atlantic seaboard of Europe, and particularly in Britain, Ire- 
land, and Brittany. Surrounding a central dolmen is an oval-shaped ring 
about thirty-five meters (115 feet) in diameter consisting of about forty 
stones. An avenue runs out from the ring to the northeast, and other rows 
run north and south. 

The site has been interpreted as an astronomical observatory and ac- 
claimed as an Armenian Stonehenge. A distinctive feature of Carahunge is 


that about eighty of the stones in the north-south rows contained a small cir- 


Part of the stone setting at Carahunge in Armenia. (www.carahunge.com) 


cular hole running through their upper section (although only about fifty of 
these stones survive intact). These curious holes have carefully smoothed 
edges and are around five centimeters (two inches) in diameter. Some are as 
much as twenty centimeters (eight inches) deep, opening out into wider de- 
pressions carved into each side of the stone. Three holes enter in one side of 
a stone, turn a right angle and then point directly upwards. An unresolved 
question is whether the holes, which seem remarkably unweathered if they 
are indeed prehistoric, were in fact added as a later feature. 

A number of Armenian and Russian archaeoastronomers have investi- 
gated the possible use of these holes for observations of the sun and moon 
in prehistoric times. They have established, for example, that three or four 
of them are directed toward the point of sunrise on the summer solstice and 
another three or four toward the point of sunset on the same day. Other 
holes point in a variety of directions, all around the compass. They are also 
inclined at various angles to the horizontal, mostly up to about fifteen de- 
grees; this means that most are directed toward points in the sky just above 


the local horizon. These facts raise the serious possibility that the holes were 


used for astronomical observations, whether contemporary with the con- 
struction of the original monument or later. It has even been suggested that 
the three right-angled holes contained mirrors and were used for zenith ob- 
servation. To address these issues, a systematic study of the holes that remain 
in situ, paying careful attention to methodological issues, is urgently needed, 
because the site is unprotected and threatened by damage from sightseers 
and looters. 

Inevitably there have been other claims—more speculative and less sup- 
portable—relating to the astronomical significance of the site. One is that it 
can be astronomically dated to the sixth millennium B.c.£. And direct com- 
parisons with Stonehenge, which few now believe was an observatory, are 
less than helpful.

Cardinal Directions 

If we find monumental alignments pointing due north, east, south, or west, 
it is tempting to interpret them simply as “cardinally oriented,” but we 
must be cautious in doing so, Why would such alignments arise? 

Where architecture is intentionally aligned toward due north or south, 
disregarding the exceptional circumstance where this is because some signif- 
icant place or landmark happens to be located in that direction, then it is as- 
tronomical in a broad sense. This is because north-south alignments follow 
the axis of symmetry of the daily motions of the stars in the night sky as they 
swing each day around the celestial poles. From some locations, certain im- 
portant celestial bodies may be seen to “rise” or “set” in these directions, but 
this can only happen if the horizon is not flat, since all the celestial bodies 
move along on the level when they are due north or south. In general, north- 
south alignments relate to the daily motions of the heavens as a whole rather 
than to any particular celestial body or event. Three very different examples 
illustrate the reasons for keeping architecture “in tune with the cosmos” in 
this way: the Great North Road at Chaco Canyon—the so-called Chaco 


Meridian; the Forbidden City in Beijing; and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. 
Alignments to the east or west are more problematic. An alignment on 
equinoctial sunrise or sunset, for example, will be approximately toward due 


« 


east or west, respectively, but was not necessarily perceived as “cardinal.” 
Then again, the concept of “east” may be a much broader one. Christian 
churches are generally conceived as oriented eastwards, for a variety of litur- 
gical reasons that dictated this to be the direction that Christian worshipers 
should face when praying. However, their actual orientations span a range 
spreading as much as several tens of degrees away from true east. If we have 
only archaeological evidence to go on, especially if we have no reason to as- 
sume any great precision, then it is difficult to see how we can distinguish an 
alignment conceived to be “easterly” from one upon the equinoctial rising 
sun, or indeed upon some other star or asterism that happens to rise in that 
general direction (such as, in the present day, Orion’s belt). 

As if this were not enough, there is a deeper problem. In assuming that 
east is universally conceived as a cardinal direction, we are making the as- 
sumption that every human community, past and present, would be inclined 
to identify as significant four directions that divide the horizon into four ex- 
actly equal parts. This assumption is unwarranted. It is not true for the 
Chorti Maya people of the Yucatan in Mexico, for whom the east and west 
are seen as the directions of sunrise and sunset on the day when the sun 
passes directly overhead. The north and south directions, as we have said, 
arise as a direct consequence of the motions of the stars in the night sky as 
they swing each day around the celestial poles—in other words, they are dis- 
cernible by direct observation of the heavens in a way that applies equally 
well at any point on the earth (apart from the poles). On the other hand, the 
directions east and west as we conceive them are not marked in any direct 
and consistent way by astronomical referents. (There is no direct way, for ex- 
ample, of identifying a particular sunrise as equinoctial: to do this one must 
employ some device such as counting the number of days or dividing the 
horizon between the solstices.) 

In short, because the designation of the four directions due north, 
south, east, and west as cardinal is so familiar to us, it is easy to think of their 
significance as an absolute, but this would be a mistake. There is no reason 
to suppose concepts such as “east” and “west” in any prehistoric society 
bore any direct relation to our concepts, or meant anything at all. And yet a 
common trait among historical and modern indigenous communities, par- 
ticularly in the Americas, is to conceive the cosmos to be divided (horizon- 
tally) into four parts. This is known as a quadripartite cosmology. Within 
such a worldview, “east” might refer to what we would describe as a range 
of directions around due east. But there is no reason a quadripartite cos- 


mology must divide the horizon into exactly equal quarters, or for each part 


to be centered upon one of “our” cardinal directions. Indeed, quadripartite 
cosmologies are commonly related to the sun, so that the easterly direction 
is not a complete quarter of the horizon but that part within which the sun 
rises at some time during the year.

Casa Rinconada 

Casa Rinconada was the largest of the great kivas in Chaco Canyon. Kivas 
were subterranean circular buildings used as meeting places or for sacred 
ceremonies. In Chaco they were generally built with their roofs at ground 
level, within the central plazas of Great Houses such as Pueblo Bonito, 
where over thirty-five examples, great and small, are to be found. Casa Rin- 
conada was unlike the other kivas in both these respects. It was built on its 
own, separately from any Great House, and while the dirt floor was 3.5 me- 
ters (twelve feet) below the surrounding ground level, its walls protruded 
above the ground. It measured twenty meters (sixty-six feet) across, and its 
vast roof (of which no trace remains) was supported by four vertical timber 
uprights placed near the center. There were entrances to the north and 
south, and around the outer wall were twenty-eight regularly spaced niches 
together with six larger, irregularly spaced ones. 

During the 1970s, archaeoastronomers were apt to scrutinize ancient 
monuments anywhere in the world for potential solar and lunar alignments 
reflecting those that had been so famously proposed a decade earlier at 
Stonehenge in England; Casa Rinconada was analyzed closely in this regard. 
However, as these early investigators had to admit, the roof was a problem, 
Only through what seems to have been a single window in the north-north- 
east could sunlight (or moonlight) actually have entered the kiva, and the 
best they could come up with was that after sunrise at the summer solstice, 
a beam of sunlight entering through this window could have illuminated one 
of six niches that, for some unfathomable reason, were built slightly larger 
than the rest. However, the window in question has been reconstructed and 
its original position is uncertain, and even if it is in the original position, it 


seems that one of the four roof supports may have been in the way. All of

this serves to illustrate the dangers of naive “alignment hunting.” 

It also obscures a more fundamental property of the orientation of 
Casa Rinconada. The kiva was cardinally aligned: its main axis (through the 
entrances) was due north-south, and it was also broadly symmetrical about 
the east-west axis. The intention, surely, was cosmological. Creation myths 
that have come down to modern indigenous peoples in the vicinity tell how 
the first kiva was circular to reflect the circle of the sky, and conceptual prin- 
ciples that result in a quartering of space in relation to the cardinal directions 
are commonplace among indigenous North American groups to this day. As 
archaeoastronomer Ray Williamson concluded back in 1982, Casa Rin- 
conada “was meant to serve as an earthly image of the celestial realm; . . . it 
was not an observatory, but a ritual building whose structure reflects the 
central place astronomy had in ancient Pueblo religious practice” (Aveni 
1982, p. 205). 

It is even more intriguing that principles of cardinality seem to have ex- 
tended into the landscape. In 1978, archaeologist John Fritz drew attention 
to the fact that three major Chaco structures, the Great House of Pueblo Alto 
to the north of the canyon, Casa Rinconada within it, and Tsin Kletzin, an- 
other Great House on the mesa to the south, lie on a north-south line. This, 
argued Fritz, was the main axis of the city. The two largest Chacoan build- 
ings, Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito, lie on either side of this axis, almost 
equidistant from it, and on an east-west line. Fritz’s contention was that these 
two cardinal axes were of fundamental importance in the minds of the Cha- 
coans, a theory that received a dramatic endorsement with the subsequent 
discovery of what has become known as the (Great) North Road, which ex- 
tends the north-south axis physically northwards for at least fifty-five kilo- 
meters. Archaeologist Steve Lekson has extended this idea still further, argu- 
ing the existence of a “Chaco Meridian” that extended from Aztec, over 
eighty kilometers (fifty miles) north of Chaco, right down to Paquime in mod- 
ern Mexico, a staggering 630 kilometers (390 miles) to the south. 

An investigation in the 1980s of the orientations of the principal walls 
of Chacoan Great Houses showed that only four out of fourteen of them 
were aligned cardinally. However, three of the four lie on Fritz’s axes: Pueblo 
Bonito (north-south) and Pueblo Alto and Tsin Kletzin (both east-west). 
Casa Rinconada itself was also cardinally aligned, as we have already seen. 
Only Chetro Ketl stands out as an exception, its principal wall oriented at 
an azimuth of about seventy degrees. The fact that all but one of the build- 
ings situated on the cardinal axes were themselves cardinally aligned surely 
adds strength to the idea that the cardinal directions and Fritz’s axes were of 
fundamental importance. (Conversely, all but one of the buildings not lying 
on these axes were not cardinally aligned.) 


During its first half-century of existence, archaeoastronomy has ma- 


tured considerably as a discipline, moving on from “alignment hunting” to 
addressing culturally relevant questions. In the same period, Casa Rin- 
conada has been transformed from a building containing numerous poten- 
tial solar and lunar alignments (an idea that never really resonated with the 
cultural evidence) to a central point within an astronomically referenced sa- 


cred landscape.

Catastrophic Events 

Unexpected events in past skies, such as eclipses or the appearance of 
comets and meteors, could cause fear and even social disruption. In partic- 
ular, they could threaten the power of elites, which was often predicated on 
being able to control the celestial bodies and keep them regular and pre- 
dictable. 

It has been suggested by some astronomers that cometary activity 
might have been much greater at certain epochs in the past, resulting in pe- 
riods when sightings of spectacular comets and meteors were much more 
common. One such period occurred during the second millennium B.c.E., 
causing considerably more “active” skies, and the unrest that these caused 
brought about significant social and political upheaval, together with 
abrupt changes in beliefs systems in many parts of the world. The astro- 
nomical arguments remain controversial, but even if one accepts them, 
there are problems on the archaeological side. For sure, major social and 
ideological changes affected many human societies all round the globe dur- 
ing the second millennium B.c.E., but one has to question whether this pe- 
riod was much different from any other era in the last few millennia in this 
respect. In any case, the impact of fearsome sights in the sky on any partic- 


ular group of people would have depended greatly upon all the other, more

localized problems that were of concern at the time. The sky was important, 
but it wasn’t everything. 

Since the 1990s, increased cometary activity in the past has engendered 
a great deal of interest, but largely for another reason: the increased proba- 
bility of physical impacts from small meteorites hitting the earth. Though de- 
rived from the same astronomical cause, this is a fundamentally different is- 
sue in human terms. Meteoritic impacts have a direct physical outcome. 
Even a small meteoritic impact can have a devastating short-term effect on 
the climate, causing atmospheric dust, which leads to growth-free “cold 
summers” over vast areas. 

And such effects did happen, which is clearly shown by evidence from 
dendrochronology (tree-ring dating). This dating technique is capable of as- 
signing individual growth rings in particular timbers to a particular year. As 
a result, we know that during certain years in the last five millennia, there 
was virtually no significant tree growth anywhere in the northern hemi- 
sphere. The years with the most severe climatic downturns were 2345 B.C.E., 
1628 B.c.E., 1159 B.c.E., and 536 Cc.E. When these events were first identified 


in the tree-ring record, the cause was suspected to be volcanic eruptions, but 
the Northern Irish dendrochronologist Mike Baillie has argued strongly 
against this. If one accepts that the cause of some or all of the climatic down- 
turns was indeed a meteoritic impact, this does not mean such impacts were 
more likely in the past; on the contrary, they may be as likely today as ever. 

Whatever did cause these climatic downturns, questions about their im- 
pact on the Earth’s population at the time can only be addressed by carefully 
piecing together fragments of archaeological, historical, and environmental 
evidence. In the meantime, the popular wave of interest in meteoritic impacts 
that ensued in the late 1990s generated everything from theories of global 
catastrophe and revolutionary social change throughout the world in the 
mid-sixth century C.E. to totally unsustainable ideas that Stonehenge in Eng- 
land was built to observe and predict meteoritic impacts.

Celestial Sphere 

The earth is surrounded by stars at various distances, but when the night 
sky is viewed on a clear night from anywhere on the earth, it appears that 
all the stars (and other celestial objects) are fixed onto a huge sphere sur- 
rounding the observer. From any given place at any given time, roughly half 
of the sphere is visible above the horizon, provided that there are clear 
views unobscured by things like trees or buildings. The other half is below 


the horizon and invisible. 


The earth rotates in space once a day, and the stars are effectively mo- 
tionless. (They are actually in motion with respect to one another, but gen- 
erally the effects of these proper motions are so negligible that they will not 
affect the configurations of the stars in a way detectable with the naked eye 
over many tens of thousands of years or more.) This means that from the 
viewpoint of an observer on the earth, the celestial sphere appears to rotate 
around him or her once a day, with all the stars affixed to it. (The fact that 
the observer is not at the center of the earth is of little consequence except 
in the case of the moon, for which lunar parallax must be taken into ac- 
count before we can determine the position of the moon in the sky, either 
now or in the past.) 

If we are interested in how human societies perceive the sky, as opposed 
to what modern physics and astronomy can tell us about the universe, then 
it is how the sky appears rather than how it actually is that is important. 
Thinking in terms of the celestial sphere enables us to define a number of 
fundamental concepts that are extremely useful in discussing ancient skies. 

For example, on this rotating sphere we can identify an equator and 
two poles. The latter are called the north and south celestial poles, and they 
are directly overhead as viewed from the north and south poles respectively 
on the earth. More generally, and most usefully, we can define lines of lati- 
tude (declination) and longitude (right ascension), which allow us to specify 
the position of any star on the sphere.

Celtic Calendar 


The concept of a Celtic calendar that divided the year into eight precisely 
equal parts, marked by festivals on the solstices, equinoxes, and mid-quar- 
ter days, has influenced archaeoastronomy for decades and does so still, in 
that many people continue to perceive monumental alignments upon sun- 
rise or sunset on the equinoxes or mid-quarter days as inherently signifi- 
cant. Certainly pre-Christian calendrical festivals existed, such as Imbolc, 
Beltaine, Lughnasa, and Samhain (celebrated in modern pagan traditions at 
the beginning of February, May, August, and November, respectively), and 
continued to be important, for example, in early medieval Ireland. How- 


ever, we should not accept uncritically the notions that their precursors 


were both widespread within Iron Age Europe and precisely determined. 
The whole concept of Celtic culture is now generally felt to be problematic, 
with many archaeologists arguing that it has more to do with modern per- 
ceptions of ethnicity than with historical or archaeological evidence of any 
widespread conformity between cultures in the European Iron Age. Given 
these uncertainties, the idea of a precise and all-pervasive Celtic calendar 
must be treated with considerable caution. 

Nonetheless, there are indications that a precise division of the year 
into eight parts, based on observations of the sun, might have existed in pre- 
Roman times. Chief among these is the Coligny calendar, a bronze tablet 
about 1.5 meters by 0.9 meters (five feet by three feet) in size (though found 
in fragments, some of which were missing) dating to the second century C.E. 
It is a public calendar covering five years, with dates and festivals marked, 
and it is luni-solar in character: a late remnant of an indigenous calendar 
from the pre-Roman world. Lunar months alternating between twenty-nine 
and thirty days, and even intercalary months, are marked; but so, too, are 
dates that recur once every three months or so, each mysteriously marked 
“PRINI LAG” or something similar. These dates occur at intervals of ninety- 
one, ninety-three, ninety-one, and ninety-two days—intervals of almost ex- 
actly one quarter of the year (which has 367 days in the Coligny calendar). 
It has been suggested that they actually mark Celtic quarter-day festivals. 

Regardless of the “Celticity” of the indigenous calendar in this region 
of southern Gaul (the calendar was discovered about eighty kilometers [fifty 
miles] from Lyon), the vital question is whether it provides solid evidence for 
a pre-Roman calendar in which the main seasonal festivals were timed by 
counting off exact numbers of days in the solar year. In view of the fact that 
the indigenous calendar concerned was clearly lunar-based, this seems very 
unlikely. Perhaps the regular intervals were introduced as part of the process 
of making the existing calendar conform to the Roman system.

Ceque System 

The capital of the Inca empire, Cusco (or Cuzco), was at the heart of a huge 
scheme of sacred geography. At the very center was the Temple of the Sun, 
known as the Coricancha (“golden enclosure”). The entire Inca empire was 
partitioned into four divisions known as suyus, a division that was so fun- 
damental in Inca thought that the Inca name for their own empire was 
Tahuantinsuyu (“four parts”). The boundary lines separating the four swyus 
radiated out from Cusco, indeed from the Coricancha itself. This much is 
known from the accounts of several different chroniclers; but one of the 
most thorough and meticulous, Bernabé Cobo, tells us of the existence of 
no fewer than forty-one (or forty-two) such radial lines, and he records that 
they were known as ceques (or zeq’e). 

The spiritual order of the Inca empire was based around shrines called 
huacas (or wak’a), sacred places for the worship of gods, prayers, and sacri- 
fices. Huacas were often located at places that were in some way special or 
exceptional, such as caves, springs, mountain peaks, bends in rivers, or un- 
usual rocks or trees. Cobo recorded well over three hundred /uacas in the 
vicinity of Cusco, documenting each of them individually. Three hundred 
thirty-two of them were located on one of the ceques, with a number more 
that were not part of the system; none of the ceques contained fewer than 
three shrines, and a couple had as many as fifteen. The ceques, however, 
were more than just lines along which the sacred places lay. They were also 
linked in various ways to social relations and the division of labor. Accord- 
ing to Cobo again, each ceque was given over to one of the three main so- 
cial classes (those directly related, less directly related, or unrelated to the 
Inca ruler), and it was the responsibility of representatives of that social 
group to take care of its buacas and to carry out the appropriate ceremonial 
activities there. Protocols for assigning representatives of different family 
groups (ayllus) to communal work activities, such as the maintenance of ir- 
rigation canals, were also governed by the ceque system. In these and vari- 
ous other ways, the ceque system made many of the principles of Incaic so- 
cial and political organization tangible in the landscape. 


Cobo’s accounts seem to indicate that the ceques were conceived as

straight lines diverging radially from the Coricancha, the symbolic center of 
the world, and extending out into the cosmos. This way of organizing 
things spatially—lines radiating out from a center—seems to extend well 
back into pre-Inca times, evident, for example, in the lines on the desert at 
Nasca. It is also evident in the guipu—trecording devices consisting of knot- 
ted strings—which can be laid out in a radial fashion, and has even survived 
to the present day in the layout of some of the more remote and traditional 
Andean villages. 

It has been suggested that some of the Cusco ceques were astronomi- 
cally aligned. Cobo’s account of various buacas includes hilltops where mon- 
uments were placed that marked the sun’s arrival at significant dates, such 
as the times to sow crops. This leaves open the question of where the hilltop 
huacas were to be viewed from, but archaeoastronomical investigations sug- 
gest that in some cases, at least, the answer was “along the ceques.” A re- 
lated claim is that some of the ceques radiating out from the Coricancha hit 
the visible horizon at astronomically significant points such as the rising and 
setting of the sun at one of the solstices, something that is not surprising 
given that various chroniclers describe horizon observations of the sun from 


Cusco and describe pillars that were erected to mark these spots and to fa- 


cilitate the observations. However, the evidence for the solstitial ceques is far 
from conclusive. 

Anthropologist and historian Tom Zuidema has gone considerably fur- 
ther by suggesting that the ceque system was linked directly to an elaborate 
ritual calendar based neither upon solar observations nor upon lunar phase- 
cycle (synodic) months but upon sidereal months. A sidereal month, the time 
it takes for the moon to complete a circuit through the stars, is two days 
shorter than a synodic month, lasting 27.3 days. This may seem like a very 
esoteric concept, but it is a cycle that is particularly noticeable near the equa- 
tor (where the celestial bodies rise and set almost vertically) by observing 
what stars the moon (whatever its phase) appears on a level with, for exam- 
ple, as it rises. This is done, for instance, by the Borana in east Africa. 

Zuidema’s interpretation was triggered by the fact that the number of 
huacas recorded by Cobo in the vicinity of Cusco, which he took to be 328, 
is exactly equal to the number of days in twelve sidereal months. Each 
huaca, then, according to Zuidema, corresponded to a day in the calendar. 
This might well be dismissed as speculative nonsense, a mere numerical co- 
incidence, except that Cobo tells us that acts of worship (such as sacrifices) 
took place at the various shrines in a sequential order, proceeding from one 
to the next, working gradually round the Cusco horizon. What of the re- 
maining thirty-seven days in each seasonal year? These, according to 
Zuidema, represented the period of time when the fields lay fallow between 
last harvest and first planting. These were “dead days” when no ceremonies 
took place at any huaca, and corresponded to the time when the Pleiades 
were invisible, being too close to the sun. The various strands of evidence in 
support of Zuidema’s ritual calendar at Cusco are highly complex and hotly 
disputed, but the interpretation remains a highly intriguing one. 

It has become evident, however, that we would be unwise to interpret 
the ceques too literally as a set of dead straight lines radiating out into the 
landscape from the center of Cusco. During the 1990s, archaeologist Brian 
Bauer conducted a field project around Cusco aiming to identify the actual 
locations of as many as possible of the original buacas. His conclusion was 
that the ceques were not straight at all, but actually zigzagged through the 
landscape. The buacas, according to Bauer, were defined by the innate power 
of places themselves, and they were subsequently grouped into ceques. They 
were certainly not placed on preconceived lines. In other words, the buacas 
defined the ceques, not the other way round. 

It is possible, then, that some earlier work on ceque alignments has 
been misconceived. On the other hand, the non-straightness of the ceques 
does not detract from the fact that the whole landscape was evidently full of 
sacred and special places at which, for example, the sun was observed to rise 


or set on certain days of the year as seen from others. This is quite clear from 


the chroniclers’ accounts. We might conclude that Incaic perceptions of 
straightness do not accord with ours. But it may simply be that the ceques, 
although often straight over relatively small distances that could easily be 
sighted along, became more sinuous as they stretched out over the wider 
landscape. The ideal may not have been matched by the reality, but perhaps 
this was not a critical concern in practice. 

In sum, the ceque system was undoubtedly both a basic organizing 
principle of the Inca empire and a mechanism of political control. The ex- 
tent to which it was also a manifestation of calendrical principles and prac- 


tices is likely to be debated for a long time to come.

Chaco Canyon 

The sight of the Great Houses of Chaco Canyon—vast multistory con- 
structions containing scores, and in a few cases hundreds, of rooms built in 
a dry and inhospitable valley—is nothing short of extraordinary. These and 
other architectural edifices were built by the ancient Puebloan peoples who 
occupied the canyon and the surrounding area between about C.E. 950 and 
1125. The largest Great House, Pueblo Bonito, covers an area of 1.8 
hectares (4.5 acres) and contains seven hundred rooms arranged in an ir- 


regular semicircle round a central plaza. The building increases in height

from a single story by the plaza up to an incredible five stories next to the 
outer wall. In the plaza itself were numerous kivas—underground chambers 
built for religious ceremonies—of various sizes, including two “great kivas” 
around fifteen meters (fifty feet) across. 

The canyon has also been the focus for a variety of archaeoastronomi- 
cal theories that, as much as anything, illustrate the changing focus of the 
discipline since its early development in the 1970s to the present day. For ex- 
ample, a hot issue in the 1970s was whether a rock-art pictograph painted 
on one of the canyon walls depicted a particular supernova explosion in C.E. 
1054. Another discovery that attracted a great deal of popular attention was 
the “sun dagger”—an interplay of sunlight and shadow on two spiral pet- 
roglyphs high up on the isolated pinnacle of Fajada Butte at the eastern en- 
trance to the valley. Finally, there have been the inevitable studies of orien- 
tations and alignments, which in the early days followed a paradigm that 
had been established in the context of British stone monuments: this was to 
search for alignments upon a predefined set of astronomical targets consist- 
ing of the horizon rising and setting positions of the sun at the solstices and 
equinoxes and of the moon at the lunar “standstills.” 

These early approaches tended to be motivated more strongly by an in- 


terest in the nature of the astronomical practice itself than by an interest in 


the culture within which the practice operated. More recently, there has been 
a closer convergence between the questions asked by archaeoastronomers 
and the broader social issues of greater interest to archaeologists at large. 

Archaeologically, one of the most intriguing questions about Chaco is 
why social organization and architectural technology should have reached 
such impressive heights in such an improbable place, and how they were 
supported. It is clear that a huge and well-organized infrastructure was 
needed, for example, in transporting tens of thousands of large timber beams 
for the construction of floors and roofs over distances of a hundred kilome- 
ters (sixty miles) or more from the nearest forests. A key issue is the size of 
the resident population. It seems unthinkable that the scant food sources 
available could have supported a population that filled all the rooms of the 
Great Houses, and this, together with other factors such as the preponder- 
ance of kivas, invites the suggestion that the canyon was first and foremost 
a religious center, with a relatively modest number of permanent residents. 
If so, then it was likely controlled by an elite who exerted both ideological 
and political control. One suggestion is that pilgrims are likely to have con- 
verged here in considerable numbers at particular times, and that these times 
would have been astronomically determined. 

In recent years, convincing evidence has emerged that the houses, kivas, 
roads, stairways, and even middens around Chaco formed a carefully planned 
“ritual landscape” centered upon the Great Houses of the canyon itself. 
Within this scheme of things, it is perhaps not surprising that a number of 
buildings seem to have been deliberately oriented along one or the other of 
the cardinal directions, or else display a strong degree of symmetry about 
their north-south and/or east-west axes. Similar principles seem to have ex- 
tended to the layout of buildings within the landscape, with several of the 
principal ones lying on an east-west axis and a north-south axis, which cross 
in the valley. When these axes were first discovered, many dismissed them as 
fortuitous rather than deliberate, but this changed with the subsequent dis- 
covery of the (Great) North Road, which connects with the north-south axis 
and runs due north from Chaco for more than fifty kilometers. 

Astronomy, then, was part of the conceptual framework that lay be- 
hind the location and design of many of the principal Chaco constructions— 
at least on a basic level, since the north-south direction is ultimately defined 
in relation to the daily rotation of the celestial sphere about the celestial pole. 
This may not sound too exciting to a modern astronomer looking for astro- 
nomical “sophistication” (as defined in his or her own terms), but it is ex- 
tremely interesting from a cultural perspective, because it suggests a degree 
of continuity of worldview extending down to the present day. The princi- 
ples that defined the spatial layout of Chaco buildings and their landscape 


were apparently derived from a quadripartite cosmology—a perceived divi- 


sion of the world into four quarters around some central place. Such divi- 
sions have persisted as a characteristic feature of indigenous North Ameri- 
can worldviews up to modern times.

Chaco Meridian 


Chaco Canyon in New Mexico was at the heart of a bustling landscape. 
Not surprisingly for a major cultural center, trackways converged on it 
from the surrounding villages and settlements. However, some of these 
make little practical sense in terms of communication or the transportation 
of goods. Typically a few meters (fifteen-thirty feet) wide, these “roads” 
were created by digging out topsoil or clearing away surface rocks and were 
sometimes lined with stone or adobe kerbs. And they ran almost perfectly 
straight, sometimes for several kilometers, completely disregarding the to- 
pography. (In this sense they bear more than a passing resemblance to some 
of the Nasca lines in faraway Peru.) Sometimes they were multiple, with up 
to four roads running in parallel. When they approached the steep walls of 
the canyon itself, rather than deviating to find easier routes down into the 
valley, they descended directly via precarious steps carved into the living 
rock (supplemented where necessary by less durable devices such as ramps). 
At first, these roads were thought to connect the Great Houses of Chaco 
with outlying villages or sacred sites many tens of kilometers away, but 


many of the roads running out from the canyon (or from outlying sites and 


pointing back toward Chaco) stop short after a few kilometers—seemingly 
functioning as symbolic pointers only. 

One, which has become known as the (Great) North Road, is much 
longer and particularly remarkable. This nine-meter-wide road runs north- 
wards from Pueblo Alto, one of the earlier structures in the Chaco Canyon 
area (built about 1020 c.E. over a pre-existing Great House), continuing 
through the landscape for more than 55 kilometers (35 miles) before reach- 
ing another canyon (Kutz Canyon) at a site known as Twin Angels Pueblo. 
Allowing for a dog-leg westwards along the canyon floor, another stretch 
striking out northwards would have brought the North Road a total of 
eighty-five km (fifty-three miles) to Aztec, a major cultural center in the Four 
Corners area where construction began just as major construction activity 
ceased at Chaco: in the early twelfth century. 

The orientation of the North Road, and especially the main extant 
stretch from about three kilometers (two miles) north of Pueblo Alto north- 
ward to the southern rim of Kutz Canyon, is impressively close to the true 
north-south direction—the meridian. The southernmost third of this fifty- 
kilometer (thirty-mile) section heads only half a degree west of north, where- 
upon it turns slightly and heads two degrees east of north for the remainder. 
The whole of this stretch of road therefore remains within a conceptual 
north-south corridor little more than one kilometer wide. What determined 
its orientation? Did it simply join together two already existing places? The 
chronological evidence seems to rule out this idea. Instead, the construction 
of the road seems to have coincided broadly with the time when construc- 
tion activity was just commencing at Aztec (and Chaco was on the point of 
falling into sudden decline). 

Is the alternative possible, then, that the orientation defined the loca- 
tion of Aztec? If so, we must first ask the question of whether the cardinal 
orientation of the road was deliberate. The layout and design of the struc- 
tures in Chaco Canyon itself strongly suggest that the answer is yes: many of 
the Great Houses and kivas in the canyon, such as Casa Rinconada, were 
built on a cardinal orientation, and some of the principal ones were them- 
selves placed on cardinal axes within the landscape. Yet the orientation of 
the road was not so precise that one has to postulate the use of anything but 
basic surveying techniques. More impressive is the principle—the strength of 
belief that determined not only that a number of minor pueblos should be 
situated along the road, but that a major new center should be constructed 
on this very axis, connected, as it were, back to the source. This principle is 
also demonstrated elsewhere in the landscape around Chaco, where several 
roads (conceptually, if not actually) connect later buildings to earlier ones. 
(Examples also occur elsewhere in the world. One is the Neolithic stone cir- 


cle and henge at Avebury in England, where a stone avenue [the Kennet Av- 


enue] ran for over two kilometers [1.5 miles], connecting the great henge to 
a centuries-older multiple-timber circle known as the Sanctuary). 

Why was the north-south direction important? The answer suggested 
by the evidence from the layout of Chaco itself is that it was cosmologically 
significant—it was part of structuring the landscape according to the pre- 
vailing worldview. And the motivation for doing this, to judge from count- 
less similar practices the world over, was to keep human action fundamen- 
tally in harmony with the cosmos and hence to ensure well-being and 
stability. 

In the late 1990s, archaeologist Steve Lekson proposed a radical new 
theory, suggesting that the North Road was only part of a far longer con- 
struction that he terms the “Chaco Meridian.” Its southern extension, he 
suggested, stretched southwards from Chaco Canyon for a staggering 630 
kilometers (390 miles) into modern Mexico, to the most important regional 
center in the period c.£. 1250-1450: the city of Paquime. Lekson’s argument 
proceeds as follows. The fact that the three major regional centers of Aztec, 
Chaco (that is, its principal north-south axis through Pueblo Alto), and 
Paquime lie exactly on a north-south line (to within four kilometers from 
east to west) seems an extraordinary coincidence, if coincidence it is. Now 
consider their chronology: building at Chaco took place during the period c. 
950-1125; Aztec c. 1100-1275; and Paquime c. 1250-1450. As soon as one 
city was abandoned, it seems, another rose up in its place. The implications 
are clear. For some reason—perhaps an environmental disaster triggered by 
overexploitation of local resources—the controlling elite were forced to 
abandon Chaco in the early twelfth century. When this happened, having 
staked out a north-south line on which their new center had to lie and iden- 
tified a suitable spot on that line, they subsequently relocated there. In the 
late thirteenth century there was an extended drought in the Four Corners 
area, and that the whole vicinity suffered extensive depopulation. So the elite 
moved again, but this time they followed the Meridian southwards—a long 
way south, 

These ideas are challenging and controversial, but their social and cog- 
nitive ramifications are profound, in that they challenge two long-held no- 
tions concerning what is now the Southwest between C.E. 900 and 1450. The 
first is that the peoples of the Southwest were organized into a variety of po- 
litical units essentially operating on a local scale, though communicating via 
networks of trade and exchange. But the sheer scale of the Chaco Meridian, 
and the idea that the controlling elite could have uprooted themselves so far 
north and then, a few generations later, several times as far in the opposite 
direction, seems to contradict this idea. Instead, it is possible that a vast re- 
gion stretching from the Four Corners area to northern Mexico could have 


been economically and politically integrated, and furthermore, that this sit- 


uation might have prevailed for a considerable time. 

The second controversial notion is that social and economic change 
was driven purely by environmental factors. Not that there is any reason to 
doubt the conventional view that the two abandonments were driven by en- 
vironmental catastrophes (although a number of questions surround the 
first, in particular). The point is that the locations of the new, alternative 
cities—first Aztec and then Paquime—were primarily determined by con- 
straints existing within people’s own minds. The manner in which worldview 
influences action in numerous other human cultures suggests the following 
explanation. Chaco was conceived as the very center of the cosmos. That 
center could not be shifted arbitrarily, since this would introduce further dis- 
order into the world. Only by extending the world axis north and south 
could a new center, appropriately connected back to the old one and to the 
existing order, be established and thus continuity—and survival—be assured. 

Whatever new evidence is brought to bear upon the Chaco Meridian in 
the future, Lekson’s theory serves as a fine illustration of a much broader 
general principle: human action in the past was typically determined by a 
mix of factors, some of which seem to us wholly pragmatic and others purely 
conceptual. In the context of another worldview, what is “in the mind” and 
what we would view as “objectively real” influences in the external world 
are not separated but woven together.

Chaco Supernova Pictograph 

The walker exploring the trail northwestward up Chaco Canyon toward 
the ruins of Pefiasco Blanco—one of several Great Houses built in the 
canyon by Anasazi peoples in the tenth and eleventh centuries—passes a 
number of notable rock-art panels, but one in particular is remarkable in its 
simplicity and power. At one point, high up the vertical sandstone cliff that 
forms the side of the canyon, some 6 meters (20 feet) off the ground, is a 
narrow overhang. And painted on the bottom of this are three straightfor- 
ward designs: a (life-sized) hand, a ten-pointed star, and a crescent—surely 


a depiction of the crescent moon. 


The “supernova” petroglyph at Chaco Canyon, viewed from below. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


This site has achieved particular notoriety because it has been claimed 
to be a representation of a supernova—an exploding star, previously invis- 
ible to the naked eye, that suddenly grows spectacularly in brightness. The 
supernova in question is one that astronomers know to have occurred in 
c.E. 1054 and which was certainly recorded by the ancient Chinese. It is of- 
ten referred to nowadays as the Crab supernova, because the aftermath of 
the explosion is visible to astronomers today as a cloud of gas in the con- 
stellation of Taurus known as the Crab Nebula. For a few weeks the new 
star was significantly brighter even than the planet Venus and visible in 
broad daylight. 

Anyone who has seen Venus and the crescent moon close together, 
hanging low in a clear blue and otherwise empty twilight sky, will know just 
what a conspicuous sight this is. In 1054, though—in the early morning of 
July 5 (in today’s Gregorian calendar)—an even more extraordinary sight 
would have greeted anyone sheltering by the cliff looking eastwards into the 
predawn sky. On this morning, the crescent moon would have appeared 
right next to the supernova, and the suggestion is that this is precisely what 
the Chaco pictograph represents. (It is a pictograph rather than a petroglyph 
because it is painted onto, rather than carved out of, the rock.) 

A number of factors seem to support this argument. First, the date fits 


with the archaeological evidence of when Anasazi activity reached such ex- 


hetroolyhh on the bottom of a rock overhbane. (Courtesy of Clive Rugeoles)

The situation of the “subernova 


traordinary heights in this apparently inhospitable valley, with the construc- 
tion of numerous Great Houses and kivas. Second, the juxtaposition of the 
crescent moon and star in the pictograph fits the actual configuration visible 
in the sky on that July morning in 1054. Third, several other rock-art sites 
in the western United States have been interpreted as depictions of the same 
event. And finally, there is independent evidence of the ancient Chacoans’ in- 
terest in astronomy, manifested most famously in the interplay of sunlight 
and shadow on the “sun dagger” petroglyph on Fajada Butte at the eastern 
entrance to the canyon. 

Nonetheless, even if we accept that the crescent is an unmistakable rep- 
resentation of the crescent moon, is the star necessarily the Crab supernova? 
The answer, of course, is no. The “star and crescent” is one of the most per- 
vasive astronomical symbols among humankind, particularly in the Islamic 
world. It is usually taken to represent the crescent moon and Venus, which— 
aside from transient phenomena such as supernovae—is the brightest object 
in the sky apart from the sun and moon. Eye-catching conjunctions of the 
crescent moon and Venus occur at quite frequent intervals (several times dur- 
ing each eight-year period that it takes Venus to return to essentially the 
same place relative to the sun and stars). Could the juxtaposed star and cres- 
cent symbols in the Chaco pictograph simply be depicting one of these con- 
junctions of the crescent moon and Venus? They clearly could: just because 
one rather attractive and exciting interpretation seems to fit the evidence, we 
cannot accept this as incontrovertible proof if there remains at least one 
equally plausible, though slightly more mundane, alternative. 

Another uncomfortable question is: what is the hand doing there? It 
has been argued that it is merely a symbol showing that the place is sacred, 
but its presence might also suggest the uncomfortable possibility that these 
three icons belonged together as a triplet, conveying symbolic meanings 
perhaps, rather than (two of them but not the other) representing some- 
thing “literal” in the sky. 

What characterizes all these arguments is that they are based on specu- 
lations that pay no attention to the cultural context. In fact, all of them are 
rendered futile by an observation made by a Zuni ethnographer almost as 
soon as the supernova interpretation was originally proposed, back in 1975. 
The modern Zuni have sun-watching stations for calendrical observations, 
and traditionally mark them using a pictograph with four elements: a cres- 
cent, a hand, a star, and a sundisk. Although more worn and less visible, 
there is indeed a sundisk accompanying the other symbols on the overhang. 
This, surely, was a sun-watching station: astronomical certainly, but with 
nothing at all to do with the Crab supernova.

Chinese Astronomy 

The political history of ancient China was no less turbulent than that of 
many other parts of the world. From about 4000 B.c.£. onwards it devel- 
oped from a multitude of farming villages into warring local chiefdoms, and 
these gradually confederated into larger competing states ruled by powerful 
dynasties. The best known of these are the Shang and Zhou, which succes- 
sively controlled ever greater swathes of eastern China during the second 
and first millennia B.c.E. Yet despite all this social turmoil, a characteristic 
cultural tradition emerged that is instantly recognizable in arts, crafts, and 
architecture. One reason is that it arose in geographical isolation from other 
developing cultures farther west. In 221 B.c.E., China was unified, thus 
forming one of the world’s greatest empires. Further great dynasties, such 
as the Han, T’ang, Song, Yuan (when China was under Mongul control), 
Ming, and finally the Qing, endured until the Chinese revolution of C.E. 
1911. Imperial China is characterized at various stages by impressive and 
highly distinctive developments in scholarship, literature, and art. 

Many aspects of Chinese astronomy, from ancient times to the later im- 
perial dynasties, are equally distinctive. Some of the earliest Chinese records 
of astronomical events, for example, are found on divinatory devices known 
as oracle bones that date to the Shang and Zhou dynasties. These were ani- 
mal bones or turtle shells heated with a hot needle until cracks appeared in 
their surface. The shape of the cracks provided prognostications used by 
kings to assist in affairs of state. Fortunately for modern scholars, the prog- 
nostication was recorded on the bone itself, together with the eventual out- 
come (tending to confirm that the prognostication was correct). Some oracle

Clive Ruggles) 


bones relate to astronomical events, including both solar and lunar eclipses, 
and form the earliest Chinese records of such phenomena. 

In the ensuing centuries and millennia of China’s imperial era, the 
recording of occurrences in the skies became systematized. Yet in China, un- 
like (for example) in ancient Babylonia, a clear distinction was maintained 
between what we might see as scientific (astronomical) and divinatory (as- 
trological) traditions. The first was predicated on the regularity of calendri- 
cal cycles, which could be established through careful observation and 
recording and then reliably predicted. The latter concerned unpredictable 
phenomena, which had divinatory significance: these were omens to be 
noted and acted upon. There were even separate practitioners: experts in cal- 
endrical methods and experts in celestial patterns (whom we might choose 
to categorize as astrologers). Both were highly valued state employees. The 
goal of the state astronomers, and their principal raison d’étre, was to pro- 
duce ever more detailed and accurate almanacs that would reinforce (percep- 
tions of) the emperor’s control of order in the cosmos. The purpose of the as- 
trologers, on the other hand, was to warn the emperor of portents in the skies 
and aid him in making crucial decisions. Rulers felt they had a mandate from 
heaven, but if they ignored signs of approval or disapproval and failed to act 
accordingly, consequences could be dire. The two sets of records—calendrical 
and astrological—combine to bequeath us an unparalleled data set of obser- 
vations of astronomical events, both regular and recurrent (such as planetary 
motions) and transient (one-off), such as the appearance of comets, novae, 
meteor showers, aurorae, sunspots, and of course eclipses. 

Occasionally, a form of celestial phenomenon would pass from the do- 
main of divination to that of calendrics when its underlying regularity was 
discovered. The classic example of this in the Chinese case is that of lunar 
eclipses. Around the year 0, the Chinese discovered a cycle of ten years and 
334 days (135 lunations), which, like the longer Saros cycle discovered by 
the Babylonians, defines a period after which a lunar eclipse will tend to re- 
cur. With this discovery lunar eclipses essentially became predictable, and 
while they continued to be recorded, they ceased from this point to have any 
significance as omens. 

A landmark in ancient Chinese astronomy was the development of a 
distinctive reference system that enabled specialists to map stars, to note the 
positions of the sun, moon, planets, or transient phenomena, and to reckon 
time at night. This was the system of twenty-eight xiu or lunar lodges. 
These are best conceptualized as twenty-eight regions into which the sky 
was divided like the segments of an orange and which were identified by 
convenient stars and asterisms situated within them. If the xiv had been of 
equal width, the moon would have moved from one to the next in each 


twenty-four-hour period. However, the widths varied considerably, and the

ing the twenty-eight lunar mansions. (Instructional Resources Corporation) 


moon could spend two or three nights in a very wide xiu, but only a few 
hours in a narrow one. 

In Imperial China, astronomy was inextricably linked to the supreme 
power of the emperor, who was seen as uniquely able to harness the sacred 
forces of the heavens and preserve the balance and harmony of the cosmos in 
the service of the people. This power was reflected (and the emperor’s right 
to rule thereby reinforced) both in the spatial layout of the palace and in the 
timing of appropriate rituals. From the Ming dynasty (fourteenth century) 
onwards, the imperial palace—otherwise known as the Forbidden City—was 
in the heart of Beijing and was approached along the meridian, directly to- 
ward the north celestial pole, which was seen as the very heart of the heav- 
ens. The Emperor moved around the sacred capital on prescribed paths at dif- 
ferent seasons, leaving the palace so as to undertake rituals at various nearby 
shrines at the appropriate times. Two of the most important ceremonies took 
place at the solstices, when the emperor was required to actively assist in the 
transitions between the seasons. At winter solstice, he ascended the Round 
Mound, the highest part of the Temple of Heaven complex to the south of the 
Forbidden City, climbing up from the south and publicly paying homage by 


himself facing the center of the heavens in the north. At other times, subjects 
permitted to visit the emperor in the Forbidden City were required, similarly, 
to approach his throne—the center of the earthly realm—from due south. 

Chinese astronomers established an impressive record in the develop- 
ment and construction of astronomical instruments. One of the most re- 
markable is a giant gnomon, in the form of a brick tower, built by the as- 
tronomer Guo Shou Jing in c.z. 1276. This enabled Guo to establish the 
length of the tropical (seasonal) year with an error of only twenty-six seconds. 
A collection of large Bronze instruments that were used for mapping and 
timekeeping can now be found on the roof of the Old Observatory in Beijing. 

However, it is as well to remember the context in which these achieve- 
ments took place. There was certainly a demand for ever greater astronom- 
ical and calendrical precision, but it resulted ultimately from the perceived 
need for the emperor to maintain cosmic harmony. In other words, the rea- 
sons astronomy was maintained at such a high level for so long in Imperial 
China were ultimately ideological and political rather than purely scientific, 
at least as we would see it.

Christianization of “Pagan” Festivals 

Wherever a ruling elite seeks to impose or stimulate a change in the domi- 
nant religious beliefs of the populace, as when controlling a new population 
following a victory in war, they may tear down old places of worship and 
build different ones on the same sites, replace existing sacred myths and sto- 
ries with ones that reflect the new ideology, and introduce novel rites and 
ceremonies in the hope of eliminating the existing ones. This is as true of 
the spread of Christianity as of any other religion. Throughout history, 
new Christian churches have been placed on the sites of “pagan” temples. 
This process is particularly evident in the Republic of Georgia, where the 
conversion to Christianity occurred as early as the fourth century C.E., and 
archaeologists excavating under early churches are wont to discover pre- 
Christian temples built several centuries earlier. Where indigenous reli- 
gious festivals were timed in relation to the calendar, or tied to particular 
astronomical observations, it made sense to schedule the new Christian 
festivals to coincide with them, thereby upstaging them. A well-known ex- 
ample of this is the timing of Christmas to coincide with pre-existing win- 
ter solstice festivals; likewise, the feast of St. John is scheduled close to the 
summer solstice. 

The result was the transformation of pagan festivals into Christian 
ones, but the original meaning was not always lost. In Mexico, for example, 
the feast day of St. Michael, as observed in the village of San Miguel del Mi- 
lagro in the state of Tlaxcala, preserves some aspects of ancient observances 
relating to mountain and fertility gods. 

It has been supposed that the timing of certain Christian feasts on mid- 
quarter days reflects the Christianization within Europe of earlier Celtic fes- 
tivals dividing the year into eight equal parts. The best known of these is the 
feast of All Saints, which takes place on November 1, on the traditional date 
attributed to the Celtic festival of Samhain. The notion of a Celtic calendar 
that was widespread through western Europe in the Iron Age and provided 
an accurate division of the year into eight equal parts is problematic. Yet 
there is no doubt that a significant pagan “start of winter” festival somehow 
became transformed into a Christian festival. Its main association now, in 
many parts of the world, is with the dead, but this probably came later.

Church Orientations 

Christian churches generally point eastwards. Liturgical traditions dating 
from medieval times associate the direction east—the rising place of the 
heavenly bodies and particularly of the sun—with the resurrection of Christ 
and the dawning of the “day of eternity” for righteous souls. Worshipers 
therefore face, symbolically, their eventual home in paradise. 

“East,” however, evidently did not necessarily mean “due east.” The 
orientations of many churches actually deviate from true east by consider- 
able amounts. In modern times church builders were often constrained by 
the space available within densely populated towns and cities, so this is 
scarcely surprising, but in earlier centuries and in rural settings such limita- 
tions seldom existed. Given the care and attention that were afforded to 
many other aspects of a church’s construction, it seems inconceivable that 
their orientations were merely poor attempts at facing due east. The ques- 
tion, then, is how the direction in which a given church should face was de- 
termined in practice. What motives and procedures led to the resulting ori- 
entations is seldom clear from surviving historical accounts or liturgical 
texts, and the question has fascinated a number of scholars in recent years. 

There have been various suggestions, the main ones of which nearly all 
relate in some way to the rising sun. One is that churches simply needed to 
face within the eastern quarter of the horizon; the details were not impor- 
tant. A second is that they needed to face within the solar arc—toward a 
point on the horizon where the sun would rise at some time in the year—but 
again, the actual position within this range was not important. A third sug- 
gestion is that they faced the rising sun on the day when the foundations 
were set out. A fourth: they faced sunrise on the feast day of the saint to 
whom the church was dedicated. A fifth: they faced sunrise on the equinox. 
And a sixth possibility: they faced sunrise at Easter. The list is not exhaus- 
tive, and it is not at all improbable that different traditions and practices held 
sway in different places and at different times. 

Occasionally, we have historical evidence of a particular practice. For 
instance, there is clear support for the third suggestion in seventeenth and 
eighteenth century England. Historian Sir Henry Chauncy, in a book de- 
scribing the historical antiquities of Hertfordshire written at the end of the 
seventeenth century, reported a common practice of aligning the foundations 
in the direction of sunrise. Over a century later, the poet William 


Wordsworth graphically described a similar practice far away in the county 


of Westmoreland. Those who were charged with building Rydal Chapel kept 
vigil through a whole night, waiting for the sun to appear, at which time they 
carefully laid out the foundation stones and thus ensured that the building— 
and especially the high altar—would be correctly placed. The night con- 
cerned was not chosen arbitrarily: it was the night preceding the feast day of 
the church’s patron saint. 

Nevertheless, it is possible that Chauncy, Wordsworth, and others were 
merely expressing a romanticized notion rather than hard evidence. For that, 
we need to measure the orientations of particular churches and compare 
them with sunrise on the day when construction began, or with sunrise on 
the patronal feast day. Sadly, the date when construction started was rarely 
recorded; what mattered was the date of consecration of the completed 
church. Identifying the patronal feast day can also give us problems, since we 
do not always know the saint to whom the church was originally dedicated. 
Even where the church is still in use, the modern patron may not be the same 
as the original one. 

In most cases, the only evidence remaining is from the orientations of 
the churches themselves. Here we must be careful, since so many churches 
have been partially rebuilt, extended, or altered since their original con- 
struction. It is certainly necessary to pay strict attention to historical records 
of construction phases where they are available. How can the orientations 
themselves help us choose between the six possibilities already mentioned? 
The answer is that if we observe a large enough group of churches con- 
forming to a common practice, then the resulting spreads of orientations 
should be distinctively different. At all but the most northerly latitudes 
(above about 55°N), general orientation within the solar arc would result in 
a narrower range of orientations than general orientation within the eastern 
quarter, but both practices would simply result in a fairly even spread of ori- 
entations within this range, perhaps concentrated toward the middle. Orien- 
tation on sunrise on the day of laying the foundations would also result in a 
spread of orientations throughout the solar arc, but concentrated toward the 
ends if the foundation dates were spread evenly through the year. This is be- 
cause the change in the sun’s rising position from day to day is much smaller 
close to the solstices. 

In order to investigate the remaining possibilities, we must determine 
more precisely the dates on which the sun rose at a particular spot on the 
horizon. For this, it is necessary to take into account the altitude of the hori- 
zon and to convert azimuths (orientations) into declinations. Orientation of 
sunrise on saints’ days would result in sharp spikes corresponding to sun- 
rise on a few specific dates in the year. (Here we encounter another com- 
plication: the dates in many cases would have been determined according to 


the Julian calendar rather than the modern Gregorian calendar.) Orienta- 


tion on equinoctial sunrise should result in a single, reasonably sharp con- 
centration of declinations, but quite possibly significantly offset from the 
true (astronomical) equinox, both because of the use of the Julian calendar 
and depending upon how the equinox was determined in practice. Easter 
sunrise orientation, finally, would result in a wider spread of orientations, 
yet much narrower than the whole solar range, since it would correspond 
to sunrise over the four- or five-week period following the vernal equinox 
(again, reckoned in the Julian calendar for earlier churches) where Easter 
could fall. 

In recent years, some studies of the orientation of churches of various 
ages in eastern Europe, Austria, Italy, and Great Britain have supported the 
idea of orientation upon sunrise on patron saints’ feast days. There is also 
evidence of solstitial and equinoctial orientation among thirteenth- and 
fourteenth-century churches in Hungary and elsewhere. The significance of 
these dates in medieval times is unquestionable: as early as the fourth cen- 
tury, feasts marking the births of Christ and John the Baptist had been es- 
tablished at the two solstices, together with feasts marking their respective 
conceptions (the Feast of the Annunciation and the Feast of the Visitation) 
at the two equinoxes. Other surveys, however, have concluded that pa- 
tronal orientations never even existed. It seems that problems of data selec- 
tion, together with a lack of rigorous statistics, may lie at the heart of these 
inconsistencies. 

A recent systematic study of the orientations of medieval village 
churches in central England, by the American archaeoastronomer Stephen 
McCluskey, has revealed a complex picture that does not fit cleanly any of 
the six models. McCluskey restricted his sample to around a hundred 
churches that were dedicated to four particular patrons: Mary, John the 
Baptist, All Saints, and Andrew. The related feast days would be the spring 
equinox, the summer solstice, November 1, and November 30. While the 
orientations of the churches all fit comfortably within the solar arc—facing 
the direction of sunrise at some time in the year—they did not correlate 
with the four relevant saints’ days. Instead, the spread of orientations cor- 
responded broadly to the date range from mid-February to mid-April (or in 
the late summer and autumn, the period from early August to early Octo- 
ber) in the Julian calendar. This spread is too narrow to fit the “any time of 
year” model, yet too wide to fit the “Easter” model. There is no obvious, 
simple explanation, and it seems likely that a number of different traditions 
and practices were operating, even within this confined group of churches. 
However, certain preferences do stand out. For example, All Saints 
churches were preferentially oriented upon sunrise on the (Julian) spring 
equinox, something that may be explained in liturgical texts connecting the 


day of eternity—“god’s eighth day”—-with (strictly?) eastward orientation, 


and with all the saints. Another, unexpected, trend is that the naves of 
churches of St. John the Baptist tend to point westward toward sunset on 
the feast of the conception of this saint on the autumnal equinox. Was this 
their defining characteristic? 

Despite the patchiness and evident complexity of the data, there seems 
little doubt that astronomical observations, and particularly observations of 
the rising sun, were commonly used to determine the orientations of me- 
dieval churches all over Europe. Such practices may have continued well into 
early modern times, especially in rural areas. The investigations of such is- 
sues to date have only touched the tip of the iceberg: the evidence is exten- 


sive and remains largely unexplored.

Circles of Earth, Timber, and Stone 

The practice of building circular, or at least roughly circular, enclosures and 
monuments was widespread in Europe in the Neolithic and Bronze Age. In 
Britain, for example, some of the earliest farming communities in the fourth 


millennium B.c.£. built earthworks known as causewayed enclosures. These

summer sunrise. The positions of the original timber posts are marked by concrete pillars. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


are mostly fairly circular, although some are highly irregular, and most of 
the examples are in southern England. They seem to have had a range of 
purposes, but they were almost certainly places where people from small 
surrounding communities came together. Later in the Neolithic, more regu- 
lar circular earthworks known as henges started to appear, as did circles of 
upright timbers and circles of standing stones. Henges are generally more 
regular (better approximations of true circles) than causewayed enclosures. 
They consist of a ditch and exterior bank, usually with one or two en- 
trances, and vary in size from a few meters across to the large henge enclo- 
sures or superbenges such as Avebury in Wiltshire, southern England. The 
large henge at Avebury is some 350 meters (1,150 feet) across, had a ditch 
some nine meters (thirty feet) deep and a bank eight meters (twenty-five 
feet) high, and surrounds an entire village. (Ironically, the name henge was 
coined for a type of monument that was like Stonehenge but without the 
stones; the name Stonehenge means “hanging stones” in Old English. The 
irony is that, by the generally accepted definition we have just given, Stone- 
henge is not actually a henge; its earthen enclosure has the bank on the in- 
terior of the ditch.) 

In trying to understand the purpose and meaning of this type of monu- 
ment, it is less helpful than was once thought to classify them primarily by the 


type of materials used, that is, as earthen circles, timber circles, or stone cir- 
cles. This is because these do not form three separate categories—far from it. 
Excavations suggest that many circles of uprights were probably sculpted first 
in wood and then repeated in stone, a good example being Temple Wood in 
Argyll, western Scotland. Many henges containing stone circles have survived 
into modern times (e.g., the Ring of Brodgar and Avebury), although the se- 
quence of chronological development is seldom clear without excavation. 
Others contained timber circles, and Woodhenge, situated some three kilo- 
meters (two miles) east-northeast of Stonehenge, contained no fewer than six 
concentric ellipses (some have suggested that they represent the postholes of 
a roofed building, but this has been the subject of intensive debate). Finally, 
Stonehenge itself represents an earthen circle with an interior ring of timber 
uprights, later superseded by the famous constructions in stone. 

Stone circles (whether built as such or as elements of more complex 
sites) survive relatively well and the remains of many of them are still con- 
spicuous in today’s landscape. Timber uprights, on the other hand, have long 
since rotted away, perhaps leaving postholes that might one day be discov- 
ered by excavation. Many earthen ditches have long since filled in and banks 
been ploughed away, only to be revealed, where we are lucky, in cropmarks 
visible from aerial photographs. It is a reasonable supposition that the num- 
ber of timber and earth circles built in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain was 
at least comparable with, and possibly considerably greater than, the num- 
ber of stone circles. 

Why build a circle? On the face of it, a circle is the simplest way to 
mark off an area of sacred space, but there may be a great deal more to it 
than that. Important cognitive principles surely lay behind such monuments 
and helped determine how they were integrated into the landscape. The later 
prehistoric circles of earth, timber, and stone were surely places where peo- 
ple gathered, very likely for formal or ritualistic activities or observances. 
Perhaps, in some cases, only a privileged few were allowed to take part. The 
presence of apparently formal approaches to some sites, such as the earthen 
avenue that leads into Stonehenge and the stone avenues leading into Ave- 
bury, suggests that the experiences of the participants were carefully orches- 
trated. The permeability of the boundary is clearly important: there would 
have been a world of difference between undertaking a private observance 
inside a large henge with a high outer bank, cut off from the wider world 
and hidden from outside view, and giving an open performance inside a 
stone circle, feeling fully a part of that wider world. The British archaeolo- 
gist Richard Bradley has identified a number of examples where circles seem 
to have been “closed off” over time, perhaps as part of a wider process of 
making both the places themselves and what went on there less generally ac- 


cessible, more limited to a privileged few. 


One possibility, for which there are plenty of historical and ethno- 
graphic parallels, is that many of these circles might have been conceived as 
central places, conceptual centers of the world. It is even possible that the cir- 
cular shape might have been intended, at least initially, to be a reflection of 
the visible horizon, and that some circles might have been perceived as a mi- 
crocosm encapsulating and reflecting the properties of the wider cosmos in 
various ways. Following this idea, a number of British archaeologists have 
explored various ways in which the properties of the surrounding world 
might have been reflected at these sites. The possibilities include the shape of 
a ring reflecting the surrounding topography, the shapes of stones in stone 
circles reflecting the shapes of hills behind them, and alignments (e.g., of en- 
trances) toward sources of water. Unfortunately there are so many possibil- 
ities that it is difficult not to be entirely subjective. 

Nonetheless, it is by this route that the alignment studies undertaken by 
archaeoastronomers for many years have begun to dovetail within the 
agenda of archaeologists interested in wider issues of cognition and cosmol- 
ogy. For astronomers, it is stone circles that have attracted most attention, 
since they leave readily surveyable remains above the ground and (subject to 
vegetation cover) alignments that can still be directly viewed. Nonetheless, 
some important astronomical features of timber circles have been noted, 
such as the orientation of Woodhenge, which, in common with Stonehenge 
itself and another henge in the general vicinity, Coneybury (which has now 
been obliterated), faces northeastwards toward midsummer sunrise.

Circumpolar Stars 
If you are in the northern hemisphere, then some stars that are close to the 


north celestial pole will never rise or set but simply circle around the pole 


once a day. These are known as circumpolar stars. Roughly speaking, these 
will be the stars whose declination, when added to your latitude on the 
earth, comes to more than 90°. For example, at latitude 40°N, all those 
stars with a declination greater than about 50° will circle around in the sky. 
The exact figure will depend upon the altitude of your northern horizon. 

The same is true if you are in the southern hemisphere, except that the 
south celestial pole is now the relevant one, and the declination of the star 
(negative) plus your latitude (also counted as negative for the purpose) must 
now add up to less than —90°. In other words, at latitude 30°S, the circum- 
polar stars will be those with a declination less than about -60°.

Clava Cairns 

Neolithic passage tombs, of which the most famous and impressive exam- 
ples include Newgrange in Ireland and Maes Howe in the Scottish Orkney 
Islands, are found extensively in Ireland and also in significant numbers in 
the more northerly parts of Scotland. In a cluster around the northern Scot- 
tish city of Inverness are found a few more modest examples of the genre, 
which dating evidence suggests were constructed at a relatively late date— 
around the year 2000 B.c.E. The so-called Clava cairns derive their name 
from a concentration of seven such monuments at Balnuaran of Clava, on 
the southern banks of the river Nairn some eight kilometers (five miles) east 
of Inverness. They comprise two types: the passage tombs (or passage 
graves) themselves and ring cairns, cairns surrounded by a circular raised 
bank but without a passage. Circles of standing stones surround several ex- 
amples of both types. 

Orientation was clearly an important consideration when a Clava cairn 
was being constructed. The orientations of the passages, where they exist, 
fall without exception within a quarter of the compass between west-south- 
west and south-southeast. The encompassing stone circles tend to have their 
stones graded in height with the tallest in the southwest. The southwesterly 
preference in the orientations of these monuments appears to follow a dom- 
inant tradition very similar to the one that controlled the broadly contem- 
porary recumbent stone circles found farther to the south and east. 

The most evident concentration of cairns at Balnuaran of Clava com- 
prises two passage tombs and a single ring cairn, all surrounded by stone cir- 


cles. The two passage tombs are arranged so that their passages are directly 


in line with each other. The ring cairn, although placed between them, is 
slightly off to one side and does not obscure the alignment. Alexander Thom 
visited the site as part of his extensive campaign in the 1950s and 1960s to 
survey many hundreds of Scottish megalithic monuments. He noted that the 
two passages were not only directly in line with each other, but also closely 
aligned upon midwinter sunset. Twenty years later the archaeologist Aubrey 
Burl completed a study of the Clava cairn orientations and concluded that, 
while the solstitial alignment was not generally repeated at other sites, the 
whole group had a consistent, broader pattern of orientation related to the 
moon. The simplest interpretation is that it related to the midsummer full 
moon. In this respect, again, the Clava cairns seemed to have much in com- 
mon with the nearby recumbent stone circles. As it happens, the direction of 
midwinter sunset falls within the broader lunar range, and the obvious con- 
clusion from considering the monuments systematically as a group was that 
their significance was in fact lunar, with the specifically solar alignment at 
Balnuaran of Clava itself being a fortuitous occurrence within this range. 
The Clava cairns stood for almost twenty years as a clear example of how 
studying a group of monuments as a whole can modify, and constrain, “one- 
off” interpretations of individual sites. 

All this changed in the late 1990s when another British archaeologist, 
Richard Bradley, commenced excavations at Balnuaran of Clava. One of his 
principal conclusions was that structural risks had been taken in order to 
conform to prevailing norms that (to our view) have no practical value—in- 
deed, that seem to run counter to common sense. These included grading 
the heights not only of the surrounding stone circle but of the kerbstones 
and other stones within the cairn that governed its structural integrity: the 
tallest were placed on the southwestern side, something that made the over- 
lying cairn structure inherently rather unstable. This confirms the impor- 
tance of orientation but also hints at a much richer set of prevailing sym- 
bolic or aesthetic principles that governed the construction of these 
monuments. 

Another extraordinary fact revealed by the excavations was that the 
various stones used in the construction of the cairns were often not, struc- 
turally speaking, best suited for the job. The choice of stone often seems to 
have had more to do with color than with (what we would see as) practical 
necessities such as size, shape, or strength. Most intriguing of all, stones of 
certain colors predominated in different parts of the cairns—with, broadly 
speaking, a preference for white stones facing sunrise in the east but red 
stones facing sunset in the west. Changes in color seem to have been related 
to the directions of solstitial sunrise and sunset. It is here that Bradley’s dis- 
coveries provide a direct challenge to the lunar conclusion: they suggest that 


the predominant symbolism at the site was solar. This, combined with the 


very fact that the solar alignment is so precise—the setting midwinter sun 
shone down the full length of the passage—argue strongly that the solar 
symbolism, and particularly the solstitial alignment, were deliberate. 

The wider issue that this conclusion raises is methodological. Every 
aligned structure must point somewhere, and we must seek corroborating 
evidence if we wish to increase our degree of belief that any particular align- 
ment upon a specific astronomical target was actually intentional or, at the 
least, came to mean something to certain people in the past. There are two 
main ways to do this. The first is to investigate whether the alignment is re- 
peated at similar monuments in the locality. The second is to seek a broader 
range of contextual evidence relating to the case in question: evidence that 
could inform us about the broader symbolic principles prevailing in that par- 
ticular instance. The example of Balnuaran of Clava shows the potential of 
both methods, but also shows that they can be in direct conflict, and raises 
the question of how we can best achieve a reconciliation in such circum- 
stances. One solution may be to postulate that this site, evidently the most 
complex and sophisticated in the Clava cairn tradition, incorporated a layer 
of symbolism relating to the sun that was additional to the more common- 
place, and more basic, relationship to the moon.

Cobo, Bernabé (1582-1657) 


Our knowledge of the Inca empire as it was shortly after the time of first 


contact with the Europeans owes a great deal to ethnohistoric evidence, the 


first-hand accounts of a number of chroniclers in the first two or three 
generations following the conquest. Some of these were early settlers— 
priests, administrators, soldiers, and the like—and others were natives or 
of mixed blood. 

Bernabé Cobo was a Spanish-born Jesuit priest and missionary who 
settled in Peru in 1599. He spent thirty years on various postings in South 
America, mostly in southern Peru and northern Bolivia, before moving to 
Mexico in 1630. During this time he observed and meticulously recorded a 
wealth of information about animals, plants, and people and their customs. 
In 1650 he returned to spend the last few years of his life in Peru. 

Cobo is best known for his multivolume work History of the New 
World, eventually completed in 1653. Although it appeared over a century 
after the Spanish conqueror Pizarro first entered Cusco in 1533 and included 
a good deal of secondary material taken from earlier chronicles, some now 
lost, it provides one of the most detailed and wide-ranging accounts of prac- 
tices and beliefs in the Inca world and is generally considered one of the most 
reliable. But for Cobo, we would know little if anything of the elaborate sys- 
tem of ceque lines that surround the Inca capital of Cusco, conceptual lines 
that defined and controlled social divisions as well as sacred space.

Coffin Lids 


Unlike those of Babylonia, the astronomical records of ancient Egypt, if 
they once existed, have generally not survived. It is possible that they were 
recorded on papyrus rather than on clay tablets, as was the Babylonian 
case. So-called pyramid texts, found inside tombs and coffins dating back 
as far as Old Kingdom times (c. 2600-2100 B.c.£.), and the younger “cof- 
fin texts” of the First Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom, do list 
various celestial bodies that represent deities, but they are in no way records 
of observations; their primary concern is with the passage of the soul to 
eternal life. The architecture of temples and pyramids in Old Kingdom 


times gives us some insights into how astronomical considerations affected 


and determined their construction. However, our main source of informa- 
tion about the development of astronomy and calendrics during Middle 
Kingdom Egypt comes from wooden coffin lids. 

A modest number—about twenty—of such lids survive, dating mainly 
from the Ninth and Twelfth Dynasties (c. 2160-1780 B.c.£.). Painted scenes 
preserved on the inside incorporate arrays of hieroglyphs, typically forty 
rows long by thirteen columns wide. Each box in the array contains a name, 
and these were, for the most part, repeated along diagonals. The overall ef- 
fect is of a checkerboard pattern with diagonal stripes, but there are nu- 
merous glitches—where a diagonal alignment of symbols jumps by a col- 
umn, for example. 

What was their purpose? The remarkable broad consistency between 
them, despite individual differences, suggests an elegant answer that makes 
sense in view of our broader knowledge of ancient Egyptian calendars and 
clocks. Each box in the grid contains the name of a star or star group known 
as a decan. In a typical table, three rows contain each of the names that ap- 
pear elsewhere: these are a list of the thirty-six available decans. The re- 
maining thirty-seven rows, containing the nearly diagonal grid, with its oc- 
casional glitches, represent the thirty-six weeks of the Egyptian civil 
calendar—each ten days long—together with the epagomenal period of five 
additional days that made up the year. For any given week, the names read- 
ing across the row represent the decans whose rising marked the successive 
“hours” during the night (these divisions of the night, unlike our hours, var- 
ied in length). A week later, each will rise roughly an “hour” earlier, which 
explains the diagonal pattern. However, since the position of the stars is ir- 
regular, it would not have been possible to choose decans that were evenly 
spaced across the sky, and this helps to explain the glitches. 

Although they are often called diagonal calendars or diagonal star 
clocks, these were not instruments as such, but arrays of tabulated data. 
They helped the priest determine the time of night for nocturnal observances. 
For any given week in the civil year, the user could read off the stars whose 
appearance in the east would mark a particular hour in the night. We must 
also bear in mind that the data tables we find on the coffin lids were not ac- 
tually functional—except, presumably, in the sense that the deceased would 
take them to use in the afterlife. The tables that actually served as priestly 
aids have not survived. In any event, each of them must have become obso- 
lete relatively rapidly, because of the slippage of the civil calendar relative to 
the seasonal year by one day in every four years, and by a whole ten-day 
“week” after only forty. 

The coffin-lid calendars were probably copies of the tables that the 
priests actually used. It is likely that these copies were made by artists who 


were not astronomical experts (unlike the creators of the actual tables). Per- 


haps they made mistakes in the transcription. Indeed, this may well explain 
other anomalies in some of the coffin-lid tables that do not seem to have an 
astronomical explanation. Reasonable as this sounds, it creates a headache 
for the modern interpreter. Do particular features reflect astronomical real- 
ity or were they merely errors in the transcription? To what extent did accu- 
racy actually matter? It is hardly surprising that a definitive identification of 
all of the decans has eluded modern scholars and continues to do so at the 


present time.

Cognitive Archaeology 

In order to probe the nature of astronomy in prehistoric cultures we must 
turn to the material evidence available in the archaeological record. Yet it is 
technological rather than cognitive achievement that is most obviously 
recorded there, in the form of artifacts such as stone axes and metal 
weapons, and constructions such as flint mines and megalithic monuments. 
Hence the traditional three-age system (Stone, Bronze, Iron) for categoriz- 
ing periods in prehistory. Since the 1960s, environmental archaeology has 
provided a range of evidence pertaining to climate, landscape, and vegeta- 
tion, as well as health and diet. Although this evidence has helped reveal 
many details of human subsistence activity in relation to the environment, 
such as developments in animal husbandry and agriculture, the emphasis is, 
once again, primarily technological. Social archaeology gained popularity 


in the 1970s, as people became more interested in political and economic 


relationships, structures, and spheres of influence. Archaeologists could 
make deductions from distributions of monuments and estimates of the 
work (and hence the labor organization) involved in their construction. But 
understanding prehistoric cognition always remained a more distant goal. 
Only in the 1990s, in the wake of intensive debates about archaeological 
theory and method that took place during the two previous decades, has 
cognitive archaeology begun to seem a feasible field of study. 

We may be able to make specific deductions about the mental processes 
that made possible a particular technological achievement. For example, it 
seems clear that the layout of the sarsen circle and trilithons constructed at 
Stonehenge in around 2400 B.c.E. using massive stones weighing up to forty- 
five tons must have been carefully planned before each one was manually 
hauled overland to the site, a journey of over thirty kilometers involving a 
huge expenditure of labor. From this we can deduce that certain people, at 
least, possessed a level of numerical and geometrical skills that included the 
ability to produce a scaled-down plan or model, perhaps constructed in 
wood; the ability to deduce from that model the numbers, sizes, and shapes 
of stones actually required; the means to communicate the appropriate num- 
bers and measurements to the place from which the sarsen blocks were be- 
ing brought; and the ability to determine the place of erection of each stone. 

But even this tells us nothing about the ideas and beliefs that led them 
to conceive of constructing the sarsen monument in the first place. For this, 
we need to develop a broader framework—a body of theory that suggests 
more general relationships between human thought and material remains, 
and more disciplined methods by which we can extrapolate from objects and 
patterns in the archaeological record to concepts in people’s minds. This is- 
sue has been the subject of extensive debate among theoretical archaeolo- 
gists, and there is no simple answer.

Cometary observations made by English astronomer Edmond Halley in 1682. Halley deduced that comets seen in 
1531, 1607, and 1682 were in fact the same comet and correctly predicted its return, which happened in 1758. The 
comet was then named in his honor. (Library of Congress) 


Comets, Novae, and Meteors 
The majority of objects we see in the night sky move in regular and readily 
recognizable cycles, but a few phenomena are much more sporadic. These 
include meteors, or “shooting stars”; comets, which at their most spectac- 
ular are seen as bright, blurry patches with a long tail; and novae, new stars 
that appear where nothing was visible before. 

Meteors are by far the most common of the three. On almost any night 
a patient observer can see a random shooting star fleetingly passing from one 
point in the sky to another. In fact, shooting stars are not stars at all but 
small particles of dust that fly into the earth’s atmosphere (or, to put it an- 
other way, the earth flies into them), whereupon they burn up. When they 
are unusually large and close to the observer, they can appear as bright and 
colored fireballs. Occasionally a small fragment of rock, or a meteorite, will 
fall to earth; large meteorites are rarer still but can cause local damage or 
even environmental catastrophe. Meteors often occur in systematic bursts 
known as meteor showers, with scores or even hundreds visible in the space 
of a few hours. When watching these closely, an observer soon notes that all 


the shooting stars appear to radiate from the same point in the sky. It is as 
though the earth is heading at breakneck speed toward this spot, rushing 
past stationary points of light. This is, in fact, pretty much what is happen- 
ing, since the earth’s orbit is passing through a stream of material (although 
the material in the stream is itself in orbit). This means that many meteor 
showers occur regularly, around the same date each year, when the earth’s 
orbit passes through the same region in space. However, varying conditions 
can mean that while in some years a given shower will be strikingly visible, 
in other years it will pass almost unnoticed. 

Comets can be truly spectacular, their tails stretching far across the sky, 
and a few are so bright that they can be seen in daytime. Such occurrences 
are relatively rare, though. The best examples in the last two centuries were 
seen in 1811, 1843, 1861, 1882, and 1910. The best example in the later 
twentieth century (which, though impressive, did not compare with any of 
these) was Comet Hale-Bopp in 1997. The appearance of any particular 
comet, and how this varies from night to night, depends on many factors and 
differs considerably from one comet to another. A comet may take several 
weeks to reach its maximum brightness or do so extremely rapidly, and it 
may only be at its most striking for a day or two. Some comets recur regu- 
larly—the most famous being Comet Halley, which reappears roughly every 
seventy-six years—but these comets cannot always be relied upon to be con- 
spicuous on every occasion (indeed, Halley passed almost unnoticed in 
1986). In practice, then, the appearance of a bright comet to peoples in the 
past—even those who kept accurate records, such as the Babylonians and 
Chinese—was unpredictable. 

While the majority of stars shine constantly with little perceptible vari- 
ation for literally billions of years, some are variable and a few—known as 
novae—are liable to sudden outbursts that cause their brightness to increase 
considerably. However, the most incredible phenomena of this type are the 
so-called supernovae—stars that literally explode or implode and whose 
brightness, as a result, suddenly increases by a huge factor. When super- 
novae occur relatively close to us (in astronomical terms), then what before 
was invisible to the naked eye suddenly makes its appearance as a guest star, 
which, in some cases, can outshine everything in the sky apart from the 
moon and sun. There have been no great supernovae in the last four cen- 
turies and only around eight have been reliably recorded in historical times. 
The earliest, in the constellation of Centaurus, was recorded by Chinese as- 
tronomers in C.E. 185, although there is some dispute about whether this 
was actually a supernova. The most recent was Kepler’s Supernova of 1604. 
It has been suggested that a guest star that appeared in 1054, and was cer- 
tainly recorded by the Chinese and possibly by others in Asia and Europe, 


was also recorded in North America. However, the idea that a famous pic- 


tograph at Chaco Canyon was a depiction of this supernova does not with- 
stand close scrutiny. 

Any unexpected and conspicuous occurrence in the sky—including so- 
lar and lunar eclipses as well as rare meteorological phenomena—has the po- 
tential to cause panic and even social upheaval. The political control wielded 
by ruling elites often rests upon a spiritual power derived from their appar- 
ent links with the heavens. Unanticipated and unnerving celestial events can 
serve to undermine this power, sometimes catastrophically.

Compass and Clinometer Surveys 
To determine the astronomical potential of a horizon point we need to meas- 
ure its azimuth and altitude and then calculate the declination. Where we are 
concerned with possible alignments set up to within about half a degree or 
better (half a degree is roughly the diameter of the sun or moon), this is best 
done using a theodolite. However, when the accuracy required is not as great 
as this, a magnetic compass together with a clinometer may well be sufficient. 
To be suitable for the task of determining the azimuth, a compass must 
be of the prismatic variety, enabling the user to view a distant object, a sight- 
ing mark (such as a vertical line), and the scale all at the same time. The 
measurement obtained is the magnetic bearing, or clockwise angle from 
magnetic north, as opposed to what is needed, which is the azimuth or clock- 
wise angle from true north. To convert a magnetic bearing into a (true) az- 
imuth, one must know the difference between true north and magnetic 
north. This difference—which is sometimes known as the magnetic declina- 
tion, a term that can cause considerable confusion with (astronomical) dec- 
lination—varies from place to place and time to time. Values for a particu- 
lar place and time can often be obtained from topographical maps, or from 
various web sites on the internet. It is important to make sure that the cor- 
rection is applied in the right direction: if magnetic north is to the east of true 


north, then the (true) azimuth will be greater than the magnetic bearing; if it 


is to the west then the (true) azimuth will be less. 

A clinometer, or inclinometer, performs a similar task for measuring al- 
titudes except that the zero point is determined simply by leveling a bubble 
before taking the reading, so that no further calibration is needed. Some 
manufacturers produce combined compass-clinometers as a single instru- 
ment, which are extremely useful for the archaeoastronomer. 

Using a compass and clinometer has some clear advantages over using 
a theodolite. They are light and easily portable instruments, which is a ma- 
jor advantage if a site is difficult of access. There is no need for preliminary 
setting up and no need to take supplementary readings such as timed obser- 
vations of the sun, which have the added problem of being dependent upon 
the weather (since a clear view of the sun is needed). 

However, the compass also has some disadvantages. The main one is 
that the reading it gives can be affected by magnetic rocks or other magnetic 
materials close by (steel-rimmed glasses, for example). It is desirable to take 
various precautions, such as keeping metal objects well away from it, and 
measuring alignments in both directions wherever possible—the bearings 
should be 180 degrees apart. Best of all is to calibrate the readings from a 
particular location by measuring one or two reference points whose location, 
and hence true azimuth, can be determined independently from maps or dig- 
ital topographic data. For this, one needs to know one’s own location to 
within, typically, a few meters; this can be determined using another portable 
instrument, the GPS receiver. 

Many archaeoastronomers prefer to use a theodolite, while others ar- 
gue in favor of a compass and clinometer. Which instruments are best in any 
given instance actually depends upon the problem being addressed.

Constellation Maps on the Ground 

It is often claimed, especially in popular accounts of archaeoastronomy, 
that human artifacts or constructions were laid out on the ground in the 
form of groups of stars in the sky. One such idea is that a group of temples 


at Angkor in Cambodia were laid out in the shape of the constellation 


Draco. Another claim is that the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt were laid out 
in the form of the three stars of Orion’s Belt. Groups of cup-like depressions 
resembling the Southern Cross and other constellations have been found on 
rock platforms in Aboriginal Australia. 

Given that there is no independent evidence to support the supposi- 
tion that any of these correspondences was intentional, we must ask how 
likely it is that they could have arisen by chance. (The patterns of stars in 
the sky, as opposed to their positions, have not changed significantly since 
earliest antiquity, so insecure dating is not a problem.) The chances of be- 
ing able to fit a random set of points on the ground, such as buildings, to 
a set of stars in the sky might not seem very great. However, there are a 
large numbers of stars in the sky and a lot depends upon the size of the er- 
rors one is prepared to tolerate. And once the researcher selects some 
points and ignores others, the likelihood of a good fit is very greatly in- 
creased. A British television documentary broadcast in 1999 managed to 
fit the locations of selected major public buildings in New York City to the 
brightest stars of the constellation Leo with surprising ease. This corre- 
spondence clearly was not intentional. 

We cannot dismiss outright the possibility that, at certain times in cer- 
tain places in the past, things on the ground were configured to map out, 
represent, or reflect constellations in the sky. Anyone proposing this, how- 
ever, must be able to describe and justify the selections made, provide an ob- 
jective assessment of the goodness of fit, and determine the probability of the 
results obtained being fortuitous. They also face wider problems. First, there 
are few, if any, known cultural precedents among historical or modern in- 
digenous communities for arrangements that map the stars; this will increase 
any archaeologist or anthropologist’s inherent skepticism. Second, patterns 
visible archaeologically were often created in many stages, over a consider- 
able period of time, whereas this idea implies that a single planning concept 
was adhered to. Finally, the use of some of the more sinuous Western con- 
stellations, such as Draco, must also arouse suspicions, since which collec- 
tions of stars are perceived to form a constellation varies from one culture to 
another. 

A particularly notorious example is the so-called Glastonbury Zodiac. 
This theory, which dates back to the 1920s, holds that features in the area 
surrounding the isolated hill of Glastonbury Tor, in Somerset, England—an- 
cient field boundaries, paths, ditches, and banks—mimicked the shapes of 
zodiacal constellations. As soon as the evidence is examined in any detail, 
however, the arbitrary nature of the whole scheme becomes readily appar- 
ent. Those fragments of boundaries that best fit the theory are simply as- 
sumed to be the remnants of ancient boundaries, while others that do not are 


discarded. When we do this, we are forcing the evidence to fit the theory 


rather than using the evidence to test the theory, which any objective assess- 
ment soon shows to be unsupportable. 

It is not out of the question that some sacred architecture in the past 
was laid out to reflect the configurations of groups of stars in the sky. But 
without due attention to the cultural context and a strict attention to 
methodology, investigations in this area can become no more than a modern 
game of fitting stars on a star chart to points on an archaeological map, with 
no cultural significance whatsoever.

Cosmology 
A cosmology is a shared system of beliefs about the nature of the world— 
the cosmos—as it is perceived by a group of people. The term worldview is 
often used to mean much the same thing, as is (less frequently) the Spanish 
term cosmovision. 

How people perceive the world influences what they do and where they 
do it. Principles of cosmology may be reflected in domestic architecture and 
sacred buildings, the design of great monuments, city layouts, and even 
whole landscapes. Numerous examples in the modern world or historically 
documented illustrate this point, such as the design of the Navajo hogan, the 
Pawnee earth lodge, and the Yekuana roundhouse; the layout of the me- 
dieval Hindu city of Vijayanagara and of the imperial Forbidden City in Bei- 
jing; and the landscape around the Hopi village of Walpi. 

Cosmology intimately involves astronomy, since the sky is an integral 
part of the world that people see around them. But cosmology is not re- 
stricted to astronomy. In many indigenous communities people freely asso- 
ciate things and events in the sky with those in the terrestrial world, in spirit 
worlds, or in a perceived world populated with beings that, from a Western 
scientific point of view, are imaginary and fantastical. Objects and happen- 
ings in the sky are also seen as intimately connected with actions and occur- 


rences in the realm of human relations. It is people in the Western world who 


are exceptional in this respect, separating, in accordance with the Linnaean 
tradition, the perceived world into different categories that can be analyzed 
using different branches of science such as astronomy, geology, biology, and 
the social sciences. (And even in the Western world, despite modern science, 
astrology still continues to have a strong influence.) Today, the separation of 
the world of everyday concerns from the domain of the sky is exacerbated 
by the city lights, which prevent much of the modern population ever (at 
least, in the normal course of things) from seeing a really dark night sky. 

For many indigenous peoples, on the other hand, and (as we now sus- 
pect) for virtually every human community way back into prehistory, the sky 
is an important if not critical part of the world in which they live, and it is 
crucial to keep human activity in harmony with it. Thus, for example, the 
traditional seasonal progression of the Lakota through the Black Hills of 
South Dakota is kept in tune with the path of the sun as it moves through 
certain constellations. The constellations themselves are directly associated 
with particular landmarks. 

The perceived relationships among people, land, and sky can often 
guide human action in what we would see as a pragmatic way. The Lakota 
are one example of this, since their annual cycle of movement through the 
landscape following the buffalo was necessary for subsistence. Two rather 
different examples are the Caterpillar Jaguar constellation of the Barasana 
people of the Colombian Amazon and the star Marpeankurrk in Aboriginal 
Australia. 

Archaeologists can seek to identify cosmological relationships in the 
archaeological record—in the orientations of buildings and monuments, for 
example—and alignment studies within archaeoastronomy form an impor- 
tant part of this process. However, spotting associations that might have 
had cosmological significance is far from a straightforward task, especially 
for the prehistorian, who may have little corroborating evidence other than 
the existence of an alignment itself. One problem, clearly, is that any align- 
ment could have arisen fortuitously. Just because a structure may be 
aligned, say, upon a prominent (as it might seem to the modern investiga- 
tor) hill or the midsummer sunrise does not mean that this was either in- 
tentional or meaningful—either to the builders or to those who used the 
place subsequently. Another problem is that we cannot prejudge the types 
of association most likely to have been significant (the possibilities are al- 
most endless), let alone the actual meaning(s) that might have been ascribed 
to them. We have already intimated that prominence is a subjective concept, 
and one has to avoid the dangers of a checklist of possibly meaningful types 
of association that is formulated in the context of a modern worldview but 
may be totally inapplicable in the context of another. This is particularly the 


case in seeking astronomical associations such as alignments, where all too 


often an investigator will approach a site with a ready-made toolkit of as- 
tronomical targets. 

In fact, it is when cosmological considerations act counter to pragmat- 
ics that they may be most striking in the archaeological record. An excellent 
example of this is the passage tomb at Balnuaran of Clava in Invernessshire, 
Scotland, where an apparent cosmological necessity, the need to have taller 
kerbstones on the southwestern side (following a local tradition evident in 
the nearby recumbent stone circles) seems to have resulted in structural prin- 
ciples being compromised so that the whole cairn was rendered unstable. In 
other cases, the arguments about whether an evidently intentional alignment 
reflects cosmological, or simply pragmatic, concerns, may be more difficult 
to resolve. Thus, the fact that many Iron Age roundhouses in Britain are ori- 
ented predominantly east- and southeastwards can be interpreted in two dif- 
ferent ways: first, that it is the result of a pragmatic consideration, an align- 
ment that allows the warming rays of the morning sun to shine into the 
house; second, that the orientation was dictated by cosmological principles, 
paralleling many modern examples such as the Navajo hogans and Pawnee 
earth lodges already mentioned. And these two explanations are not neces- 
sarily mutually exclusive.

Crucifixion of Christ 

Can biblical, historical, and astronomical data be combined to produce an 
exact date for the crucifixion? The question has intrigued Christian schol- 
ars right back to Sir Isaac Newton and continues to spark fierce debate 
from time to time. The Bible places the crucifixion within the period when 
Pontius Pilate was procurator of Judaea, C.E. 26 to 36, and other historical 


constraints are generally agreed to rule out years earlier than C.E. 29 and 


later than C.E. 34, with C.E. 29 and 34 themselves being unlikely. The bibli- 
cal accounts also make it clear that the crucifixion took place on the after- 
noon before the Sabbath began, that is a Friday afternoon, and on the day 
before (or possibly on the day of) the feast of the Passover, that is on the 
Jewish date 14 Nisan or 15 Nisan. But in which year? 

Attempting to answer this question involves correlating two calendars 
that are very different in nature. The Julian calendar of the Romans ran ina 
fixed and pre-determined way, tied to a solar year of 365-and-a-quarter days 
in length and ignoring the actual heavenly bodies. The (Gregorian) calendar 
used in the Western world today is directly descended from the Julian one. 
The Jewish calendar, on the other hand, was a lunar one and was, at least in 
the first century C.E., always regulated by direct observations of the moon. 

In the Jewish calendar, the new day begins at sunset, with the Sabbath 
having fallen unfailingly on every seventh day since Biblical times. The new 
month begins when the new crescent moon first appears in the evening sky. 
A major problem, then, in trying to date the crucifixion is that we have to 
estimate the likelihood that the new crescent moon would have first been 
seen on a given evening or whether it would not have been noticed until the 
next. Another problem for us is that an intercalary month needed to be in- 
serted periodically in order to keep the Jewish calendar in step with the sea- 
sonal year, and in the first century C.E. this was also done empirically. Al- 
though in theory the main trigger for inserting an extra month before Nisan 
was that Passover should not precede the vernal equinox, it is unclear how 
the equinox was itself determined (and to what accuracy), and in practice a 
variety of pragmatic criteria seem to have been used, including the availabil- 
ity (depending upon the weather) of first fruits and sacrificial lambs. 

Given all these uncertainties, we cannot obtain a clear-cut answer to the 
critical question, which is whether 14 Nisan or 15 Nisan fell on a Thursday- 
Friday (the Jewish day running from sunset Thursday to sunset Friday) in any 
given year, and hence whether one or the other might be a candidate for the 
date of the crucifixion. However, the years C.E. 31 and 32 seem to be non- 
starters. Newton himself favored April 23, c.z. 34, but historical arguments 
weigh against this. The clear favorites are generally April 7, C-£. 30 and April 
3, C.E. 33. One view favors the c.E. 33 date on the grounds that (as astro- 
nomical calculations show) a lunar eclipse occurred on that very day. This 
seems to accord with the prophecy (Acts 2:20) that “the moon [shall be 
turned] into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord comes,” 
which some interpret as describing an actual event at the time of Christ’s 
death. On the other hand, the lunar eclipse was only partial and in its final 
stages when the moon rose: the moon would not have turned red for this rea- 
son. Furthermore, this and other references in the Bible to the moon turning 


to blood clearly refer to Judgment Day rather than to the crucifixion. 


A final difficulty is that if the crucifixion really took place on a Friday, 
then it did not allow Jesus to spend three days and three nights in the tomb 
before Sunday morning. If one entertains the possibility that the crucifixion 
actually happened on a Wednesday or Thursday, then some of the eliminated 
years re-enter the frame. 

In the end, it is more likely to be historical arguments than astronomi- 
cal ones that will tip the balance in this issue.

Crucuno 
Crucuno is one of a number of megalithic enclosures—settings of standing 
stones or boulders arranged to enclose a space—found in two clusters in 
Brittany, northwest France. One group is found toward the far northwest 
coast, around the modern city of Brest, and the other is found on the south 
coast of the Département of Morbihan, around Carnac. Often grouped to- 
gether under the term cromlechs, some of these enclosures are very roughly 
circular or oval, while others are shaped like a horseshoe, a barrel, or a let- 
ter “D”; a few are closer to a rectangle or square. Crucuno, situated some 
five kilometers (three miles) northwest of Carnac, is certainly the most im- 
pressive of these. The twenty-two stones form the remains of what appears 
to have been an almost perfect rectangle, 33.2 meters by 24.9 meters (108.8 
by 81.6 feet), oriented in the cardinal directions, with the longer sides east- 
west. Although the site has been largely reconstructed, the reconstruction 
appears to have been done faithfully, so that the layout can be trusted. 
Amazingly, this simple structure combines geometrical perfection with 
cardinal orientation and astronomical alignment. In addition to being a near- 
perfect rectangle, the lengths of its sides were in the ratio 3:4. And in addition 
to the sides being oriented in the cardinal directions, the diagonals are ori- 
ented toward the rising and setting positions of the sun at the two solstices. 
Yet we should guard against overinterpretation. The ratio of the sides 
does not necessarily imply that the builders were aware of the Pythagorean 


rule whereby the length of the diagonal is also a whole number of units (5).

It could be just that, for aesthetic or other reasons, they chose to have the side 
lengths in the proportion 3:4 instead of, say, 2:3 or 4:5. Then there is the 
question of whether the solstitial orientation of the diagonals is fortuitous. 
Crucuno is located at a latitude (47.6°N) where, given a reasonably flat hori- 
zon, constructing a cardinally oriented 3:4 rectangle with its longer sides east- 
west will ensure the (approximate) solstitial orientation of the diagonals, 
whether or not this was intentional. On the other hand, perhaps the solstitial 
orientation of the diagonals was deliberate and the ratio of the lengths of the 
sides followed, unintentionally, as a result. Either way, it seems inconceivable 
that the latitude was deliberately chosen in order to achieve both solstitial ori- 
entations and Pythagorean proportions at once: the location of the site was 
surely determined in relation to the territory occupied by the people who built 
it, as is evident from its position within a tightly confined cluster of various 
types of megalithic enclosure in the Carnac area. Lastly, it is tempting to iden- 
tify the east-west orientation as aligning upon the sunrise and sunset at the 
equinoxes, but this also makes several questionable assumptions, not least 
that the equinox as a concept meant something to people in prehistory. 

The Scottish engineer Alexander Thom believed fervently that, in addi- 
tion to a sophisticated knowledge of astronomy, “megalithic man” knew a 


good deal of geometry, including Pythagorean triangles, and used a precise unit 


of measurement, the “megalithic yard” of 0.829 meters (2.72 feet), in con- 
structing monuments throughout the length and breadth of Britain, as well as 
in Brittany. The evidence he used to support this idea has now been largely re- 
futed, but it is curious that the 3:4 ratio of side lengths is marked so clearly at 
Crucuno and that this implies a unit of 8.3 meters (27.2 feet), which is almost 
exactly ten of Thom’s megalithic yards. The most probable explanation is that 
a unit of around this length tends to arise through local practices of pacing. 

Most of the other recorded stone rectangles in Brittany are in a dilapi- 
dated state or have been removed entirely, but similarities have been noted 
with the station stones at Stonehenge. These four stones marked the corners 
of a rectangle whose side lengths were in the ratio 5:12, another Pythagorean 
combination yielding a diagonal of length thirteen units. The station stone 
rectangle is not cardinally oriented, but its shorter sides are themselves ori- 
ented upon midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset, while the longer sides 
align roughly with an extreme rising position of the moon. This is similar 
enough to be intriguing, but different enough that it does not provide com- 
pelling corroborative evidence. 

Nonetheless, despite the many problems and unresolved issues, the fact 
that people in the Neolithic or Bronze Age could have encapsulated four dis- 
tinct characteristics—geometrical and numerological perfection, cardinal 
orientation, and astronomical alignments—in such a simple setting is truly 
remarkable. We do not have to accept Thom’s megalithic yard at face value 
or postulate that the builders conceptualized Pythagorean geometry to ap- 
preciate this fact. 

Nor do we have to assume that the builders chose their latitude in or- 
der to believe that the solstitial alignments of the diagonals were fully inten- 
tional. True, Crucuno would not have “worked” if it had been located much 
farther north or south. It is also true that such ideal latitudes are few and far 
between. For example, a square enclosure with similar properties would 
need to be placed much farther north—around Carlisle in northern England 
(latitude 55.0°)—and a 3:4 rectangle with its longer sides north-south would 
have to be located around latitude 59.6°, somewhat to the north of the 
Orkney Islands in northern Scotland. But what seems to us a case of re- 
markably good luck could, for people living in the Carnac area and unaware 
of differences farther afield, simply have seemed an intrinsic property of na- 
ture. In encapsulating the interconnectedness of geometry and astronomy in 
this modest but powerful way, the Crucuno rectangle may have provided a 


clear confirmation of the unity and integrity of the cosmos.

Cumbrian Stone Circles 

In and around the Lake District, in the county of Cumbria in the northwest 
of England, are a group of nine large stone circles in spectacular landscape 
settings with panoramic views of the surrounding hills. The British archae- 
ologist Aubrey Burl has also noted four similar large circles scattered slightly 
farther afield—three across the Solway Firth in Dumfriesshire, southwest 
Scotland, and one across the Irish Sea in County Down, Northern Ireland— 
that also seem to form part of this distinctive group of monuments. 

These great stone circles are impressive in scale, varying from some 
thirty meters (100 feet) to over a hundred meters (330 feet) in diameter. The 
largest, Long Meg and Her Daughters, contains sixty-six stones (originally 
there may have been up to ninety). Nowhere does the idea that stone circles 
were conceived as microcosms, sacred spaces relating to the wider world and 
used for ritual performances, seem more appropriate than at some of these 
majestic circles in their breathtaking settings. 

Astronomical alignments have been noted at a number of these circles. 
A large outlier at Long Meg and Her Daughters (Long Meg itself) is located 
in the direction of midwinter sunset from the center of the adjacent ring. The 
entrance at Swinside is roughly in the direction of midwinter sunrise. One of 
the best known of these circles, Castlerigg, contains a number of low-preci- 
sion alignments noted by Alexander Thom, who considered it “a symbolic 
observatory.” Systematic studies of the group as a whole do back up these 
initial impressions to some extent, revealing an apparent obsession with the 
cardinal directions and the solstitial directions. This may well reflect the ex- 
istence of quadripartite cosmologies not dissimilar to those so prevalent in 
pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and indigenous North America.

Cursus Monuments 

In addition to the large numbers of circles of earth, timber, and stone con- 
structed in Britain and Ireland during the Neolithic and Bronze Age, there 
were also a variety of monumental constructions that were linear in form, 
including rows of free-standing timber uprights or standing stones. Two 
very different examples of the latter are the 2 kilometer- (1.5 mile-) long 
Kennet Avenue at Avebury and the many short rows of no more than six 
megaliths found in western Scotland and the west of Ireland. The earliest 
easily recognizable type of linear monument, however, is the cursus, a pair 
of roughly parallel ditches and banks, typically a few tens of meters (one 
hundred to three hundred feet) apart, that run for some distance, typically 


a few hundred meters. Some eighty examples are known, of which the 
longest is the Dorset cursus in southwest England, which runs up and down 
across the undulating chalk uplands of Cranborne Chase for a remarkable 
ten kilometers (seven miles). 

The name cursus derives from the spurious characterization by William 
Stukeley in the eighteenth century of one such monument as a racetrack for 
chariots. Their actual purpose is far from clear. The dating evidence suggests 
that cursuses were constructed in the Early Neolithic, generally within the 
later part of the fourth millennium B.c.£., so that they predate many of the 
more conspicuous, and hence better-known, British prehistoric monuments. 
The so-called Stonehenge cursus, for example, which is located just 1 kilo- 
meter north of Stonehenge and runs roughly east-west for some 3 kilometers 
(2 miles), is scarcely visible on the ground but may well have existed for sev- 
eral centuries before the earliest discernible activity took place at Stonehenge 
itself, and it may predate the arrival of the stones by as much as a whole mil- 
lennium. 

Cursus monuments are found in many parts of Britain with possible 
examples farther afield, although the main concentration is in southern 
England. Around twenty are known in the Upper Thames Valley alone. 
They represent some of the earliest monuments that impacted the British 
landscape in a way that is still visible today (though in most cases they are 
visible only from cropmarks evident in aerial photographs). They are also 
among the most baffling. Were they pathways or processional ways? If so, 
it seems strange that in most cases the ends, or terminals, were not open: in- 
stead, the banks along the sides curved or bent round, closing them off. It 
is debated whether the ditches and banks were sufficient to form a physical 
barrier, or whether the monuments could have been entered or crossed from 
almost anywhere. There is some evidence to support the assertion that they 
were cleared of tall vegetation, or at least built through cleared or partially 
cleared areas. 

Did cursus monuments mark out formalized, or ritualistic, rites of pas- 
sage? Some, like the Stonehenge cursus, joined two high points in the land- 
scape, and it has been speculated that they provided some sort of symbolic 
link between two settlement areas. On the other hand, at Rudston in York- 
shire four different cursuses converge upon (or diverge from) a point in the 
valley through the chalk wolds, a natural focus for settlement through the 
ages, seemingly connecting it to the surrounding higher ground in various di- 
rections. Yet again, many of the Thames valley cursuses are situated ona sin- 
gle gravel terrace, their orientations ensuring that there were no sudden 
changes in elevation along their length. 

Many cursuses also seem to encapsulate a variety of symbolic relation- 


ships with the wider visual environment. A number appear to be linked with 


streams and watercourses, while others are aligned with local hilltops. Yet 
others are astronomically aligned. Standing at what was once the northeast- 
ern terminal of the Dorset cursus, on Bottlebush Down, prehistoric viewers 
looking along the cursus to the southwest would have seen a conspicuous 
long barrow, built right across the cursus where it crossed the horizon. 
Around the shortest day of the year, the sun would have set directly behind 
this barrow. Although this segment of the Dorset cursus is virtually impossi- 
ble to make out from the ground, the terminal can be identified and the bar- 
row on Gussage Cow Down remains conspicuous. Another solstitially 
aligned cursus, the Dorchester cursus in Oxfordshire, has fared even less 
well: it has been completely destroyed by a combination of quarrying and 
the construction of a bypass. 

It cannot be proved statistically that these solstitial alignments were de- 
liberate. They are not repeated at most cursuses. Even at the Dorset cursus 
itself, only one segment is solstitially aligned: there were several other seg- 
ments, built in more than one stage. Even if it was done intentionally, we can 
never know exactly why it was important to the people who built these par- 
ticular cursuses to align them upon the midwinter sun. Some have suggested 
that there was a desire to keep them in harmony with nature, to appear to 
be part of the functioning of nature in a broad sense. And yet in some other 
cases a clear opportunity for a solstitial alignment seems to have been passed 
over. At Cleaven Dyke in Perthshire, central Scotland, is a two kilometer- 
(over one mile-) long earthen bank running between two ditches, generally 
considered to be a variant cursus monument. From the vicinity of its north- 
western terminus a prominent hill is clearly visible, and this would have lined 
up approximately with the midsummer setting sun. If astronomical orienta- 
tion really was important, it is hard to conceive that such an obvious align- 
ment, with solstitial sunset coinciding with a prominent hill, would have 
been shunned. The cursus was not, however, oriented in this direction but 
over ten degrees differently. Some other suggested solar alignments are also 
problematic. The Stonehenge cursus, for instance, is often said to be aligned 
upon equinoctial sunrise and sunset, but there are a number of problems 
with this, as with supposed equinoctial alignments generally. 

A different type of astronomical alignment is found at Thornborough 
in Yorkshire. The cursus here is associated with circular earthworks that 
were later superseded by three large henge monuments. To the northeast it 
was aligned upon midsummer sunrise, but to the southwest it was aligned 
upon the setting of the stars of Orion’s belt. Since there are a good many 
bright stars in the sky, and their rising and setting positions vary consider- 
ably over the centuries owing to precession, it is possible to fit stars to al- 
most any alignment, given the uncertainty in the archaeological dating of 


most prehistoric monuments. This one would certainly not be considered 


significant were it not for the fact that Orion’s belt alignments are found re- 
peatedly in different features at the site and fit with other archaeological ev- 
idence suggesting that the site was a pilgrimage center where ceremonies 
were held in early autumn. Orion’s belt could have been important because 
its annual reappearance in the morning sky—its heliacal rising—served to 
forewarn potential participants. 

In sum, cursus monuments do not appear to have any common ritual- 
istic or symbolic purpose that is reflected in their relationships to the wider 
landscape or sky. Yet we can see tantalizing indications that both might have 
been important in particular cases.

Cusco Sun Pillars 

The Inca elite claimed kinship to the sun, and this needed to be constantly 
reinforced. Public rituals were regulated by the annual motions of the sun 
along the horizon, the most important of these being the festival of Inti 
Raymi, which took place at the time of the June solstice. This is still enacted 
today in the form of a pageant held annually at the ruins of the fortress of 
Sacsahuaman (Saqsaywaman) in the hills immediately outside the city of 
Cusco (Cuzco), once the capital of the entire Inca empire. 

Several chroniclers, including Bernabé Cobo, give accounts of pillars 
that were erected on the horizon around Cusco in order to mark sunrise or 
sunset on key dates in the year. These eye-witness accounts span the whole 
of the century immediately following the European conquest and differ in 
many details, not least the number of pillars and their locations. There are, 
however, independent and largely consistent accounts of four pillars (“small 
towers”) placed on a hill to the west of the city to mark planting times. Gar- 
cilaso de la Vega, the son of a Spanish captain and an Inca princess, de- 


scribed four sets of four pillars, each set marking one of the four solstitial di-

rections. In each case, according to Garcilaso, the critical rising or setting po- 
sition of the sun was flanked by two smaller towers, themselves flanked by 
two larger towers to guard them. 

Given the importance of the sun in Inca religion, it is scarcely surpris- 
ing that horizon observations of the sun might have been the dominant sea- 
sonal markers and calendrical determinants, but some chroniclers’ accounts 
also speak of a lunar calendar and distinctive ceremonials and rituals (such 
as llama sacrifices) being carried out each month. How the lunar and solar 
aspects of the calendar were resolved is not clear, although Garcilaso main- 
tains that the solstitial pillars were used for this purpose. There are also some 
grounds for suggesting that pillars were used to observe lunar as well as so- 
lar risings and settings. 

Within a generation after the conquest the pillars fell into disuse, al- 
though some may have survived for more than a century. No material traces 
remain today, though archaeologists and archaeoastronomers have tried to 
identify where some of them stood. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni has 
identified what he feels is the likely location of a set of four pillars to the west 
of Cusco, on a hill called Cerro Picchu, suggesting that they marked sunset 
not on either of the solstices but on the dates of solar antizenith passage. 


However, the evidence is equivocal and his conclusions are hotly disputed.

Declination 

Declination is the single most useful concept in archaeoastronomy. It basi- 
cally means no more than “latitude” on the spinning celestial sphere, with 
the axis of spin defining the north and south poles. Every star has a par- 
ticular declination and moves daily around a line of constant declination. 
This means that if you go to a place and identify a point of interest on the 
horizon—perhaps because an interesting archaeological feature points 
there—then all you have to do is to determine the declination of that hori- 
zon point, whereupon you can deduce what will rise and set there, and fur- 
thermore what would have risen and set there at any epoch in the past. The 
declination of a horizon point depends upon the azimuth and altitude of 
the point, together with the latitude of the observer. When calculating a 
declination, we need to make allowance for atmospheric refraction and, in 
the case of the moon, for lunar parallax. 

The declination of the north celestial pole is 90° and that of the celes- 
tial equator is 0°. The declination of Polaris, for example, is 89° and that of 
the Pleiades is 24°. By convention, declinations south of the celestial equa- 
tor are negative, so that the declination of Sirius, for example, is -17°, and 
that of Acrux, the brightest star in the Southern Cross, is -63°. The decli- 
nation of the south celestial pole is -90°. 

Confusingly, the word declination is also used to mean the difference 
between magnetic and true north. Equally confusingly, astronomers use the 
term latitude in the context of a different coordinate system on the celestial 


sphere: one related not to its spin axis but to the sun’s apparent path around 
it—the ecliptic.

Delphic Oracle 

The oracle at Delphi, famous throughout ancient Greece from about the 
seventh century B.C.E., was (at least initially) only available for consultation 
on one day in the entire year. It was also set in a remote location in the 
foothills of Mount Parnassos, several days’ journey from most ancient 
Greek cities. How, then, did pilgrims manage to arrive there at the appro- 
priate time? 

There might appear to be little difficulty, because the date was clearly 
specified as Apollo’s birthday, the seventh day of the month of Bysios. The 
problem is that in ancient Greece, even as late as the fifth century B.C.E., 
there was no universal calendar. Instead, each urban center reckoned its own 
lunar calendar independently. In theory, observations of the first appearance 
of the new moon were used to determine the beginning of each month, but 
these were often subject to political interference, and the same was true of 
the insertion of intercalary months to keep the calendar in step with the sea- 
sonal year. Different cities had different sequences of months, different god 
and goddess cults, and different festival dates. The month of Bysios, for ex- 
ample, could fall at any time from (what in our calendar is) mid-January to 
mid-March. Certainly, no pilgrim relying on their own city’s civic lunar cal- 
endar could be sure of arriving at the oracle at the appropriate time, perhaps 
within several weeks. 

The key, it seems, was in observations of the stars. Their use as seasonal 
indicators had been known to Greek farmers since at least the eighth century 
B.C.E., as is clear from the writings of Hesiod. By the fifth century—follow- 
ing the development of peg-hole star calendars called parapegmata—some 
cities at least were using star sightings to regulate their own civic calendars. 
We also know from at least one parapegma that the relatively faint stars of 
the constellation Delphinus were recognized as a dolphin from at least the 
fifth century B.C.E. Finally, the cult title of the god (Apollo Delphinios) and 
the name of the site suggest an association with Delphinus. 

Weaving these various strands together, it is not surprising to discover 


that the heliacal rise (first pre-dawn appearance) of Delphinus occurred to- 


The ruins of Delpbi, Greece. (Corel Corp.) 


wards the end of December. If pilgrims used this event as the cue to com- 
mence the journey to the oracle, then they would have arrived in good time. 
What is more, this celestial event may well (at least initially) have defined the 
date when the oracle held forth. The key to this notion is Delphi’s location 
within the landscape: it is situated in a natural bowl surrounded on three 
sides by towering cliffs. The high eastern horizon means that from the tem- 
ple itself, the first appearance of Delphinus did not occur until about the end 
of January. According to tradition, Apollo left Delphi for a three-month pe- 
riod each year, which coincides (at least approximately) with the period 
when the constellation was too close to the sun and hence invisible. The con- 
sultation, then, would have taken place on the seventh day of the first lunar 
month in which the celestial dolphin had returned. 

All this is strongly suggestive that the cult activities associated with the 
god Apollo Delphinios, and in particular the day when the oracle made its 
pronouncements, were defined by direct reference to the annual cycles of 
appearance of the constellation Delphinus. This direct connection may well 
have been used by pilgrims to know when to commence their journey to the 
oracle.

Diurnal Motion 

Diurnal means “daily.” Each day the celestial sphere turns once about an 
axis through two points known as the celestial poles. For an observer in the 
northern hemisphere, the north celestial pole is up in the sky while the south 
celestial pole is below the ground. The stars appear to turn around the 
north celestial pole, which defines the (“true”) north direction. (In the 
southern hemisphere, the south celestial pole is up in the sky and defines the 
south direction.) 

The diurnal motion is the most fundamental motion of the celestial 
bodies. For any place on earth (apart from the poles!) it defines the north- 
south axis known as the meridian, and hence any other direction in relation 
to this, regardless of the nature of the terrestrial landscape. Suppose, for ex- 
ample, that we find a group of monuments that are consistent in their ori- 
entation, and this has evidently been achieved over a wide area and despite 
a varied topography, so that it cannot be put down to prevailing winds, the 
local topography, or reference to distant landmarks. It follows that these ori- 
entations must be astronomical in the broadest sense, in that they can only 
have been achieved in relation to the diurnal motion of the celestial bodies.

Dresden Codex 

Most of our knowledge of Maya writing comes from monumental inscrip- 
tions in stone—public pronouncements carved into the walls of buildings or 
on stelae that stand like sentinels by a particular temple-pyramid. Sometimes 


textual commentaries were associated with striking carved friezes and vivid 


painted murals. Classic-period inscrip- 
tions and murals typically describe key 
events in the lives of kings and gods, 
but the later ones are increasingly con- 
cerned with warfare, conquest, and the 
sacrifice of captives. Many inscriptions 
contain calendrical dates, and these 
helped researchers establish the nature 
of the Maya calendar long before the 
remaining parts of the inscriptions be- 
gan to be deciphered. 

That these texts contained true hi- 
eroglyphic writing was not generally 
accepted until the later part of the 
twentieth century but is now beyond 
dispute. As we now know, syllabic 
glyphs were combined to produce pho- 
netic expressions of words in a lan- 
guage conforming to strict principles of 
grammar and syntax, principles that 
have passed down recognizably into 
modern Maya languages such as Yu- 
catec, spoken in the Yucatan peninsula 
of Mexico and in parts of northern 
Guatemala and Belize. 

Ancient Maya script was without 
doubt the most highly developed writ- 
ing system in the whole of pre- 
Columbian America. Yet much of it 
doubtless existed on perishable media 
and has been permanently lost. Hun- 
dreds of “books” in the form of folded 
strips of bark paper were burned to a 
cinder by the Spanish priests. From the 
Maya region only four of these codices 
survive, but these give us tremendous 
insights into learning and ritual. They are known, after the places where they 
were eventually discovered, respectively as the Dresden Codex, Madrid 
Codex, Paris Codex, and Grolier Codex. It is the first—the Dresden 
Codex—that holds the most fascination regarding astronomy. The whole 
book appears to be an astronomical (or rather astrological) almanac stuffed 


full of information about different celestial bodies. A vast amount of careful

scholarship has been concerned with the detailed analysis of the contents of 
the codex. Among many other things, this work suggests that the Dresden 
Codex was actually a copy, probably made between the twelfth and four- 
teenth centuries C.E., of an original document as much as three or four hun- 
dred years older. 

The Dresden Codex contains a number of tables that relate to particu- 
lar celestial bodies. One of the most famous is the Venus table, which was 
first identified as such from the repeated appearance of the number sequence 
236, 90, 250, and 8. These numbers seem to correspond to the canonical 
lengths of the appearance and disappearance of Venus during each synodic 
cycle. Another table records intervals between “danger periods” when solar 
eclipses might occur. It is also clear from the Dresden Codex that the Maya 
were obsessed with interlocking time cycles: they were well aware that five 
Venus cycles equaled eight years and also (nearly) 99 lunations; 46 tzolkins 
(260-day cycles) equaled 405 lunations, and so on. We would see these as 
coincidences of nature but to the Maya they represented natural rhythms of 
the cosmos. 

The motivation for their interest in celestial cycles was, as we would see 
it, primarily astrological. They needed to be able to predict the motions of 
Venus, for example, so that they could judge the time when the omens would 
be best for waging war and capturing warriors for sacrifice to the gods. In 
this sense, the Dresden Codex and other books like it might have functioned 
both as astronomical tables and as divinatory almanacs.

Drombeg 

Drombeg is a carefully restored and well-preserved example of a south-west 
Irish axial stone circle, probably built in the early part of the second mil- 
lennium B.c.E. Located near to the south coast of County Cork, a few kilo- 


meters from the village of Ros O gCairbre (Ross Carbery), it commands a

wide view southward down toward the sea. It is relatively large as axial 
stone circles go: it is a little under ten meters in diameter and contains sev- 
enteen stones. 

Drombeg is significant astronomically because of its axial alignment. 
As viewed along the axis from outside the circle to the northeast, looking in 
through the portals, the recumbent stone on the far side sits beneath a rela- 
tively close hill, less than a kilometer (half a mile) distant. In this hill, above 
the center of the recumbent stone, is a shallow but prominent notch. The 
axis and notch mark the setting position of the midwinter sun. The solstitial 
alignment of Drombeg was first recorded by Boyle Somerville in 1923 and 
has been much noted since. In fact, it is not exact: at around the time of the 
circle’s construction the midwinter sun would have set somewhat to the left 
of the notch, only reaching it about two weeks before and after. Nowadays 
it is much closer. Nonetheless, even at the time of construction it would have 
been close enough to impress. 

Much has been written about Drombeg, including speculations about 
other sunrises and sunsets that might have been observed from the circle at 
different times in the seasonal year. But everywhere has a horizon, and a cir- 
cle of seventeen stones must of necessity form many alignments. Although it 


is not unreasonable to imagine Bronze Age people tracking the annual pas- 


sage of the sun along the horizon, the archaeological record does not speak 
clearly about this. Even the intentionality of the main solstitial alignment is 
in some doubt. When Drombeg is considered in the wider context of the 
group of monuments of which it is a member, it is found that—despite the 
general consistency of the orientations of the axial stone circles toward the 
southwest or west—not a single other example is solstitially aligned. The ob- 
vious conclusion is that solstitial alignment was not important to the axial 
stone circle builders—even though the general design and orientation was— 
and that the solstitial alignment of this single example was probably fortu- 
itous. On the other hand, however strong the framework of beliefs and tra- 
ditions that governed and constrained the construction of one of these 
circles, it is always possible that the builders of this particular one had a spe- 
cial reason for going beyond the prevailing convention and incorporating a 
deliberate alignment upon sunset on the shortest day.

Easter Island 

Easter Island is the most isolated island on earth. Less than twenty-five 
kilometers (fifteen miles) across, it is well over 2,000 kilometers (1,300 
miles) distant from the nearest habitable land in any direction. Yet when 
Europeans first chanced across it (Dutchman Jacob Roggeveen arrived 
there on Easter Sunday in 1722, hence the name), they found it inhabited. 
In fact, Rapa Nui (which is the Polynesian name for the island) had been 
colonized well over a millennium earlier, in about C.E. 400. Whether only 
a single canoe or fleet of canoes ever reached this remotest corner of Poly- 
nesia, or whether for a period there was further contact, we shall probably 
never know. What is certain is that the inhabitants of the island soon lost 
contact with their forebears and spent many centuries in complete isola- 
tion. Both archaeologists and ecologists have been bequeathed an incredi- 
bly valuable case study of people interacting with their environment within 
a closed system, and it is one that has some sobering lessons for the popu- 
lation of the planet as a whole. Certainly environmental disaster loomed 
toward the end, when the population had increased dramatically and all 
the forests had been destroyed. 

Among the fascinations of Easter Island are the famous large statues or 
moai. Several hundred of them came to stand imposingly on platforms 
(abu), mostly ringing the island and facing inland, but with a few in other 
locations. Scores more lie or stand in what resembles a frozen production 
line in the volcanic crater Rano Raraku, in various stages of production 
from quarrying to transportation. Why would an isolated population on a 
small island have put such a significant proportion of its human resources 
into producing them? One possibility is that they were seen as protective 
presences, but their full significance for the population of this tiny island re- 
mains largely a matter of speculation. 

The island has long attracted astronomical attention. As far back as the 
1960s, publications appeared describing abu that were solstitially or 
equinoctially aligned. But since there are over 250 ahu on the island, the

question of bias in selection arose. Were the supposedly astronomically 
aligned abu selected on the basis of a preconceived “toolkit” of targets? If 
so, it is possible that they had no statistical or cultural significance whatso- 
ever. Attempts were made to resolve this question through systematic stud- 
ies of ahu and moai orientations, both by an archaeologist (the Easter Island 
specialist William Mulloy) and later by an astronomer, William Liller. They 
provide only marginal evidence at best of any intentional orientations upon 
solstitial and equinoctial sunrise and sunset. The overriding tendency is for 
abu to be situated close to the coast and oriented parallel to it, with the moai 
facing inland. Since such platforms are to be found all around the perimeter 
of the island, their orientations are scattered around the compass, with some 
falling inevitably within the solstitial and equinoctial ranges. 

Perhaps the most noteworthy abu from an astronomical point of view 
is one of a small minority that are not situated on the coast but a good way 
inland. Ahu Huri a Urenga is situated in a low saddle surrounded—unusu- 
ally for Easter Island—by a hilly horizon with very little sea visible. Stand- 
ing upon the platform is a distinctive and imposing moai. This is aligned not 
only upon the rising sun at the June solstice, but upon a prominent hill sum- 
mit. Another hilltop marks equinoctial sunset. A number of apparently arti- 
ficial depressions in boulders adjacent to the platform incorporate several so- 


lar alignments and hence, it has been claimed, could have functioned as a 


Abu Nau Nau in its coastal setting. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


solar-ranging device. All this evidence still falls short of conclusive proof, but 
it does at least raise the possibility that natural features in the landscape were 
used to mark the solar rising or setting positions at different times of the 
year. This is a possibility that has been raised elsewhere in Polynesia, for ex- 
ample in the Na Pali region of the Hawaiian island of Kaua‘i. 

One of the most significant astronomical alignments to the inhabitants 
of Rapa Nui may actually have been a natural one. The village of Orongo 
was placed in an extraordinary situation on a knife-edge ridge overlooking 
the spectacular but treacherous crater of Rano Kau, with its marshy lake on 
one side and the ocean on the other. This sacred place was the ceremonial 
base for the extraordinary annual “birdman” ritual in which contestants had 
to swim two kilometers (over a mile) out to a small rock, wait there for the 
return of a migratory sea bird, and collect its first egg. As seen from Orongo, 
the sun rose behind the summit of Poike, a prominent volcanic hill on a far 
corner of the island, precisely at the winter (June) solstice. As the rising sun 
moved away from this peak, the spring ceremony approached. It is hard to 
believe that priests at Orongo could have failed to notice that the peak of 
Poike marked the limit of the sun’s movement along the horizon, especially 
given that the word poike, according to the anthropologist and Maori 
scholar Sir Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hiroa), means “to be seen just above the 
horizon.” However, the severe limitations of the topography make it unlikely 
that this was taken into account when the village was planned. Instead, the 
solstitial alignment of Poike from the crater-rim village may have been dis- 
covered later. We would see it as a coincidence, but it may well have been 
taken by the Easter Islanders as something that confirmed and reinforced the 
already evident sacredness of the place. 

A remnant of Easter Island astronomy of a rather different nature may 
have been bequeathed to us in the form of Rongorongo script, a system of 
symbols used on Easter Island that seems to have provided a series of trig- 
gers for the reader rather than actual words or syllables. One fragment of 


Rongorongo has been interpreted as a lunar calendar.

Eclipse Records and the Earth’s Rotation 

Modern physics allows us to calculate, with extraordinary accuracy, the or- 
bits of the earth about the sun and the moon about the earth. This enables 
scientists to predict the characteristics of solar (and lunar) eclipses for many 
centuries into the future, and in particular, to determine “paths of totality.” 
These are narrow tracks across the surface of the planet defining those 
places where that rare and spectacular event—a total eclipse of the sun— 
will occur. 

It is also possible to operate backwards in time and “predict” the oc- 
currence of total solar eclipses in the past. Unfortunately, there are innate er- 
rors in this process that increase the further back (or forward) one tries to 
go. A significant effect is tidal friction, which has the effect of gradually 
slowing the rate of rotation of the earth. To illustrate the point, suppose that 
we made the assumption that the earth has rotated at the exactly same rate 
for the past two millennia. In fact it has slowed down slightly, and during 
that time it has actually rotated by one eighth of a turn more than we 
thought. The result will be that our eclipse track “predictions” for an eclipse 
occurring in the year 0 would be correct in latitude but some 45 degrees off 
in longitude, since the moon’s shadow would actually have fallen further 
round the earth’s surface than we expected. 

It was first realized in the 1970s that this argument could be turned 
around. Eclipses were recorded by the ancient Chinese, Babylonians, Greeks, 
and Romans, as well as by astronomers in medieval Europe. As a result, 
there exist many scores of records of total solar eclipses (and other sun- 
moon-earth related astronomical events) dating between about 700 B.c.E. 
and c.£. 1600 with sufficient information on the timing of their occurrence 
to enable us to identify them with “predicted” eclipses. By comparing, 
through time, the difference in longitude between the “predictions” and the 
actual observations, it is possible to construct a remarkably accurate esti- 
mate of the rate of deceleration of the earth’s rotation. Even so the modeling 
is not straightforward, and the main progress was made in the 1980s by the 
British historian of astronomy Richard Stephenson working together with 
astronomer Leslie Morrison. 

This type of study uses archaeology and history—in the form of ancient 


eclipse records—to inform modern physics and astronomy. It has been 


named applied historical astronomy to distinguish it from archaeoastron- 
omy, which does precisely the opposite. Archaeoastronomy uses modern as- 
tronomy to reconstruct the appearance of ancient skies with the ultimate aim 
of learning something about people’s beliefs and practices in the past.

Ecliptic 

If the earth didn’t rotate, and the atmosphere didn’t scatter the light of the 
sun and obscure our view of the stars during the day, then as the earth 
moved slowly on its annual cycle around the sun we would see the sun mov- 
ing slowly against the stars, completing a circuit around the celestial sphere 
once every year. This apparent path of the sun through the stars is known 
as the ecliptic. 

Because the earth does rotate, the celestial sphere appears to spin 
around once every day. During each twenty-four-hour period, as it moves 
around with the stars, the sun progresses along the ecliptic by approximately 
one degree. If it were not for the atmosphere, we would see it by day among 
the stars. To many human communities it is important to know where 
among the stars the sun is. The zodiac familiar to people in the modern 
Western world—a band of twelve constellations through which the ecliptic 
runs—has its origins in ancient Babylonia. But many different “zodiacs” are 
possible, as for example among the Maya. The Lakota people of North 
Dakota traditionally keep their seasonal movement around the landscape in 
tune with the path of the sun through their own “zodiacal” constellations.

Egyptian Temples and Tombs 

During the earliest dynasties in ancient Egypt, from about 3000 B.c.£. on- 
wards, royal burials increased steadily in size and complexity. However, it 
is the construction of huge pyramids that for most people epitomizes an- 
cient Egyptian burial customs and captures the imagination. 

Large stone architecture first appeared during the Third Dynasty 
(twenty-seventh century B.C.E.) in the form of the 77-meter- (254 foot-)high 
stepped pyramid at Saqqara, some ten kilometers (six miles) south of mod- 
ern Cairo. Pyramid building reached its peak (after some initial shortcom- 
ings) during the Fourth Dynasty (2613-2494 B.c.£.) with the construction of 
the famous Pyramids of Giza. Pyramids actually formed part of complexes, 
typically built on the edge of the desert plateau above the fertile river valley 
where they would dominate the surrounding landscape yet remain inacces- 
sible to the masses: they were enclosed, together with other sacred structures, 
within a high wall. The precinct interior could only be reached by means of 
a covered causeway leading up from a separate temple in the valley, accessi- 
ble by boat. 

The subsequent Fifth Dynasty is particularly characterized by the con- 
struction of temples dedicated to the sun god, Ra (or Re). The pharaoh’s 
power depended upon sun worship, and these “sun sanctuaries” followed 
the design of the mortuary complexes in having two enclosed precincts on 
different levels linked by a causeway. Six of the nine pharaohs of the Fifth 
Dynasty built temple complexes; the best preserved is that built by the sixth 
pharaoh, Neuserre, at Abu Ghurab. 

All of this happened during Old Kingdom times, up to the mid-twenty- 
second century B.c.E. Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted for a further two 
millennia, its complex history including periods of political instability and 
social upheaval as well as two further periods of relative stability: the Mid- 
dle Kingdom (mid-twenty-first century to mid-seventeenth century) and the 
New Kingdom (mid-sixteenth century to mid-eleventh century). Monumen- 
tal tombs and temples proliferated in these later times, but they were gener- 
ally more modest and not just the preserve of the kings themselves. However, 


the New Kingdom has left us some spectacular remains in the vicinity of its 


Part of the painted ceiling of the burial chamber of the tomb of Seti I (New Kingdom, thirteenth century B.C.£.), list- 
ing and depicting the decans—stars and asterisms that marked ten-day calendrical periods. (Gianni Dagli Orti/Corbis) 


sacred capital, Thebes, some five hundred kilometers (three hundred miles) 
upriver to the south of Cairo, near modern Luxor. Amun (or Amon), the pa- 
tron god of Thebes, had become identified with the existing sun god Ra, and 
the Great Temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak provided a spectacular setting at 
the heart of the city for public ceremonials relating to the sun god. On the 
opposite side of the river is the so-called Valley of the Kings, which contains 
over sixty underground pharaohs’ tombs, including the famous (because it 
was discovered intact) tomb of Tutankhamun. 

The most obvious clues to astronomical associations of temples and 
tombs are found in the inscriptions within them. A number of New King- 
dom tombs and temples, for example, contain painted “astronomical ceil- 
ings,” listing and depicting stars, constellations, and even planets. But why 
should these be placed inside tombs? The answer is that ancient Egyptians’ 
understanding of the sky was framed within a worldview that bound to- 
gether inextricably the gods, the otherworld Duat, the afterlife, and what 


was seen in the night sky. It had long been engrained in ancient Egyptian 


minds that the sun god Ra traveled nightly through Duat, the world beyond 
the horizon, on his journey to the eastern side where the sky goddess Nut 
would give birth to him once again. Similarly, most of the stars in the sky 
disappeared from view for a period of some weeks in the year, between their 
heliacal set and heliacal rise; during this time they too were understood to 
pass through Duat. Likewise, the deceased were required to pass through 
the twelve parts of the underworld in order to join the gods in the sky. As 
far back as Old Kingdom times, pharaohs’ tombs contained sets of spells 
known as pyramid texts that were designed to ensure a safe passage. Cir- 
cumpolar stars, on the other hand, were immortal: ever present in the night 
sky, they never crossed the horizon into Duat, never died, and were never 
reborn. It was these stars that the human soul, striving for immortality, en- 
deavored to join. 

These beliefs, and especially the deep importance attached to the north 
direction with its imperishable stars, may well have given rise to a practice 
during Old Kingdom times of aligning tombs and temples with the cardinal 
directions. Pyramids from Saqqara onwards were oriented to the cardinal 
points, and at the Pyramids of Giza this was achieved with remarkable pre- 
cision. This practice of cardinal orientation also appears to have been fol- 
lowed, though not necessarily with such great precision, at Old Kingdom 
temples such as those at Abu Ghurab. Other celestial alignments have also 
been discovered at Old Kingdom temples and tombs. The great pyramid of 
Khufu, the largest of the three pyramids at Giza, contains two long shafts 
connecting the King’s Chamber directly to the outside world. Thought for 
many years to be mere ventilation shafts, it was discovered in the 1960s that 
one was aligned upon the star Thuban in the north, the closest thing to a 
pole star at the time, and the other upon Orion’s belt in the south. While it 
is possible that the alignments are fortuitous, it is more likely that they had 
a very real purpose relating to the journeys to the stars that the pharaoh 
would need to make in the afterlife. 

Various New Kingdom temples seem to have been aligned with the sun. 
The central axis of the Great Temple of Amun-Ra is aligned toward winter 
solstice sunrise. The main enclosure at Karnak also contains several other 
temples with solstitial orientations. This is scarcely surprising, given that it 
was the center of a sun cult, but the reasons that particular importance was 
attached to the winter solstice are unknown. The main axis of another great 
New Kingdom temple, Abu Simbel, was aligned upon sunrise on (in our cal- 
endar) October 18 and February 22. (This temple was moved in the 1960s 
out of the way of the floodwaters created by the Aswan Dam, but the align- 
ment was carefully preserved.) These dates were probably significant for cal- 
endrical reasons, but precisely what these were is hotly disputed. 


A number of enthusiasts have investigated possible astronomical align- 


ments at Egyptian temples and tombs over the years, going back to the pio- 
neering efforts of the German scholar Heinrich Nissen and the British physi- 
cist Sir Norman Lockyer in the late nineteenth century. Not only solar but 
also stellar and even lunar alignments have been claimed, but there are in- 
herent dangers in all this. The mere existence of an alignment does not prove 
that it was intentional, and the number of different structures in each tem- 
ple complex provides many putative alignments. Only recently have system- 
atic studies of temple and tomb orientations in ancient Egypt, sensibly inter- 
preted in the light of the broader knowledge that has been obtained over the 
years from a range of archaeological evidence, begun to be undertaken. Pre- 
liminary results seem to indicate that temples in the Upper Egyptian Nile val- 
ley were predominantly topographically oriented, although some astronom- 
ical orientations were included as well, especially upon the winter solstice 
sun. According to another recent idea, the builders of Old Kingdom pyra- 
mids perfected (over time) their orientation and proportions so as to achieve 


impressive illumination effects at the summer solstice and equinoxes.

Emu in the Sky 
When the Europeans arrived in Australia at the end of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, they found a huge diversity of Aboriginal languages and traditions, 
much of which has been irretrievably lost in recent generations. Sky myths 
and stories were of great importance to many Aboriginal groups. Like other 
aspects of the Aboriginal cultural heritage, they varied greatly from one 
group to another, but some common elements do emerge from the fragments 
that have come down to us. A good example of this is the celestial emu. 

The emu in the sky is a dark shape formed by dust clouds in the Milky 
Way. The clouds obscure the bright light behind them, and so appear as 
darker patches within the ribbon of diffuse light that encircles the sky. The 
emu’s head is a particularly clear and compact black patch known to mod- 
ern astronomers as the Coalsack, close to the Southern Cross. From here, a 
long neck runs along the Milky Way to a large body in the vicinity of Scor- 
pius, with the hint of legs below. All this is completely invisible in modern 
light-polluted city skies where even the Milky Way itself can scarcely be seen. 
In remote areas, however, on a moonless night, it can be magnificent: par- 
ticularly so when the emu “stands” on the horizon with its head halfway up 
toward the zenith. It is a huge and directly visible shape, looming darkly and 
imposingly behind the brilliant light of the foreground stars that fill the 
whole sky. For a Western observer unused to truly dark skies, recognizing 
the emu can come as a real shock, a moment of revelation that throws into 
a different perspective the Western predilection for forming constellations by 
joining stars with imaginary lines. This experience in itself serves as a re- 
minder that different ways of perceiving things not only exist, but can be 
compelling and unforgettable once the mind comprehends them. 

Earthly emus are unusual in that the male incubates the eggs and rears 
the young, and this was of great significance to male Aboriginal elders, who 


had the task of training boys in preparation for their initiation into manhood. 


It is said that the changing appearance of the emu in the sky served to indi- 
cate the time (of year) when initiation ceremonies should be held. It has also 
been claimed that some of the rather distorted forms of the emu appearing in 
Australian rock art owe their appearance to the shape of the celestial emu. 

The emu in the sky was recognized as such from one side of Australia 
to the other, although by no means universally or consistently. This has led 
some to propose that this particular celestial being may have a history that 
goes back thousands of years.

Equinoxes 

The word equinox is generally taken to refer to the days when, at every 
point on the earth, day and night are of equal length. But this definition of 
the equinox is a bit misleading. Since it gets light before the sun rises and 
remains light after the sun sets, the actual period of darkness at the equinox 
will be substantially less than twelve hours, the exact amount depending on 
latitude and how one defines the boundary between twilight and night. It is 
even misleading to say that the equinoxes are the days when the time be- 
tween sunrise and sunset is the same as that between sunset and sunrise, be- 
cause this definition assumes a flat horizon and the absence of atmospheric 
effects, particularly refraction. In practice, one cannot determine the equi- 
nox by measuring the length of time between sunrise and sunset. 

From an astronomical perspective, the definition of the equinoxes is 
much clearer. They represent the positions in the earth’s orbit where the axis 
joining the two poles leans neither toward nor away from the sun. These 
points are roughly a quarter of the way around from the two solstices, al- 
though not exactly, because the earth’s orbit is elliptical rather than circu- 
lar. It is also possible to express this technical definition from the perspec- 
tive of an earth-based observer, using the concepts of the celestial sphere 
and declination. The equinoxes are the times when the sun, in its progress 
along its annual circuit through the stars known as the ecliptic, crosses the 
celestial equator, in other words, when its declination is zero. This occurs 
twice in each year, at the vernal, or spring, equinox, which generally falls 


on March 20 or 21 in the modern (Gregorian) calendar, and the autumnal 


equinox on September 22 or 23. (Of course, spring and autumn are trans- 
posed in the southern hemisphere.) 

This concept of the equinox, in the sense in which astronomers use the 
term today, was a natural one for the astronomers of Hellenistic Greece, be- 
cause they were attempting to develop geometric models that fit the avail- 
able observational data. For example, Hipparchus in the second century 
B.C.E. developed a model of the motion of the sun around the earth in which 
the sun orbited in a circle at uniform speed but the earth was displaced from 
the center of the circle. If we were in Hipparchus’s shoes, approaching the 
problem geometrically, then we might naturally progress as follows. First, 
draw a circle to represent the sun’s orbit around the earth. Then divide it into 
quarter-points (the solstices and equinoxes). Then consider how these could 
best be determined through observation. Then measure the time intervals be- 
tween them (leading to the discovery that they are not uniform). Finally, try 
to find a way of modifying the model to fit the observations. The point of 
this exercise is to show that, while the equinoxes do enter this particular 
thought process quite naturally, this is only because we are approaching the 
problem in a geometrical way. What if, in common with many other human 
societies in the past, especially the prehistoric past, as well as in the indige- 
nous present, we were vot inclined to try to understand or explain the cos- 
mos using geometrical models? In other words, how relevant is the concept 
of the equinoxes likely to be among other human cultures in general? 

To add a further complication, when people use the term equinox in a 
cultural context, they commonly mean not the true equinox (as just defined) 
but the halfway point between the two solstices. Unfortunately, this, like the 
“night and day” definition, is problematic in practice. For a start, one might 
mean the halfway point in space or the halfway point in time. The first of 
these might be identified, say, by observing the rising points of the sun at the 
two solstices and then marking out the day when it rises halfway between 
them. The second would involve counting the number of days between the 
adjacent summer and winter solstices, then counting half that number of 
days. In the case of the spatial halfway point, unless one is close to the equa- 
tor, the sun does not rise vertically but at an angle. This means that, unless 
the horizon is smooth and flat, the resulting “equinoctial sunrise” could be as 
much as several degrees (and the resulting “equinox” many days) away from 
the true one. The temporal halfway point is less problematic, in that it is in- 
dependent of place, thus making it easier for us to spot if things were consis- 
tently aligned upon sunrise (or sunset) on that date. The engineer Alexander 
Thom did believe that this event was extensively known in prehistoric Britain 
and marked by monumental alignments; for this reason the day halfway in 
time between the solstices is sometimes referred to as the Thom equinox. Be- 


cause the earth does not orbit the sun at a constant speed, it actually occurs 


one or two days later in March, and earlier in September, than the true equi- 
nox, at a time when the sun’s declination is about +0.5 degrees. 

When monumental alignments are found facing close to east and west, 
such as the two passages at the passage tomb of Knowth in the Boyne Valley 
of Ireland, it is often assumed that they are equinoctial in the “halfway be- 
tween the solstices” sense. It is certainly easier to argue on pragmatic grounds 
that the “halfway” rather than true equinox was the one marked in prehis- 
toric times, in that the halfway point (whether in space or time) could have 
been identified using direct observations from the place concerned. However, 
this explanation leaves open the question of how this might have been 
achieved in practice, and to what precision. Identifying the Thom equinox, 
for example, requires an efficient system of recording or memorizing numbers 
of days up to at least 180 and presupposes that the solstices can themselves 
be defined to pinpoint precision—which is not self-evident, as is seen at the 
Bronze Age site of Brainport Bay in Argyll, Scotland. This is quite different 
from suggesting, for example, that past communities in temperate latitudes 
may have divided the seasonal year into two main portions, the start of sum- 
mer and winter halves being recognized and celebrated at times that happen 
to approximate the equinoxes. The point is whether the equinox existed as a 
meaningful concept for them, and hence a meaningful concept for us in try- 
ing to explain, for example, monumental alignments to the east or west. 

This question leads to another, fundamental question. Even if certain 
human societies in the past had the technical means to accurately determine 
the halfway point between the solstices, either in space or time, are they 
likely to have been motivated to do so? Historical and anthropological evi- 
dence suggests that the answer in most cases is no. To judge from historical 
and ethnographic examples, the norm is to identify dates that are significant 
in a local context, such as in a ceremonial calendar related to seasonal agri- 
cultural activities. Ceremonial significance might also be attached, say, to the 
day on which the sun rises or sets in line with a significant feature in the vis- 
ible landscape, such as a sacred mountain: an example of this occurs at Ca- 
caxtla in Mexico, The point is that space and time are generally not con- 
ceived in the abstract, as in the modern scientific tradition, but in relation to 
physically perceived objects and events. Now, the solstices are physically dis- 
cernible (to whatever precision) as the days when the lengths of day and 
night are at their longest or shortest. In addition, the solstitial rising and set- 
ting points of the sun have a concrete significance in any landscape as the 
limits of the sun’s motion, and the boundaries of those parts of the horizon 
where the sun can rise or set. The equinoxes, and the positions of equinoc- 
tial sunrise and sunset, on the other hand, have no inherent significance. Di- 
vision into two equal parts only tends to strike the modern investigator as an 


obvious way of subdividing up the arc of horizon where the sun rises, or the 


time between the solstices, because he or she perceives space and time in an 
abstract way in the first place. 

The fact that the equinox has, nonetheless, acquired crucial liturgical 
importance within the Christian world in connection with the timing of 
Easter is attributable to the roots of that tradition in the Classical world. The 
difficulties of recognizing and marking the equinox in medieval times were 
considerable, and this is reflected in the process and practice of orienting 
churches. 

But outside this context the evidence from around the world that peo- 
ple in the past were directly interested in the equinox (however defined) and 
intentional equinoctial alignments is rather thin. For instance, if we look im- 
partially at the patterns of orientation of local groups of European prehis- 
toric temples and tombs, rather than just picking out individual examples, 
then the evidence suggests a clear interest in the motions of the sun, mani- 
fested in many different ways in different places and times, but no clear pref- 
erence for equinoctial alignments. In Mesoamerica, to take another example, 
the easterly direction was itself of fundamental importance, and convincing 
evidence exists for horizon calendars marking sunrise at different dates in the 
year against topographic landmarks. However, there is little or no direct ev- 
idence of precise equinoctial alignments. Despite this, some researchers con- 
tinue to argue that topographic landmarks could have been used to mark off 
equal divisions of the year into quarters or eighths. 

When trying to interpret the orientations of ancient structures, it has 
become commonplace to apply a “toolkit” of potential astronomical targets 
in which sunrise and sunset on the solstices and equinoxes invariably appear 
at the top of the list. One problem is that the term “equinoctial” is often 
poorly defined and used all too often simply as a convenient label for east- 
west alignments. More seriously, it is usually considered self-evident (or else 
implicitly assumed) that the equinox was a meaningful concept, whatever 
the human society being investigated, and hence that sunrise or sunset on 
that date was a possible target for orientations. In fact, outside the frame- 
work of the modern Western scientific tradition (which has its roots in the 
Greek geometrical tradition), it is far from self-evident in most cases that the 
equinox was of any significance at all. 

The equinoxes, perhaps more than any other astronomical concept, 
demonstrate the dangers of applying Western concepts too readily and un- 
critically in interpreting the material remains of human cultures in the past. It 
is essential to deconstruct concepts that are particular to our own mindset if 
we want to understand actions that arise as a result of the mindsets of others.

Ethnoastronomy 

Paralleling the definition of archaeoastronomy, one can define ethnoas- 
tronomy as the study of beliefs and practices concerning the sky among 
modern peoples, and particularly among indigenous communities, and the 
uses to which people’s knowledge of the skies are put. The term ethnoas- 
tronomy seems to have been coined in 1973, not long after the term ar- 
chaeoastronomy, first appearing in the title of a review article by Elizabeth 
C. Baity, “Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy So Far,” in the journal 
Current Anthropology. There is no clear dividing line between archaeoas- 
tronomy and ethnoastronomy, and many would prefer simply to combine 
the two fields under one heading, such as cultural astronomy.

Ethnocentrism 

Ethnocentrism is the tendency to create a privileged view of our own (mod- 
ern Western) culture and hence to project our own ways of comprehending 
things onto the people we are interested in. Clearly, this is something to be 
avoided if we are trying to understand other ways of understanding the 
world, which is the broader agenda into which archaeoastronomy fits. 

In its most extreme form, ethnocentrism manifests itself as the tendency 
to judge the “achievements” of a past culture as if they can be measured on 
a linear scale with ourselves at the pinnacle. It is very easy to fall into this 
trap quite innocently, simply by praising some intellectual achievement of a 


past culture. Yet if a time machine took us to meet face to face with the peo- 


ple of whom we were speaking, they would surely find this practice im- 
mensely patronizing: from their point of view it would be we who are clearly 
failing to comprehend their way of viewing the world. Very likely we would 
be seen to have progressed only a short way up their scale of achievement. 

A problematic issue arises. To reach what people in the modern West- 
ern world, at least, would consider to be the most reasonable, reliable, and 
sustainable conclusions on the basis of the evidence available—for example, 
whether an astronomical alignment at a monument was likely to have been 
deliberate and, if so, what it meant to the people who created it—we must 
be scientific in the broadest sense. This is another way of saying that we 
must select the evidence fairly and consider it objectively, rather than just 
taking into account the evidence that fits our favorite theory and ignoring 
the rest. However, some argue that in order to avoid ethnocentrism we 
must not accord “our science” a privileged place in analysis and must even 
strive not to be objective. This problem is relevant in archaeology, and in- 
deed in many of the social sciences as a whole: it is a form of cultural rel- 
ativism that has caused a good deal of confusion and aggravation. The res- 
olution of this apparent paradox is simple. Even when we are studying 
other worldviews, and the context in which they operated, we must seek 
to comprehend them using our own mindset. Although we should avoid 
ethnocentric interpretations, we must still be “scientific” in our broad ap- 
proach to interpreting the evidence.

Extinction 

If you attempt to watch a star setting in the middle of the night, you may 
well be in for a disappointment. Unless the western horizon is a high one, 
as the star approaches it, it will gradually become dimmer and (depending 
upon a number of factors including, of course, the initial brightness of the 
star) may well disappear completely. Even in a location where the skies are 
little affected by modern light pollution, this will still be the case. The cause 
is atmospheric extinction—the absorption and dispersion of the starlight as 
it passes through the earth’s atmosphere on the last leg of its long journey 
to the human observer on earth. When a star appears close to the horizon, 
its light has to pass through many times as much atmosphere as when it is 


high in the sky. The practical effect is that surprisingly few stars—even 


bright ones—are actually visible at the moment of rising or setting, even in 
remote places on the darkest of nights. 

The effect of extinction is that a star will only be visible above a certain 
altitude, known as the extinction angle. That angle will depend upon the 
brightness of the star and upon atmospheric conditions. At high latitudes, 
where the celestial bodies rise and set at relatively shallow angles, extinction 
adds another confounding factor to any attempt to date a monument on the 
basis of postulated stellar alignments.

Fajada Butte Sun Dagger 
Fajada Butte is an isolated, 135 meter- (440-foot-)high column of rock at the 
southern entrance of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. In a precarious loca- 
tion on a narrow ledge are three stone slabs between 2 and 3 meters (7-10 
feet) in height, with narrow gaps between them, which lean against the cliff. 
On the cliff immediately behind the slabs are two spiral petroglyphs. For a 
few days around summer solstice, the larger spiral is directly lit by sunlight 
for just eighteen minutes. Shortly before noon, a spot of light appears right 
at the top of the spiral, quickly grows into a vertical dagger of light passing 
directly through the center, and then passes downward to disappear near the 
bottom of the spiral. On days before and after the solstice the dagger ap- 
pears for longer and to the right of the center, the displacement being de- 
tectable only two or three days away from the solstice itself. The smaller spi- 
ral manifests a similar effect at the equinoxes. At winter solstice the two 
light daggers frame the larger spiral by appearing down each side of it. 
This spectacle achieved considerable fame following its discovery in 
the 1970s and remains for many the best-known manifestation of ancient 
astronomy in the United States. Yet fierce debates surrounded it for many 
years, centering upon the question of whether the sun dagger was actually 
significant to, or even noticed by, the person or people who carved the spi- 
ral petroglyphs. It is not contentious to suggest that this inaccessible spot 
may well have had a sacred significance for ancient Puebloans. Neither is it 
difficult to envisage a sun priest coming here to conduct a lonely ritual, de- 
riving cosmic power and making suitable offerings when the sunlight 
showed that the time was right. This is not so different from practices 
recorded in later, historic Pueblo times. But was it really a sun shrine? Did 
the sun dagger phenomenon even exist when the spirals were first carved? 
The slabs have shifted slightly since the 1970s, probably because of the dam- 
aging effects of the large numbers of visitors resulting from the publicity the 
initial discovery received, and before the site was closed off to the public. 
This shifting raises the possibility that shifting also could have occurred in 


Fajada Butte viewed from the east at sunrise. The petroglyphs upon which the sun dagger falls are located high up the 
Butte on a narrow ledge. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


the centuries between the period when the site was in use and its discovery. 
We can take nothing for granted. 

Even ignoring this possibility, one much-debated question is whether 
the three slabs were placed in position or had simply fallen there naturally. 
Either way, placing the spirals to get the light daggers striking them in the 
correct way at the correct times would have been a formidable task involv- 
ing long days studying the patterns of sunlight and shadows against the half- 
hidden rock face. In the absence of any independent evidence, how can we 
judge whether this feat was actually achieved? The question must be turned 
about to focus upon our own methodology. It becomes a question of how 
likely we are to interpret wholly fortuitous phenomena as deliberate. Given 
rock art in a restricted location, how likely are we to be able to spot totally 
unintentional but nonetheless impressive light and shadow phenomena oc- 
curring at what we would take to be significant times? 

In the decade following the initial discovery, the team who had first un- 
covered the sun dagger phenomenon carried out further research at the site. 
As a result, they extended their hypothesis to suggest that the Fajada Butte 
petroglyphs were significant in relation not only to sunlight but to the light 
of the moon. At the time of moonrise, there would have been a sharp divi- 
sion between parts of the spirals lit up by moonlight and those still in 
shadow. But the motions of the moon are more complex than that of the sun, 
varying over an 18.6-year cycle known as the lunar node cycle. Lunar dag- 


ger configurations in relation to the spirals were duly identified, and the con- 


clusion was reached that the ancient Puebloans knew and recorded the 
longer-term motions of the moon. This conclusion was subsequently rein- 
forced by studies of alignments of various buildings in Chaco Canyon, which 
seemed to show significant alignments upon limiting moonrise and moonset 
positions that occur only around the times of lunar standstills, and these only 
occur once in every lunar node cycle. The alignment evidence proved highly 
controversial, both because of selection effects in the data and the fact that 
independent historical or ethnographic evidence of an interest in the lunar 
standstills as a concept is lacking anywhere in pre-Columbian or indigenous 
America. Ironically, what arose as an additional (lunar) elaboration of the 
original (solar) light-and-shadow idea turned out for many critics to under- 
mine it, since it raised serious concerns about how easy it is to see signifi- 
cance in things that are, in fact, purely fortuitous. 

The question remains: by focusing on the solstitial and equinoctial 
light dagger phenomena, might we be ignoring equally impressive but dif- 
ferent phenomena that occur at numerous other times of day and year? If 
so, then we should question whether the solstitial and equinoctial ones were 
really intentional. This is an issue that has been extremely difficult to re- 
solve until recently, with the development of a new visualization tool, 
which, at the time of writing, is on display at the Adler Planetarium in 
Chicago. This is a computer reconstruction of the Chaco petroglyph in 
three dimensions. It allows the user to set the time to any day in the year 
and any time of day, and to watch the light and shadow effects. Using such 
a tool, the user can reach an informed conclusion about whether the solsti- 
tial sun daggers are really so special. 

The consensus that has emerged after the many debates is that the dag- 
gers that appear at the summer and winter solstices could well have been de- 
liberate, and that the site may well have been a sacred place used as a sun 
shrine. This conclusion is considerably strengthened by a number of other 
“solstice daggers” that have now been found at other sites in the U.S. south- 
west. The lunar alignments at Fajada Butte, however, are almost certainly 


fortuitous, and the equinoctial ones remain open to question.

Field Survey 

The goal of archaeoastronomical field surveys is to assess the astronomical 
potential of a set of archaeological or material remains. Often we are inter- 
ested in structural alignments, asking where they point to on the horizon 
and what rises or sets there, or would have risen or set there at some point 
in the past. Sometimes we are interested in the interplay of sunlight and 
shadow. We might be interested to know, for example, the particular times 
of the year and day when sunlight suddenly streamed into the dark interior 
of a prehistoric tomb such as Newgrange in Ireland, or when streaks of sun- 
light or shadow fell in distinctive ways across the spiral rock carvings on 
Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon. 

It is, of course, possible to go to an archaeological site and simply ob- 
serve what happens, for example, at a sunrise or sunset. Being there in this 
way has the advantage that you can assess the visual impact of a phenom- 
enon first-hand and in context, and maybe spot alignments or light-and- 
shadow effects that might otherwise have been missed. For those lucky 
enough to be able to revisit a place on many different occasions, special ef- 
fects only visible at certain times may suddenly show up. Some important 
discoveries have certainly been made in this way, including the famous mid- 
winter sunrise alignment at Newgrange. However, there are dangers. An 
obvious one is that a site and its landscape may have altered significantly 
since earlier times: a monument may have been constructed and recon- 
structed in several stages or may have suffered damage more recently. Be- 
cause of this, effects that are spotted now may have appeared rather differ- 
ent, if they appeared at all, in the past. A more subtle danger arises because 
people are inevitably drawn to a site on what they perceive as special days, 
such as the solstices. If you spot an eye-catching effect on a day such as this, 
it is easy to forget that equally eye-catching effects might also be present on 
other days, thereby decreasing the likelihood that the solstitial effects were 


actually intentional and meaningful to the original builders. Yet another 


problem is that the rising and setting position of the celestial bodies may 
have been different then from now. How great a problem this is depends 
upon the astronomical body or phenomenon in question, the precision of 
the alignment or effect, and the time span that has passed since it was (os- 
tensibly) set up. 

For professional work, a set of methods and techniques has been es- 
tablished by archaeoastronomers over the years. These form an essential part 
of the broader study of archaeoastronomy, just as excavation and other field 
techniques form a central part of archaeology as a whole. 

For assessing alignments, the standard procedure is to determine the az- 
imuth and altitude of the relevant point or range of points on the horizon us- 
ing an instrument such as a theodolite or a magnetic compass and clinome- 
ter, depending upon the accuracy required. From this we are able to 
determine the declination, which provides an indication of what rises and 
sets there, or would have risen or set there at any given era in the past. In 
particular, it is not necessary to wait for a particular day such as the solstice 
in order to determine where the sun would have risen and set on that day, or 
on any other day in the year. Depending upon the accuracy required, it may 
also be possible to determine horizon data directly from large-scale topo- 
graphic maps or by analyzing digital topographic data using computer soft- 
ware such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This approach is also 
useful in helping to overcome practical problems such as the obscuration of 
the horizon by modern buildings or trees, or even the bad weather that might 
beset a survey. There is also great potential for using computer technology 
to combine three-dimensional reconstructions of sites, monuments, and 
landscapes with visualizations of the whole sky; this is a technique that re- 
mains to be fully exploited. 

For light-and-shadow effects, various forms of simulation are possible, 
including three-dimentional computer reconstructions. For example, at the 
time of writing, a simulation of a “sun dagger” that crosses one of the spi- 
ral petroglyphs at Chaco Canyon, where the user can set the day of the year 
and the time of day, can be viewed in the cultural astronomy gallery at the 
Adler Planetarium in Chicago. 

It is important to be rigorous in presenting the results of field surveys 
so that others can objectively assess the evidence. A photograph of a pretty 
sunset in a horizon notch behind a standing monument is generally of little 
value because it is unquantitative: there can often be great flexibility in 
choosing a suitable spot for taking the photograph, and one often has only 
the photographer’s word as to when the picture was taken. Scaled horizon 
diagrams and associated site plans are as essential to the archaeoastronomer 
as carefully drawn and scaled excavation plans are to the archaeologist. 


A vital, though less tangible, aspect of field procedure is selection of 


data. The mere existence of an astronomical alignment does not prove that 
it was intentional or meaningful in the past. This means that we must pay 
attention (some would say, strict attention) to selecting data fairly. It proves 
nothing to go to a site and, wittingly or unwittingly, choose the alignments 
that look promising astronomically while ignoring the rest. Selection criteria 
form an essential part of the methodology that underlies all archaeoastro- 
nomical fieldwork.

Fiskerton 

The site of Fiskerton in Lincolnshire, in the fenlands of eastern England, is 
one of a number of wooden trackways or causeways built during the Late 
Bronze Age and Iron Age (late second and first millennium BC) across 
marshes, shallow lakes or rivers at various locations in Britain and conti- 
nental Europe. Whether we might wish to classify them as “bridges” (con- 
necting dry land) or “jetties” (for example, leading out onto platforms over 
open water) is not always clear from the available evidence, but what they 
have in common may have to do less with this (to us) pragmatic aspect of 
their function as with their strong association with votive deposits con- 
nected with water. Underneath and along both sides of the Fiskerton cause- 
way, which was supported by two rows of upright posts, were scattered lit- 
erally hundreds of what appear to be votive offerings, including precious 
weapons such as daggers and swords as well as more mundane items of 
metalwork such as hammers. 

This is interesting enough in itself, but what sets Fiskerton apart is ev- 
idence that the causeway underwent major refurbishment at regular inter- 
vals. One of the advantages of ancient timber artifacts and constructions, 
where they remain to be examined by the modern archaeologist, is that they 
are susceptible to dendrochronology (tree-ring dating). This is a technique 
that can specify the date of felling to a particular year, and even season. 
Thus we know that the Fiskerton causeway was periodically maintained by 
adding new posts, and that the felling dates span a period of over a century, 
from 457 B.C.E. to 339 B.c.E. It appears that the felling took place predom- 


inantly in the winter or early spring, and that few if any timbers were sea- 
soned before use—in other words, they were put into use within a year. Re- 
markably, the causeway uprights seem to have been felled—and, by impli- 
cation, placed—at regular intervals of between sixteen and eighteen years. 

Given the evident sacred significance of the site, an obvious possibility 
is that the regular episodes of major refurbishment—likely accompanied by 
due ritualistic observances—were astronomically regulated. Archaeologist 
Andrew Chamberlain has examined the possibilities in detail. A prime can- 
didate would seem to be the Saros cycle. This represents a period after 
which the sun, moon, and earth return to almost exactly the same configu- 
ration in space. The upshot is that, at any time, the moon’s phase and po- 
sition in the sky are more or less identical to what they were eighteen years 
and eleven days before. In particular, if a lunar eclipse occurs once, then an- 
other is likely to occur eighteen years and eleven days later. Chamberlain 
concluded that the major episodes of construction were indeed correlated 
with total lunar eclipses—those associated with two particular Saros series 
(nos. 46 and 47). 

The implication here is that the people who used Fiskerton could pre- 
dict eclipses as opposed to merely reacting to them. Unfortunately, this ap- 
pealing conclusion may not be as clear-cut as it seems. For one thing, the 
fact that one lunar eclipse may be prominently visible does not necessarily 
mean that the next one in the given Saros series will be prominent as well; 
the successor may, for example, occur below the horizon during the day- 
time. Second, many different Saros cycles, running concurrently, produce 
eclipses from one year to the next. Third, some lunar eclipses will be missed 
on cloudy nights. In the absence of any form of counting or recording, the 
occurrence of total lunar eclipses observed from any given location could 
not seem anything but entirely irregular. There are some short-term cycles 
that, once recognized, will yield partial predictive success, but only after 
very careful recording maintained systematically over several generations 
(as among the ancient Babylonians) can longer-term cycles such as the Saros 
become evident. And even then, the Saros is not the only cycle that might 
be recognized: the ancient Chinese, for example, identified a shorter one of 
10 years and 334 days, while the Maya discovered a longer one of 32 years 
and 272 days. While we should not underestimate the capacity of people in 
Iron Age Britain to keep records had they been so motivated, we have no 
direct evidence of this. 

It remains possible that some of the bursts of construction at Fisker- 
ton were carried out in response to lunar eclipses, and indeed there is some 
evidence from other European trackway sites of correlations with various 
lunar eclipses that might support this conclusion. However, in this case the 


apparent regularity of the interval between the bursts of activity at Fisker- 


ton would have to be fortuitous, since people would have had no way to 
distinguish only those eclipses from particular Saros series. Further evidence 
and statistical analysis may clarify some of these issues. 

Despite all these imponderables, Fiskerton has a wider significance. 
One of the most important things about the sky as a cultural resource is 
that the regular cycles of the celestial bodies provide a way keeping the tim- 
ing of various activities in tune with nature. Yet archaeoastronomers are sel- 
dom faced with evidence that bears directly on this, since the time resolu- 
tion of most archaeological data is so imprecise. (Some have tried to use the 
astronomy to do the dating, but this is dangerous because it can so easily 
result in circular argument.) Even the best radiocarbon dating can seldom 
tie down a particular action to much better than the nearest century, and 
often the uncertainties are much greater than this. Fiskerton represents a 
rare example of a prehistoric site—certainly the first in Britain—where the 
timing of several successive bursts of activity can be tied down to the very 
year, if not the season. This enables us to ask not only whether they were 
correlated with the regular cycles of the heavens, but also whether they may 
even have had some connection to actual celestial events such as particular 
eclipses. This sets an important precedent for other places where we are 
lucky enough to be able to recover timber artifacts and monuments.

Governor’s Palace at Uxmal 

Uxmal is situated in the Puuc Hills region of northern Yucatan. One of the 
largest Classic Maya cities, it reached its apex around C.E. 800, then was 
suddenly abandoned, a fate shared by many other Maya centers during the 
ninth century. The various buildings that form its ceremonial center are 
straight-sided and consistently aligned (on a grid rotated by nine degrees 
clockwise from the cardinal directions), but with a single glaring exception. 
The so-called Palace of the Governor (a traditional name not necessarily re- 
lated to its original purpose)—one of the most splendid buildings on the 
site, an elongated rectangle in shape with a beautifully decorated facade 
containing seven entrances—is noticeably skewed from the common grid 
(by just under twenty degrees). 

The Governor’s Palace looks towards the distant (now ruined) pyramid 
of Cehtzuc, a little under five kilometers (three miles) away. (There is con- 
siderable confusion in the early literature, since Cehtzuc was originally 
misidentified as a different ruin, Nohpat.) This direction—east-southeast, or 
more precisely, an azimuth of 118 degrees—corresponds to the maximum 
southerly rising point of the planet Venus at around the time the temple was 
built. Another possibility, argued strongly by some scholars such as the 
Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Spraje, is that the Venus alignment actually op- 
erated in the opposite direction, from Cehtzuc toward the Governor’s Palace. 

If this were a prehistoric monument that we were investigating in the 
absence of historical or documentary evidence, then little credence would be 
placed on such an alignment. The planetary motions are notoriously com- 
plex, and their extreme rising or setting points are subject to complicated 
patterns of change operating on various time scales. Furthermore, the ex- 
tremes for all the planets are all fairly close together on the horizon and can

be difficult to distinguish, both from one another and from the sun and 
moon. Why should we believe that this Venus alignment (in whichever di- 
rection) was deliberate? The most direct answer is the abundance of Venus 
glyphs within the carved frieze on the front of the building—over three hun- 
dred of them. To one able to read Maya writing, the building fairly screams 
“Venus.” A recent reinterpretation of the hieroglyphic throne inscription 
above the central doorway has reinforced this conclusion by arguing that it 


depicts Maya zodiacal constellations and includes reference to Venus.

GPS Surveys 


Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers use signals from satellites to de- 
termine their position on the ground. Given a reasonably clear view of the 
sky, a standard GPS receiver can usually locate itself in the horizontal to 
within a few meters. This information is clearly useful in locating or relo- 
cating sites of interest, especially in remote areas, but it also has some uses 
in the course of archaeoastronomical field survey. Sometimes we wish to 
know the azimuth of a feature on a distant horizon, such as a mountain 
peak, in order to assess its potential astronomical significance. Then again, 
we might wish to know the azimuth of a reference point such as a church 
spire in order to calibrate a compass and clinometer survey. Given that the 
distant point is readily identifiable on a topographic map, one way to do 
this is to determine its coordinate position from the map, and to determine 
the coordinate position of the observing point using a GPS receiver. The az- 
imuth of the distant point can then be deduced. 

Standard GPS receivers are not accurate enough to be used for meas- 
uring the azimuth between two points (that is, determining the orientation 
of an alignment) unless the points in question align, in turn, with a distant 
landmark whose azimuth can be determined with the aid of a map, as al- 
ready described. Trying to determine the azimuth of one point from another 
simply by placing a GPS receiver at each of them would, given a ten meter 
uncertainty in the position of either, require the two points to be something 
like two kilometers (one and a half miles) apart in order to achieve half-de- 
gree accuracy in the result. Differential GPS receivers can be a good deal 
more accurate, perhaps determining a location to within one or two meters, 
but even then the two points would need to be several hundred meters (up 
to half a mile) apart for this technique to be of any use. 

Carrier-phase GPS receivers relate to standard GPS receivers as FM 
radio does to AM radio. Although still prohibitively expensive for most 
users, they have the potential to transform field survey techniques gener- 
ally in the near future. A carrier-phase GPS receiver has the capacity to de- 
termine a position to within a centimeter or two if not better. This should 
dispense with the need for heavy surveying equipment such as a theodolite 


in many cases, although even this sort of GPS receiver will experience dif- 


ficulties if there is not a clear view of the sky, for example because of build- 
ings or trees.

Grand Menhir Brisé 


The landscape around Carnac on the south coast of Brittany, northwestern 
France, is so full of megalithic monuments that one almost grows blasé 
about them. There are huge passage tombs (also referred to as passage 
graves) and other types of burial monument; great multiple alignments of 
standing stones several hundreds of meters (over a thousand feet) in length; 
stone circles and variants, known locally as cromlechs; and numerous indi- 
vidual standing stones, often themselves of considerable size (some are sev- 
eral meters [over 15 feet] high). Le Grand Menhir Brisé (the Great Broken 
Menhir) is situated close to the modern town of Locmariaquer, adjacent to 
two burial mounds of considerable size: a passage tomb known as the Table 
des Marchand (Merchants’ Table), and a 160 meter- (close to five-hundred- 
foot-) long tumulus known by its Breton name Er Grah, much of which was 
destroyed in the mid-twentieth century to make room for a visitors’ park- 
ing lot, but which has now been carefully restored. 

The Great Menhir stands out as by far the largest single standing stone 
in the area, indeed the largest standing stone in Europe; incredibly, it weighed 
well over three hundred tons and measured some 20.5 meters (67 feet) from 
its base to its tip. It does not stand now: at some stage it broke, the top part 
falling one way and the lower part in the opposite direction. The top part split 
into three on impact, so that the stone now lies in four huge pieces. The fact 
that the whole menhir did not topple over in the same direction implies that 
it could not have fallen while being erected, nor could it have been deliber- 
ately pushed over. The only viable conclusion seems to be that it was shaken 
from side to side by an earthquake: in other words, it fell naturally. 

The Scottish engineer Alexander Thom, famous for his interpretation 
of the British megalithic sites as solar and lunar “observatories” of consid- 
erable precision, interpreted the menhir as a “universal” lunar foresight that 
was used to track the changing rising and setting positions of the moon. The 
rising point of the moon moves up and down the eastern horizon (and sim- 
ilarly the setting point on the western horizon) between limits that are 


reached once every month. These limits themselves vary over a cycle of 18.6

Marchand visible in the distance. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


years, so that in every nineteenth year the range of rising (and setting) posi- 
tions of the moon is at its widest, while nine and a half years later it is at its 
narrowest. The outer and inner “limits of the limits,” where the moon rises 
and sets at times that are (rather misleadingly) referred to as its major and 
minor “standstills,” form eight lunar horizon targets that, if known, would 
have helped people keep track of the 18.6-year cycle. All eight horizon tar- 
gets were, according to Thom, accurately marked by the Great Menhir. This 
was achieved by carefully placing backsights some distance away in each of 
the eight opposite directions, to mark places where people could stand and 
observe the rising or setting of the moon in relation to the Great Menhir in 
the distance. 

Unfortunately, there are many problems with this interpretation. How 
could the positions of the backsights have been fixed without observing pro- 
grams lasting many generations? How useful would the “inner” target 
markers have been in practice? (The moon passes these positions twice every 
month!) What happened when a critical observation was missed owing to 
bad weather? Given these and many other concerns, people were quick to 
ask whether Thom’s evidence could really support such an idea. One prob- 


lem that soon emerged was that the alleged backsights formed a motley mix 


of prehistoric monuments, and in four out of eight cases were probably not 
genuine prehistoric monuments at all. Yet the landscape in this area is strewn 
with impressive monuments. Wouldn’t it be quite easy to find an equally 
convincing backsight in almost any direction from the Great Menhir? The 
answer, it is now generally agreed, is: very likely indeed. 

The importance of this example is methodological. How could Thom 
have been so selective with the evidence without realizing it? As we know 
from the accounts of those who worked with him, he merely set out to iden- 
tify suitable backsights in each of the eight directions he considered signifi- 
cant. Why didn’t he at least try some other, randomly chosen, directions as 
a control? The probable answer is that he was too convinced by his own the- 
ory—that Neolithic people observed the motions of the sun and moon to 
great precision—to feel it necessary. He was not alone in this. It is natural to 
want to find evidence that supports a favorite theory, especially if it is one 
that has taken a lifetime to develop. Yet it is precisely for this reason that cor- 
rect field methodology, which ensures that one gives due consideration to all 
the evidence, is so critically important. 

In fact, The Grand Menhir is now known to have stood at the end of 
an alignment of more than a dozen stones, varying in height. Most of the 
smaller stones in the row were subsequently felled and some at least were 
then reused in the construction of tombs. A split carving shows without any 
trace of doubt that one former menhir—possibly one of this row—was split 
asunder, with one end ending up as the capstone at the Table des Marchand 
and another as the capstone at the tomb of Gavrinis several kilometers away 
across a strait (it is now on an island). Not only does the very early date for 
menhir construction that this implies drive a final nail in the coffin of the lu- 
nar foresight hypothesis (since the lunar targets shift slightly over the cen- 
turies owing to the changing obliquity of the ecliptic). More importantly, it 
shows the potential complexity of the archaeological and chronological con- 
text, and the vital importance of taking this into account when formulating 


astronomical theories.

“Green” Archaeoastronomy 
This term denotes an approach in archaeoastronomy that is primarily con- 
cerned with developing rigorous procedures in studying the possible astro- 
nomical alignment of monumental structures. It involves developing strict 
criteria for data selection and fieldwork methodology, and the formal sta- 
tistical analysis of the results. This approach emerged in Britain during the 
1970s in the attempt to move alignment studies forward and as a response 
to the huge controversy between archaeologists and astronomers caused by 
the conclusions of Alexander Thom.

Gregorian Calendar 
In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII introduced a dramatic calendrical reform to 
overcome the problem with the existing Julian calendar: it was getting grad- 
ually further and further out of step with the seasonal (“Tropical”) year. 
The problem would not have occurred if the mean length of the year were 
exactly 365 days and 6 hours, but it is in fact somewhat shorter—365 days, 
5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. By the sixteenth century, the Julian 
calendar was running ten days behind the true solar year. 

The solution to the problem was two-pronged. First, the pope issued a 
decree that the day following October 4, 1582, would be October 15. This 


brought the calendar back in step with the seasonal year. Second, steps were 


taken to prevent a significant error from accumulating in the future. A 
scheme was introduced whereby in each subsequent period of four hundred 
years, three years that would have been leap years under the “every fourth 
year” rule now would not be. This makes the mean length of the calendrical 
year 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 20 seconds, which is only 34 sec- 
onds longer than the true (Tropical) year and means that the accumulated er- 
ror will not reach a full day again for some 2,500 years. The specific scheme 
adopted was that century years not divisible by four hundred would not now 
be leap years, that is, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc. 

Calendrical reform took place immediately in Catholic countries, but 
not surprisingly, in Protestant countries the pope’s decree was ignored. The 
Gregorian calendar was not adopted in Britain and its colonies until 1752, 
by which time the error had increased to eleven days, and in Russia until the 
Bolshevik revolution of 1917. In Ethiopia, the Julian calendar still remains 
in use, and the timing of Easter for Orthodox Christians in eastern Europe 
still follows the Julian calendar. 

Although it bears no direct relationship to ancient calendars, the Gre- 
gorian calendar is related closely to the seasonal year and so provides a con- 
venient frame of reference when discussing the timing of seasonal activities, 
astronomical observations, or the dates when the sun rose or set in line with 
temples or buildings. If we are interested in whether the orientation of cer- 
tain temples or buildings had a calendrical significance, we do have an ad- 
vantage where we know something of the calendar involved. An obvious 
case in point is the orientation of medieval churches, where we must be es- 
pecially careful to distinguish between the Gregorian calendar as our point 
of reference and the Julian calendar that was being used by the builders.

Group E Structures 
Uaxactiin is one of scores of Maya architectural complexes located in the 
Petén, a forested lowland region in northern Guatemala. From modest be- 
ginnings in the first millennium B.C.E. it grew to become one of the most im- 
portant Maya cities, the focus of a city-state that thrived for several cen- 
turies before finally collapsing around c.E. 900. 

A rather peculiar group of structures at Uaxactiin, known as Group E, 
was identified as far back as the 1920s as potentially having astronomical 


significance. The structures lie on opposite (western and eastern) sides of a 


plaza located on the eastern side of the ceremonial center of the city. (There 
are also structures to the north and south of the plaza, but these seem to be 
of secondary significance.) In around c.£. 200 an eight meter- (twenty-six 
foot-) high pyramid was built on the western side of the plaza, known to ar- 
chaeologists as Structure E-VII-sub. Later, this pyramid was covered by a 
fourteen meter- (forty-five foot-) high pyramid, Structure E-VII. Across the 
plaza on the eastern side was an elongated platform running lengthwise from 
north to south, upon which there were three buildings (“temples” E-I, E-II, 
and E-III), evenly spaced. Viewed from the western pyramid, the three build- 
ings to the east are approximately in line with sunrise at the summer solstice, 
equinoxes, and winter solstice, respectively. This was one of the earliest as- 
tronomical alignments to be recognized in Maya architecture, and the site 
became renowned as a “solar observatory.” 

A detailed investigation in the 1980s by archaeoastronomer Anthony 
Aveni and architect Horst Hartung confirmed that the solstitial and equinoc- 
tial alignments were precise, provided that the observer was standing about 
3.5 meters (11 feet) up the western pyramid. This, together with various 
strands of archaeological evidence, led them to propose that the whole struc- 
ture evolved in three stages. At first, E-VII-sub was a truncated pyramid 
standing only to about 3.5 meters (11 feet) high, and the eastern mound was 
a simple rectangular platform. An observer standing on the western pyramid 
would have been able to track the sun rising along the horizon behind—and 
just about level with—the eastern platform. The length of the platform just 
spanned the solar rising range. At some stage, the three “temples” were 
added. These provided points of reference against which precise observa- 
tions of the solstices and equinoxes could now be made. When E-VII-sub 
was completed to its full height, such observations could still be made by 
standing at the appropriate level on the eastern staircase, but all this changed 
when a new, larger pyramid was built over the top. An observer on this new 
pyramid would see the eastern horizon well above the eastern temples, and 
the precise alignments would no longer be functional. 

A skeptic examining the Group E alignments might well ask whether 
they could have arisen fortuitously. One approach to this problem would be 
to look for similar structures elsewhere, to see if they systematically incor- 
porate similar alignments. Such an approach has been used extensively in 
Europe, both to confirm suspected megalithic alignments and—as at 
Drombeg stone circle in Ireland—to isolate megalithic alignments that seem 
convincing in themselves but become less so when the site concerned is con- 
sidered as one of a group. In fact, over fifty architecturally similar structures 
are now known to exist at other Maya sites, mostly concentrated in the 
Petén within about a hundred kilometers (sixty miles) of Uaxactin: they are 


so similar to Group E that they have become known as E-group structures. 


These are broadly characterized by an eastern platform in the shape of an 
elongated rectangle supporting three equally spaced buildings in a roughly 
north-south line. There are several variants, including some with three sepa- 
rate constructions on the eastern side. Many of these, while clearly preserv- 
ing the general form, are so irregular that they could not reproduce the sol- 
stitial and equinoctial alignments found at Uaxactin, at least in anything like 
a similar way. 

One’s immediate reaction might be to dismiss the Uaxactin alignments 
as fortuitous. However, we have a plausible chronological development at 
Uaxactiin itself obtained by combining the archaeological and alignment ev- 
idence. This suggests another interpretation: that the other E-groups were 
nonfunctional copies of the Uaxacttin observatory. Just as in the later stages 
at Uaxactiin itself, they preserved a ritual significance that had its origin in 
real observations but no longer needed to be confirmed or reinforced by re- 
peating those same observations. Unfortunately, as dating evidence has 
slowly emerged, it no longer seems that Uaxacttiin Group E was a particu- 
larly early example of the genre. Many other E-groups were built at around 
the same time—the transition between the Late Preclassic Period and Early 
Classic Period around c.z. 200—and at least two seem to have been consid- 
erably earlier. Even more recently, other pseudo E-structures have been dis- 
covered that date from the Late Classic period (as late as the seventh century 
C.E.) but appear to incorporate functional solstitial alignments. A more sus- 
tainable argument, then, is that while Maya rulers in the northern Petén over 
a considerable time span desired to have one of these ritualistic complexes, 
the actual solar observations mattered more to some than to others. 

If solar observations were carried out at Uaxactin and some other E- 
groups, what then was their purpose? One possibility is that they related— 
at least originally—to an empirical calendar based upon direct observations 
of the horizon rising position of the sun. Such a calendar existed in this re- 
gion, it has been suggested, before an invasion from the north in about C.E. 
400 brought greater emphasis on the more abstract 260-day cycle that came 
to characterize calendars throughout Mesoamerica. Recent statistical analy- 
sis of the alignments incorporated in the Group-E-type assemblages does 
support the conclusion that many of them incorporated sunrise alignments 
on dates marking calendrically significant intervals. Even so, it may be mis- 
leading to portray even the functional E-groups as observatories, since they 
were primarily ritual complexes. It seems more likely that, where solar ob- 
servations actually took place, they served as much as anything to regulate 
calendrically related rituals or ceremonials. One of these may well have been 
the ball game—a sacred game played all over Mesoamerica and claimed by 
some scholars to have been played at the equinoxes, since they symbolized 


the time when the forces of nature were in balance. A great many of the E- 


groups are found close to a ball court—an arena where such games were 
played. In many cases, though, any association between the sun and the tim- 
ing of a ceremony such as the ball game did not need to be reaffirmed by 
making actual observations.

Ha‘amonga-a-Maui 

As ancient Polynesians voyaged across the Pacific, discovering and coloniz- 
ing a great variety of islands, the cultures they established developed in dif- 
ferent ways according to the environment and the available natural re- 
sources. At one end of the scale were sand and coral atolls where little but 
coconuts could be made to grow; lifestyle there was frugal, and many of 
these atolls were settled for only a short period before being abandoned. By 
contrast, in large and fertile island groups such as Tonga, the Society Islands, 
and the Hawaiian chain, populations thrived, and complex social hierar- 
chies and powerful chiefdoms developed. The Tongan Islands, in the heart- 
lands of ancient Polynesia, are unusual in that, never having been over- 
thrown by European invaders, the pre-contact social structure has in essence 
persisted without severe cultural disruption right up to the present day. 

On the largest Tongan island, Tongatapu, is found Oceania’s most fa- 
mous archaeoastronomical artifact: the coral trilithon known as Ha‘a- 
monga-a-Maui. According to tradition, its construction was ordered by 
Tu‘itatui, the eleventh sacred ruler of Tonga, in around C.E. 1200. It consists 
of three large coral monoliths, two standing and one placed as a lintel across 
the top, and bears an uncanny resemblance to the sarsen trilithons at Stone- 
henge in England. Nothing quite like it is known elsewhere in Polynesia. It 
is aligned along its length upon the rising position of the sun on the June sol- 
stice, and ceremonies to mark the occasion still take place. 

Despite the superficial similarity between Ha‘amonga-a-Maui and the 
Stonehenge trilithons, and the existence of solstitial alignments at both sites, 
it would be plainly ridiculous to posit a direct connection between these two 
sites on opposite sides of the world and separated in time by some three mil- 
lennia. Even so, it might seem impressive that human thought could develop 
in such similar ways at such different places and times. However, there is ab- 
solutely no historical evidence to back up the assertion that the Tongan 
alignment was significant at the time of its construction. The present tradi- 
tion dates no further back than 1967, when the King of Tonga, Taufa‘ahau 


Tupou IV, himself an amateur astronomer, began to take an interest in the 
alignment of the monument. 

In fact, valuable insights about ancient Tongan astronomy may be 
found by focusing less on monumental alignments and examining instead a 
broader range of customs and traditions, including contemporary ones. In 
Tonga, many cultural practices have been unusually well preserved, though 
constantly subject to modern influences. Stories and poetry frequently refer 
to topographic features in the landscape and describe the motions of objects 
in the sky. Designs on bark-cloth and incised markings on war clubs often 
incorporate symbols of the heavenly bodies. Dance movements can have sa- 
cred and cosmic significance. As all this reminds us, knowledge of celestial 
phenomena formed an integral element of worldview in Tonga as well as 
throughout Oceania and among human societies everywhere.

Hawaiian Calendar 

The Hawaiian islands were settled, probably in around c.£. 400, by Poly- 
nesians who had voyaged northwards across the Pacific for some 3,000 
kilometers (2,000 miles) from central Polynesia. This new island chain pro- 
vided a substantial land mass and a rich and fertile environment in which, 
over the subsequent centuries, agriculture developed and intensified, and 
the population thrived and multiplied. During the last two centuries or so 


before European contact, powerful social hierarchies developed, controlled 


by high chiefs (alii), with lesser chiefs, priests, and other specialists, and 
commoners (fishermen and farmers) being assigned to progressively lower 
ranks. There may also have been a lowest social class of slaves and outcasts. 
Everyday life, whatever a person’s rank in society, was pervaded by ritual 
observances and taboos tied to a strict calendar. This calendar derived from 
an earlier prototype, variants of which were in use all over Polynesia by the 
time of European contact. 

What we know of the Hawaiian calendar derives largely from three na- 
tive historians, David Malo, Samuel Kamakau, and Kepelino, whose ac- 
counts were first recorded in the mid-nineteenth century, in the decades fol- 
lowing the arrival of the Christian missionaries and the virtual eradication 
of indigenous religious practices. While broadly consistent, the three de- 
scriptions of the calendar differ markedly in many details. This variation not 
only indicates that there were significant differences from one island to an- 
other at around the time of European contact, but also suggests that the im- 
plementation of the calendar in practice, while following common princi- 
ples, operated on a local basis. In view of the broad similarities between the 
recorded Hawaiian calendars and those recorded elsewhere in Polynesia, the 
general principles were probably of considerable antiquity. 

The Hawaiian year, termed the makahiki, was divided into twelve 
months according to the phase of the moon. Most month names were used 
on more than one island and followed broadly the same sequence, but their 
timing in the seasonal year varied considerably from one Hawaiian island 
to another. The month Iki-iki, for example, was said to have occurred in 
March on O‘ahu, in May on the big island of Hawai‘i, in July on Kaua‘i, 
and in August on Moloka‘i. The main division of the year was always into 
equal summer and winter halves, but the two seasons were recorded as con- 
taining different sets of six months on different islands. All this might be 
taken as evidence that no additional (intercalary) month was ever inserted 
to keep the month sequence in step with the seasons, so that the sequence 
of months moved around in the solar year. Indeed, there is no record of an 
intercalary month being inserted, or of what procedure was followed in or- 
der to know when to do so. On the other hand, if there were no intercala- 
tion, then the timing of events that were fixed in the seasonal year (such as 
the beginning of summer) would progress on average by one month in every 
second or third year, and there is no evidence of this happening either. 

The Hawaiians did make use of observations of astronomical events 
fixed in the solar year. Piecing together fragments of the available accounts, 
it appears that the beginning of the summer and winter halves of the year 
were marked by two major annual events involving the Pleiades. The be- 
ginning of winter, in about November, was marked by the appearance of the 


Pleiades in the eastern sky just after sunset as opposed to rising later in the 


night (loosely, their acronical rise). The beginning of summer, in about May, 
was marked by the first appearance of the Pleiades in the eastern sky before 
dawn, after not having been visible at all for several weeks (their heliacal 
rise). The Hawaiian term for the new year is the same as that for the year 
itself, sakahbiki, and this appears to be a contraction of makalii-hiki, which 
means the rising of the Pleiades. 

Each month consisted (nominally) of thirty nights—Hawaiians 
counted the nights rather than the days—whose names, like those of the 
months themselves, differed somewhat from island to island or place to 
place. According to Malo, the day when the new crescent moon was first 
sighted was known as Hilo, meaning “twisted,” because slender and 
twisted was how the moon appeared, and he goes on to name the other 
twenty-nine nights. There is no explicit reference to the last night, Muku, 
being skipped in approximately every second month, but this must have 
happened in order to keep the months correlated with the lunar phases. 
Nonetheless, it is quite clear that a rich set of prognostications was attached 
to the various nights of the month. For example, according to Kepelino, po- 
tatoes, bananas, and gourds planted on the day following Hilo will thrive, 
while those planted on Ku-kolu, the fifth night, will “just shoot up like co- 
conuts” and be useless. Many native Hawaiians today still keep track of the 
phase of the moon and will only carry out certain activities, such as plant- 
ing crops, on the correct day or days in the month. People’s personalities 
were also seen as related to the night of the month on which they were 
born. Before the arrival of the Europeans, each month contained four tapu 
(taboo) periods dedicated to the worship of particular gods, when appro- 
priate ritual observances took place. Each was imposed at sunset and lifted 
at dawn two or three days later. 

The term makabiki not only referred to the new year and the year as 
a whole, but also to a period starting at new year and lasting, by most ac- 
counts, for some three or four months. It was a sort of prolonged harvest 
festival, during which normal labors were suspended, as was the regular 
monthly cycle of ritual observances and taboos associated with them. In- 
stead, a number of rites took place that were connected with the god 
Lono—who was particularly associated with (dryland) agriculture, fertility, 
and medicine—as well as with other gods in the Hawaiian pantheon. When 
Captain Cook first arrived on the Big Island of Hawai‘i, he was received 
and revered as Lono himself, but when he was forced to return just eight 
days after his departure, in order to repair a mast, he was killed. The deifi- 
cation of Captain Cook almost certainly owed a great deal to the timing of 
his appearance in relation to the calendar, which may also have had a bear- 
ing on his subsequent demise. The first arrival occurred, by good chance, 


during the makahiki festival when the mythical return of Lono was annu- 


ally re-enacted. The second happened inopportunely, after the makahiki pe- 
riod had finished. At this time Lono was meant to have departed, having 
fulfilled his annual task of regenerating nature, leaving the ali“ to rule in the 
normal way until the following year. His unexpected return constituted a 
threat to the perceived order of things and he met a ritualistic death. But 
this interpretation remains fiercely debated. The opposite view is that Cook 
was primarily revered as a visiting chief and met his end in a skirmish that 
had a very down-to-earth explanation—it resulted from his attempts to 
take an alii hostage in return for a stolen boat. 

A wider issue of considerable significance here is how outsiders should 
best try to comprehend, and hence to respect, indigenous traditions. Is it not 
demeaning to native Hawaiians, as the Sri Lankan anthropologist 
Gananath Obeyesekere has argued, to assume that they were incapable of 
recognizing a real threat and dealing with this threat in a “common-sense” 
manner by attacking the perpetrator? Or is it more demeaning, as the 
American anthropologist Marshall Sahlins has argued, to fail to recognize 
and respect the worldview within which Hawaiian religious beliefs and cal- 
endrical rituals operated, rather than trying to rate it against our own ra- 
tionality?

Heliacal Rise 

As the celestial sphere rotates, every star moves constantly around the line 
of a particular “latitude” or declination. This means that from any place on 
earth, every star that is not circumpolar will rise and set in the same posi- 
tions, day in and day out, year in and year out (although this is not the case 
on longer time scales). However, since the (diurnal) rotation period is 
slightly less than a day—approximately four minutes shorter—this means 
than the time of rising or setting will not remain the same but will be ap- 
proximately four minutes earlier each day. 

For any given place and any given star (apart from circumpolar ones), 
there will be a time of year, typically lasting a few weeks, when that star is 
not visible in the night sky at all, because it is rising at approximately the 
same time as the sun and setting at about the same time as the sun. In other 
words, it is up in the sky during the day, when it cannot be seen, and below 
the horizon at night. Gradually, however, the rising time will progress earlier 
and earlier each day until there comes a day when the star can be seen briefly 
in the morning sky before the sky brightens too much prior to sunrise. This 
is known as the heliacal rise. After this, the star will rise progressively ear- 
lier, getting ever higher in the sky before it is lost in the pre-dawn twilight. 
Eventually, the star will reach a point, typically five months or so after the 
date of heliacal rise, where it crosses the sky from east to west during the 
night and can just be seen to set before the sky brightens. This first visible 
setting is often referred to as the acronical set, although the term strictly ap- 
plies when the star sets at sunrise, an event that will already have passed un- 
noticed some days earlier. At around the same date, the star’s rising time will 
have moved back through the night and be approaching the previous sunset. 
The last time the star can be seen to rise before this occurrence becomes lost 
in the evening twilight is often referred to (again loosely) as the acronical 
rise. During the ensuing months the star will be rising in daylight but setting 
ever earlier during the night. Finally, the day will come when it can only be 
seen briefly in the evening sky after sunset before itself setting, after which it 
will once again become invisible. This is known as the heliacal set. 

This general series of events—disappearance, heliacal rise, acronical 
rise/set, heliacal set, and then disappearance again—holds for all stars 
apart from circumpolar ones, which never rise or set. On the other hand, 
details such as the length of disappearance, and whether acronical rise oc- 
curs before or after acronical set, will depend upon the brightness of the 
star, the latitude of the place, the declination of the star, and even atmos- 
pheric conditions (since these can affect the visibility of a star in the 
evening or morning twilight). Nonetheless, for any particular star and 
place of observation, the approximate dates of the various events can be 


reliably specified. 


The terms heliacal rise and heliacal set are also applied to planets and 
have the same meaning of “first appearance in the pre-dawn sky” and “last 
appearance in the evening sky,” respectively. However, the apparent motions 
of the planets are more complex than those of the stars, and those of infe- 
rior and superior planets are fundamentally different from each other.

Hesiod (Eighth Century B.c.E.) 

Ancient Greece is well known as the place where the modern science of as- 
tronomy has its roots. This resulted from the blending together, in the Hel- 
lenistic era that followed the conquests of Alexander the Great in the latter 
part of the fourth century B.C.E., of two earlier traditions: a Babylonian tra- 
dition of careful empirical observation and a Greek tradition of cosmolog- 
ical and philosophical theorizing about the cause of observed phenomena. 
It is easy to forget that the classical world not only contained famous 
philosophers and astronomers—Plato, Aristotle, Aristarchus, Apollonius, 
and Hipparchus—but also contained common people, such as farmers, who 
made use of observations of the sun, moon, and stars in going about their 
everyday activities, as they had done for many generations. 

Hesiod was a farmer who lived in central Greece in the eighth century 
B.C.E. He was also a poet, and his epic Works and Days was written to be 
chanted or sung. It was passed on for many generations and eventually writ- 
ten down three centuries later, whence it has come down to us. Thanks to 
Hesiod we know something of the ways in which his contemporaries regu- 


lated their activities through the seasons by watching the skies, thereby help- 
ing to overcome the vicissitudes of the climate. Works and Days contains a 
series of tips about signs to watch for and what to do in response to them— 
a sort of farmer’s almanac that could be easily memorized and recited. Tips 
such as those contained in Hesiod’s poem had doubtless been carefully ac- 
cumulated and passed down over many generations. 

The Works part of Works and Days refers to many seasonal astro- 
nomical indicators that make good sense from a modern perspective. For 


example: 


At the time when the Pleiades, the daughters of Atlas, are 
rising, 
begin your harvest, and plow again when they are setting. 
The Pleiades are hidden for forty nights and forty days, 
and then, as the turn of the year reaches that point 
they show again, at the time you first sharpen your iron. 
(Works and Days 383-387.) 


Descriptions such as this one of the changing appearance of the 
Pleiades refer to observable events in the skies that are tied to the seasons, 
and give good practical advice. So useful are these types of observation—and 
in particular observations of the heliacal rise (first pre-dawn appearance) of 
stars and asterisms—as seasonal indicators, that similar practices have 
evolved, and persisted, as an aid to subsistence all over the world, from pre- 
historic times right up to the present day. 

The Days part, in contrast to the Works, contains prognostications as- 
sociated with the phase of the moon that, from a modern scientific perspec- 
tive, represent no more than irrational superstition. However, it is important 
to realize that, to the farmers of the time, there was no fundamental distinc- 
tion between the two parts: they would have viewed them on equal terms. 
This illustrates an important general principle. In attempting to interpret an- 
cient practices relating to astronomy, we can rarely separate what, from a 
modern perspective, might appear to be “rational” behavior with pragmatic 
outcomes from “irrational” actions that are only explicable if one knows 
something about the prevalent systems of beliefs.

Hopewell Mounds 

The custom of mound building was widespread in eastern North America 
prior to European contact, and it was long-enduring. Earthen burial 
mounds were built as far back as the fourth millennium B.c.£. The tradition 
spread and developed until reaching a culmination that lasted from the late 
second millennium B.c.£. until well into the mid-second millennium c.k. It 
was characterized by the construction of huge earthworks typically several 
hundred meters (more than a thousand feet) across—comparable in size to 
the largest British henges, such as Avebury. These earthworks are found 
down the Mississippi valley from Wisconsin to Louisiana, as well as east- 
wards into Ohio in the north and Alabama in the south. A distinctive phe- 
nomenon within the mound-building tradition, particularly from the late 
first millennium C.E. onwards, was the construction of effigy mounds— 
earthworks in the form of birds, animals, (occasionally) people, and more 
abstract designs. Serpent Mound in southern Ohio is one of the best-known 
examples of these. 

The number of mounds built by ancient native North Americans is 
staggering: over fifteen thousand examples have been documented within the 
state of Wisconsin alone. Sadly, many have been obliterated and others only 
survive as almost imperceptible bumps in ploughed fields. Still others have 
met more distinctive fates—such as the enclosure in the shape of a conjoined 
circle and octagon at Newark in Ohio, which has been landscaped into a golf 
course. The largest were on a grand scale, and in just a few cases one can still 
gain a sense of how impressive they must originally have been. 

The peoples who adopted the practice of mound building were many 
and various, each doubtless turning the practice to their own purposes. 
These peoples occupied a variety of woodland and valley environments and, 
over the centuries, developed new modes of subsistence. One of the clearest 
transitions was the adoption of maize as a staple food in the late first mil- 
lennium c.£. Archaeologists identify a number of distinctive cultural assem- 
blages: Poverty Point, named after the earliest known large ceremonial earth- 
work in the lower Mississippi valley, dating to around 1200 B.c.E.; Adena, 
in the Ohio valley in the mid-first millennium B.c.£.; Hopewell, which flour- 
ished later in the same area; and Mississippian, in the first part of the second 
millennium C.£., its most famous site being the great center of Cahokia, sited 
close to modern St. Louis. 

The Hopewell assemblage is characterized by enormous enclosures in 
the shape of circles, squares, and other clear-cut geometrical shapes, gener- 
ally thought to have been built between about 200 B.c.£. and c.z. 400. These 
are often found in association and even connected together, as at Newark. 
From an engineering perspective they are awe-inspiring, which has led to 
much speculation about other aspects of their construction, such as the use 


of precise measurement units and the incorporation of astronomical align- 
ments. The latter include a number of solstitial alignments: for example, 
along the diagonal axis of several square earthworks, such as Hopeton, An- 
derson, Dunlap, Hopewell, and Mound City. Even the Serpent Mound—be- 
longing to the later effigy mound tradition—has its head pointing at least 
roughly toward midsummer sunset. Various alignments upon potentially sig- 
nificant horizon rising and setting positions of the moon have also been 
claimed. The best known of these is the axis of the circle-octagon at Newark, 
which is aligned upon the most northerly rising position of the moon. 

One thing is certain: these sites were not astronomical observatories. 
They served a variety of purposes. The geometrical earthworks demarcate 
large spaces, and it is generally assumed that they functioned, among other 
things, as ceremonial centers. One suggestion is that rituals related to bury- 
ing the dead changed over time into grander ceremonials aimed at ensuring 
the continuance of world order and seasonal renewal. This explanation cer- 
tainly fits the archaeological evidence of burial mounds gradually becoming 
transformed into large ceremonial earthworks. If so, it reflects a modifica- 
tion in the way people expressed and acted upon their beliefs relating to 
death, ancestors, and regeneration. 

If these great earthworks were focuses for ceremonial activity preserv- 
ing the world order, then they would surely reflect that perceived world or- 
der in their overall design. But how do we go about trying to understand this 
in any detail? One possibility is to examine modern indigenous worldviews 
in the region, on the basis that some aspects of early indigenous American 
cosmological beliefs may have survived through to modern times. For ex- 
ample, in the case of Wisconsin effigy mounds it has been suggested, by com- 
parison with modern indigenous beliefs there, that the bird-shaped mounds 
were representations of powerful spirits inhabiting the upperworld, while 
land and water animals represented spirits of the lowerworld. Clusters of ef- 
figy mounds, then, both reflected—and preserved—the balance between the 
two realms of nature, earth and sky. (Other modern groups conceive of three 
realms—sky, earth, and a watery underworld—but the same general princi- 
ples apply.) 

Hopewell mounds are more distant in time from the indigenous pres- 
ent. Yet, just as modern traditional houses of many native North American 
groups reflect the fundamental perceived division of the (horizontal) world 
into four quarters, demarcated either by the cardinal or solstitial directions, 
so many of the Hopewell earthworks have a fourfold symmetry and are car- 
dinally or solstitially aligned. More speculatively, it has been suggested that 
circles and squares (or octagons) might themselves represent the earth and 
sky. When conjoined, as at Newark, they would have represented the whole 


universe in microcosm, defining spaces in which ceremonies or other activi-

ties could be performed that were suited to each realm, dedicated to keeping 
each in its natural balance with the other. 

However close to the truth such speculations might be, it is clear that 
any astronomical alignments that were intentionally built into the Hopewell 
mounds formed part of a much wider set of symbolic associations that 
helped to affirm the perceived order of things. Solstitial alignments, if de- 
liberate, were not very precise. But if their purpose was merely to demar- 
cate the four divisions of the cosmos, they did not need to be. The horizon 
rising and setting positions of the moon, on the other hand, have no place 
in modern native American thought, which is one reason why many ar- 
chaeoastronomers remain unconvinced that such alignments were inten- 
tional. The other is that the alignments do not seem to occur in any consis- 
tent way.

Hopi Calendar and Worldview 

The Hopi people of Arizona remained almost undisturbed by European in- 
fluences until about 1870. A number of traditional Hopi villages were situ- 
ated on the very edges of mesa tops overlooking the surrounding barren 
plains, and Walpi, located particularly precariously on the top of a narrow 
mesa with precipitous cliffs on three sides, has remained relatively unspoiled. 
The inhabitants of Walpi are known to have observed an elaborate ceremo- 
nial calendar. The entire year was punctuated with ceremonies whose purpose 
was to “assure vital equilibrium, both social and individual, and conciliate the 
supernatural powers in order to obtain rain, good harvests, good health, and 
peace” (Ortiz 1979, p. 564). Some were carried out in public and some in pri- 
vate. Some were of considerable duration: a celebration lasting nine days oc- 
curred at the time of winter solstice. The calendar was regulated by carefully 
tracking the horizon rising position of the sun against various distant land- 
marks from different observing positions in and around the village. 

The Hopi calendar, as practiced at Walpi and other traditional villages, 
provides a fine example of a seasonal calendar regulated by horizon sun ob- 
servations. First recorded by the ethnographer Alexander Stephen in the 
1890s, it has attracted a good deal of attention because it achieved an accu- 
racy that many commentators found remarkable, generally keeping within 
two or three days of the “true” solar year. As a result, it has sometimes been 
portrayed as a classic example of the use of horizon sun observations to reg- 
ulate crop planting and other subsistence activities, and so it is. Yet this only 
represents one aspect of the whole picture. The elaborate ceremonials (“rit- 
ual performances”) that accompanied the various seasonal subsistence tasks 
were a vital part of an annual round of activities that—although we might 
try to break them up into those that were more “sacred” and those that were 
more “secular” or pragmatic in character—represented to the Hopi an inte- 
grated way of harmonizing human actions with cycles of events in the natu- 
ral world. The calendar and all its associated ceremonies, in other words, 
had a key role in reaffirming the natural (cosmic) order. 


This cosmic order also had spatial characteristics. These are reflected in 


the way people perceived the horizon and the whole landscape around them, 
and attributed meaning to different places. Working with the Hopi in the 
1970s, historian Stephen McCluskey found out that the points on the hori- 
zon behind which the sun rises and sets at the solstices are themselves sacred 
places. Some of them are visited at the appropriate times of the year, when 
decorated prayer sticks and other offerings to the sun are placed on shrines. 
The place of midwinter sunrise in the southeast is the house of the sun, out 
of which the sun is said to come eating from a red stone bowl. The place of 
midsummer sunset in the northwest is the house of Huzruing wubti, “hard 
being woman,” who is associated with hard substances such as shells, corals, 
and turquoise. The sun stands directly above her house before descending 
into it through a hatchway in the roof (Ruggles 1993, 40). 

Observations of the sun rising and setting at the solstices themselves are 
actually superfluous to the ceremonial calendar, since the sun’s day-to-day 
movement at these times is minuscule and there are no suitable foresights 
that would aid precision. The solstitial directions are important for a differ- 
ent reason: they mark the four principal directions that are sacred in the 
Hopi worldview, fundamental axes that divide the world into four parts cen- 
tered upon a particular village. These directions are not conceived as geomet- 
rical abstractions but as empirical realities with a variety of symbolic associ- 
ations. They result in a conceptual quartering of the world, or quadripartite 
cosmology, a type of worldview that is found, in different variants, among 
other indigenous American groups such as the Navajo and Pawnee. 

Each of the mesa-top villages, then, had an associated “sacred geogra- 
phy” in which particular places in the landscape had specific meanings, 
many were sacred, and the village itself stood at the center of things. This 
view of the world was derived through experience and constantly reinforced 
in myth and practice. It contrasts absolutely with the Western view of land 
as a resource to be exploited. 

The Hopi calendar did (and does) not simply regulate crop-planting ac- 
tivities but constantly reaffirms the structure and correct functioning of the 
Hopi cosmos.

Horizon Calendars of Central Mexico 

Since the emergence of archaeoastronomy in the 1970s, there have been 
numerous studies of the orientations of temple-pyramids and other con- 
structions in the central Mexican highlands and throughout Mesoamerica. 
Particular attention has been paid to the Valley of Mexico, in which peo- 
ples had dwelt for millennia before the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, was 
eventually founded at what is now the center of Mexico City. Numerous 
instances have been identified of orientation upon sunrise at the solstices 
and on the day of solar zenith passage, as well as on other calendrically 
significant dates. 

It has also been proposed that horizon calendars were developed by di- 
rect observation of the movement of sunrise on successive days along moun- 
tainous horizons full of natural foresights and reference points. Some re- 
searchers have argued that surprisingly many sunrise alignments correspond 
to dates separated from the solstices by intervals of 20, 52, 65, or 73 days— 
numbers that are also encapsulated in the intermeshing cycles of the 
Mesoamerican Calendar Round. Among the independent strands of evi- 
dence in support of this idea is the fact that the first appearance of the noon- 
day sun in the Xochicalco zenith tube occurs exactly fifty-two days before 
the June solstice, and the final appearance fifty-two days after. These suc- 
cessive fifty-two-day intervals are particularly intriguing because the interval 
between them (at Xochicalco, the length of the period of darkness before the 
sun starts to appear at noon again) is more or less 260 days, the length of 
the calendrical cycle known as the tonalpobualli. 

A more controversial suggestion is that horizon calendars were tied to 
concepts of space, with intervals in time corresponding to horizon sunrise 
positions separated by multiples of an angular unit of around 4.5 degrees. 
However it is more likely that the true significance of dates encapsulated in 
intentional sunrise alignments had to do with a much richer set of perceived 
connections—between temples, the perceived dwelling places of the gods, 
the correct place and timing of tributes to ensure seasonal renewal, and so 
on. In other words, the horizon calendars only made sense in the context of 
complex schemes of sacred geography. 

One idea is that horizon calendars might have been developed in the Val- 
ley of Mexico at a very early date and may have helped stimulate the devel- 


opment of the Mesoamerican Calendar Round that is well known from his- 


torical and documentary evidence. One of the main proponents of this idea is 
the Austrian-born anthropologist Johanna Broda, who argues that an early 
horizon calendar existed at Cuicuilco, a large Preclassic temple-pyramid dat- 
ing from the first millennium B.c.E. whose ruins are now lost within the sub- 
urbs of Mexico City. This temple, argues Broda, was built on an observation 
point where some of the natural features of the eastern horizon happened to 
mark—and others came to define—significant calendrical dates. 

There are three strands to the argument. First, the main peaks on the 
eastern horizon correlate particularly well with sunrise on calendar dates 
that were significant in the later Mesoamerican calendar and some of 
which continue to be significant to the present day. Second, there are co- 
incidences between these sunrise dates and the dates of the calendrical rit- 
uals performed at shrines erected on the slopes of some of the relevant 
mountains. And finally, the visual lines that connect Cuicuilco with the 
mountain peaks on the eastern horizon pass through a number of histori- 
cally significant settlements, sacred mountains, and shrines, implying a 
network of sacred lines in the landscape that remained significant, and 
continued to be respected, over a long period. Broda’s scheme has since 
been reassessed and modified by the Slovenian archaeoastronomer Ivan 
Sprajc, but he has confirmed the idea that calendrically significant inter- 
vals were marked at Cuicuilco. 

This type of investigation raises a number of methodological questions 
that are more familiar from “green” archaeoastronomy and reassessments 
of British ley lines. Yet it rests on much firmer ground because of the abun- 
dance of historical evidence concerning sacred geography in ancient 
Mesoamerica.

How the Sky Has Changed over the Centuries 
The actual positions of the distant stars in space relative to one another 
have only changed by minuscule amounts over many millennia. This means 
that the distinctive patterns of the constellations visible in today’s skies 
around the world have not changed significantly since early prehistory. On 
the other hand, the rising and setting positions of particular stars as viewed 
from a given spot, although constant day after day and year after year, do 
change significantly on a time scale of centuries. On this time scale, the 
whole mantle of stars shifts on the celestial sphere owing to a phenomenon 
called precession (short for the precession of the equinoxes). This shift has 
important methodological implications whenever we try to interpret appar- 
ent alignments upon stellar targets at ancient structures whose date can 
only be determined archaeologically to within a span of a few centuries. 

The rising and setting positions of the sun, moon, and planets are not 
affected by precession but do nonetheless change by a smaller amount ow- 
ing to a distinct phenomenon known as the change in the obliquity of the 
ecliptic. For example, in an equatorial location, the difference between the 
horizon position where the sun rises or sets at one of the solstices now and 
the corresponding position in 2000 B.c.E. is about the same as sun’s own di- 
ameter. (In temperate zones the difference is slightly greater, because the sun 
rises or sets at a shallower angle rather than almost vertically.) 

Some astronomers have argued that the appearance of spectacular 
comets and meteors occurred much more frequently at certain epochs in the 
past, for example during the Bronze Age. Since this would also have resulted 
in an increased probability of meteoritic impacts, the idea is usually dis- 
cussed in the context of catastrophism, the idea that major natural catastro- 
phes could have affected humanity in the past.

Inferior Planets, Motions of 

The planets Venus and Mercury revolve around the sun on orbits inside 
that of the earth. And because they are on closer orbits, they move faster. 
Suppose for a moment that the earth simply vanished, leaving a sentient 
space monster orbiting the sun in its place, its head upward to the north, 
For want of anything better to do, the monster decides to ignore everything 
else in the sky but the sun and Venus, keeping its face toward the sun and 
watching Venus gradually progressing around it. At intervals it sees Venus 
at its closest approach come rattling past between it and the sun, then pull 
rapidly away to the right. The time when Venus passes the sun (only rarely 
will it pass directly in front of it) is known as inferior conjunction. As 
Venus continues to arc round the sun, its rightward motion decreases, but 
it continues to get farther away (and hence it also gets fainter). At some 
point, well before it has gained on the earth-monster by a quarter of an or- 
bit, it will be at its furthest angle rightward from the sun, known techni- 
cally as the point of greatest elongation. Thereafter Venus appears to move 
leftward toward the sun again, but ever more slowly, as it heads round to 
the far side of the sun from the earth-monster. Eventually, it passes behind 
the sun, an event known as superior conjunction, and then gradually 
emerges to the left. The sequence is now repeated in reverse and in mirror 
image, the planet increasing in proximity and brightness, gradually at first, 
then reaching its greatest elongation to the left of the sun, and finally mov- 
ing rapidly once again toward inferior conjunction. 

The sequence of events for an earth-based observer reflects those just 
described, except that we view them from the surface of a spinning planet. 
An observer in the northern hemisphere perceives the celestial sphere to be 
turning to the right. If Venus is to the right of the sun, it rises earlier, passes 
across the sky to the right (west) of the sun, and sets earlier. The directions 
are reversed for an observer in the southern hemisphere, whose perceptions 
can be modeled by turning the space monster upside down. 

Just a few days after inferior conjunction, then, Venus suddenly ap- 


pears in the eastern sky before sunrise. This event as known as the heliacal 
rise—a similar concept to the heliacal rise of stars. The planet is already 
bright, and in a few more days it dominates the dawn sky, easily the bright- 
est object apart from the sun and moon. As it draws rapidly away westward 
from the sun, it rises earlier and climbs higher in the sky by sunrise, until at 
greatest (western) elongation it can be visible in the pre-dawn sky for as much 
as three hours. This occurs about seventy-one days after inferior conjunction. 
Subsequently, it draws closer to the sun once again but much more gradually, 
steadily losing brightness as its distance from the earth increases. After a fur- 
ther 180 days or so, it disappears from the pre-dawn sky. This time—around 
superior conjunction—it remains hidden for much longer, around fifty days 
on average. The cycle is then repeated, in reverse, in the evening sky. Toward 
the end of this period it dominates the western sky after sunset. Then it rap- 
idly disappears from the evening sky (this is known as the heliacal set). This 
is followed by inferior conjunction, and the cycle is repeated. 

It may seem strange at first that Venus can only ever be seen during a 
short period around dawn or dusk. It never appears in the middle of the 
night, which would imply that it was opposite to the sun in the sky—that the 
earth was between the sun and Venus. However, since Venus is on a closer 
orbit to the sun, the earth can never be between Venus and the sun. 

The period between successive occurrences of the same configuration 
(the synodic period) of Venus is 584 days, the average periods of visibility 
and invisibility being 263, 50, 263 and 8 days. It is an accident of nature that 
five Venus synodic cycles equate to almost exactly eight years, the difference 
being less than three days. This means that whatever Venus’s appearance on 
a particular date, it will be almost exactly the same eight years (minus two 
days) later. It also means that the motions of Venus (over eight years) can be 
correlated with the seasons. Both of these facts had a particular significance 
in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. 

Mercury is much closer to the sun and orbits it in a much shorter time, 
but its apparent motions follow a similar pattern. Its synodic period is just 
116 days, the average periods of visibility and invisibility being 38, 35, 38 
and 5 days (with quite wide variations).

Inuit Cosmology 

The Inuit peoples, who live (mainly) in the extreme north of Canada, oc- 
cupy one of the most hostile and challenging environments in the world. 
Their communities, scattered over eight thousand kilometers (five thousand 
miles) from the eastern tip of Siberia eastward to the west coast of Green- 
land, seem to an outsider to represent outposts in a vast, icy wilderness. Yet 
to the Inuit themselves the Arctic tundra is a homeland—the central part of 
which now forms the Canadian territory of Nunavut—that for countless 
generations has provided a variety of resources deriving from both land and 
sea animals and is navigable by kayak and dog-drawn sled. 

The survival of human communities in such an inhospitable environ- 
ment seems, to most outsiders, nothing short of miraculous. How survival 
was achieved varied from place to place, according to the resources avail- 
able. Thus for the central Inuit, living around Hudson Bay, subsistence 
needs had to be satisfied in very different ways during the two seasons of 
the year. Winters were traditionally spent in fixed coastal settlements, with 
sea mammals the main source of food and other essentials. Summers were 
traditionally spent in temporary camps while hunters followed the caribou 
herds and other land animals. This basic dichotomy is reflected in central 
Inuit people’s conception of the structure of the world. So, too, are gender 
qualities. For example, women are regarded as belonging more to the sea, 
sea mammals, and the winter season, while men belong more to the land, 
land animals, and summer. Such principles determine the materials of 
which, say, hunting (male) and sewing (female) tools are made; they can 
also influence the orientations of male and female burials. Similar principles 
also extend to a number of perceived Other Worlds: the Land of the Moon 
Spirit, Birdland, and Belowsea Land. Belowsea Land, for example, is ruled 
by Sea Woman, while the night sky is a reflection of terra firma, where the 
male moon spirit drives his sled across smooth ice (clear sky) or through 
trickier snow fields (clouds). 

As for numerous other indigenous peoples, sky myth and symbolism 
formed an integral part of Inuit understanding of the workings of the cos- 
mos—knowledge that ensured well-being and, ultimately, survival. What 
makes the Inuit case particularly interesting is that they are one of the very 
few sets of human communities living at very high latitudes (the only others 
are in northern Scandinavia and parts of Siberia). Here, the appearance and 
behavior of the celestial bodies is distinctive in several ways. Many Inuit 
communities lie within the Arctic Circle, which means that there is a period 
around the summer solstice when the sun never sets, and around the winter 
solstice when it never rises. During the hours (and—around the winter sol- 
stice each year for those living north of the Arctic circle—the weeks) of dark- 


ness, whenever the skies are clear, the stars are seen to pass around the sky 


in circles only shallowly inclined to the horizontal, a great many of them 
never disappearing below the horizon. 

The Sun and Moon Spirits are prominent in Inuit cosmology; the sun is 
female and the moon male. Yet the sun’s role in Inuit myth is limited; by far 
the more important figure is the moon, her brother. Moon Man was widely 
seen as a benevolent and approachable spirit, a direct help in maintaining 
human life. This is scarcely surprising, since it is the principal luminary dur- 
ing the long, dark winter nights, especially prominent during those years (de- 
pending upon the lunar node cycle) when the winter moon would circle 
above the horizon each month for several days on end. 

Observances to mark the winter solstice, or (above the Arctic Circle) to 
mark the first brief noonday appearance of the sun after the “great dark- 
ness,” were certainly important. Great festivities lasting for many days have 
been recorded in Greenland, but in many other places they were rather sub- 
dued, since this is one of the most difficult times of the year. Children (sym- 
bolic of renewal) were often to the fore: in one custom, they would smile at 
the newly appeared sun, but only with one side of their face. This was to 
show that while warmer weather was now assured, the coldest part of the 
winter was yet to come. The summer solstice, in contrast, apparently was of 
little or no importance. Summer festivals recorded by early ethnographers 
tended to take place later in the season or as the first terrestrial signs (such 
as the formation of ice floes) heralded the onset of winter. 

Traditionally, Inuit communities have named relatively few bright 
stars and constellations. They saw the majority generally as spirits of the 
dead or as “holes in the sky.” Ursa Major is one distinctive group of stars 
that was widely recognized; it was seen variously as a herd of caribou or 
as a single animal. It was used for navigating and for marking time. Spe- 
cific meanings, and the stories associated with them, most often attached 
to those brighter stars that were seen to set and rise again. Thus Sirius, 
which only appeared low in the southern sky in the middle of winter, and 
flickered brightly in different colors owing to atmospheric effects, was 
known by some Inuit peoples as the “fox star,” and was seen as a red fox 
and a white fox fighting to get into the same foxhole. The annual patterns 
of appearance and disappearance of these stars were also used to mark 
times of the year. 

The exceptional nature of the terrestrial environment in which they live 
has strongly influenced Inuit knowledge and beliefs, but so too has their ex- 
ceptional sky. The extent to which their distinctive view of the positions and 
motions of the celestial bodies has given rise to characteristic aspects of Inuit 
cosmology is an issue about which little more may be knowable, but it high- 
lights the wider cultural significance of the shreds of evidence that have sur- 


vived concerning traditional Inuit sky knowledge.

Iron-Age Roundhouses 

Unlike the preceding two thousand years, which remain conspicuous in the 
British landscape by way of their monumental tombs and temples while set- 
tlement evidence is sparse, the archaeological record of the late second and 
first millennium B.c.E. in Britain—conventionally labeled as the Middle 
Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age—is characterized by settlements. There 
were isolated farmsteads; villages, both open and fortified; and hill forts, 
some of which housed communities of several hundred people. The domi- 
nant form of domestic architecture during this period was the roundhouse, 
and several thousand of these have been uncovered by archaeologists over 
the years. They were generally of moderate size, typically between about 
eight meters (twenty-five feet) and fifteen meters (fifty feet) across. A ring 
of upright wooden posts or planks, either within the walls or forming a sep- 
arate interior ring, supported a conical roof, which was probably thatched 
with straw or reeds and may often have been covered in turf. Inside this 
roof space, smoke from a central fire could accumulate before gradually 
permeating out through the thatch. 

The roundhouse provided good and effective shelter from the British 
climate, and it is scarcely surprising that there was just a single doorway. 
But it may seem odd that the direction the entrance faced was far from ran- 
dom. At first, roundhouses faced predominantly southward, but from c. 
1200 B.c.E. onward the great majority of roundhouse doorways faced gen- 
erally toward the east or southeast. Why? An obvious practical explanation 
is that by placing the entrance in this direction the roundhouse interior 
would be sheltered from the prevailing westerly winds and could be 
warmed by letting the early morning sunlight enter the house. Yet if west- 
erly winds were the major factor, might there not be greater variation in ori- 
entation? It also seems curious that little attempt was made to avoid the el- 
ements in the actual siting of buildings and settlements. Furthermore, 
similar orientation practices seem to extend more widely—for example, to 
hill fort entrances, where the prevailing wind would hardly have been a 


consideration. 


The “obvious” explanation was increasingly challenged in the 1990s. 
Detailed analyses of the azimuths of roundhouse entrances showed that 
there are particular concentrations around due east (between about 85 de- 
grees and 95 degrees) and similarly around southeast (between about 125 
degrees and 135 degrees). There was a significant drop between the two as 
well as a sharp drop outside the whole range (85 degrees to 135 degrees). 
The second of the two ranges corresponds to the position of midwinter sun- 
rise, prompting suggestions that the solstitial sun was the intended target, 
and a natural extension of the argument was to suggest that the easterly con- 
centration had something to do with the equinox. But why should the equi- 
nox have been a significant target at all, since it does not represent a physi- 


by 


cal “station of the sun,” only the half-way point between its two extreme 
rising positions? The position of winter solstice sunrise, on the other hand, 
is certainly tangible, in that it represents the limit of the part of the horizon 
where the sun can rise, separating it from the southern quarter, which the 
sun only ever passes over. But even so, why should the direction of sunrise 
at different times in the year have had any bearing upon the way people ori- 
ented their houses and other structures? 

Vital clues are provided by practices still known among certain modern 
indigenous peoples, together with broader archaeological evidence concern- 
ing the spatial distribution of different activities within the Iron Age round- 
houses themselves. To take one modern example, hogans, traditional houses 
of the Navajo, face eastwards toward the sacred mountain of the east, for 
reasons that have to do with keeping life in harmony with a cosmos per- 
ceived to be divided into four quarters. The earth lodges of the Pawnee pro- 
vide another example where the dominant practice of entrance orientation— 
again, toward the east—derives from the dominant worldview. A more 
general principle is at work in these cases, of which entrance orientations 
form just one part: these modern roundhouses serve as models of the 
world—microcosms—designed as such so that people can live their lives at 
one with the cosmos. 

Recent work provides compelling evidence that there were many sym- 
bolic divisions of space and activity within Iron-Age roundhouses in relation 
to their overall design and orientation: for example, between living, eating, 
and sleeping; between preparing and eating food; between male and female 
activities; and so on. Everyday activities that we would see as mundane and 
unconsequential were, it seems, strictly enacted in accordance with a prevail- 
ing worldview, as is the case among the modern indigenous peoples just men- 
tioned. Within this context, it is scarcely surprising that the entrance orienta- 
tions should have been heavily influenced by cosmological considerations. 

Nonetheless, considerations that seem to us altogether more pragmatic 


may also have played their part. As in the case of the Pawnee earth lodge, 


the practical benefits of houses facing the warmth of the early morning sun 
could certainly have been recognized. The separation between behavior that 
we would see as having clear practical ends and what we might choose to 
describe as symbolic or even irrational did not exist in the minds of prehis- 
toric people. There was no clear separation between special rites that ap- 
peased the cosmic powers and those mundane activities that filled and main- 
tained life from hour to hour and day to day. In this sense, there was a sacred 
aspect to the very houses in which they lived out their daily lives; the orien- 
tation of those houses in relation to the rising sun is just one manifestation 
of this.

Is Paras 

Is Paras is one of an extraordinary type of prehistoric monument known as 
nuraghi that is found in copious numbers on the Mediterranean island of Sar- 
dinia. Located near to the modern town of Isili, Is Paras was built during the 
Bronze Age, probably around the middle of the second millennium B.c.£. De- 
spite some damage to the exterior, it contains one of the most impressive ex- 
amples of the central chamber characteristic of all nuraghi, and this is pre- 
served intact. Circular in cross-section at ground level, measuring over 6.5 
meters (21 feet) across, the walls rise vertically for several meters before be- 
ginning to close in. From this point, layer upon layer of stone blocks are grad- 
ually corbelled inwards, each supporting the next so as to form a high vaulted 
roof. Although it is built entirely of dry stone, it rises to an incredible 11.5 


meters (over 37 feet), making it the tallest example known.

It has been suggested that the tower functioned as part of a system of 
inter-nuraghe alignments marking solar and lunar events. Viewed from an- 
other nuraghe, Nueddas, a few kilometers away, it is a prominent skyline 
feature and marks the position of midsummer sunset. However, what makes 
Is Paras of particular interest is a distinctive light-and-shadow phenomenon 
that also seems to relate to the summer solstice. 

The apex of the vaulted roof is unusual in having a small round open- 
ing, about forty centimeters (sixteen inches) across. A stone, possibly used to 
cover the hole, was discovered on top of the tower by excavators in the late 
1990s, but it could be moved by one or two people and is too small to pro- 
vide a permanent cover. While it is possible that a larger, more permanent 
stone was used at one time to cover the hole, there is no sign of it now. It is 
therefore a strong possibility, though by no means a certainty, that the hole 
was designed to be uncovered at least at certain times. 

When the sun is high in the sky, sunlight enters the chamber and casts 
a dagger of light onto the chamber wall. This only happens around the mid- 
dle of the day, and since the sun is toward the south at this time, the dagger 
appears on the northern wall, moving in a “U”-shaped curve down and to 
the left until local noon is reached, whereupon it starts to move upwards 


again, continuing to the left. At noon on the summer solstice, the sun is as 


high as it ever reaches in the sky and the noontime dagger reaches its lowest 
point of all. This is on the very lowest layer of stones, within two centime- 
ters of the floor. For a period of about twenty minutes on this day, it moves 
across on this level before starting to rise up again. 

This example epitomizes the problems of interpreting a “one-off” phe- 
nomenon. Nothing like it has been discovered at any other nuraghe, despite 
the fact that there are several thousand of them, and this must cast doubt 
upon its authenticity. Could it simply be a coincidence? Was the hole per- 
manently covered? And yet the fact that the light dagger reaches so close to 
the floor without actually touching it—surely an incredible coincidence if 
unintentional—seems to argue otherwise. Without further contextual evi- 
dence we may never know whether this phenomenon was deliberately in- 
tended, or if it was deliberate, what it actually meant to the people who built 
and used this tower back in the Bronze Age.

Islamic Astronomy 

Scholars in the Islamic world were responsible for providing a vital bridge 
connecting ancient Babylonian and Greek astronomy to modern scientific 
astronomy. But for this bridge, the traditions of thought that had led to the 
development of mathematical astronomy in Hellenistic Greece (after the 
conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.c.E. had brought 
the Babylonian and Greek traditions into direct contact) would have been 
all but severed. In any case, several centuries had passed by the time (in the 
ninth century C.E.) that serious quantities of old astronomical treatises writ- 
ten in Greek began to be retrieved, translated into Arabic, and thence com- 
municated around the Muslim world. There they helped give birth to one 
of the world’s richest and most sophisticated astronomical traditions. Early 
elements of this tradition (including translations and re-translations of the 
ancient Greek texts) subsequently passed into Christian Europe, where they 
contributed to the development of ideas within the European Renaissance. 
(This legacy is most obvious today in the fact that a number of modern star 


names, such as Aldebaran, Alnilam, Alnitak, and Altair—as well as techni- 


Muslims bow their heads toward Mecca in prayer. Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia, is the birthplace of Mubam- 
mad, the prophet upon whose teachings Islam is based. (PhotoDisc/Getty Images) 


cal terms, such as azimuth, zenith and nadir—are Arabic in origin.) How- 
ever, Islamic astronomy continued to develop in its own right until around 
the beginning of the sixteenth century, and Europeans remained largely ig- 
norant of it. In fact, developments in Europe and the Muslim world re- 
mained largely independent until the nineteenth century. 

Astronomy and astronomers generally thrived in the Islamic world. The 
distinctive nature of the astronomy that they studied and practiced derived 
from a particular mixture of traditions: indigenous folk astronomies, Baby- 
lonian and Greek ideas drawn from ancient texts, and elements of Persian 
and Indian astronomy absorbed as the Muslim world stretched eastwards. 
An example of this mixed intellectual heritage is the set of stars and aster- 
isms known as anwa’ that identified twenty-eight lunar stations or “man- 
sions”; these helped identify the position of the moon on successive nights 
and hence to track its monthly course through the stars. The general concept 
may well have been adopted from Hindu astronomy, while the chosen refer- 
ence stars derived from Bedouin knowledge of heliacal and acronical events. 
Muslim astronomers advanced mathematical astronomy in various ways, in- 
cluding studies of the motions of the sun, moon, and planets, and catalogues 


of stars and their positions, tabulated in substantial documents known as 


zijes. They were also responsible for the construction of many fine portable 
astronomical instruments and made a number of important technical ad- 
vances in the design of the astrolabe and the quadrant. 

Coexisting alongside what we would recognize as scientific astronomy 
was a tradition of folk astronomy that did not involve any attempt to make 
systematic observations or predictions based on mathematical models. What 
it did do was to regulate both agricultural activities and religious ones using 
straightforward observations of the skies. While mathematical astronomy 
could achieve the same ends, and indeed do so with a great deal more preci- 
sion, it was the preserve of just a few specialists; folk astronomy, on the other 
hand, was accessible to all, and thus had far wider social implications since 
it determined everyday practice for ordinary people. 

Prior to the widespread adoption of the Muslim faith, different cultural 
traditions within what became the Islamic world would have tended to pro- 
duce a mish-mash of local seasonal calendars and/or astronomical rules of 
thumb molded by the particular subsistence requirements of a given com- 
munity. The rapid exchange of ideas within the Islamic world itself brought 
about a degree of rationalization: thus a broadly consistent set of anwd’ be- 
came widely used for divination and were increasingly adopted as a means 
of time keeping. Nonetheless, what makes it possible to speak meaningfully 
of “Islamic folk astronomy” is the fact that very particular requirements 
would have been imposed upon all practicing Muslims by sacred Islamic law. 
Folk astronomies all over the Muslim world adapted to satisfy these com- 
mon needs. 

The first essential was to observe religious festivals on the right days, 
and particularly to correctly define such critical dates as the beginning and 
end of the month-long fast in the holy month of Ramadan. The formal Is- 
lamic calendar is lunar, and consists of only twelve synodic (phase-cycle) 
months, since intercalary months are forbidden by the Ouran: this means 
that it is eleven days shorter than the seasonal year. Whatever calendars were 
in local use for seasonal reckoning, it was necessary for liturgical purposes 
to determine the start of each new month by direct observations of the new 
crescent moon. People with good eyesight might be sent to watch the west- 
ern sky on the critical evenings, and various solutions had to be found when 
the critical part of the sky was obscured by cloud. It is scarcely surprising 
that the star and crescent symbol, depicting the crescent moon, has become 
a global symbol of the Islamic faith. 

An imperative for any Muslim is to observe the five daily prayers, 
which must take place within set intervals during the day and night. The in- 
tervals in question are specified according to the daily motions of the sun: in 
relation to the lengths of shadows when the sun is up; in relation to certain 
visible phenomena (such as the redness of the sky) at twilight; and in rela- 


tion to set time intervals during the night (the evening prayer, specifically, 
should preferably be completed before a third of the night has passed). This 
means that the actual prayer times vary both according to latitude and lon- 
gitude, and at any given place they change from day to day with the varying 
length of daylight. This makes the problem of determining the correct prayer 
times nontrivial, and before tables based on scientific data became available, 
the use of sundials and gnomons was common, with amwd’ used to estimate 
the time of night. 

Folk astronomy had a third and rather different application, though to 
something no less vital in the practice of the Muslim faith. This was to help 
determine the sacred direction, or gibla. One of the most basic necessities for 
any Muslim is to know the direction of Mecca, in order to determine the cor- 
rect bodily orientation during prayers and other activities. Formally this has 
nothing to do with astronomy, but (again, before Muslim mathematicians 
had produced tabulations of the gibla for different latitudes and longitudes) 
astronomical observations were extensively used to provide the best avail- 
able approximations, some of which were rather better than others. Typi- 
cally they used the horizon rising or setting point of a particular bright star 
or the rising or setting arc of the sun. This seemed only natural as the base 
of the Kaaba itself—the cube-shaped stone structure at the center of the 
Great Mosque in Mecca that forms the sacred center of the Muslim world— 
had been known as far back as the seventh century to have its longer axis 
oriented upon the rising of the star Canopus and its minor axis aligned 
(roughly) in line with midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. 

Historically, the assumed gibla is most evident in the orientation of 
mosques and in the layouts of some cities. In some cases, historical accounts 
attest to how the sacred direction was actually determined. Thus, we know 
that the earliest mosques in Iraq were built with their prayer walls facing 
midwinter sunset in order to face the northeastern wall of the Kaaba, while 
Egyptian ones were built with their prayer walls facing midwinter sunrise in 
an attempt to be parallel with the Kaaba’s northwestern wall. However, in 
many cases we can only speculate about the methods used to determine the 
qgibla. Since the errors were sometimes considerable, anyone trying to recon- 
struct the motivation behind mosque orientations in the absence of anything 
but the orientations themselves would have a hard time fathoming that the 


intention was always to orient them toward Mecca.

Island of the Sun 


The Inca empire dominated a huge swath of the Andean region running 
down the west coast of South America for almost a century before the ar- 
rival of the Europeans in 1532. At its height, it stretched for no less than 
4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from north to south, an area that extends 
from the northern border of Ecuador down to Santiago, Chile. The Inca 
rulers rose to dominance remarkably quickly and ruled their vast and di- 
verse state using bureaucratic and rigidly hierarchical procedures to organ- 
ize labor and redistribute food and other raw materials. One mechanism of 
conquest was subsuming the religions and ideologies of captured peoples 
within a state-controlled cult. It was dedicated to three principal deities, 
among whom Inti, the Sun god, was prominent. The ruling Inca elite 
claimed to be descended from Inti himself, and in this way the dominant 
ideology they had imposed served also as a mechanism of political control, 
putting their own right to rule beyond question. 

In one myth recounted by the chronicler Bernabé Cobo, the “true 
dwelling place of the sun” was said to be a large crag on the island in the 
huge inland lake of Titicaca, on the border between modern Peru and Bo- 
livia. According to the legend, the ancient peoples had been without light for 
many days. “Finally, the people of the Island of Titicaca saw the Sun come 
up one morning out of that crag with extraordinary radiance. For this rea- 
son they believed that the true dwelling place of the Sun was that crag, or at 
least that crag was the most delightful thing in the world for the Sun” 
(Hamilton 1990, pp. 91-92). This myth evidently had pre-Inca origins, but 
under Inca control the island became a destination for pilgrimages to the 
sun’s place of origin. A sanctuary was built around the sacred crag and ac- 


cess was tightly controlled. Common pilgrims were only permitted if they

city of Machu Picchu. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


followed various strict protocols and donated appropriate offerings. Even 
then, they were not allowed near the sacred crag, but had to watch the sun- 
rise ceremony from a distance. By combining elements of Cobo’s and other 
accounts with archaeological examinations of the remains of the sanctuary 
and archaeoastronomical measurements to determine the rising direction of 
the sun at different times, archaeologist Brian Bauer and archaeoastronomer 
David Dearborn have deduced that the sunrise-watching ceremony almost 
certainly took place in June or July, perhaps at the June solstice itself. 

The fact that the sunrise ceremony at the sanctuary on the Island of the 
Sun is historically attested allows us to answer questions that we would not 
be able to answer if we had to rely upon archaeological evidence alone. 
Compare, for example, later British prehistoric sites such as Brainport Bay, 
a solstitially aligned set of platforms and structures, where we would dearly 
like to know who made sunrise observations and for what purpose; Stone- 
henge, where—although it is evident that only a select few could observe sol- 
stitial sunrise or sunset from within the huge stones of the sarsen circle—we 
can only speculate about the observers’ social status and purpose, and 
whether larger crowds were allowed to spectate from a distance; and the 
Thornborough henges, which appear from the archaeological evidence to 
have been a pilgrimage destination, and we are keen to ask when in the year 


people came here and what the place signified to them.

Javanese Calendar 

To many generations of rice farmers in rural Java, Indonesia, it was not the 
stars of Ursa Major that formed the plough, but the stars of Orion. Here, 
close to the equator, the constellation appears on its side and Orion’s belt 
plus three of the four outer stars (excluding Betelgeuse) were seen to re- 
semble a traditional Javanese plough (Weluku): they constituted the con- 
stellation Bintang Weluku. 

The changing appearance of this constellation (together with the 
Pleiades) over the year was used to provide various rules of thumb to regu- 
late the different seasonal activities associated with inundated rice cultiva- 
tion. The beginning of the new agricultural year was marked by the plough’s 
first appearance in the pre-dawn sky (heliacal rise). This happened around 
the time of the June solstice. At this time the celestial plough was upright, 
just like earthly ploughs when in use. Three months later, with Bintang 
Weluku rising progressively earlier each night, came the onset of the rainy 
season and the time to prepare the tools and check the water channels. 
When the plough eventually rose at sunset (acronical rise) and was once 
again upright, it was the time for the women to sow the rice in the nursery 
and for the men to start plowing the fields. About a month later, at around 
the time of the December solstice, the process began of harrowing the fields 
(men) and transplanting the seedlings into the fields (women). (Planting was 
also regulated by the phase of the moon.) By now, Bintang Weluku was ap- 
pearing higher and higher in the sky after sunset, and the end of this period 
was marked by its culmination (appearing at its highest point in the sky) at 
dusk. Four months later, when the rain had stopped and the rice had 
ripened, the harvest began. This season was marked by the celestial plough 
appearing progressively lower in the western sky after sunset. At this time it 
was perceived as upside down, “like a farmer’s plough when the work is 
done.” Soon afterwards, it disappeared completely (heliacal set). 

The workings of this pragmatic stellar calendar are reminiscent of Hes- 
iod’s words of advice to Greek farmers in the eighth century B.c.E. Numer- 


ous other practices known from many different parts of the world also reg- 
ulate seasonal farming activities (both growing crops and managing live- 
stock) by reference to the observed behavior of prominent stars or asterisms. 

Bintang Weluku remained in use until around the late nineteenth cen- 
tury and is still prominent in folk memory, despite the co-existence of two 
other methods of dividing the year. The first involved numerical (i.e., non- 
astronomical) cycles such as five- and seven-day weeks and 210-day years, 
which derived from a mix of Islamic and Hindu traditions. This system was 
institutionalized and also used for divination. The other calendar, known as 
the pranotomongso (or pranatamongsa), was based on measurements of the 
length of the sun’s shadow at noon, regulated since the seventeenth century 
by using an accurate gnomon device known as a bencet. This calendar di- 
vided the year into twelve unequal divisions, although only four were widely 
used in practice. These were demarcated by the solstices and the days of so- 
lar zenith passage.

Julian Calendar 
The new civic calendar introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 B.C.E. was revo- 
lutionary in that it ignored the moon. Earlier calendars in the Roman world 
had been based on the lunar phase cycle and had gotten badly out of step 
with the seasonal year. Remarkably, two key elements of our own modern 
calendar date all the way back to Caesar’s innovations. The first is its divi- 
sion into twelve months, each with a fixed number of days, chosen so as to 
add up to the number of whole days in the seasonal year (365). The word 
month in this context is in fact a complete misnomer, since the divisions of 
our year are completely independent of the cycle of lunar phases. The sec- 
ond innovation was the concept of a leap year. By introducing an additional 
day once every four years, the average length of a year in the Julian calen- 
dar became 365.25 days, very close to the true length of the year. 

The Julian calendar did not escape teething troubles. For over three 
decades an additional day was mistakenly inserted every third instead of 


every fourth year, necessitating a retrospective adjustment. Only by c.E. 8 


was the pattern established that remains familiar today, whereby every 
fourth year (whenever the year is divisible by four) is a leap year. 

The Julian calendar survived intact for over 1500 years in the Christian 
world, but (with the exception of Ethiopia) was eventually superseded by the 
more accurate Gregorian calendar. This happened at different times in dif- 
ferent countries according to whether the dominant tradition was Catholic, 
Protestant, or Orthodox. Those who study calendrically related phenomena 
in medieval times, for example the orientations of medieval churches, have 
to be critically aware of the differences between the two calendars.

Kintraw 

This megalithic monument on the west coast of Argyll, Scotland, consists 
of a single standing stone four meters (thirteen feet) high situated between 
two round cairns. It probably dates to the late third or early second mil- 
lennium B.c.E. It is well known because it was the place where, in the 
1970s, an archaeological excavation was first used to test an astronomical 
theory deduced from alignment studies. 

The horizon all around this site is relatively close except toward the 
southwest, where there is a distant view toward the Isle of Jura, some 45 
kilometers (28 miles) away. Here two adjacent mountain peaks stand out 
prominently with a deep, sharp notch between them. As viewed from the 
standing stone, this notch aligns precisely with the midwinter sunset. Close 
to the winter solstice, the top part of the setting sun would reappear briefly 
in the bottom of the notch, but at the solstice itself it would be slightly too 
low, and only then would it disappear from view. 

When Alexander Thom discovered this alignment, he also discovered 
a problem. The notch is just hidden from the standing stone itself by an in- 
tervening ridge; only a 2.5-meter (8-foot) giant would be able to see it from 
the standing stone. Undeterred, Thom followed the alignment back toward 
the northeast where it crosses a deep gorge and then climbs a steep hillside. 
Halfway up this precipitous slope is a narrow ledge, which would have pro- 
vided the perfect spot from which to observe the setting sun. From here, the 
standing stone appears directly beneath the deep notch. But there was no 
obvious sign of human activity here, just two rounded boulders. Was the 
ledge simply a natural feature? Here was the perfect opportunity for an ar- 
chaeological test of an astronomical theory: if the ledge could be shown by 


excavation to be artificial, then this would vindicate the idea that it was used 


as an observing platform. 

Archaeologist Euan MacKie rose to the challenge in 1970 and 1971. 
Unfortunately, his excavations did not reveal any clear and direct signs of 
human activity. However, they did show that the flat part of the ledge was 
covered with rounded pebbles, which he suggested had been carefully placed 
there to form a viewing platform. The problem was that they might have ar- 
rived naturally, rolling down the hill and coming to rest behind the two 
larger boulders. Analyses were undertaken of the orientations of the pebbles, 
in the hope of distinguishing between the two possibilities, but no clear con- 
clusion could be reached. Thus MacKie’s excavations proved inconclusive. 

One of the general questions that arises from Thom’s theory of highly 
precise solstitial sightlines is how they could have been set up in the first 
place. One of the most plausible ideas is that a row of people, stretching per- 
pendicularly to the sightline, watched the sunset on days leading up to the 
solstice. Each day, fewer or them would see the sun reappear in the notch, as 
the sun’s setting path sank slightly in the sky (the opposite would be true at 
a notch where the sun rose or set at the summer solstice). Each evening a 
temporary marker would be set up to mark the limiting position where the 
sun could be seen to reappear in the notch. Day by day, this position would 
move sideways, by less and less as the solstice approached, until the limit 
was eventually reached and the position began to move back in the opposite 
direction. For the summer solstice, the limit would mark the spot where the 
tip of the sun would only appear in the notch on the solstice itself; for the 
winter solstice, as at Kintraw, it would mark the spot from which the sun 
would only disappear on the solstice itself. This, then, would be the spot 
where a permanent marker would be erected. 

There are two serious problems with this procedure at Kintraw. First, 
there is no room to set out a line of people as just described, because the plat- 
form is situated on the side of a precipitous hillside above a deep gorge. Sec- 
ond, the intervening ridge blocks the view of the distant notch from those 
positions where one would have had to stand in order to watch the sunset 
on the days before and after the solstice. There are also more general prob- 
lems that bring into question the whole idea that solstitial sightlines of pin- 
point precision could have been established at British megalithic sites such as 
Kintraw, Ballochroy, or the Ring of Brodgar. An obvious imponderable 
would have been the British weather: the setting-up procedure would only 
work given a reasonable run of clear evenings, something that would have 
been far from guaranteed even given that the weather in western Scotland in 
later prehistoric times was somewhat different from now. Another is the pos- 
sibility of significant day-to-day variations in atmospheric refraction due to 
changing atmospheric conditions, which would alter the apparent altitude of 


the setting sun. 


The reappearance of the setting sun in the notch at Kintraw for a pe- 
riod around the December solstice would undoubtedly have formed a spec- 
tacular sight. Certainly, it may have been deeply significant to the people 
who constructed (not necessarily at the same time) the cairns and monolith: 
the larger cairn, for example, had a setting of stones resembling an entrance 
(known as a false portal) facing in this general direction. Perhaps no greater 
precision than this was needed. By trying too hard to fit prehistoric people 
into the mould of ancient “scientific” astronomers, and by focusing too 
closely on the possible existence of alignments of pinpoint precision, we risk 
failing to grasp more useful insights into the part that astronomy really 
played in prehistoric burial and ceremonial practices.

Kukulcan 

The pyramid of Kukulcan, also known as El Castillo, is one of the most im- 
pressive constructions at the Maya site of Chichen Itza. Some consider its 
innate calendrical significance to be expressed in the numerology of its four 
stairways, one on each side, each of which rises in ninety-one steps to the 
top platform; adding the final step into the temple on the top makes 365 
steps in all. The pyramid is not cardinally oriented but skewed by about 
twenty-one degrees clockwise, and archaeoastronomers have investigated 
the possible reasons for this as part of systematic studies of the orientations 
of Maya temples and city plans. However, the phenomenon that has cap- 
tured the public imagination was apparently discovered by chance by a 
caretaker at the site in the late 1920s. 

Twice each year, at around the time of the equinoxes, the late afternoon 
sun slants across the stepped terraces of the northwestern (actually NNW) 
corner of the pyramid and casts a sinuous shadow onto one balustrade of the 
northern (actually NNE) staircase. At the bottom of this balustrade is a large 
stone serpent’s head, and the shadow appears to complete the body of the 
serpent, undulating back up the balustrade. The shadow is visible for an 
hour or two, as sunset approaches. 

Whether the phenomenon that has become known as the equinox hi- 
erophany was intentionally orchestrated by the builders is highly question- 
able. Given the overall fourfold symmetry of the monument, it seems incon- 


gruous that the northern staircase should be favored in this way. However, 


Crowds of people assemble at Kukulcan (El Castillo) to view the equinox hierophany in 1988. (Richard A. 
Cooke/Corbis) 


the pyramid does overlay an earlier version, and this one only had a single 
stairway which was on the northern (actually NNE) side. Furthermore, there 
is good evidence to relate the pyramid to Kukulcan, a plumed serpent (feath- 
ered rattlesnake) god prominent in the Mesoamerican pantheon, known 
later to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. There is also good evidence to relate 
Quetzalcoatl to the planet Venus. A platform to the north of the Kukulcan 
pyramid has wall carvings containing a number of Venus symbols, and as a 
result has become known as the Platform of Venus. This has led some to sug- 
gest that the timing of the so-called equinox hierophany may have had more 
to do with the motions of Venus than the equinox. 

Be this as it may, the site has certainly become the focus for modern pil- 
grimage. The hierophany is now witnessed by tens of thousands of visitors, 
which has become interesting as a modern sociological phenomenon in itself.

Kumukahi 
Cape Kumukahi, in the southeastern corner of the Big Island of Hawai‘i, 
forms the bleak, easternmost extremity of the Hawaiian island chain. Lava 
flows have pushed across this flat plain over the centuries, most recently in 
1960, when the molten rock stopped just short of the lighthouse at the end 
of the road out across the cape—something regarded by many as a concilia- 
tory gesture by the volcano goddess Pele. East of the lighthouse, close to the 
coast, is a rugged landscape formed of large irregular chunks of black lava. 
This is an unlikely setting for astronomical observations, yet it is one 
of the very few places mentioned explicitly in this regard in Hawaiian oral 
history. Two traditions have come down to us. The first, recorded by the 
ethnographer Nathaniel Emerson in 1909 as a footnote in a book about 


sacred songs of the hula, refers to a “pillar of stone,” itself called Ku- 


mukahi, and a “monolith,” to the south of it, called Makahoni. According 


to Emerson: 


In summer the sun in its northern excursion inclined, as the 
Hawaiians noted, to the side of Kumukahi, while in the sea- 
son of cool weather, called Makalii, it swung in the opposite 
direction and passed over to Makahoni. The people of Puna 
accordingly said, “The sun has passed over to Makahoni,” 
or “The sun has passed over to Kumukahi,” as the case 
might be. (Emerson 1997 [1909], p.197) 


Ethnographer Martha Beckwith recorded a slightly different legend. By this 
account, a red stone at the extreme end of the cape represents the god Ku- 
mukahi, a god with healing powers who can take the form of a plover. Two 
further stones represent his wives, who “manipulate the seasons by pushing 
the sun back and forth between them at the two solstices” (Beckwith 1970 
[1940], p.119). 

The observations described in the myths are hardly of great sophistica- 
tion. The significance of this example is that the Kumukahi pillars constitute 
one of very few calendrical markers whose location is identified in Polynesian 
oral traditions with absolute certainty. Without these legends, this barren cor- 
ner of the Hawaiian islands would surely be one of the last places a modern 
archaeoastronomer might think to look for evidence of ancient astronomical 
observations. The visible landscape is formed entirely in relatively modern 
times, a substantial part of it within living memory; such landmarks as there 
are were formed by natural processes rather than human intervention. The 
stones and pillars of which the legends speak are not easy to single out from 
among the many natural lava pillars in the area, if indeed they are still stand- 
ing. Even with the help of the legends, the exact nature of the observations, 
and hence of the alignments that may still exist, is not entirely clear. Nonethe- 
less, a combination of archaeology and archaeoastronomy may yet manage 
to identify the Kumukahi pillars with a fair degree of confidence. 

One cannot visit Kumukahi without wondering what the ancient 
Hawaiians could possibly have been doing in such a desolate spot. Yet this 
was undoubtedly a sacred place, featuring in a number of different songs and 
chants. We do not need to postulate the existence of more precise astro- 
nomical alignments in order to explain its sacred significance; we probably 
need look no further than the fact that it was an extremity, beyond which 
the boundless ocean extended away in the direction of the rising sun. In this 
sense, it may have something in common with remote Necker Island, at the 
opposite end of the chain.

Kumulipo 

Just because a human society has not developed writing does not mean that 
it cannot generate literature. In many nonliterate cultures, certain stories— 
and particularly creation myths—were so sacred that they were carefully 
learned and passed on from generation to generation, strictly verbatim, and 
thereby preserved intact for many decades or even centuries. Recital or per- 
formance, sacred in itself, was typically a formal affair and subject to strict 
protocols. The audience was often restricted to those of sufficient rank or 
those suitably initiated in some way. 

A fine example of such oral literature is the Hawaiian prayer chant 
known as the Kumulipo. Passed down through several generations of high 
chiefs (ali‘), it came into the possession of the last native ruler of Hawai‘, 
King David Kalakaua, after which it was recorded and translated into Eng- 
lish. It originated as far back as the mid-eighteenth century, a longevity that 
is all the more remarkable given its considerable length—over two thousand 
lines. It was composed for the alii Ka-‘I-i-mamao, and clearly served as a le- 
gitimization of his rank and power. Its purpose was to demonstrate how he 
(and, by extrapolation, his descendants) was directly descended from a string 
of culture heroes and ultimately from the gods themselves. The Kumulipo 
was, according to later Hawaiian informants, the very chant that was recited 
to Captain Cook during a ceremony at Hikiau heiau on the Big Island of 
Hawai‘i, when he was being received as the god Lono. 

The Kumulipo combines a creation story and description of the world 
with genealogies that recount (or, as an outsider would see it, establish) the 
lineage of the chief. It is in the form of a poem, although substantial chunks 
consist of no more than lists of names. Although genealogical prayer chants 
of this nature are not exceptional in Polynesia, the Kumulipo describes var- 
ious natural phenomena in particular detail. It is, in this sense, an excellent 


natural history. The heavens are included, of course, and the work actually 


begins with a reference to the sun, moon, and Pleiades. Some have claimed 
that a much richer body of astronomical knowledge is represented in the 
form of hidden, double meanings, which were undoubtedly included. 
Hawaiian is a language ripe for punning; subtle word play, allusions, and 
different levels of meaning were an essential characteristic of sacred chants. 
The difficulty lies in accurately reconstructing them. Unfortunately, much 
was lost in the early transcriptions of Hawaiian, which ignored subtle but vi- 
tal differences in vowel sounds that have only relatively recently been repre- 
sented using appropriate diacritical marks. The underlying, hidden meanings 
of old texts are extremely difficult to reconstruct, even for native Hawaiian 
scholars, and can vary widely in their interpretations. In this regard, the Ku- 
mulipo is no exception. 

The genealogical lists in the Kumulipo certainly include known star 
names. One native Hawaiian scholar, Rubellite Kawena Johnson, has argued 
that the chant describes the heavenly cycles in considerable detail using var- 
ious numerological encodings and devices. Others, however, argue that the 
particular ordering of and relationships between the natural phenomena de- 
scribed have more to do with the requirements of good rhythmic balance. 
However this debate is ultimately resolved, the Kumulipo is interesting 
enough as an example of a creation story that not only describes the natural 
world and its human inhabitants but tries to explain it.

Lakota Sacred Geography 

The traditional homeland of the Lakota (Sioux) is the Black Hills, an iso- 
lated oval-shaped area of mountains on the border between South Dakota 
and Wyoming. The mountains stretch some 180 kilometers (120 miles) 
from north to south and 80 kilometers (50 miles) east to west, and are sur- 
rounded by flat plains. The name Lakota means “Friends of the Earth,” 
and the Lakota, traditionally a nomadic people, kept their lives in har- 
mony with the cosmos by tuning their seasonal path through the land- 
scape to the annual cycle of the sun through the stars. The basis of their 
subsistence was the buffalo (tatanka), an animal they considered to em- 
body the power of the sun. As they followed the herds through the land- 
scape, they received spiritual instruction from the stars. Although their 
traditional way of life was virtually eliminated during the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries, as were the extensive buffalo herds that used to roam 
this country, the Lakota are now sharing with outsiders elements of their 
tradition as they try to rebuild it. 

The Lakota perceive a direct connection between certain places in the 
landscape and certain groups of stars in the sky. Thus Harney Peak, the 
highest mountain in the Black Hills, was associated with Seven Little Girls 
(the Pleiades), and isolated Devil’s Peak was connected with Bear’s Lodge 
(part of Gemini). During the year, the Lakota traditionally moved from their 
winter camps south of the Black Hills northward, toward and into the 
range. This journey, following the seasonal movements of the buffalo 
through the landscape, also followed the path of the sun through the con- 
stellations, and an integral part of the process was the performance of the 
appropriate sacred rites. On one level, this annual journey, regulated by ob- 
servations of astronomical phenomena, simply served to ensure the success- 
ful exploitation of a vital food resource. However, this outsiders’ perspective 
fails utterly to comprehend anything of the meaning of these practices to the 
people who undertook them. From the Lakota standpoint, the whole jour- 
ney was a ceremony—a sort of ritual pilgrimage—that first and foremost 


preserved the balance of life and ensured peace and harmony in the cosmos 
in general. 

A few details serve to give an idea of the complexities involved. The 
spring journey away from the winter encampments commenced when the 
sun entered the Cansana Ipusye constellation (parts of Aries and Triangu- 
lum). The same phrase, Cansana Ipusye, is used by the Lakota to describe 
the Dried Willow, the Sacred Pipe in which it was smoked, and the wooden 
spoon in which shamans would carry live coals (representing the sun) as the 
journey commenced. At the same time (around the spring equinox), the sa- 
cred powers in the sky would use the celestial wooden spoon (Ursa Major) 
to carry the sun to the celestial pipe (Aries/Triangulum). 

When the sun arrived at the Pleiades, the people would camp at Har- 
ney Peak and perform ceremonies welcoming back the Thunders. After this, 
the sun moved toward the center of “the great circle of stars” (Rigel, Sirius, 
Procyon, Pollux, Castor, Menkalinan, Capella, and the Pleiades) while the 
people moved to Pe Sla, a “bare hill” in the middle of the Black Hills. Emerg- 
ing out of the celestial great circle are the head (Hyades), backbone (Orion’s 
belt), ribs (Betelgeuse/Bellatrix and Rigel) and tail (Sirius) of a buffalo, the 
animal that symbolized all life. Likewise, the Black Hills were seen as the 
place out of which all life was annually renewed on earth. For this reason, 
rites took place there at this time to welcome back life: water was poured on 
the earth to feed the plants, seeds were scattered for birds, and buffalo 
tongues were offered for meat-eating animals. 

As the summer solstice approached, the sun approached the Bear’s 
Lodge (Mato Tipila) and the people arrived at the Devil’s Tower. Mato Tip- 
ila was created by the central figure in Lakota oral tradition, Fallen Star, to 
protect two children threatened by bears. The constellation is located on one 
side of, but nonetheless within, the great circle of stars, whereas its earthly 
equivalent, Devil’s Tower, is in fact some one hundred kilometers (sixty 
miles) northwest of the Black Hills. This configuration seems contradictory 
from a Western perspective, serving to remind us how wrong we could be if 
we tried to reconstruct elements of Lakota worldview from partial historical 
information without having modern informants. We might easily try to en- 
force too literal an interpretation of the mapping between sky and earth, and 
dismiss the idea that the Devil’s Tower could have been part of the scheme. 
It was at Devil’s Tower that, in July or August, the annual Sun Dance took 
place. Contrary to popular belief, this was a solemn ritual, the last celebra- 
tion of the season devoted to the sun, buffalo, and the Black Hills. 

The Lakota, like many indigenous peoples, ascribe spiritual meaning to 
the whole landscape and to particular places within it. What makes their 
case particularly interesting, though, is the added dimension of timing. Cos- 


mic harmony is preserved by being in the right place at the right time and 


performing the appropriate rites. The terrestrial world is connected to the 
spirit world both in space and time, and the key to this connection is the sky. 
Not only are places in the landscape associated with particular asterisms, but 
the time to be there is prescribed by reference to the sun’s passage through 
the stars. This connection between the terrestrial and the spiritual also has 
the pragmatic effect (from a Western perspective) of making sure that the 
buffalo can be successfully hunted. But for the Lakota, the buffalo are not 
simply a resource to be exploited. They are part of the whole circle of life, 
who say “take my flesh with gratitude” (Chamberlain et al. 2005, p. 145), 
and humans have to return this gift by doing all they can to preserve the cos- 
mic order.

Land of the Rising Sun 

In modern Japan, ancient traditions coexist with the many emanations of 
modern Western culture. In centuries past, too, Japanese culture continually 
absorbed influences from abroad—namely from mainland Asia—and yet 
retained a distinct identity. Even the Japanese language, when it was first 
written down in the middle of the first millennium C.E., used kanji charac- 
ters imported from the Chinese. 

For a millennium and a half, from the fourth century until the end of 
World War II, the principles of Shinto religion forged unbreakable links be- 
tween cosmology, political structure, and the sun. Successive emperors 
traced their ancestry directly back to the Sun Goddess, helping to forge a na- 
tional identity linked with the sun that is still evident in the national flag. 
Shinto persisted despite the strong influence of Buddhist traditions from 
China that have coexisted in this island nation from the sixth century on- 
wards. This coexistence involved some remarkable compromises, for in- 


stance, in locating and aligning temples and palaces. In the Shinto tradition 


this would be done with respect to places of spiritual power in the landscape, 
whereas in the Chinese tradition they would typically be aligned cardinally, 
reflecting the principle that spiritual and imperial power derived from the 
north celestial pole as the pivot of the heavens, and ensuring that the em- 
peror would be approached, like the celestial pole itself, from the south. The 
plan of ancient Kyoto, for example, built in c.£. 794, with its palace com- 
plex approached from due south, reflected such principles every bit as faith- 
fully as Beijing itself. 

Aside from institutionalized astronomy, elements of star lore and folk 
calendars have been transmitted through countless generations of ordinary 
people, and some have persisted in rural areas despite the introduction of the 
Gregorian calendar. For example, the changing patterns of appearance of the 
Pleiades (Subaru), Hyades, and Orion’s belt provided a succession of seasonal 
rules of thumb for rice farmers. One of these was that when Subaru—which 
resembled a collection of rice seedlings—set progressively earlier in the 
evening sky in the spring, this indicated the time for planting the actual rice 
seeds in the ground. 

Archaeoastronomy is in its infancy in Japan. The Asuka plain, to the 
east of Osaka, contains several tombs (kofun) of high-status individuals that 
were erected in the seventh and early eighth centuries. Two of them, only 
about a kilometer (half mile) apart—Takamatsu Zuka Kofun, excavated in 
1972, and Kitora Kofun, probed in 1998 using a miniature camera—contain 
paintings with strong astronomical associations. The ceilings depict the 
twenty-eight lunar “mansions” (known in Japan as shuku) and other con- 
stellations, while the walls show the animal gods associated with each of the 
cardinal directions. The two tombs demonstrate clear but nonetheless dif- 
ferent Chinese and Korean influences. The region also contains a number of 
granite megaliths carved in the shape of human figures. These are of uncer- 
tain origin, date, and purpose, and while some have attracted archaeoastro- 
nomical interest, interpretations are far more speculative.

Landscape 

People in the past ordered the world of their experience, defining places 
within it and pathways through it, and in that way came to understand and 
control it. Vital as it was to exploit natural resources to the full in order to 
subsist, human activity in relation to the landscape was often structured ac- 
cording to symbolic or cosmological principles, forming what are known to 
archaeologists as ritual landscapes or sacred geographies. Examples of sa- 
cred geographies are many and varied among both historically recorded 
and modern indigenous peoples. 

As is still the case for many indigenous peoples today, places may have 
become imbued with sacred or mystical significance because of their position 
within the landscape, as with the summits of high hills; because of the pres- 
ence of prominent landmarks, such as caves, watering holes, or distinctive 
natural rocks; or because of remembered events that happened there. Some 
of these places may have been used for the construction of shrines or monu- 
ments, and others may have assumed sacred significance precisely because 
earlier constructions were built there. Sacred significance may be attached to 
lines and paths as well as particular places. For the inhabitants of the Hopi 
village of Walpi, the directions of sunrise and sunset at the solstices are them- 
selves sacred, so that four sacred lines radiate out through the landscape 
from the village to the horizon. This configuration represents a very direct 
and obvious connection between the landscape and the sky, and also a rela- 
tionship between space and time, in that each line is empowered by the ac- 
tual occurrence of sunrise or sunset on the appropriate day. 

Patterns of movement through the landscape may be vitally important 
as a way of reinforcing a group’s understanding of the structure of the world 
and their place within it. Thus the Lakota people of South Dakota associate 
certain constellations with specific landmarks within the Black Hills. In ac- 
cordance with their oral tradition, they undertake an annual progression 
through those hills that is understood to be related to, and seen to be in tune 
with, the path of the sun through the constellations. The Lakota example 
also illustrates how the needs of the sacred and the mundane—or, as we 
might see it, of ideology and pragmatism—need not necessarily be mutually 
exclusive or in conflict. The cycle of seasonal movements ensures that the 
Lakota follow the movements of the buffalo, a vital food source that they 


also saw as the very embodiment of the power of the sun. 


The Lakota example also illustrates that no discussion of sacred land- 
scapes is likely to be complete without a consideration of the sky. As soon as 
we start to think about how people perceived and conceived the world, and 
as soon as we start examining evidence of human action shaped by and un- 
dertaken in accordance with such perceptions, then we need to consider not 
only the land and sea but the totality of the visible environment within which 
those people lived. That includes the sky.

Ley Lines 

In 1921, so the story goes, businessman Alfred Watkins had a revelation. 
Standing on a hillside in Herefordshire, England, overlooking an expanse 
of rural countryside containing a number of ancient features, he noticed 
that many of them seemed to lie on straight lines. A subsequent examina- 
tion of Ordnance Survey maps revealed the apparent existence of numer- 
ous ancient straight trackways that formed a network of intersecting 
straight lines stretching from one end of Britain to the other, with ancient 
sites of various ages situated along them. Noticing that many of the track- 
ways passed through places whose names contained the syllable ley, 
Watkins concluded that the word Jey referred to the trackways themselves 
and named them ley lines. Drawing on the earlier astronomical work of Sir 
Norman Lockyer, he also concluded that some of the lines were oriented 
in the directions of sunrise and sunset at the solstices. By the following year 
he had published his first book, Early British Trackways; its sequel, The 


Old Straight Track, published in 1925, attracted a wide following from a 
fascinated public. 

Professional archaeologists, however, were highly skeptical. The idea 
that the whole of Britain could have been mapped out single-mindedly in 
prehistoric times seemed to them inherently unreasonable, and there seemed 
little in the way of hard evidence to support the theory. For a start, the sug- 
gested etymology of the term Jey as referring to ancient tracks was highly 
questionable. More crucially, the ancient sites taken to define the lines were 
of widely different ages and types, and marker points actually included nat- 
ural features such as large stones, trees, ponds, and mountain peaks. Fur- 
thermore, large numbers of equally plausible ancient sites and natural 
places did not lie on any of the proposed lines. We must ask the question: 
how easy is it, given a scatter of effectively random locations, to find 
straight lines joining some of them? It is possible to give a mathematical an- 
swer, but the informal answer is clear: surprisingly easy. The excavator of 
Stonehenge, Richard Atkinson, once demonstrated this using the locations 
of telephone boxes, which no one could argue had been laid out deliberately 
in straight lines, finding several convincing “telephone box leys.” As to the 
question of the different ages of the sites forming supposed marker points, 
Watkins and his followers argued that newer buildings such as churches 
must have been constructed on the site of older markers. However, in most 
cases there was little or no independent evidence to support this, and in 
some cases the archaeological evidence stood in flagrant contradiction to 
the theory. A notorious example is a ley line joining Stonehenge (third mil- 
lennium B.C.E.), Old Sarum (first millennium B.c.£.), and Salisbury cathedral 
(c.E. 1220) in Wiltshire. The site for Salisbury cathedral was on virgin 
marshland, actually chosen because a preferred site, several kilometers to 
the west, could not be secured. 

Curiously, unbeknownst to Watkins and his followers in the 1920s, a 
similar idea had been developed in Germany around the same time, claim- 
ing that sacred places in that country were linked by Heilige Linien (“Holy 
lines”). This theory came, infamously, to be used in support of the Nazi po- 
litical agenda. Back in Britain after the 1920s, though, ley lines soon faded 
into obscurity and would have been long forgotten but for their reemergence 
in the 1960s in a new guise. Watkins believed that his trackways were con- 
structed by prehistoric surveyors physically sighting from one place to an- 
other, but the ley lines of the 1960s were conceived as lines of power, the 
paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient an- 
cestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought. 
Public interest in ley lines mushroomed, and “ley hunting” became a hugely 
popular pastime, largely because someone with no professional training 


whatsoever could feel directly involved in the process of rediscovering the 


magical landscapes of the past. All that was required was an open mind, the 
energy to walk about in the landscape seeking potential sacred places, and 
the ability to feel the spiritual forces. 

The dangerous aspect of this approach is that it abandons all attempts 
to examine the evidence objectively—to be scientific in any broad sense. The 
existence of the lines of force had to be accepted as an article of faith, to be 
backed up by subjective discoveries. Very few archaeologists bothered to 
waste their time on a topic that seemed to them a complete fiction, but this 
just served to confirm to the ley liners that the academics were both narrow- 
minded and arrogant. Meanwhile ley hunting spawned journals and books, 
sub-fields, experts, and doctrinal disputes; in short, it developed all the trap- 
pings of an alternative discipline, arrayed in competition against the aca- 
demic establishment. The irony is that the ley hunters found themselves 
adopting the very paraphernalia of science that most of them were arguing 
so vociferously against. 

For the most part, ley lines represent an unhappy episode now con- 
signed to history. Yet humans do tend to construct lines in the landscape, 
conceptual or actual, a practice that has emerged in some human societies in 
the past. The best-known example is that of the Inca ceques, conceptually 
(though not actually) straight lines radiating out from the capital, Cusco, 
throughout the entire Inca empire. Sacred sites and places, uacas, lay on the 
ceques. There is even evidence that a few ceques (though by no means all) 
were oriented astronomically. In cases such as this we may wonder how an- 
cient people perceived these lines, and whether in their minds they may in- 
deed have been the loci of sacred power. In doing so, we may find ourselves, 
as anthropologists, investigating an innate human desire to discern, and 
hence to try to reinforce, a structure in the landscape that we can under- 
stand. The ley line phenomenon, at least in its later manifestation, may rep- 


resent a more modern manifestation of this same innate desire.

Lockyer, Sir Norman (1836-1920) 


Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer was the first, at least in the English-speaking 


world, to introduce scientific method into the investigation of the possible 
astronomical significance of ancient monuments. He was a physicist, hailed 
for his discovery of helium through spectroscopic studies of the sun, and for 


many years the editor of the scientific journal Nature. In later life Lockyer 
became fascinated by possible solar and stellar alignments at Egyptian tem- 
ples and surveyed several of them, publishing his results in 1894 in a book 
entitled The Dawn of Astronomy. He was responsible for the idea that 
some temples were carefully designed so that a beam of light from the sun, 
or possibly a bright star, would shine down a long narrow passage, illumi- 
nating a dark sanctuary in the interior on particular days. This idea would 
be applied more generally in very different contexts in later times, one of its 
most famous manifestations being at Newgrange in Ireland. Later Lockyer 
turned his attention to his native Britain, surveying several dozen megalithic 
monuments all over the British Isles and publishing the results in 1906 un- 
der the title Stonehenge and Other British Stone Monuments Astronomi- 
cally Considered. This work inspired a generation of amateur archaeoas- 
tronomers, including the engineer Alexander Thom. Lockyer is less well 
known as the author of Surveying for Archaeologists, the first book on that 
topic, published in 1909.

Lunar and Luni-Solar Calendars 

One lunar phase cycle, also known as a lunation or a synodic month, is 
completed on average every 29.53 days. It is one of the most obvious of all 
the celestial cycles and has formed the fundamental basis for reckoning time 
in a wide range of human communities to the present day. Recognition of 
the lunar phase cycle may extend well back into Palaeolithic times: mark- 
ings on the 30,000-year-old Abri Blanchard bone have been identified as a 
possible lunar calendar. Yet the lunar phase cycle remains at the heart of 
some of the world’s great calendar systems, including both the Jewish and 
Islamic calendars. 

In the great majority of lunar calendars, the new month is taken to start 
following the new moon, with the first appearance of the thin crescent just 
after sunset. This particular point in the cycle is chosen because it is a clearly 
definable event; but even so there can be problems. Among the Mursi of 
southwestern Ethiopia, there is often disagreement as to whether the moon 


was really seen or not by someone who claims to have done so. Problems 


also arise if a critical evening is cloudy, and they are compounded if a single 
calendar needs to be consistently adopted over a wider area. The Islamic 
world faced this problem at an early stage, and at first Muslim astronomers 
used technical criteria to determine the theoretical visibility of the new 
moon. Nowadays an institutionalized algorithm is more widely adopted, in 
which the length of successive months alternates between twenty-nine and 
thirty days. However, it is still necessary to modify this from time to time. 

In many calendars, each day in the month is given a name. The Greeks 
divided the month into three periods of ten days known as decades, while 
other cultures simply distinguish between the waxing and waning halves. A 
variety of portents may be associated with the particular days or periods in 
the cycle. One of the most intricate examples of this is the Hawaiian ritual 
calendar, in which each month contains a number of taboo periods. Lunar 
prognostications also live on in folk traditions in various parts of the world. 

Problems occur as soon as any attempt is made to keep a lunar calen- 
dar in step with the seasonal year. Whether the number of months in a year 
is taken to be twelve or thirteen, the calendar will drift out of step with the 
seasons by more than a full month in only two or three years. Some lunar 
calendars, such as the Islamic calendar, simply proceed independently of the 
seasonal year. This calendar comprises twelve months and lasts 354 days, so 
that the start of each year moves back by eleven or twelve days in relation 
to the seasons. Thus, in 1994 the Islamic New Year occurred on June 11, 
while in 2004 it occurred on February 22. 

Calendars that are based on the cycle of the lunar phases but take ac- 
count of the seasonal (solar) year are known as /uni-solar. In these calendars, 
a month is periodically added or subtracted, a process known as intercala- 
tion. It is not necessary to do this formally: the Mursi manage it through a 
process of institutionalized disagreement and retrospective correction, Gen- 
erally, however, wherever people do need to know what month it is at any 
given time, definite procedures are required that determine the insertion or 
omission of an intercalary month. 

One way is to incorporate other forms of astronomical observation that 
are directly linked to the seasonal year. Among the most common are the ap- 
pearance and disappearance of certain stars or constellations in the dawn 
and dusk sky, known technically as their heliacal and acronical rise and set. 
Early ancient Egyptians, for example, used the heliacal rise of Sirius, which 
coincided with the beginning of the flood of the Nile, to decide whether to 
insert an intercalary month before the start of the new year. The Hawaiians 
and other Polynesians used the heliacal or sometimes the acronical rising of 
the Pleiades in similar ways. In ancient Greece, the practice of directly link- 
ing star appearances and disappearances with seasonal events or actions was 


documented as far back as the eighth century B.c.E. in the farmers’ almanac 


written by Hesiod, and it may have preceded the development of lunar cal- 
endars. Certainly, star calendars, or parapegmata, existed by the fifth cen- 
tury B.C.E. These were stone tablets used like pegboards for tracking the 365 
days in the year, and many of them were annotated with star configurations 
for each day. By this time lunar calendars existed too, and parapegmata 
could have provided any number of reference points—appropriate star ob- 
servations—for keeping a lunar calendar in step with the seasonal year. 

A different intercalation method came to light in Greece in the fifth cen- 
tury B.C.E, It emerged from a centuries-old Babylonian tradition that com- 
bined meticulous observation and recording with complex arithmetical cal- 
culations. The discovery was that adding seven intercalary months in every 
nineteen years kept a lunar calendar accurately in step with the seasonal year. 
The error is less than a fifth of a day in each cycle—just over a day in a cen- 
tury. This idea was propagated in Greece by Meton and bears his name—the 
Metonic cycle. The significance of the Metonic cycle is that it paved the way 
for empirical practices to be replaced by a set of mechanical rules. This de- 
velopment epitomizes the move toward a logical and mathematical way of 
understanding nature, and toward an abstract concept of time, which devel- 
oped in ancient Greece and prevails in the Western world today. 

Ironically, it is not clear that Meton’s scheme caught on widely, and 
empirical intercalation schemes may have persisted in many Greek cities. 
Even more crude and subjective schemes of intercalation persisted in the 
Roman world, but the schemes became so dogged by political interference 
that the calendar got more than three months out of step with the seasonal 
year before it was eventually replaced in the Roman world by the solar- 
based Julian calendar.

Lunar Eclipses 

When the moon is full, the side facing the earth is fully illuminated by sun- 
light, which means that it is also the side of the moon facing the sun. In 
other words, the earth is between the moon and the sun. More often than 


not, the earth doesn’t pass exactly between them, but when this does hap- 


pen—about once every sixth lunation—the moon passes through the earth’s 
shadow (umbra). At such times an astronaut on the moon would see the 
earth passing across in front of the sun—a rather different experience from 
seeing a solar eclipse from the earth, since the earth’s disc would appear 
about four times the size of the sun’s. 

The situation is actually more complicated than this example suggests, 
because the earth’s shadow has an inner cone (the umbra) and an outer part 
called the penumbra. If our astronaut on the moon stood within the penum- 
bra, he or she would see the equivalent of a partial solar eclipse. But if he or 
she stood within the umbra, the earth’s disc could entirely cover the sun. 
Around the disc an eerie glow would be visible—orange, reddish, or 
brown—due to sunlight reflected in the earth’s cloudy, dusty atmosphere. 

But how does this appear from the earth? If the moon passes through 
the penumbra but misses the umbra—a so-called penumbral eclipse—then 
the moon’s disc is slightly dimmed and the eclipse passes unnoticed to the 
naked eye. Such eclipses have no cultural impact and can be ignored, Um- 
bral eclipses may themselves be partial or total, depending whether the en- 
tire moon passes into the umbra. 

Lunar umbral eclipses, unlike solar ones, can be seen (weather permit- 
ting) from approximately half of the earth: from all places where the sun is 
below the horizon, it is night, and the moon—opposite to it in the sky—is 
up and visible. During a partial lunar eclipse—as well as in the stages lead- 
ing up to a total one—part of the moon is in the earth’s shadow and is dark. 
Sometimes a partially eclipsed moon could be mistaken for a normal cres- 
cent moon except that it is in the wrong position in the sky and, to the dis- 
cerning eye its appearance is odd—the crescent may be at an unusual angle 
and have an odd shape. A total lunar eclipse, however, can be truly spectac- 
ular. As soon as no bright part remains to overpower the rest, the whole lu- 
nar disc reappears but now glows dimly with a deep red, brown, or orange 
color. “Totality” can last as long as one and three-quarter hours. 

For modern city dwellers it is easy to miss even a total lunar eclipse, and 
for this reason we are inclined to think that for ancient peoples the social im- 
pact of a total solar eclipse—a truly rare event transforming day into night— 
would have been far greater. Yet anyone who relies upon the moon to illu- 
minate a dark night or as the basis of their calendar regulating seasonal, 
subsistence, and ritual activities may be alarmed to watch the full moon be- 
ing “eaten” away and then totally consumed. And such events are not rare: 
given clear skies and someone to wake us up when it happens, we would ex- 
pect to see roughly one total lunar eclipse every three years on average. 

To many peoples in the past, then, an eclipse of the moon was just as 
ominous, potentially frightening, and even calamitous, as a total solar 


eclipse. The Aztecs, certainly, were every bit as terrified of a lunar eclipse as 


of a solar one, as we know from the writings of the chronicler Fray 
Bernardino de Sahagtin: when the moon’s face darkened, women feared that 
their unborn children would be born lipless, noseless, or cross-eyed, or 
turned into mice. Maya, ancient and historical, variously saw the moon as 
being attacked, bitten, or eaten, and hence sick or dying, just as they saw the 
sun during a solar eclipse. The impression of the moon literally being eaten 
is reinforced by its blood-red color at the time of totality. Indeed, the moon 
being turned into blood was a common metaphor in medieval European 
chronicles. 

The blood-red color was also taken as a portent of death. The Anglo- 
Saxon Chronicles record that in C.E. 734 the moon was as though drenched 
with blood; this lunar eclipse was taken to presage the death of the Venera- 
ble Bede in the following year. Similarly, it has been supposed that a 
prophecy that the moon would “turn to blood” at the crucifixion of Christ 
might refer to a lunar eclipse (although this is highly questionable). Lunar 
eclipses were certainly taken very widely as a bad omen. An unexpected lu- 
nar eclipse in 413 B.c.E., for example, led the Athenian forces to postpone 
their departure from Syracuse, which they had held under siege for two years 
during the Peloponnesian war. This delay resulted in total military defeat. Al- 
most a millennium later, in c.E. 549, two Teutonic armies were preparing to 
wage battle in the Carpathian basin. It was nighttime. In their two camps, 
close but out of sight of each other, the chieftains and escorts on each side 
were likely drunk in their tents. Without warning, the soldiers of both 
armies—quite independently—simply fled from their camps, leaving their 
superiors with no choice but to conclude an armistice. The reason, it seems, 
was a total lunar eclipse. 

The Maori had a less calamitous view. According to Maori myth, a 
woman named Rona was snatched up by the moon after insulting it when it 
disappeared behind a cloud while she was trying to fetch water at night. 
Rona can still be seen in the face of the moon. During a lunar eclipse, Rona 
was attacking the moon and trying to destroy it. The result of the conflict, 
however, was far from calamitous: the moon ultimately returned reinvigo- 
rated, young and beautiful. 

Once people began to keep systematic records, the possibility emerged 
of predicting lunar eclipses. Since they can only occur at full moon, the chal- 
lenge is to predict which full moons are the mostly likely candidates. There 
are a variety of cycles that, once recognized, provide the means to do this at 
various levels of reliability. The simplest in the short term involves regular 
counting in sixes and fives: if a lunar eclipse occurs in month zero, then an- 
other is most likely in months six, twelve, eighteen, etc.; might happen in 
months five, eleven, seventeen, etc.; but cannot happen in any other month, 


The best-known longer-term cycle is the so-called Saros cycle of eighteen 


years and eleven days (223 lunations) discovered by the Babylonians, but the 
Chinese used one of ten years and 334 days (135 lunations), and the Maya 
recognized one of thirty-two years and 272 days (405 lunations), a time pe- 
riod commensurate with their 260-day sacred calendar round known as the 
tzolkin (405 lunations = 46 tzolkins to within a fraction of a day). None of 
these cycles is failsafe, however. Some of the predicted eclipses will only be 
partial, and some may occur but not be visible because they happen during 
daylight. Those that occur high in the sky in the middle of the night, and last 
longest, will be the most conspicuous. 

For many ancient peoples, the motivation for systematic astronomical 
observations—initially, at least—was divinatory. Thus ancient Chinese 
records of lunar eclipses date back to the Shang dynasty in the second half 
of the second millennium B.c.£., when they were recorded—together with as- 
sociated prognostications and verifications—on turtle shells and animal 
bones that have become known as oracle bones. However, as lunar eclipses 
became more predictable, around the year 0 and beyond, they began to lose 
their significance as portents and to fall into the domain of calendrics. They 
simply became part of the framework of regular and reliable events whose 
cycles could be calculated using careful record-keeping and mathematics. 
(Solar eclipses, in contrast, remained unpredictable and so continued to be 
regarded as bad omens.) The Maya, on the other hand, seem to have been 
obsessed with establishing exact numerical relationships between natural 
and entirely manmade cycles, and in particular with the 260-day tzolkin. 
Each day of this sacred round had particular characteristics that were cru- 
cial in fixing rituals and making prognostications. In complete contrast to 
the ancient Chinese, the desire to incorporate what were effectively astro- 
logical considerations into their calendar drove the Maya to ever greater lev- 


els of astronomical achievement.

Lunar Parallax 

We use modern astronomy to determine the appearance of the sky in dif- 
ferent parts of the world at different times in the past. The formulae we use 
are derived from mathematical models of the motions of the earth through 
space, as it orbits around the sun, spinning and wobbling under the gravi- 
tational influences of the sun and moon. One consequence of this is that 
when we use standard formulae to calculate the declination of a celestial 
body or event, we implicitly make the assumption that we are standing at 
the center of the earth. Although this sounds crazy, the distances of most ce- 
lestial objects are so vast that it makes no practical difference to the ar- 
chaeoastronomer studying naked-eye observations of the skies in the past. 
Only in the case of the moon is the difference important. 

The lunar parallax is the difference between the position of the moon 
in the sky as viewed (theoretically) from the center of the earth and (actu- 
ally) from somewhere on the earth’s surface. If we are interested in the pos- 
sibility of lunar alignments of a precision much greater than the size of the 
moon (about thirty arc minutes across), then we must take parallax into ac- 
count. There are two ways of doing this. The usual way, which is adequate 
in most cases, is to adjust the “target” declination values that correspond to 
various lunar events, such as the moonrise or moonset at the major stand- 
still limits. However, if we are interested, as was Alexander Thom, in possi- 
ble alignments of very high precision—precise to a just few minutes of arc— 
then we must take account of the fact that the parallax correction varies 
slightly from place to place and from time to time. We can only do this by 
increasing by an appropriate amount, different in each case, the altitude of 
any given horizon point, and hence of the moon if it were rising or setting 


behind that point, in order to calculate where it would be seen in the sky, 


and hence what its declination would be if we were standing at the earth’s 
center. The corrected declination, which can now be compared directly with 
the target declination, is known as the geocentric lunar declination.

Lunar Phase Cycle 

The changing phases of the moon form the most obvious regular cycle of 
events in the night sky. This phase cycle of the moon, known by as- 
tronomers as the synodic month and also as a lunation, is between twenty- 
nine and thirty days long. The details depend upon the viewer’s latitude on 
earth, the time of year, and upon the timing in relation to certain longer- 
term cycles of the moon, but generally the phase cycle adheres to the fol- 
lowing pattern. After a period of no more than a few days when the moon 
is not seen at all, a thin crescent moon is seen low in the western sky just 
after sunset, following the sun downward. During the next few nights, the 
moon grows in phase night by night and also appears higher in the western 
sky night by night, taking longer until it sets. By the time half phase is 
reached, also known confusingly as first quarter, since this is a quarter of 
the way through the cycle, the moon appears close to the north-south 
meridian at dusk and sets approximately halfway through the night. Dur- 
ing the next seven days it becomes gibbous. It now appears in the eastern 
sky at dusk, or may even be visible before dusk, taking most of the night to 
pass at first across the meridian and then set in the west in the early hours. 
Finally, the moon becomes full. The full moon rises around dusk and sets 
around dawn. Then, during the next seven days, while it decreases back to 
half phase, it rises progressively later each night and is still high in the west- 
ern sky at dawn. By the time half phase (third quarter) is reached, it rises 
approximately halfway through the night and reaches the meridian around 
dawn. Then finally, as it diminishes back to a crescent, it rises progressively 
later and later, getting less and less far up into the eastern sky by dawn, un- 
til finally the thin crescent is seen only briefly just before sunrise. 

The lunar phase cycle is likely to have been recognized by human com- 
munities well back into Palaeolithic times. One obvious practical conse- 
quence of the changing lunar phases is that at certain times in the month one 
can see to travel about at night, when hunting, for example. Seafaring com- 


munities could also become aware that the appearance of the moon is related 


to the tides. The fact that the length of the phase cycle is close to that of the 
female menstrual cycle has led to controversial suggestions that groups of 
women in hunter-gatherer communities would tend to synchronize their 
menstrual periods not only with one another but also with the phases of the 
moon. This, alongside the other effects, could lead to the regulation of food 
gathering, fishing, hunting, cooking, feasting, and sexual activity—all in ac- 
cordance with the moon. And this cycle, in turn, would eventually become 
“institutionalized,” reinforced through ritual practices and taboos related to 
the lunar phases, and encapsulated in myth. Although this sequence of events 
is speculative, examples abound of the influence of the lunar cycles on hu- 
man activity. Indigenous peoples in the historical and modern world often 
tied ritual practices to the phases of the moon (the Hawaiian calendar is just 
one example), and many folk practices and beliefs relate to the lunar phase 
cycle, such as those found in the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia.

Maes Howe 

The gently rolling landscape of the Orkney Islands, north of mainland 
Scotland, is home to a wealth of prehistoric monuments, few more impres- 
sive than the great passage tomb at Maes Howe. Probably built around 
3000 B.c.E., it is the largest of its type in Scotland. Its dome-shaped mound 
is estimated to have been some 38 meters (125 feet) across and about eight 
meters (26 feet) high, and its huge central chamber, cruciform in shape and 
over 4.5 meters (15 feet) across in each direction, was probably more than 
4 meters (13 feet) high originally. This was reached via a low passage over 
15 meters (50 feet) long, which enters the mound from the southwest. 

The passage at Maes Howe is aligned so that the light of the setting sun 
on the shortest day of the year shines along its entire length and onto the 
back wall of the main chamber. However, this solstitial alignment is far from 
exact. A similar phenomenon occurs daily from more than a month before 
the solstice until more than a month after it, and the same would have been 
true in prehistory. In fact, a most impressive light phenomenon occurs about 
twenty-one days (twenty-two to twenty-three days when the tomb was 
built) before and after the solstice. On these days the sun, having set behind 
the top of Ward Hill, on the adjacent island of Hoy, reappears briefly to the 
side of the hill a few minutes later, suddenly striking the back of the cham- 
ber for a second time. 

Archaeologist Euan MacKie has argued that the tomb was not poorly 
aligned upon the solstice but very precisely aligned upon the sun’s setting 
position twenty-two or twenty-three days before and after it. These dates, 
argued MacKie, were significant because they represented “epoch dates” in 
a calendar that divided the year into exactly sixteen equal parts of (on av- 
erage) 22.8 days each. The existence of such a calendar in Neolithic Britain 
had been argued by the engineer Alexander Thom on the basis of a variety 
of supposed alignments at different megalithic monuments. However, it has 
subsequently been shown that if the data are selected fairly, there is no con- 
vincing evidence to support it. This fact, quite apart from a number of other 


Maes Howe passage tomb, Orkney Islands, Scotland. Behind the tomb are the bills of Hoy, which the entrance of the 
tomb faces. (Adam Woolfitt/Corbis) 


arguments, undermines the calendrical interpretation of Maes Howe. 

On the other hand, it remains possible that the imprecise solstitial 
alignment was deliberate, and comparisons have inevitably been made be- 
tween Maes Howe and the Irish passage tomb of Newgrange, which is also 
aligned upon the midwinter solstitial sun, though at sunrise rather than sun- 
set. However, Maes Howe lacks anything like the famous “roof-box” that 
distinguishes Newgrange, and which allowed the sun to shine into that tomb 
even after the entrance had been blocked off. The entrance at Maes Howe 
was blocked off too, admittedly using a stone that was too short, and some 
have argued that this was to permit the continued entry of sunlight for a sim- 
ilar purpose, but this argument is controversial. And the alignment at Maes 
Howe is even less precise than that at Newgrange. Yet the fact that the align- 
ment was imprecise does not mean that the tomb was badly constructed or 
unfit for its purpose. Some, indeed, have argued that the vagaries of the 
Orkney weather would have made this imprecision a necessity. 

Yet to dwell too long on the precision of the alignment, or the actual 
interplay of sunlight within the tomb at or dates close to the solstice, may be 
missing the point. We may learn more of the purpose and meaning of the ori- 


entation of Maes Howe tomb by examining the archaeology of the living. 


The Orkney Islands are rare in that they contain evidence of Neolithic set- 
tlements. One of these is the famous village at Skara Brae, with its stone 
houses huddled together as protection against the winds and weather, some 
containing still-visible central hearths and dressers made of stone. In the 
1980s, excavations commenced at a newly discovered village at Barnhouse, 
only about one kilometer (one-half mile) from Maes Howe. They revealed a 
number of houses, cruciform in shape like the Maes Howe chamber, includ- 
ing a particularly large one remarkably similar in form to the nearby tomb. 
This discovery reinforces the oft-made suggestion that the design of tombs— 
houses for the dead—reflected that of houses for the living. One aspect of 
design is orientation, and tombs may well have echoed orientation practices 
common among houses for the living. In this way they did not only reflect 
what we would consider “practical” considerations; they also reflected prin- 
ciples that were symbolic or cosmological, though of no less importance to 
their builders. Such principles still operate among a number of modern in- 
digenous peoples, good examples being the Navajo and Pawnee in the 
United States. 

Neolithic houses in Orkney are characterized by a remarkable consis- 
tency in their spatial arrangement. A square hearth is always located in the 
center, a stone dresser is always found against the wall opposite the door, 
and rectangular stone boxes, generally assumed to be beds, were placed 
against the side walls. This uniformity provides ample evidence that activi- 
ties in these houses were, indeed, governed and strongly constrained by a 
consistent set of ordering principles. These principles no doubt derived from 
how people perceived and understood the world, and served in their minds 
to keep everyday life in tune with the cosmos. 

Studies of the orientations of houses at Barnhouse, together with other 
Neolithic villages in Orkney, show a marked preference for entrances in the 
southeast. Given other similarities between houses for the living and houses 
for the dead, it comes as little surprise that the many chambered tombs in 
the area were oriented in the same direction, Maes Howe itself being an ex- 
ception. However, in many cases, the only indication of the orientation of an 
excavated house is the orientation of the hearth, since all other features have 
disappeared. We can extrapolate the orientations of the walls, but we can- 
not tell which wall contained the entrance. When studied systematically, the 
hearth orientations—and hence the wall-directions—cluster broadly but 
quite unequivocally around the intercardinal directions; the cardinal direc- 
tions themselves were avoided. The four wall-directions also cluster around 
the directions of sunrise and sunset at the solstices and may have been in- 
tended to be oriented upon them, but this is uncertain. It is clear, though, 
that one of the basic ordering principles of the cosmos, which constrained 


the orientation of houses and, by extrapolation, tombs, was a quartering de- 


marcated by the cardinal directions. This quartering recalls the quadripartite 
cosmologies common among indigenous American peoples such as the 
Navajo and Pawnee. 

Given this context, the solstitial alignment at Maes Howe should surely 
be interpreted not as an indicator of an illusory prehistoric calendar of sup- 
posed remarkable precision, but in a more modest way, as a particularly fine 
reflection of prevailing views of the cosmos.

Magellanic Clouds 

The two Magellanic Clouds are the most extensive patches of fuzzy light 
(nebulae) in the sky, apart from the Milky Way itself, and can be seen from 
the southern hemisphere and tropics. Where the Milky Way sweeps past the 
south celestial pole, they are seen on the opposite side of the pole, the Small 
(or Lesser) Magellanic Cloud (SMC) more or less directly across from the 
Southern Cross, and the Large (or Greater) Magellanic Cloud (LMC) off to 
one side. Most of the LMC falls within the southern constellation of Do- 
rado (the “goldfish”—or more strictly, the Hawaiian mahi-mahi). When the 
Southern Cross, which is within the Milky Way, appears high in the sky 
above the pole, the SMC will be seen close to the horizon below the pole, 
with the LMC over to its right, looking like detached pieces of the Milky 
Way itself. As nights progress, the Milky Way and the two Magellenic 
Clouds, together with all the individual stars and other objects in the sky, 
swing round the pole, just as the Great and Little Bear (Ursa Major and 


Ursa Minor) and other stars do in the north, but in the opposite direction 
(i.e., clockwise). 

The Magellanic Clouds are actually great clumps of stars, or dwarf 
galaxies, satellite appendages to our own large galaxy (the Milky Way). Each 
contains hundreds of millions of stars, but this is only a small fraction of the 
number of stars contained in the Milky Way itself. 

Not surprisingly given their visual prominence in southern skies, the 
Magellanic Clouds frequently feature in southern-hemisphere cosmologies 
and myths. A number of different stories have been recorded among Aus- 
tralian Aboriginals. To one group in Arnhem Land, toward the northern tip 
of Northern Territory, Australia, the Magellanic Clouds represent the homes 
of two sisters. When only the SMC is visible, it is said that the elder of the 
two, who dwells in the LMC, journeys away. Her younger sister eventually 
persuades her to return in the wet season, when they can go out together to 
collect yams. They were also widely recognized in ancient Polynesia: to the 
ancient Hawaiians, for example, they were “white butterfly” and “dark but- 
terfly.” One story among the Khoisan bush-peoples of southwestern Africa 
starts with the culture hero #Gao (the # symbol represents a palatal click, or 
the sound made when the tongue is pressed against the roof of the mouth 
and then quickly removed) standing on the LMC, looking around for game 
to hunt. He eventually spots three zebras (Orion’s belt) but his arrow 
(Orion’s sword), aimed at the middle one, falls short. 

One could continue to recount such stories, but these three examples 
alone are sufficient to demonstrate the diverse ways in which different peo- 
ples can perceive the same objects in the skies, each colored by their own 
earthly environment and subsistence practices.

Mangareva 

Mangareva is the largest of the Gambier Islands at the southeastern corner 
of French Polynesia. South of this group lies nothing but clear ocean all the 
way to Antarctica. To the east lie just four small and scattered islands in the 
Pitcairn group, and then well over 2,000 kilometers (1,400 miles) beyond 
those, the remote Rapa Nui (Easter Island), the most isolated outpost of an- 


cient Polynesia. In 1834, a Belgian priest by the name of Honoré Laval be- 


gan working as a missionary on Mangareva. He remained on the island for 
almost four decades and compiled a detailed account of the indigenous peo- 
ples. Ironically, their traditional religious practices were simultaneously being 
relentlessly destroyed in the missionary zeal to convert them to Catholicism. 

Laval describes the use of two tall, dressed stones set up side by side on 
a small mountain, for determining the solstice. When the sun rose between 
them, a “learned person” called Akaputu, seated on a flat stone in the mid- 
dle of the village, announced that the sun had reached its resting place. The 
anthropologist and Maori scholar Sir Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hiroa), who vis- 
ited the island a century later, coincidentally published his Ethnology of 
Mangareva in the same year Laval’s account, which had languished in mis- 
sionary archives in Belgium, was finally brought to publication. Buck docu- 
ments four separate places where observations were made of the northern 
and southern limits of the course of the sun along the horizon. The place of 
observation, in one case at least, was a flat rock or stone on which the priest 
sat. From vantages close to the east coast, the changing rising position of the 
sun could be tracked against various islets visible on the reef to the east. Else- 
where, people took advantage of other foresights, such as natural landmarks 
on mountain ridges, and sometimes used the setting rather than the rising 
sun. In another case, the focus of attention was the shadow of a mountain 
at sunset: when this reached a certain stone, the winter (June) solstice had 
arrived. The practice of placing a pair of stones on the horizon to mark the 
limiting rising or setting position of the sun with maximum precision seems 
to have represented the culmination of this widespread tradition. 

Archaeological and archaeoastronomical work by the American an- 
thropologist Patrick Kirch has recently established, beyond any reasonable 
doubt, the location of one platform used to make solstitial observations as 
recorded by Laval. The platform at Atituiti Ruga is about twenty-three me- 
ters (seventy-five feet) square and contains a large, flat boulder at its center. 
From here, sunrise on summer (December) solstice was observed over 
Agakauitai, an island in the outer barrier reef that is visible on the sea hori- 
zon to the east. The shadow of the eastern peak of Auorotini (Mount Duff), 
which towers over the site to the north, passed across the platform shortly 
after local noon on the winter (June) solstice. 

Why was it important to keep track of the sun? One possibility is that 
the solstices were used to mark the start of the new season or the new year. A 
side benefit of this would be to keep the calendar in phase with the seasons. 
The Mangarevan calendar had much in common with the calendars of most 
of the rest of Polynesia: it was a lunar calendar based on the phase cycle of 
the moon, days within the month were reckoned by nights of the moon, and 
it used month and day names of which variants appear more widely. As is the 


case with all lunar calendars, it would have been necessary to insert an inter- 


calary month from time to time in order to keep the months in step with the 
seasons, Making observations of the solstices would be one way to do this. 

However, even though the calendar is of a type familiar through Poly- 
nesia, clear evidence of careful observations of the solstices is nonexistent 
elsewhere, except for hints in Hawai‘i. This raises the question: did a par- 
ticular concern with the annual motions of the sun happen to develop in 
Mangareva but not in other places, or was it a wider Polynesian preoccu- 
pation that just happens to have survived long enough in this island to be 
reliably recorded?

Maya Long Count 

The Maya were the most enduring of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The 
origins of Maya society can be traced back to at least 400 B.c.£. in the low- 
lands of the Yucatan peninsula, when existing small villages—which, in the 
dry north, were built close to cenotes, sink holes full of vital water formed 
by the collapse of underground caves—started to develop into more sprawl- 
ing towns with monumental structures at their centers. This process accel- 
erated, with social elites beginning to gain power, during what is known as 
the Late Preclassic, or Late Formative, period, which lasted until about C.E. 
250. In the Classic period that followed, the political structure of the Maya 
lowlands developed into a patchwork of city states—anywhere from about 
twenty-five to about sixty of them at different times—creating a continually 
shifting network of wars and alliances. Each political center was also a re- 
ligious one, with ceremonial buildings and pyramids surrounding a large 
central plaza. But the ninth century brought change. Many of the largest 
Maya cities were suddenly abandoned for no clearly apparent reason. One 
of the exceptions was Chichen Itza, which endured and even reached its 
apex in the ensuing Postclassic period, from about C.E. 900-1300. Maya de- 
scendents, speaking dialects of the Maya language, continue to live in 
southern Mexico, Guatemala, and adjacent countries. 


That the Maya peoples were prepossessed with astronomy is beyond 
dispute, although the motivation seems to have been primarily astrological. 
The Maya shared the general Mesoamerican concern with calendrical cycles, 
taking to tremendous lengths the quest to find coincidence between different 
numbers of cycles of different celestial bodies. However, one of their most 
incredible achievements was the adoption, development, and extensive use 
of the linear calendar known as the Long Count. Underlying this was a set 
of time units—baktuns (periods of four hundred years), katuns (twenty 
years), tuns (years of 360 days), uinals (twenty days) and kins (days}—and 
each progressive day was simply expressed as a number of each unit. For ex- 
ample, 9.17.19.13.16 meant nine baktuns, seventeen katuns, nineteen tuns, 
thirteen uinals and sixteen days. 

One crucial prerequisite, without which Long Count dates could never 
have been recorded and, arguably, the Long Count is unlikely even to have 
been conceived, is a system for recording numbers using a fixed base. Mod- 
ern (Arabic) numerals use a decimal (base ten) system, so that 8,945 signi- 
fies 5 units + 4 tens + 9 hundreds (10 x 10) + 8 thousands (10 x 10 x 10). 
The Maya did the same, except they used different symbols to express the 
digits and used a base of twenty. Thus, when they wrote (in their own vi- 
gesimal, rather than decimal, notation) 1.2.7.5 this signified 5 units + 7 
twenties + 2 four-hundreds (20 x 20) + 1 eight-thousand (20 x 20 x 20)—in 
other words, the same number. (The use of base twenty makes sense: our 
base ten derives from counting using the fingers and thumbs, and people 
have twenty digits on their hands and feet.) To represent the individual nu- 
merical digits, the Maya used bars and dots. Each dot counted one and each 
bar five. Thus the digit seven was represented by a bar and two dots. When 
reading Maya numbers it is essential to remember that each set of bars and 
dots represents a single digit. In a base-twenty system, we need symbols for 
all the digits from one to nineteen, and so the largest, nineteen, was repre- 
sented by three bars and four dots. Finally, in any fixed-base notation we 
need a symbol for zero. The Maya used a stylized nut, shell, or other vari- 
ants. More esoteric ways of recording numbers also existed, such as repre- 
senting each digit from 0 to 19 as a deity’s head shown in profile with dis- 
tinctive attributes. 

Before any society can develop a fixed-base recording system for num- 
bers, they must develop two concepts: first, the idea that the position of a 
digit can be used to signify value—that is, depending on its place, a digit can 
represent units, twenties, four-hundreds, etc.; second, the concept of zero in 
order to concoct a symbol to represent it. Once these bridges are crossed, 
two major advantages soon emerge. The first is the ease with which one can 
do simple arithmetic. It is a trivial matter to multiply a Maya numeral by 


twenty by simply adding a zero on the end, and other sums are easily solved 


using straightforward rules, just as with modern numbers; but they would be 
frightfully difficult using, say, Roman numerals. The second advantage is the 
ability to represent arbitrarily large numbers (since it is always possible to 
add further digits). It is this ability that aided the conceptualization of the 
long periods of time that underlie the Long Count. 

The relationship between Long Count dates and base-twenty numbers 
fell out naturally, since each time unit was twenty times larger than the next 
smaller one, with the single exception of the tun, which is eighteen rather 
than twenty winals in order to achieve a “year” not too different in length 
from the real one. In fact, all written records that have come down to us are 
calendrical, and in these the Maya used a modified vigesimal system to ex- 
press all numbers, in which the third-to-last digit was 18, rather than 20, 
times the second-to-last one. 

The significance for us of Long Count dates is that they permit us to 
date sites and artifacts. The significance for the ancient Maya was that they 
could achieve a grand conception of history. On the first point, most Maya 
calendrical inscriptions give the Long Count and Calendar Round (haab plus 
tzolkin) date. One of the main challenges is to find events, dated according 
to the Long Count, that can also be dated within our own (Gregorian) cal- 
endar to permit a correlation between the two. Astronomical events such as 
eclipses are one possibility; recorded events soon after the conquest are an- 
other. Once the correlation is determined any Long Count date can be con- 
verted to a Gregorian one. The issue of finding the definitive correlation has 
occupied Maya scholars for many decades. 

On the second point, since the Long Count was a linear calendar, the 
Maya could conjure up key (mythical) historical events and assign them 
dates that seemed significant within the Long Count, such as the beginning 
of a new baktun. Even more fundamentally, they had to fix a zero date for 
the whole scheme—an assumed date of creation. The date chosen corre- 
sponds in the Gregorian calendar to about August 13, 3114 B.c.E. (depend- 
ing upon the correlation). One explanation of why this particular date was 
chosen is that it was obtained by retrogressing the Calendar Round and 
other observed astronomical cycles in order to reach a date of key (per- 
ceived) astronomical significance. 

The Long Count could also be extended into the future and provided a 
source of prognostication. It is commonly believed that the ancient Maya 
even predicted the end of the world, which would occur at the end of bak- 
tun 13, around December 21, 2012. However it now seems more likely that 
they considered the present era would contain 20 baktuns, or a complete pic- 
tun of 8,000 years, giving the world considerably longer. 

A more sobering thought is that without the historical evidence of 


Maya inscriptions and the few books that only survive through fortunate ac- 


cident, we would know little or nothing of the existence—let alone the dis- 
tinctiveness or complexities—of Maya astronomy and calendrics. Although 
a few anomalous round towers, such as the Caracol at Chichen Itza, have 
been suggested as possible observatories, there is no convincing archaeolog- 
ical evidence of any Maya astronomical measuring instruments.

Medicine Wheels 


The structures known as medicine wheels are distinctive configurations of 
boulders found across the Great Plains region of Canada and the United 
States. Over 130 examples are known; they are typically found in remote 
spots at high elevations. Among the most famous are Majorville Cairn in 
Alberta, Moose Mountain in Saskatchewan, and Big Horn in Wyoming. 
The archetypal medicine wheel is a few tens of meters (around a hundred 
feet) across and exhibits a characteristic “spoked wheel” structure, with an 
outer ring and a central cairn. In practice, however, no two are the same 
and the form varies widely. The supernatural and shamanic associations 
that have given rise to the term “medicine” are modern. Yet at sites such as 
Majorville, the large central cairn—striking both because of its size and be- 
cause of the inclusion of a variety of colorful local stones topped with re- 
cent offerings—has evidently been cumulated over a very long period. Ar- 
chaeological evidence corroborates this conclusion (the site was excavated 
in the 1970s) and demonstrates that there has been more or less continuous 
activity at the site for as long as five thousand years. 

Medicine wheels were among the earliest indigenous structures in the 
Americas to be analyzed astronomically, at around the time of the rise of 
“megalithic astronomy” in Britain in the 1970s. Big Horn, for example, was 
found to have a plausible axis of symmetry oriented upon midsummer sun- 
rise and excited much attention. This was followed by the discovery of align- 


ments upon midsummer sunset and the rising positions of the stars Alde-

of brightly colored stone; the outer ring and some of the radial spokes are also visible. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


baran, Rigel, and Sirius. The idea that these alignments could have been in- 
tentional was backed up by the common-sense argument that the heliacal ris- 
ings of the three stars, and of course the summer solstice sunrise and sunset, 
all occurred during the summer months, when the site would not have been 
covered with deep, drifting snow. 

However, as astronomical interest in medicine wheels grew, the ease 
with which solar, stellar, and even lunar alignments could be identified— 
and replaced by new ones when errors were found in earlier calculations— 
became disconcerting. A more systematic study in the 1990s by the Cana- 
dian archaeoastronomer David Vogt revealed little overall consistency in 
patterns of orientation and astronomical alignment. The basic problem 
was that the alignment hunters had paid little attention to the cultural con- 
text. 

Anthropological studies have suggested a variety of functions that med- 
icine wheels may have served: as monuments to the dead, for example; as fo- 
cuses for Sun Dance rituals; or as sacred places where those on solitary Vi- 
sion Quests went to seek the patronage of guardian spirits. Such ideas do not 
rule out the possibility that solar and stellar alignments were incorporated 
into at least some medicine wheels as a vital part of their broader function; 


but it is difficult to see any need for high precision, and the ways in which 


alignments were achieved are likely to have been as many and various as the 


different forms of the medicine wheels themselves.

“Megalithic Astronomy” 

This term, which is a chapter title in Alexander Thom’s first book, came to 
be synonymous with Thom’s ideas concerning the astronomical significance 
of the megalithic monuments of Britain. It is generally felt by archaeologists 
to be unhelpful (along with terms such as “megalithic mensuration,” “mega- 
lithic geometry,” and “megalithic man”) because there was no “megalithic 
culture” as such. The prehistoric communities who built many of the mega- 
lithic monuments of Britain and Ireland also built structures in earth, timber, 
and other materials; it is just that the stone constructions have best with- 
stood the passing of time so that many of them remain, conspicuous, in the 
modern landscape.

“Megalithic” Calendar 
Sir Norman Lockyer, writing early in the twentieth century, was one of the 


first to suggest that there was a widespread calendrical practice in Neolithic 


and Bronze Age Britain and Ireland that involved dividing the year into 
eight equal parts. This calendrical practice fed through into Celtic times two 
millennia later, and thence to medieval pagan and Christianized calendrical 
festivals. It has nothing to do with lunar months but instead involves count- 
ing the days from one of the solstices. The eight division points are the two 
solstices themselves, the two equinoxes, and the four mid-quarter days. 

When Alexander Thom started to survey scores of British megalithic 
monuments several decades later, and to examine their astronomical poten- 
tial, he noticed accumulations of alignments upon the position of sunrise or 
sunset at each of these eight dates. There was even some hint of an interest 
in the dates halfway in between them. On the basis of this evidence Thom 
proposed that there existed in Neolithic Britain a “megalithic calendar” di- 
viding the year into sixteen equal parts, each twenty-two or twenty-three 
days long, demarcated by “epoch dates,” which in the modern (Gregorian) 
calendar would correspond, to within a day or so, to June 21 (solstice), July 
14, August 6 (mid-quarter day), August 28, September 20 (equinox), Octo- 
ber 13, November 5 (mid-quarter day), November 28, December 21 (sol- 
stice), January 12, February 4 (mid-quarter day), February 27, March 22 
(equinox), April 14, May 6 (mid-quarter-day), and May 29. While the six- 
teen-division calendar never gained wide acceptance, there was a great at- 
traction in the idea that the eight-fold division of the year represented a 
thread of continuity stretching through the Celtic calendar and into the even 
more remote past. Indeed, mid-quarter day alignments have been found 
among stone circles, such as Beltany in County Donegal, Ireland; among Ne- 
olithic passage tombs dating back to the late fourth millennium B.c.£., such 
as Dowth (one of the large tombs in the Boyne valley) and Bryn Celli Ddu 
on the Isle of Anglesey (Ynys M6n) in Wales; and even in one Earlier Ne- 
olithic site (a U-shaped setting of timber posts) at Godmanchester in Cam- 
bridgeshire, England. 

Yet this argument may be circular. There is a distinct danger of our 
picking out “calendrical” alignments because they seem interesting—be- 
cause they form part of our list of astronomical targets deemed worthy of at- 
tention—while ignoring many other alignments that do not point at calen- 
drical targets. Lockyer was certainly aware of existing ideas about the Celtic 
calendar, as was Thom. Reassessments of Thom’s data, paying stricter at- 
tention to the fair selection of data, have failed to duplicate his results re- 
garding the calendar, as have systematic studies of local groups of monu- 
ments. Added to this, the whole notion of a precise “Celtic” calendar, 
confidently assumed by Lockyer and Thom and their contemporaries, is now 
known to be highly problematic and questionable in itself. 

Finally, one of the other criticisms of Thom’s megalithic calendar was 


that he did not find calendrical sites as such (although the site at Brainport 


Bay in Argyll, Scotland, was subsequently claimed as one), but rather a scat- 
ter of individual monuments with isolated alignments, each of which indi- 
cated sunrise or sunset on just one of the various calendrical epoch dates.

Megalithic Monuments of Britain and Ireland 
All over Britain and Ireland, and particularly in the more remote northern 
and western areas of Britain and the western side of Ireland, the traveler is 
quite likely to encounter one of the hundreds—indeed, several thousands— 
of megalithic monuments (monuments built of large stones) that form a 
conspicuous legacy of the prehistoric past of the British Isles. Erected in the 
Neolithic period or the earlier part of the Bronze Age, between the later part 
of the fourth millennium B.c.£. and the later part of the second millennium 
B.C.E., this category of monuments includes huge passage tombs such as 
Newgrange in Ireland and Maes Howe in Scotland, and spectacular settings 
of standing stones such as Callanish in Scotland and Avebury and Stone- 
henge in southern England. It also includes a great many more modest 
tombs and temples, often found in remote fields and farmlands, as well as 
stone circles, short stone rows, and many single standing stones. 

These alluring and mysterious monuments have attracted astronomical 
attention ever since the earliest antiquarians roamed the British Isles as far 
back as the seventeenth century. The first person to bring any semblance of 
a scientific method to this type of investigation was Sir Norman Lockyer at 
the beginning of the twentieth century. However, the most famous name in 
this regard is Alexander Thom who, from the 1950s to the 1970s, espoused 
the idea that they functioned as astronomical observatories and incorporated 
high-precision alignments upon the rising and setting positions of the sun, 
moon, and stars. These conclusions concerning “megalithic astronomy” 
caused controversy for many years, until a consensus among archaeologists 
and astronomers finally began to emerge toward the end of the 1980s. 

From the archaeological point of view, it is important to realize that 


this category of monument does not reflect a particular cultural development

but rather a practice of construction using large stones that emerged among 
the early farmers of the Neolithic period and spread, developing all the time 
in various ways, until it finally faded out toward the end of the Bronze Age. 
It manifests itself in various forms of monument, doubtless with many dif- 
ferent purposes. Some, like the great sarsen monument at Stonehenge, were 
unique, while others evidently represented regional traditions, since monu- 
ments of very similar form were found in considerable numbers in particu- 
lar local areas. Examples of the latter are the wedge tombs of western Ire- 
land and the recumbent stone circles of northeastern Scotland. Many of 
these regional practices appear to have emerged, and then faded away, 
within a fairly short period compared with the two millennia or so that the 
whole megalithic tradition persisted in Britain and Ireland. The whole tra- 
dition itself forms part of a wider megalithic tradition that is particularly 
prominent on the Atlantic fringes of western and northern Europe, al- 
though megalithic monuments are also found in other parts of Europe and 
indeed all over the world at such places as Carahunge in Armenia, Nabta 
Playa in Egypt, and Rujm el-Hiri in Israel. This wide distribution in itself 
helps to emphasize that we should not see the practice of building things 
with big stones as a key indicator of significant ethnic or cultural identities 
in the past. 


All this helps to explain archaeologists’ skepticism in the 1970s toward 
archaeoastronomical theories such as Thom’s that implied the existence in 
Neolithic Britain of a “megalithic science” that was well developed, stable, 
and consistently practiced (by “megalithic man”) from one end of the British 
Isles to the other. More recent evidence reveals much more complex and re- 
gionally specific developments in astronomy throughout the two millennia 
when megalithic monuments of various forms were being constructed. Im- 
portant examples in this regard are the axial stone circles of southwest Ire- 
land, the wedge tombs of western Ireland, and the Clava cairns and recum- 
bent stone circles of northeast Scotland.

Megalithic “Observatories” 

In the mid-twentieth century, the engineer Alexander Thom proposed that 
many British megalithic monuments functioned in prehistory as devices for 
observing the sun, moon, or stars. Actually, the horizon was the real ob- 
serving instrument. Given a sufficiently distant horizon, and provided that 
the observing position is closely enough defined, then any clear, unmistak- 
able horizon feature such as a jagged hilltop or a sharp notch between two 
steep slopes can be used to pinpoint a particular direction. From the right 
observing position, the notch or other feature can be used as a foresight 
marking the rising or setting point of a celestial body to remarkable preci- 
sion, perhaps to as little as a few arc minutes. For instance, the difference 
in the rising or setting position of the sun on the solstice and a couple of 
days earlier or later is normally imperceptible. However, by choosing a suit- 
able observing position and horizon notch, an oberserver could distinguish 
the solstice, Thom observed, on the basis of whether or not a brief flash of 
sunlight from the very edge of the sun’s disc appeared in the notch. Many 
megalithic monuments, he claimed, marked both the place to stand and the 
direction in which to look. They could, in this sense, appropriately be la- 


beled “observatories.” Classic examples include the stone row at Bal- 


lochroy and the standing stone at Kintraw, both near the coast of Argyll, 
western Scotland. 

Thom’s ideas of high-precision alignments have not withstood the test 
of time. During the 1970s and 1980s many problems came to light, includ- 
ing day-to-day variations in atmospheric refraction, and extinction in the 
case of stars; and many difficulties were found with Thom’s selection of data 
(see, for example, Brodgar, Ring of). Many archaeologists were deeply sus- 
picious from the outset of the idea of “observatories” in prehistory. They did 
not necessarily dismiss out of hand the possibility of deliberate astronomical 
alignments; what disturbed them was the idea that monumental alignments 
were used primarily as observing devices. Surely, if the aim was merely to 
mark a rising or setting position, one could simply use a temporary marker 
such as a wooden stake, as is done by sun-watchers among the Mursi in 
Ethiopia. There would be no need to go to all the bother of erecting big 
stones. Given that big stones were used, it would seem more likely that they 
were encapsulating an alignment that was already well known, perhaps us- 
ing it for symbolic or ceremonial purposes. This would be entirely consistent 
with the human tendency, identified by anthropologists, to encapsulate rela- 
tionships of cosmological significance in monumental architecture. This sort 
of explanation also fits well with the lower-precision alignments that are 
more commonly indicated by research in archaeoastronomy today.

Meridian 


The meridian is a line running directly overhead across the sky, joining the 
north point on the horizon to the south point. Technically, it is defined as 
the complete circle around the celestial sphere that also passes directly un- 
derneath, but this definition can be ignored for current purposes. Any ob- 
server on earth, unless they are standing at one of the two poles, has a 


meridian. Every celestial body crosses that meridian once each day, halfway 


in time between rising in the east and setting in the west, assuming that the 
eastern and western horizons are level or at a similar altitude; circumpolar 
stars, which never rise or set, cross it twice. The celestial north pole lies on 
the meridian for observers in the northern hemisphere, as does the celestial 
south pole for observers in the southern hemisphere. Outside the tropics, 
every celestial object reaches its highest altitude, or point of culmination, on 
the meridian. In particular, the sun crosses the meridian at local noon: at 
this time, the shadow of a vertical pole is shortest and points due north in 
the northern hemisphere or south in the southern hemisphere. 

The cultural significance of the meridian is that it is an axis of symme- 
try around which all the celestial bodies swing evenly in the course of their 
diurnal motion. Anything aligned along this axis on the ground (i.e., due 
north-south) will appear naturally “in tane” with the symmetry of the heav- 
ens. Perhaps this was one reason the Great North Road leading into and out 
of Chaco Canyon was so closely aligned along the meridian. Meridianal 
alignments are also oriented, consequentially, upon the celestial pole, which 
is often seen as the hub of the heavens, the point that keeps the cosmos in 
place, or the point of connection with the upper world. Aligning earthly 
structures along the meridian can serve to confirm and reinforce the power 
of great leaders, whether living, as in the imperial Forbidden City in Beijing, 
or dead, as with those entombed in the Pyramids of Giza. 

How, though, was the meridian determined in practice, especially when 
reasonable accuracy was desired? After dispensing with modern instruments, 
the simplest way in the northern hemisphere at the present time might be to 
orient directly upon Polaris, which would give true north to within a degree; 
but owing to precession no bright star marked the pole at most times in the 
past. One possibility is to use two chosen circumpolar stars to determine the 
north direction, using a plumb line to determine when one passed directly 
above the other. It has been suggested that, with the right choice of stars, this 
method would explain the extraordinary accuracy with which the Khufu 
Pyramid at Giza was cardinally aligned. The continued use of the same stars 
over subsequent decades would then have resulted in lower accuracy for sub- 
sequent pharaohs. 

But there is a problem here. We can easily work out which two stars 
would give the best result because our modern instruments and computer 
programs tell us very accurately where true north actually is; people in the 
past did not, by definition, have such a yardstick. How could they have 
known which two stars were best? In fact, this was not an insoluble prob- 
lem for them: one possibility is that they marked the direction defined by a 
vertically aligned pair of stars, then observed the same pair of stars at a dif- 
ferent time of year and night when they were upside down (this would hap- 


pen twelve hours after the first observation but would not generally be ob- 


servable at that time because the sky would be light). The difference between 
the two directions would give an indication of the accuracy (in fact, the av- 
erage of the two directions would be true north). Of course, this is only a 
suggestion, and the actual method used remains speculative; the point is that 
we have step out of our own shoes in order to recognize that there is a ques- 
tion to be answered.

Mesoamerican Calendar Round 
Ancient Mesoamerica—the region stretching from central Mexico to El Sal- 
vador and northern Honduras, including Guatemala and Belize—had a tur- 
bulent history. One city-state after another rose to power and then col- 
lapsed, often relatively suddenly and for no obvious cause. From the Olmec, 
who inhabited the hot and humid lowlands of the Mexican Gulf Coast as 
early as 1200-400 B.c.E., to the Aztec, whose powerful and in many ways 
cruel empire centered on the Valley of Mexico in the central highlands was 
at its height at the time of Spanish contact, the archaeological record of the 
region bears witness to numerous and varied polities that rose and fell. 

Despite this backdrop of social turmoil, common aspects of Mesoamer- 
ican ceremonial centers (such as ball courts, the setting for a ritualistic ball 
game) bear witness to common practices and beliefs—in other words, a com- 
mon worldview. An essential and apparently unassailable aspect of this 
worldview was the calendar. Its basic structure was totally distinctive—it is 
unlike any other calendar system the world has seen—yet extraordinarily 
consistent, and persistent, through ancient Mesoamerica. It consisted of two 
interconnected cycles. The first, relatively unexceptional in itself, comprised 
an endlessly repeating cycle of 365 days divided into eighteen months of 
twenty days plus five additional days. 

It is the other cycle that is extraordinary and gives the Mesoamerican 


calendar its idiosyncratic character. Also endlessly repeating, it contained 


260 days, organized around thirteen numbers and twenty day names, but 
with each running continuously, like two interlocking cogwheels. Thus, for 
the Maya (for whom the twenty day names were Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chic- 
chan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Ca- 
ban, Etznab, Cauac, and Ahau), the day 1 Imix was followed by 2 Ik, 3 Ak- 
bal, etc., round to 13 Ben, but then followed 1 Ix, 2 Men, etc., round to 7 
Ahau, then 8 Imix, 9 Ik, etc. Every possible combination of number and day 
name would be covered, but in what seems to us a very improbable order, 
before the commencement of the next 260-day cycle. The names of the two 
cycles, as well as the month and day names within them, varied from one 
Mesoamerican culture to another, but the cycles themselves were quite in- 
variable. And they were themselves intermeshed, resulting in a Calendar 
Round that only returned to its starting point after slightly less than fifty-two 
years, in other words, exactly fifty-two rounds of the longer (365-day) cycle 
and seventy-three rounds of the shorter (260-day) one. 

In central Mexico the Calendar Round was known as the Xuihmolpilli, 
or “binding of the years.” The end of the cycle, when the years were bound, 
was a time of great fear. All fires were extinguished, houses were swept very 
clean and all rubbish removed. At an elaborate ceremony, commencing in 
the middle of the night (when the Pleiades crossed the meridian, according 
to one source), new fire was kindled in the heart of a sacrificed warrior, thus 
ensuring that the sun would reappear, at which point runners with torches 
would spread the new fire around the land. The great Templo Mayor in the 
center of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan was rebuilt six times, each reju- 
venation involving the addition of an entirely new layer over the existing 
temple, thereby increasing its size substantially. It has been suggested that 
these episodes of rebuilding might well have been undertaken in preparation 
for the start of a new Calendar Round, although there is no direct evidence 
to support the idea. It is more generally accepted that they were ordered by 
successive new rulers. 

The 260-day cycle was called the tzolkin in the Maya region and the 
tonalpobualli in central Mexico. Nobody knows its origins. While the 365- 
day cycle (haab for the Maya, xibuitl or xiubpohualli for the Aztecs) was 
clearly related to the solar year, the tzolkin has no obvious astronomical der- 
ivation, although several different theories have been proposed. One sugges- 
tion is that it arose from observations of the zenith passage of the sun around 
the latitude of fifteen degrees (that is, at around the latitude of the Classic 
Maya site of Copan), where the interval between the two dates of zenith pas- 
sage in a given year was, indeed, 260 days. However, the earliest inscriptions 
attesting to the 260-day calendar round, dating to the mid-first millennium 
B.C.E., come from much farther north, in the region of Oaxaca. We do know 


for certain that the 260-day cycle was of fundamental importance for div- 


inatory purposes. Each day had its omens, good or bad, and these were used 
to regulate a variety of sacred rituals as well as more general activities. The 
tzolkin is still used for prognostications among Quiché Maya peoples to this 
day. 

Ancient Mesoamericans were tremendously concerned with fitting to- 
gether cycles of nature—or to be more precise, cycles of the celestial bodies— 
into neatly repeating longer cycles. All the while, the 260-day cycle, itself ap- 
parently unrelated to any cycle directly visible in the skies, endured and 
formed part of this process. Some larger cycles fell out naturally, owing to 
(what we would see as) coincidences of nature. The most important of these 
is the fact that eight synodic cycles of Venus are very close to five solar years. 
The Mesoamericans knew the synodic period of Venus to be 584 days, and 
by this reckoning five Venus cycles are exactly equivalent to eight baab or xi- 
huitl years of 365 days. It follows that, since the number of 365-day years in 
two Calendar Rounds is divisible by eight, two Calendar Rounds must also 
be a whole number of Venus cycles: actually sixty-five of them. This coinci- 
dence of three cycles has been suggested as a reason that particular signifi- 
cance was attached to the end of every second Calendar Round. 

Another astronomical coincidence is that three times the mean eclipse 
danger period, close to 173.3 days, which would be necessary knowledge for 
anyone hoping to predict eclipses, is equal to two 260-day cycles, so that the 
main danger of eclipses would recur around (every other occurrence of) the 
same three dates in the 260-day cycle. Yet another coincidence is the fact that 
the synodic period of the planet Mars is equal to exactly three rounds of 260 
days. In the case of central Mexico, it is not always easy to pursue these 
ideas, since the threads of evidence are very indirect, but it is quite certain 
that the Maya took this process of cycle-matching to tremendous lengths: we 
know this from the Dresden Codex. 

A number of religious texts both from before and from shortly after the 
conquest contain cosmograms—tepresentations of the cosmos that can con- 
tain depictions of the gods, the four quarters of the world and their quali- 
ties, the path of the sun along the horizon, and the calendar, plus perceived 
interrelationships between them. A famous example in the Codex Féjérvary- 
Mayer, a pre-conquest document from central Mexico, contains a pattern of 
dots in the shape of a Maltese cross which represents the entire 260-day sa- 
cred round arranged in twenty groups of thirteen. In form, this resembles 
many of the pecked cross-circle designs found in and around a number of 
central Mexican sites. It is not surprising, then, that the numbers of small 
holes forming the basic elements of such designs seem to include, much more 
frequently than would be expected by chance, calendrically significant num- 
bers such as twenty, eighteen, thirteen, and five. 


Another way in which concepts of number, calendar, space, and time 


may have been tied together in ancient Mesoamerica is manifested in what 
has become known as calendrical orientation. Systematic studies of the ori- 
entations of buildings and city plans, both in central Mexico and in the 
Maya world, have revealed clear but curious patterns of orientation prefer- 
ence. (Many Maya cities, for example, have their street grids oriented a few 
degrees clockwise of the cardinal directions.) These preferences included 
sunrise and sunset on dates whose significance would have followed, as for 
many peoples worldwide, from directly observable extremes in the motions 
of the sun—the solstices and the days of zenith (and perhaps also anti-zenith) 
passage. However, there are also notable regional preferences for other days 
in the year. Some of these seem to indicate the existence of horizon calendars 
in which key dates were those counted off from the solstices in intervals such 
as twenty, fifty-two, sixty-five, and seventy-three days, numbers that also 
arise in the context of the Calendar Round. 

However, the apparent coexistence of the Calendar Round and horizon 
calendars raises an issue. Calendars based on the movement of the sun up 
and down the horizon are implicitly tied to the true solar year, whereas the 
365-day cycle of the Calendar Round that became established all over 
Mesoamerica would have slipped against this by one day in every four years, 
and the discrepancy would have become evident over time. Since our knowl- 
edge of the Calendar Round comes from documentary and _ historical 
sources, while the evidence for horizon calendars relies more on the statistics 
of alignments, it is not easy to resolve this issue. One possibility that has 
been suggested is that the horizon calendars were older developments, pre- 
cursors of the Calendar Round. Another is that the formal, ceremonial 365- 
day calendar and the pragmatic horizon-based one existed in parallel, rather 
like what is thought (by most scholars) to have occurred with the civil and 
lunar calendars in ancient Egypt. 

In most respects, the Mesoamerican calendar reflected the cycles of na- 
ture—particularly observable astronomical cycles—directly. The only appar- 
ent exception to this was the 260-cycle tzolkin or tonalpobualli: if this ever 
did have such a basis, it became lost in the mists of time. Yet this sacred cy- 
cle, with its complex set of associated prognostications, lay at the very heart 
of Mesoamerican worldview and calendrics.

Mesoamerican Cross-Circle Designs 
Cross-circle designs, often referred to as pecked cross-circles, are found at 
several sites in the highlands of central Mexico and also as far south as the 
Maya city of Uaxactiin, typically pecked into the stuccoed floors of build- 
ings or carved as petroglyphs in rocks in the hills around cities. The great- 
est preponderance is in and around Teotihuacan, where over fifty are 
known. They generally consist of one, two, or three concentric circles in- 
tersecting four radial lines in the shape of a cross, though there are numer- 
ous variants on this design, including squares and Maltese crosses. They are 
typically around one meter (three feet) across, and made up of cuplike de- 
pressions about one centimeter (half an inch) in diameter. They have at- 
tracted a good deal of attention from archaeoastronomers, since they may 
have reflected aspects of astronomy and the calendar in three distinct ways. 
The first way is in their numerology. Counts of the number of dots 
forming elements of cross-circle designs, such as on radial spokes between 
points where they cross the circles or on circle sectors between points where 
they cross radial spokes, reveal a preponderance of the numbers five, thir- 
teen, eighteen, and twenty, which are significant as elements of the 
Mesoamerican calendar. Enough of them have a total count of 260 (the 
number of days in the sacred 260-day calendrical cycle) to suggest that this 
might have been significant too. They may have been symbolic representa- 
tions of the calendar in some sense, an idea that seems less strange when we 
compare them with cosmograms found in some of the central Mexican 
codices. Yet ethnohistoric accounts also refer to the use of such designs, 
made up of cavities pecked into the floors of buildings, for a game called pa- 
tolli, which involved moving pebbles around in the holes. Why should a 
gameboard have reflected the calendar? Perhaps because, in Aztec times at 
least, it had religious overtones. 


The second way the cross-circle designs may have reflected aspects of 


One of several cross-circle designs discovered in the 1980s adjacent to the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotibuacan, Mex- 
ico. One corner has been re-pecked to avoid a hole in the stucco floor, suggesting that the actual shape was less im- 
portant than the number of holes. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


astronomy and the calendar is in their orientation. Systematic studies suggest 
that the spokes of those found as geoglyphs on natural rocks tend (more of- 
ten than would be expected by chance) to be oriented roughly in the solsti- 
tial directions. This would not be surprising if they were indeed cosmologi- 
cal symbols, reflecting the four corners of the perceived cosmos. 

Finally, those carved on rock outcrops tend to be in hilly locations with 
clear views of distant horizons, particularly toward the east, once again sug- 
gesting a connection between landscape, calendar, and cosmos. Could some 
of them have marked observing points? Or, as has been suggested, were they 
used as surveyor’s benchmarks? In the 1970s it was proposed that three of 
the cross-circles at Teotihuacan—one pecked into the floor of a building by 
the Street of the Dead and two carved into rocks on adjacent hills—defined 
two baselines that were used by surveyors in laying out the street grid. This 
idea was criticized on statistical grounds, because it depended upon the ar- 
bitrary selection of three cross-circles from fourteen then known at Teoti- 
huacan (the total is now over fifty), and on archaeological grounds, because 
the central cross-circle, used in both baselines, was pecked into the floor of 
a building dating to a late phase, long after the street grid was set out. The 


statistical argument was criticized in its turn because of the established fact 


that cross-circles had different purposes. But we cannot use this as an excuse 
for simply selecting the data that fit a given hypotheses and ignoring the rest. 
The archaeological evidence seems to clinch the issue unless one appeals to 
the possibility (unproven) that the central pecked cross may have been cited 
on the position of an older one. 

Be this as it may, it is quite clear that cross-circle designs had several 
different functions and meanings. One view is that they represent the prop- 
agation of a symbol whose form remained essentially unaltered but came to 
be used for different purposes. An alternative is that many if not all of these 
purposes were interrelated. It may seem strange to us to tie concepts of space 
and time together in such contorted ways, but the unfamiliar manner in 
which patterns of thought operate within other worldviews means we would 
certainly be wrong to close our minds altogether to such possibilities.

Methodology 

Methodology concerns how we go about obtaining data and using those 
data to assess our theories. Whether we are considering archaeological evi- 
dence such as monumental alignments, or other forms of evidence relevant 
in archaeoastronomy such as ethnohistoric accounts, written documents, or 
a combination of these, we need agreed-upon procedures that give us con- 
fidence that we can reach the best, most reasonable, most reliable, and most 
sustainable conclusions on the basis of the evidence available. An accepted 
methodology is vital in any academic discipline, and it will constantly be 


under review: people will constantly strive to improve it. 


One of the most fundamental methodological necessities is to be fair 
with the evidence. As a statistician involved in the debates about Alexander 
Thom’s theories concerning the British megaliths once decreed: “Observe all 
there is and report all you observe.” In practice it is seldom feasible to ob- 
serve all there is, so fair ways of selecting (sampling) data become vital. “Fair 
selection of data” means doing so in a way that will not bias the eventual 
conclusion. In other words, it is vital that researchers not just consider and 
present the evidence that favors a favorite theory while ignoring or hiding 
the rest by accident or by design. This would occur if, in our enthusiasm to 
find data that fit a favored theory—for example, that ancient stone rows 
were aligned upon sunrise or sunset on particular days in the year—we kept 
searching until we found suitable candidates while ignoring many others that 
did not fit. Unless this principle is followed, no amount of complex statisti- 
cal analysis will have any value whatsoever. 

Nowhere are the dangers more evident than in popular claims that con- 
structions on the ground, such as temples and pyramids, were laid out in the 
form of celestial constellations. A famous example is the suggestion that var- 
ious temples at the ancient site of Angkor in Cambodia were laid out in the 
formation of the bright stars in the constellation Draco. If there are no firm 
criteria for selecting the buildings to be considered, then, given the large 
number of stars in the sky to select from, one can obtain surprisingly good 
fits totally fortuitously. One BBC television documentary, experimenting 
with this concept, managed to obtain a remarkably good fit between the lay- 
out of selected large buildings in New York City and the stars in Leo. 

Each of the various different types of evidence about ancient astronomy 
presents its own methodological challenges. For instance, impressive light- 
and-shadow effects, occurring only when the sun or moon reach a particular 
configuration, are well known. Famous examples include the equinox hiero- 
phany at the pyramid of Kukulcan at Chichen Itza in Mexico, the sun dagger 
at Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, and the passage tomb at Newgrange in Ire- 
land. Each of these, on the face of it, may have been intentional but might be 
the result of chance. As the American archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni 
once said, “In the American southwest, the search for solar alignments [has 
been] conducted with a fervent passion not exceeded anywhere in the world. 
Many a weekend was spent by individuals in hot pursuit of daggers of light 
entering cracks and openings in caves and buildings—especially light patterns 
that crept across petroglyphs” (Ruggles 2002, p. 444). We have to devise 
ways of assessing the likelihood that an effect we observe might actually have 
been intentional. Where we have only the archaeological evidence to go on, 
this must inevitably involve some sort of statistical analysis. 

In alignment studies there is a similar problem, stemming from the sim- 


ple fact that every oriented building or structure must point somewhere, and 


there can be many different reasons for choosing a particular orientation. 
Often an ancient monument contains not just one obvious axis but many 
different alignments of buildings, stones, or other structures, and to pick 
and choose between them on the basis of a favored theory will lead to com- 
pletely misleading conclusions. There are also many different horizon tar- 
gets—many potential rising and setting points of celestial bodies that we 
might deem significant if we find alignments upon them. Added to this is a 
further problem, that the rising and setting positions of stars change over 
the centuries, owing to precession, and those of the sun, moon, and planets 
to a lesser extent, owing to the changing obliquity of the ecliptic. If, as is 
most often the case, we cannot date a structure at all accurately by archae- 
ological means, then if we simply choose the best fit date, the possibilities 
are almost endless. If we allowed ourselves the fifteen brightest stars, for in- 
stance, and a range of five hundred years, we could fit a suitable star and 
date for one-third of all oriented structures. Clearly we have to be far more 
careful and critical. 

What, then, can we do to reach a reasonable degree of confidence that 
any alignment, light-and-shadow phenomenon, or similar association that 
we spot in the archaeological record was actually intentional and meaning- 
ful? One possibility is to look for repeated occurrences. This approach has 
demonstrated the solar and, in some cases, lunar significance of many local 
groups of monuments in Britain and Europe, a classic example being the 
Scottish recumbent stone circles. On the other hand, repeated occurrences 
can only reveal prevailing practices that were widely and consistently ad- 
hered to. Another approach is to seek independent evidence that a particu- 
lar alignment was deliberate. Archaeological excavations can sometimes re- 
veal this, as has been the case at Balnuaran of Clava, near Inverness, 
Scotland. Here, it seems that the structural stability of a passage tomb was 
compromised in order to incorporate the correct astronomical alignment. 

A fundamental methodological issue arises from the fact that people’s 
behavior is not governed by unbending principles comparable to the physi- 
cal laws that govern the universe. Even where the strictest doctrines dictated 
correct practice regarding, say, the construction of a Neolithic tomb, it is 
likely that some people “did their own thing.” Treating archaeological data 
too much like data from physics, subjecting it to “scientific” testing, will not 
explain the actions of individuals in particular places and times, according 
to particular sets of circumstances. The stone circle at Drombeg in Ireland is 
a single solstitially oriented stone circle among a group of around fifty. Con- 
sidering the group as a whole, one would be extremely inclined to put the 
solstitial alignment of Drombeg down to chance. However, it is certainly 
possible that the builders of this monument did have reasons for the align- 


ment and that it was, in fact, deliberate. The crucial point is that one cannot 


use this argument to simply assume that the Drombeg alignment was delib- 
erate; to do so would be to fall into the trap that we identified at the start, 
namely to choose the data that fits a favored theory (the solstitial alignment 
at Drombeg) while ignoring the rest (the alignments of the other forty-nine 
circles). Independent corroborating evidence, such as that obtained at Bal- 
nuaran of Clava, is needed. 

Problems of data selection are not confined to archaeological evidence. 
Ethnographers may have the problem of distinguishing between informants’ 
accounts that genuinely relate to practices that have been endemic for many 
generations and more recent inventions or intrusions. The situation is also 
different where we need to reconcile archaeological with historical and other 
forms of evidence such as iconography and written inscriptions. Thus a 
Venus alignment at the so-called Governor’s Palace at the Maya city of Ux- 
mal is a one-off that would not be given credence if we did not have a secure 
date for the alignment, extensive evidence for the importance of Venus in 
contemporary Maya culture, and many Venus glyphs on the building itself. 

Another problem is that some alignments occur naturally, purely by 
chance, but may well have been afforded significance in the past. A good ex- 
ample is the Hawaiian island chain, which is quite closely aligned with June 
solstice sunset and December solstice sunrise. From an indigenous perspec- 
tive, such alignments, once noticed, can seem very impressive, since they ap- 
pear to demonstrate the integrity and harmony of the cosmos and the inter- 
connectedness of land and sky. However, this possibility can present a 
headache for the modern archaeoastronomer seeking to prove that a partic- 
ular astronomical meaning was attached to a natural alignment in ancient 
times, especially in the absence of corroborating evidence from history or 
ethnography. A great many alignments with plausible astronomical connec- 
tions may well occur naturally in the landscape, and we have no knowledge 
as to which ones were actually “observed.” Once again, we cannot use our 
own predilections to prejudge the issue. 

In short, it is crucial not to try to fit a favorite theory to some evidence. 
We must select the data fairly and consider the possible alternative explana- 
tions. Unless we do this, we risk misleading not only everyone else but also 
ourselves. How best, in practice, to assess competing interpretations of the 
evidence at hand raises a series of questions. There is no simple answer to 
many of them.We must always keep an open mind and always be open both 
to new ideas and to new data.

Mid-Quarter Days 


The solstices and equinoxes divide the year into four almost equal parts. If 
one further divides each of these parts into two, the additional dates are 
what are known variously as the mid-quarter or cross-quarter days, or 
sometimes as the Scottish quarter days, since in Scotland, as opposed to 
England, they—and not the solstices and equinoxes—were used as the ba- 
sis of the legal division of the year into four. The dates are February 4, May 
6, August 6, and November 5. 

A number of later prehistoric monuments in Britain and Ireland are 
aligned upon sunrise or sunset close to one of the mid-quarter days, although 
whether these alignments were intended and hence reflect a widespread cal- 
endrical practice is a matter of considerable doubt. Perhaps the earliest ex- 
ample is a U-shaped setting of large timber posts constructed in the Earlier 
Neolithic (fifth century B.c.E.) at Godmanchester in Cambridgeshire, Eng- 
land, which was aligned upon sunrise in early May and early August. Oth- 
ers include the longer passage at the Neolithic passage tomb of Dowth, 
County Meath, Ireland (one of three large tombs in the Boyne valley), which 
is aligned upon sunset in early November and early February. 

Four of the eight festivals traditionally associated with the Celtic calen- 
dar were also associated with mid-quarter days, namely Imbolc (early Febru- 
ary), Beltaine (early May), Lughnasa (early August), and Samhain (early No- 
vember), and these same dates found their way into pagan and Christianized 
calendrical festivals, most notably the feast of All Saints on November 1.

Minoan Temples and Tombs 

The Minoan civilization flourished in the Mediterranean island of Crete 
during the mid-second millennium B.c.£. and influenced later developments 
in the Aegean in various ways. It has been suggested, for example, that ori- 
entation practices in early and Classical Greece may derive in part from this 
more ancient culture. The rich Bronze Age heritage of Minoan Crete in- 
cludes palaces, villas, and several peak sanctuaries—cult centers where ar- 
chaeologists have uncovered thousands of clay figurines, apparently votive 
offerings left by pilgrims. Various solar and stellar alignments noted at peak 
sanctuaries such as Pyrgos and Petsophas hint at an intimate relationship 
between these temples and observations of the skies, as well as to the pos- 
sible use of prominent horizon foresights. 

Similar relationships may also have extended to tombs. At Armenoi, a 
huge Minoan cemetery on the western part of the island, are well over two 
hundred carefully constructed tombs consistently oriented eastwards within 
an arc that is best explained as relating to moonrise. Prominent on the sky- 
line in this direction is Mount Vrysinas, a mountain that may well have had 
strong cultic associations with the moon, since a peak sanctuary located on 
its summit seems to have been dedicated to a moon goddess.

Misminay 

Misminay is a small village in the Peruvian Andes, geographically quite 
close to well-trodden tourist destinations, since it is situated almost midway 
between the city of Cusco and the famous ruins at Machu Picchu. It is, 
however, off the main tourist routes and thus relatively remote and difficult 
of access. In many ways it is unexceptional; what is unusual is that the as- 
tronomical knowledge and practices of the villagers are known in some de- 
tail, owing to the particular interest taken by anthropologist and ethnoas- 
tronomer Gary Urton in the 1970s. 

The villagers recognize various objects in the sky and use several dif- 
ferent types of astronomical observation to regulate their seasonal agricul- 
tural activities. One is to observe the annual cycles of appearance (heliacal 
rise) and disappearance (heliacal set) of different stars and asterisms. For ex- 
ample, there are two “celestial storehouses,” the Pleiades and the five stars 
at the tail or hook of Scorpius. These are almost opposite in the sky, so one 
or the other is generally visible at any time in the night. In fact, the most sig- 
nificant event in the cycle, the heliacal rise of the Pleiades in June, does not 
directly signal the time to begin planting but instead heralds observations 
where prognostications are made about the year’s crop yield on the basis of 
the perceived brightness of the stars. The times for planting and harvesting 
maize and potatoes are determined by another method: by looking at the 
changing rising position of the sun on the eastern horizon, and in particular, 
noting when it passes a given spot going in one or the other direction. The 
lunar phases are also said by some to be important in determining the best 
times for planting. In sum, the calendar is not regulated by simple observa- 
tions of one type, but by a mix of observations of the heliacal risings and set- 
tings of stars, the changing rising position of the sun along the horizon, and 
(to some extent) the phases of the moon. 

But there is a good deal more to Misminay astronomy than the agri- 
cultural calendar. The villagers’ conception of the sky forms part of a world- 
view that affects many aspects of life, including the very layout of the village. 
Central to this worldview is the Milky Way, which at the latitude of Mismi- 
nay (14°S) has a very distinctive cycle of motions about the heavens during 
each twenty-four-hour period. For several hours it appears to hang in the 
sky, arcing over from roughly the northeast to the southwest, dividing the 


sky into two parts. Then, relatively suddenly, it starts to tumble toward the 


horizon, falling and tipping until it seems to surround the observer, just 
above the horizon. Equally suddenly, it starts to rise again, climbing up un- 
til it partitions the heavens in the orthogonal direction, from the northwest 
to the southeast. The sequence is then repeated in reverse. This pattern of 
motions only occurs at around this latitude and is difficult to visualize with- 
out the aid of a planetarium; but when seen it is extremely impressive. Only 
half of this diurnal cycle can be seen at any particular time of the year, since 
the other half occurs during daylight hours. This means that, for example, 
when the sky first gets dark during the rainy season at Misminay, from No- 
vember to February, the Milky Way is seen arcing over from the northwest 
to the southeast; whereas during the dry season, May to August, it divides 
the sky the other way. For people living at this latitude and watching the 
skies through the year, these patterns of motion soon become apparent. A 
natural reaction is to conflate the two axes in one’s mind and to perceive 
them as a cross, dividing the celestial dome into four quarters. This is pre- 
cisely what the inhabitants of Misminay do, and this perception is reflected 
on the ground in a very direct way. 

The central gathering place in the village is a chapel, standing at a 
crossroads from which four paths head off in the intercardinal directions. 
Apart from anything else, this alignment reflects a widespread tendency to 
organize space around lines radiating out from a central place, a tendency 
that stretches back to Inca and even pre-Inca times. The paths also mark out 
social divisions, again reflecting broader practices long established in the re- 
gion. But the specifics of the layout of Misminay also bear important rela- 
tionships to the sky. The center of the village is the crossing point of two ir- 
rigation canals. Their directions, as well as those of the paths they follow, 
reflect the two axes of the Milky Way in the sky. Terrestrial water flows 
downhill, southward to northward, and the Milky Way is seen as a celestial 
river that carries water back in the opposite direction, southward and up 
into the sky, from which it falls as rain. By this means, the village is appro- 
priately placed within an integrated system that serves to circulate water 
through the cosmos as a whole, and by so doing ensures the continued suc- 
cess of the crops and the survival of the community. 

In fact, these are just some of the principal elements of a much more 
complex conceptual scheme that links together, both in time and space, the 
layout of things on the ground with different objects and events in the sky. 
The directions of the four paths also correspond quite closely to the rising 
and setting positions of the sun at the solstices. The June solstice, when the 
sun rises in the northeast, corresponds to the time of year when the Milky 
Way appears after sunset oriented in this direction. The same is true with re- 
gard to the southeast and the December solstice. Then again, the rising di- 


rection of the Pleiades, and the opposite setting direction of the tail of Scor- 


pius, also coincide quite closely with the directions of the paths, the Milky 
Way, and the solstitial directions. The heliacal rise of the Pleiades coincides 
with the time when the sun rises in the same direction at the June solstice. In 
short, the quartering of the earth by the cross-shaped paths and ditches re- 
flects many significant aspects of the quartering of the sky. (The quarters are 
actually far from equal in size—the solstitial azimuths at Misminay are 
roughly 63 degrees, 117 degrees, 243 degrees and 297 degrees—but this is a 
detail that has no significance to the villagers.) The chapel at the center of 
the village is appropriately named: its name is Crucero (cross). 

Another interesting aspect of the Misminay villagers’ conception of the 
sky is the “dark cloud constellations.” They perceive the shapes of dark 
patches in the Milky Way to be creatures such as a llama, toad, fox, and 
snake. The part of the Milky Way that appears in southern skies is especially 
bright and impressive, and it is scarcely surprising to see these dark shapes, 
hugely imposing against the foreground of bright stars, singled out as signif- 
icant in southern hemisphere cosmologies. The celestial llama is one of the 
largest and most imposing shapes of all, and broadly corresponds to what is 
seen as an emu across Aboriginal Australia. It also reminds us that the prac- 
tice of imagining stars as bright points on invisible objects and creatures, 
which underlies the Western concept of constellations, is not the only way of 
perceiving entities in the sky. 

Finally, according to the villagers at Misminay, there is a correspon- 
dence between the gradual rise of the celestial llama in the sky each morning 
and the breeding period of terrestrial llamas. This is one of many examples 
from around the world of people perceiving a direct correspondence between 
linked events on the earth and in the sky, another being the Barasana “Cater- 
pillar Jaguar” constellation.

Mithraism 


The Mithraic religion was one of the most powerful sun cults in human his- 
tory. It took shape in Persia around the time of the conquests of Alexander 
the Great in the fourth century B.c.E., spread into Babylonia and Hellenis- 
tic Greece, and subsequently into ancient Rome in the second century C.E. 


All this time it was developing and changing as it came into contact with 


other religions and new influences. Mithra, a solar deity, became identified 
in Babylonia with the Babylonians’ own ancient sun god, Shamash; in 
Greece with Helios, the sun, and the god Apollo; and in the Roman empire 
with Sol Invictus, the unconquered, or unconquerable, sun. 

In the Roman world, Mithraism had only modest support at first, as 
one of a number of “mystery” cults from the east. In the second century C.E., 
however, it became popular among soldiers and spread rapidly with the le- 
gions to the far corners of the empire. Numerous temples, monuments, and 
inscriptions are found from Asia Minor in the east to Britain in the west. 
Mithraic temples are characterized by altars containing a scene depicting 
Mithras ritually sacrificing a bull. From this primordial act, according to the 
Mithraic belief, sprang life on earth. 

By the late second century, Mithraism had attracted the support not 
only of a range of government officials but even of the emperor himself. 
Commodus, emperor from C.E. 180 to 192, was initiated into the sect, and 
a frieze at Ephesus shows the sun taking his father, Marcus Aurelius, up to 
heaven in a chariot escorted by the moon and stars. Commodus was the first 
of a succession of Roman emperors for whom popular worship of the sun as 
the supreme body in the heavens affirmed their own earthly powers. (An in- 
teresting comparison can be made here with the role of sun worship in Inca 
society.) Caracalla, emperor from C.E. 212 to 217, seems to have portrayed 
himself as the son of the sun god; and the mother of Aurelian (c.E. 270-275) 
was believed, at least by some, to be a priestess of the sun. The culmination 
came in C.E. 274, when, under Aurelian, the cult of Sol Invictus became the 
official state religion of the empire. 

Following Constantine’s conversion to Christianity early in the fourth 
century, Christianity began its inexorable rise and pagan alternatives de- 
clined. Mithraism certainly presented the most serious pagan challenge to 
early Christianity, and the bitter rivalries that ensued were sometimes over- 
come by a process of acculturation—subsuming pagan rituals within Chris- 
tian ones. This process is most obvious in its lasting effect on the Christian 
calendar. It is no coincidence, for example, that the date of Christ’s nativity 
was fixed as December 25, the date the Romans believed to be the winter 
solstice, and which had been established by Aurelian in c.E. 274 as the feast 
of the birth of the unconquered sun (Natalis Solis Invicti). Neither is it any 
coincidence that the Christian holy day is named Sunday. 

The conflict between early Christianity and astral religions such as 
Mithraism also hardened Christian attitudes toward astrology.

Monuments and Cosmology 

The architecture of public monuments, great and small, can give the ar- 
chaeologist important clues about the worldviews of those who built them. 
One reason is that their designs may reflect the perceived cosmos, revealing 
associations that existed in the minds of the builders, just as the solar align- 
ment at the passage tomb of Newgrange in Ireland reveals a perceived con- 
nection between the sun and the ancestors. Monumental architecture may 
also reflect a ritually defined order of things that was relatively widespread 
and relatively stable, even where the nature of the society at the time was 
constantly changing in other ways. It is easy to see how existing monuments 
may have helped reinforce the perceived order of things, since they created 
an indelible mark on the landscape that was bound to have influenced fu- 
ture worldviews—if this is how the ancestors did things, people would 
surely have thought, then this is how we must do things too. Conversely, 
fundamental changes in ideology may indicate major social disruption. 

This inherent stability of the perceived world order means that associ- 
ations of ideological and cosmological significance have a greater chance of 
leaving their mark on the material record, and thus have a greater chance of 
being detectable by modern archaeologists, than many other, more volatile 
aspects of a past society. The reason is that we can expect them to be re- 
peated over and over again. A single association, such as the solstitial align- 
ment at Newgrange, may have meant nothing at all to the builders; it may 
have arisen entirely fortuitously. But if we see other, similar solstitial align- 
ments repeated again and again, then the likelihood that they could have 
arisen fortuitously is rapidly diminished. Where we find significant numbers 
of monuments with similar designs, similar orientation, and even consistent 
patterns of astronomical alignment, we can be confident that common prac- 
tices prevailed over a considerable area and time. 

Throughout Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe we find discernible tra- 
ditions of monument construction operating at various levels and scales. 
Some of these are remarkably widespread in space and time. In Britain, Ire- 
land, and Brittany, for example, a propensity to build circular and linear cer- 


emonial monuments resulted in the construction of many hundreds of stone 


circles and stone rows over as long as two millennia. Patterns of orientation 
tend to be more localized, and patterns of astronomical orientation more so 
still. For example, among the recumbent stone circles, a group of stone cir- 
cles of a particular form found in northeastern Scotland, and among the 
short stone rows of southwestern Ireland, there appear to be more specific 
traditions of orientation upon prominent features in the landscape or rising 


or setting positions of the sun or moon than in the larger area.

Moon, Motions of 

Just as the rising and setting positions of the sun move north and south along 
the eastern and western horizons over an annual cycle, those of the moon do 
the same over the course of a month. This means that, unlike the sun, the 
day-to-day change in the rising or setting position of the moon is consider- 
able, since the passage from one “lunistice” to the other is completed in a pe- 
riod of just two weeks. Observing these lunar changes is not an easy matter, 
even from a place with perfect weather, because of the lunar phase cycle. The 
moon rises and sets approximately an hour later each day, meaning that over 
the course of the month, the aspiring observer will have to rise at all hours 
of the night. Furthermore, for half of the month the moon will be rising (or 
setting) in daylight, rendering the event almost certainly invisible. 

The length of time it takes for the moon to complete a whole cycle from 
north to south and back again, known technically as the tropical month, is 
significantly shorter than the synodic (phase-cycle) month: 27.3 days as op- 
posed to 29.5. This means that the phase cycle and the cycle to and fro along 
the horizon get significantly out of step. However, a pattern emerges over the 
course of a complete year. At the time of the June solstice, the moon is full 
when it is farthest south, and new when it is farthest north. At the time of 
the December solstice, on the other hand, the opposite is the case. This 
means that in the northern hemisphere, the midsummer full moon—or more 


precisely the full moon nearest to the summer solstice, which can occur up 


to two weeks before or after the solstice itself—will rise and set at, or very 
close to, the southern limit of its monthly motions. Conversely, the midwin- 
ter full moon will be at or close to the northern limit. Since the full moon is 
the most prominent phase, and also the phase at which the moon lights up 
the entire night, it may well be that it was the annual motions of the full 
moon northward and southward, rather than the monthly cycle to and fro, 
that was most important to many human cultures in the past. 

From what has been said so far, the northward and southward swing 
of the rising or setting moon along the horizon would seem to be similar to 
that of the sun, but on a shorter time scale. However, there is another crit- 
ical complication. The directions of sunrise and sunset at the solstices are 
effectively constant from year to year and only change very slowly over the 
centuries, owing to the gradual change in the obliquity of the ecliptic. The 
directions of moonrise and moonset at the monthly “lunistices,” in con- 
trast, vary noticeably from year to year. They themselves swing back and 
forth over a cycle lasting 18.6 years, which is known as the lunar node cy- 
cle. At one point in this cycle, the monthly swing of the moon from north 
to south is at its maximum and considerably wider than the annual swing 
of the sun. At such times, the most northerly monthly rising or setting path 
of the moon will reach beyond the most northerly annual rising or setting 
path of the sun by more than five degrees, or ten solar or lunar diameters; 
the most southerly path will do the same in the other direction. Some nine 
years later, in contrast, the monthly swing of the moon will be at its mini- 
mum, falling short of the annual swing of the sun at both ends by a similar 
amount. Alexander Thom coined the terms major standstill and minor 
standstill, respectively, to signify these times. Although the terms have been 
criticized as misleading, since nothing ever physically stands still, they are 
convenient and have become quite commonly used. 

Again, it is likely to have been the changes in the position of the full 
moon that stood out most clearly to many human communities in the past. 
If they noticed the lunar node cycle at all, it may have been because of the 
changing path through the sky of the midwinter or midsummer full moon, 
rising and setting unusually far north or south for only one or two short pe- 
riods during a lifetime. The effect would be most striking at latitudes of 
about sixty degrees, which is reached in the northern hemisphere, for ex- 
ample, in northern parts of Scotland. Here, in years close to a major stand- 
still, the midsummer full moon would appear only briefly in the south, pass- 
ing very low over the southern horizon, where its proximity to terrestrial 


landmarks would make it appear larger and closer.

Mursi Calendar 


The Mursi live in the northern part of the basin of the river Omo in south- 
west Ethiopia. They depend for their subsistence upon both cattle and cul- 
tivation, mainly of sorghum but including some maize and cowpeas. Their 
subsistence activities span two ecological zones: the Omo and its flanking 
belt of bushland thicket, which is suitable for cultivation following annual 
floods, and the higher, wooded grassland, where the cattle can be herded 
safe from infestations of tsetse fly. The two most significant seasonal events 
in Mursi country are the onset of the “big rains” in March or April, when 
the entire Mursi population comes together at the border of the two zones 
and rain cultivation is possible, and the flooding of the Omo six months 
later, when some of the population, mainly women and girls, move to the 
Omo and plant a flood cultivation along its banks, while the remainder, 
mainly men and boys, move in the opposite direction to cattle camps where 
they remain during the driest part of the year. 

If one were trying to piece together an account of Mursi calendrical 
practice from informants’ accounts, the first step in the process would be 
easy. The Mursi have a seasonal calendar based upon the phase cycles of the 
moon, and every member of the group, including children, can recount the 
seasonal events associated with each month. Thus, for example, one would 
learn immediately that in month eight the “big rains” fall. One would begin 
to encounter difficulties, however, in trying to match up the Mursi months 
with the seasonal year. There are between twelve and thirteen synodic (lunar- 
phase-cycle) months in the seasonal year, as we know. This means that in or- 
der to keep a lunar calendar in step with the seasons, some years must con- 
tain twelve months while others have thirteen. And yet, each Mursi year 
contains twelve numbered months together with a thirteenth, which has a 
name: gamwe. Mursi informants insist that no month is ever missed. 

Only by living with the Mursi for a period of time could one discover 
the solution to this problem. It would then become clear that, in practice, 
no Mursi is ever quite sure what the current month is. This is despite the 
fact that everyone is confident that there are experts who are. In actuality, 
the regulation of the calendar is a matter of public consensus. When certain 
seasonal events occur, their effect is to sway the balance of opinion. Even 
major seasonal events such as the coming of the big rains do not serve to 


fix the calendar, as might be expected from the rule of thumb that everyone 


recounts: this is because everyone acknowledges that seasonal events can 
sometimes occur early or late. To an outsider, the Mursi calendar seems 
haphazard and imprecise; yet for the Mursi it is self-consistent and works 
perfectly well. 

Among the Mursi are people who have a particular interest in watch- 
ing the sun rising behind the mountains on the eastern horizon. They recog- 
nize the sun’s two “houses” in which it rises for a period of time at the ex- 
tremes of its sojourn along the horizon, around the time of the solstices. A 
visitor might be told, for example, that the sun enters its southern house in 
the first half of month five and leaves it again in the first half of month six. 
A future archaeologist, on discovering evidence of the existence of such ob- 
servations, might well conclude that the Mursi had developed a horizon- 
based solar calendar. However, as we know, the sun cannot, for example, al- 
ways enter its house in the first half of a month, since the lunar phases fall 
differently in each solar year. When pressed on the issue, the Mursi special- 
ists admit that the sun can sometimes be early or late in its movements along 
the horizon. The behavior of the sun, in other words, is viewed as no more 
reliable a seasonal indicator than that of animals, plants, and the weather. 
The lunar calendar remains intact. 

Despite the haphazard nature (to an outsider) of the Mursi calendar, it 
works well enough for nearly all of the year. There is, however, one event 
that must be timed critically. This is the time of migration to the banks of the 
Omo. The river floods its banks several times, and the crop of cowpeas must 
be planted within a few days of the final flood; otherwise, if planted too late, 
the seeds will be too dry to germinate or, if planted too early, they will be 
washed away by the subsequent flood. How do people know the right time 
to move away from their bushland clearings down to the river? The answer 
is: by observing the successive disappearance of four stars in the evening twi- 
light. The stars in question are the middle two stars of the Southern Cross (6 
and B Crucis) and the Pointers (B and o Centauri), which are more or less in 
a straight line falling vertically to the horizon at the latitude (close to the 
equator) where the Mursi live. 

The successive disappearance (heliacal setting) of the four stars coin- 
cides with the time of year of the Omo floods, which are very regular. When 
imai (6 Crucis) ceases to appear in the evening sky at dusk (around the end 
of August), it is said that the Omo rises high enough to flatten the imai grass 
that grows along its banks, and then subsides. This is followed a week or 
two later by the disappearance of thaadoi (B Crucis) when the Omo rises 
and falls but does not yet reach its full height. By the time that waar (B Cen- 
tauri) disappears, the Omo (for which the Mursi name is waar) has risen to 
its full height and has flooded the levee forest along its banks. Finally, as 


sholbi (a Centauri) disappears from view (around the beginning of Octo- 


ber), the flood waters finally recede, carrying away the fallen petals of the 
sholbi (acacia) tree. Planting can now proceed down to the water’s edge. 

To us it might seem that the successive disappearance of these four stars 
simply provides a practical rule of thumb that helps to determine when the 
move to the river bank should take place. But the use of common terms for 
stars and terrestrial objects indicates deeper associations in the minds of the 
Mursi, direct connections that tell us something of their worldview. For 
them, the behavior of the Omo is understood in relation to other factors in 
the natural world, both terrestrial and celestial. It is this knowledge of the 
world that is being applied in order to determine when to move down to the 
banks of the Omo and begin planting. 

The Mursi example serves to undermine virtually every generalization 
we might try to make about calendrical development. If people have a basic 
lunar calendar, so the argument goes, in which they count off months ac- 
cording to the changing phases of the moon, then they must inevitably no- 
tice that it soon gets out of step with the seasons. Whether their annual cy- 
cle consists of twelve or thirteen months, they will find themselves adding or 
subtracting intercalary months to keep the lunar calendar in phase with the 
seasons, at first on an ad hoc basis, and then, if they progress beyond this 
point, more systematically. The Mursi example shows how a basic lunar cal- 
endar, without intercalation, can work perfectly well through the mechanism 
of institutionalized disagreement. Another common assumption is that if 
people observe the changing position of sunrise or sunset on the horizon, 
then they have reached a stage of development at which they recognize that 
it is the sun, rather than the moon, that is actually tied to the seasons, and 
they are likely to shift to a horizon-based solar calendar. Again, the Mursi 
example repudiates this notion completely. 

Finally, the direct observation of the four stars to determine the cor- 
rect time of arrival at the river might also be seen as a developmental step. 
It would be easy to conclude that, while the Mursi are haphazard the rest 
of the time, in this instance, when it really matters, they are capable of be- 
ing precise. This would be a misleading conclusion. As far as the Mursi are 
concerned, there is a direct connection between the successive disappear- 
ance of each star in the evening twilight and the corresponding terrestrial 
events. To say that the Mursi are precise when they need to be is missing 
the point. It is more correct to say that their understanding of how the 
world works is completely different from ours, and yet it is both self-con- 
sistent and has a predictive capability. It is the application of this knowledge 
that successfully prevents the loss of the crop that provides their main food 
source for half of the year. 

In short, as the Mursi example shows, it is misguided to attempt to 


measure the sophistication of an indigenous calendar against any sort of de- 


velopmental yardstick. Instead, we need to try to understand such calendars 
in the context of a framework of indigenous knowledge. By doing so, we bet- 
ter appreciate that knowledge for what it is, and for what it can add to our 
appreciation of the richness and diversity of indigenous knowledge in general. 
On the last point, a comparison of the Mursi with the nearby Borana, who 
have a much more precise but highly unusual luni-stellar calendar, demon- 
strates very clearly how two communities in similar circumstances, with sim- 


ilar skies, can nonetheless think and act in completely different ways.

Na Pali Chant 


In the Hawaiian islands prior to European contact, people’s awareness and 
use of the skies took place within a cognitive framework that combined an 
extensive practical knowledge used in long-distance navigation with 
strongly developed elements of ritual and ceremony. In this resource-rich 
corner of ancient Polynesia, where powerful social hierarchies developed, 
religious practices and cosmological principles are reflected archaeologi- 
cally in sacred landscapes containing a variety of temples and shrines 
(heiau) as well as prominent natural places named after celestial objects. 
There is also an abundant heritage of oral literature—creation myths and 
formal chants recorded after European contact, some of which contain de- 
tailed astronomical information. 

The hula—despite its modern image as public entertainment and 
tourist attraction—actually constitutes a very significant aspect of the 
Hawaiian oral tradition dating back to pre-contact times. In those days it 
took the form of a formal performance involving the recital of a chant 
(mele) together with associated bodily movement. Certain types of hula 
were deeply sacred. The repertoire in these cases was fixed, with no im- 
provisation allowed, and the nature and circumstances of their performance 
were bound by strict protocols. It is likely that chants of this nature that 
were recorded after European contact could have been passed down from 
one generation to another, virtually unscathed, for some considerable time. 

The following chant, recorded by the ethnographer Nathaniel Emerson 
in 1909 (in the days before diacritical marks were added to Hawaiian words 


to aid comprehension), may well be in this category: 


Hiki mai, hiki mai ka La, e. 
Aloha wale ka La e kau nei, 
Aia malalo 0 Ka-wai-hoa, 
A ka lalo o Kauai, o Lehua. 
A Kauai au, ike i ka pali; 
A Milo-lii pale ka pali loloa. 


E kolo ana ka pali o Makua-iki; 
Kolo o Pu-a, he keiki, 
He keiki makua-ole ke uwe nei. (Emerson 1997, p. 114) 


“Literal” translations vary, but the following represents a broad consensus: 


It has come, it has come; lo the Sun! 

How I love the Sun that’s on high; 

Below it swims Ka-wai-hoa, 

On the slope inclined from Kaua‘i to Lehua. 

On Kauai met I a pali, 

A beetling cliff that bounds Milo-lii, 

And climbing up Makua-iki, 

Crawling up was Pua, the child, 

An orphan that weeps out its tale. 

(Warther and Meech, in Koleva and Kolev 1996, p. 28, 
following Emerson 1997, p. 114) 


According to a legend recorded in 1899, the chant was first performed on 
the island of Ni‘ihau by a chief who was possessed by the spirit of Kapo, an 
alternative manifestation of the goddess Laka, principal deity of the hula. It 
refers to a number of landscape features both on the island of Ni‘ihau and 
on the rugged northwestern coastline of Kaua‘i some thirty kilometers 
(twenty miles) to the east, which, viewed from the northern part of Ni‘ihau, 
stretches for some twenty kilometers (twelve miles) directly away from the 
observer. This remote part of Kaua‘i, impassable even by modern roads, is 
known as Na Pali (“the cliffs”), although its deep valleys, deserted today, 
are accessible from the sea and had thriving populations in pre-contact 
times. Of the places named in the chant, Kawaihoa is a volcanic cone on 
Ni‘ihau; Lehua is another volcanic cone forming a separate islet; and 
Makua-iki is a point about halfway along the Na Pali cliffs, with the 
Miloli‘i valley close by. 

But could the chant be doing more than just describing the landscape? 
It is certainly true that Hawaiian chants contained copious quantities of rid- 
dles and word play, something the whole language lends itself to very nat- 
urally. Often they also contained a hidden level of meaning, known as 
kaona. In 1996, a local resident, Francis Warther, together with astronomer 
Karen Meech, suggested the following interpretation of the hidden (kaona) 


meaning: 


The sun is rising, east. 

The sun rises to its zenith. 

We stand on Ni‘ihau island, 

Sun reflected down from Kaua‘i island. 
Look towards Kaua‘i; see the cliff. 


A big cliff that bounds Milo-li‘i valley. 
The [baby] sun climbing up the cliff named Makua-iki. 
Alone, it takes five days to return, or eventually climb the 


cliff and return on its six-month trip to the south. 
(Warther and Meech, in Koleva and Kolev 1996, p. 28) 


According to Warther and Meech, the whole chant was in fact describ- 
ing a solstitial alignment along the Na Pali coastline. This could actually be 
viewed both ways, and it so happens that at the far (eastern) end of the cliffs 
is a large heiau sitting at the foot of a number of terraces leading up to a sa- 
cred altar dedicated to Laka herself, Ke-Ahu-a-Laka. According to traditions 
recorded early in the twentieth century, this was a place where priests or 
priestesses of the bula underwent periods of instruction and came to “gradu- 
ate.” The spot is very sheltered, and only from the very lowest corner of the 
heiau can one see along the coast. From this point, the cliffs of Makua-iki can 
be seen jutting out into the sea beyond the immediate cliffs, and Lehua ap- 
pears in the distance a short way along the skyline. The flat northern part of 
Ni‘ihau is in the line of sight but lost beneath the horizon. 

The chant and its double connection with Laka/Kapo strongly hints 
that this alignment in the landscape had a deep resonance for ancient Hawai- 
ians, notwithstanding the astronomical connection. But what was the nature 
of that connection? Archaeoastronomical work has shown that the align- 
ment may have had as much, if not more, to do with sunrise and sunset on 
the days of zenith/antizenith passage of the sun than the solstices. The mo- 
ment when the sun passed directly overhead was certainly a moment of great 
sacred power (mana) for ancient Hawaiians. 

The alignment along the Na Pali cliffs is, of course, naturally occurring 
rather than artificially constructed. This does not mean, though, that astro- 
nomical significance could not have been attributed to it: on the contrary, in 
fact. By an accident of nature (as a Western investigator would see it) re- 
sulting from the process of their geological formation, the highest points of 
various islands along the whole Hawaiian chain are quite closely aligned 
along an axis pointing toward June solstice sunset in one direction and to- 
ward December solstice sunrise in the other. Such fortuitous alignments pre- 
existing in the landscape might not impress a modern astronomer, but from 
an indigenous point of view it is difficult to imagine a more direct affirma- 
tion of the natural harmony between the land and the sky. 

It is possible that this so-called Na Pali chant will stand the test of 
time as a rare example of a “documented” ancient alignment. Unfortu- 
nately, the evidence is very inconclusive. In particular, the freedom with 
which double meanings can be expressed in Hawaiian, and with which 
kaona meanings can be imagined, cuts both ways, since it gives the mod- 
ern investigator a great deal of flexibility to postulate much that may not 


have been in the ancient Hawaiians’ minds at all. For now, no firm verdict 
has been reached.

Nabta Playa 
Between about 9000 B.c.£. and 3000 B.c.£., parts of what is now the Sahara 
Desert became habitable for periods lasting many centuries, when summer 
monsoons reached farther northward than at present. Nabta Playa is a nat- 
ural basin in southern Egypt, roughly fifty square kilometers (twenty square 
miles) in area, where water accumulated in the summer rainy season. It was 
a focus for seasonal occupation and settlement over several millennia, in- 
cluding ritual activities such as the burial of slaughtered cattle in roofed 
chambers covered in sandstone blocks. At some time between 7000 B.c.E. 
and the final abandonment of the playa in c. 3000 B.c.£., a number of stone 
slabs up to three meters (ten feet) in length seem to have been erected over 
a area of about three square kilometers (1.5 square miles), including three 
alignments several hundred meters long. There is also an oval arrangement 
of small standing and recumbent stones about three meters (ten feet) across. 
In many respects these stones bear an uncanny resemblance to European 
megaliths but predate them, possibly by several millennia. 

Surveys of the Nabta “megaliths” by the American archaeoastronomer 
Kim Malville in the late 1990s revealed that one of the alignments faced due 


east-west, while pairs of small standing stones sighted on opposite sides of

the circle defined two sightlines across it, one oriented north-south and the 
other aligned upon sunrise on the June solstice. The circle has accordingly 
been dubbed a calendar circle and seized upon by those keen to challenge the 
idea that the oldest astronomical alignments must have developed in Europe. 
It is certainly true that there are configurations of standing stones in many 
parts of the world that have not received the attention lavished upon their 
European counterparts. However, the history of the investigations of the Eu- 
ropean megaliths readily demonstrates the many dangers that await those 
overeager to find astronomical alignments and to overinterpret them in the 
absence of supporting archaeological evidence. 

Nonetheless, it is possible that the alignments at Nabta provide a mod- 
est but valuable indication of early cosmological beliefs and calendrical prac- 
tices among nomadic peoples in northeast Africa before the rise of the Egyp- 
tian kingdom. One suggestion is that climatic change in the fourth 
millennium B.c.£. forced these peoples to move north, not only forcing social 
change that precipitated the development of the kingdom, but introducing 
beliefs and practices that, in a later form, became enshrined in the architec- 
ture of large temples and pyramids.

Nadir Passage of the Sun 


See Antizenith Passage of the Sun. 


Namoratung’a 
Namoratung’a II (or Kalokol) is an archaeological site close to Lake 
Turkana in northwest Kenya. It consists of a collection of nineteen small 
standing stones—basalt pillars—associated with two burial cairns. It 
achieved notoriety in the late 1970s as an ancient calendrical site marking 
the horizon rising positions in 300 B.c.£. of seven stars and star groups still 
used in the present-day calendar of the Borana, who live about three hun- 
dred kilometers (two hundred miles) to the east. 

This interpretation serves as a warning against the dangers of heaping 
supposition upon supposition without paying enough attention to the 
broader evidence. Before the Borana were revisited by Italian anthropologist 


Marco Bassi in the mid-1980s, the only first-hand account of their calendar 
was that obtained by the Ethiopian anthropologist Asmerom Legesse around 
twenty years earlier. Legesse’s informants had said that successive months 
were recognized by the newly sighted crescent moon rising “in conjunction 
with” seven successive stars or star groups: Triangulum, the Pleiades, Alde- 
baran, Bellatrix, Orion’s belt and sword, Saiph, and Sirius. Astronomer Lau- 
rence Doyle from NASA examined Legesse’s account but could not make as- 
tronomical sense of it, unless “rising in conjunction” was taken to mean 
rising at the same horizon position, that is, in astronomical terms, at the 
same declination. The only problem was that this didn’t work correctly in 
the present era; however, it would have worked perfectly in around 300 
B.C.E. The answer, suggested Doyle, was that the present-day Borana calen- 
drical system derives from a more ancient calendar set up by Cushitic peo- 
ples around 300 B.c.£. A survey of alignments between the pillars at the 
Namoratung’a II site revealed alignments upon all seven of the Borana stars 
and asterisms at their rising points in around 300 B.c.E. 

Unfortunately, subsequent reassessments challenged many aspects of 
this attractive picture: the actual dating and purpose of the Namoratung’a 
stones; their cultural connection with the later Borana; whether the align- 
ment evidence was statistically significant (there exist a lot of pairwise align- 
ments between nineteen stones); and whether the measured alignments were 
accurate in the first place. Finally, it is difficult to understand why, and how, 
the observational principles underlying the Borana calendar could have re- 
mained static for over two thousand years when they no longer fit the actual 
motions of the stars. 

Taken together, these problems made the idea that the Borana calendar 
was some sort of frozen remnant of a much earlier calendrical system seem 
extremely shaky. The house of cards collapsed completely when Bassi’s field- 
work confirmed that “in conjunction with” should be interpreted as “side 
by side with,” in other words, in astronomical terms, “rising at the same 
right ascension as.” When properly understood, the Borana system works 
perfectly well in the present day.

Nasca Lines and Figures 

Few archaeological enigmas have excited so much fanciful speculation as 
the lines and figures etched into the desert near Nasca (or Nazca) in south- 
ern Peru. Few of the theories are scientifically tenable, and many are pure 
fantasy. However, behind the speculation lies a unique cultural phenome- 
non that for almost a century has attracted the attention of scientists and 
archaeologists alike. 

The coastal strip of southern Peru, which is in effect the northern ex- 
tension of the Atacama desert in Chile, is one of the most arid and desolate 
regions of the world. The landscape here comprises a series of flat desert 
plains, or pampas, separated by oasis-like river valleys. Measurable rainfall 
occurs on average only once in several years. Rivers are dry for much of the 
year, and water is plentiful for a short period only, when the seasonal melt- 
water flows down from the snow-capped Andes to the east. Yet despite the 
severity of the climatic regime, prehistoric societies flourished in the area for 
several millennia. Human occupation was concentrated in the valleys, but 
cultural activity extended onto the adjacent pampas, where it left a distinc- 
tive concentration of prehistoric remains. 

The small town of Nasca, some four hundred kilometers south of 
Lima, is situated in such a valley. A distinctive culture flourished here be- 
tween the first and sixth centuries C.E., leaving an abundant archaeological 
record including a fine and distinctive style of pottery, brightly colorful and 
richly decorated. During the centuries before the arrival of the Europeans, 
the people who lived in this area also seem to have channeled considerable 
efforts into etching monumental drawings on the desert. The Nasca pampa, 
an arid plain to the north of the town, covers an area of some two hundred 
square kilometers (about eighty square miles) and is covered in a vast array 
of long, straight lines, rectangles and trapezoids, labyrinths and spirals. The 
greatest concentration of markings is in the northern corner, where a num- 
ber of large stylized bird and animal figures, as well as less readily identifi- 
able forms, are also found. The overall impression, as viewed from one of 
the many light aircraft that carry tourists over the plain, is one of a giant

sketchpad, much scribbled upon. 

The desert surface here is composed of black ferrous oxide pebbles 
darkened by oxidation over many centuries. By simply brushing them aside, 
a bright yellow sandy soil is revealed beneath. This means that the desert 
markings, often termed geoglyphs, are highly susceptible to modern damage. 
Merely walking on the pampa is often enough to leave conspicuous foot- 
prints, which, owing to the lack of precipitation, will endure almost indefi- 
nitely. Worse still, many of the ancient lines and figures are scarred by deep 
ruts created by cars and even large commercial vehicles, which drive across 
the open desert in order to avoid paying highway tolls. On the other hand, 
there is no great mystery about how the Nasca geoglyphs were created, at 
least in principle. Armed with nothing more than a piece of string and a few 
sighting poles, a group of six volunteers was able to produce a ten-meter- 
(thirty-foot-) long straight line ending in a spiral on a nearby pampa in less 
than ninety minutes (see photo). 

Yet the Nasca markings were more than casual doodles. Some lines run 
for several kilometers, remaining dead straight even where they pass over 
small hills and dips. The figures, generally too large to be seen for what they 
are when standing close by, must have been constructed by scaling up from 


a template of manageable size. The enigma lies not in how the etchings were 


constructed per se, but in the reasons for their construction on such a vast 
scale. One suggested motivation for the anthropomorphic figures, which are 
clearly visible only from the air, is that they were for the benefit of shamans 
“flying” above the figures under the influence of the powerfully hallucino- 
genic San Pedro cactus. There is actually some evidence to support this spec- 
ulation: the San Pedro cactus is depicted upon Nasca pottery; images of birds 
are very common amongst Nasca artifacts (including, of course, the desert 
drawings themselves); and traditional beliefs about the spirit world that sur- 
vive today have much to do with flying. Be this as it may, it is clear that one 
does not need to resort to explanations totally divorced from the cultural ev- 
idence (such as the suggested existence of hot-air balloons), let alone extra- 
terrestrial involvement, to provide plausible theories as to why the Nasca 
people were motivated to etch vast figures in the desert. 

The lines are a more widespread phenomenon than the figures, both in 
time and space. Pottery fragments scattered in the vicinity of the geoglyphs 
indicate that the figures are attributable to the “Classic” Nasca period, dur- 
ing the first six centuries C.E., while the lines were created over a longer pe- 
riod of time. Not only do the lines (as opposed to the figures) cover the 
whole Nasca pampa; they also spread off into the valleys, where they be- 
come obliterated by modern cultivation. Similar lines are known on adjacent 
pampas as well as much farther afield. It just happens that on the Nasca 
pampa they are exceptionally well preserved, owing to the nature of the sur- 
face geology. 

Survey work has revealed a network of line centers, mostly located 
around the edge of the Nasca pampa, with lines of various types radiating 
out from them. Some of the lines stop dead, others turn corners and continue 
into labyrinths, but some run on, absolutely straight, for up to several kilo- 
meters, connecting different line centers. They are not pathways, at least not 
casual pathways; they are too perfectly straight. So what was their purpose? 

The Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejia Xesspe, working in the 
1920s, was one of the first to suggest a possible interpretation, dismissing 
the possibility that the lines were part of an irrigation system in favor of the 
idea that they were associated with some form of religious ritual. A decade 
or so later the North American geographer Paul Kosok chanced to observe 
the sun setting along one of the lines on June 22, the winter solstice in the 
southern hemisphere. This single fortuitous observation apparently led him 
to the conviction that the Nasca lines had a calendrical function (he later 
described them as the “largest astronomy book in the world”), thereby set- 
ting the seal on an astronomical interpretation that dominated Nasca stud- 
ies for many years. 

It was this interpretation that inspired a young German mathematics 


teacher living in Lima, Maria Reiche, to devote a lifetime to studying the

lines. A few visits to the pampa convinced Maria that the lines were directed 
toward horizon directions where the sun, moon, or stars appeared and dis- 
appeared; solving the riddle of the mathematical and astronomical meaning 
of the lines and figures subsequently became her mission in life. She began 
to visit the pampa regularly, living the life of a recluse, spending hours, days, 
and weeks walking on the desert and making measurements. Despite Re- 
iche’s unremitting devotion to the investigation of the lines, which lasted for 
the rest of her life (she died in 1998, aged ninety-five), it produced precious 
little published hard data. Reiche’s book Mystery on the Desert, which has 
run to several editions, concentrates mainly on descriptive material. In 1968, 
the astronomer Gerald Hawkins, who had proposed that Stonehenge in Eng- 
land was an astronomical observatory or computer, visited the pampa and 
carried out a statistical examination of the line orientations. His conclusion, 
which came as a surprise for many, was that they had no astronomical sig- 
nificance whatsoever, beyond what might be expected by chance. Although 
very different, both these approaches failed in one fundamental respect: they 
were divorced from the cultural context. Each, in its different way, was an 
intellectual exercise dictated by Western concepts of science and mathemat- 
ics but unrelated to the rich cultural traditions of pre-Columbian America. 


Any meaningful explanation for the Nasca lines needs to be couched in 


a wider, pan-Andean framework. There is, for example, an evident similar- 
ity between the network of line centers and radial lines at Nasca and the sys- 
tem of ceques that arose later at the imperial Inca capital of Cusco. A radial 
structure is also evident in the guipu—Andean recording devices consisting 
of knotted strings—which it seems natural to lay out so that the strings ra- 
diate from the single, “primary,” string to which each is attached. Added to 
this, ethnographic work has revealed the existence of a number of modern, 
traditional Andean villages, some in the vicinity of Cusco but others as far 
afield as northern Chile and Bolivia, organized around lines radiating from 
a central place such as a plaza or church. Attaching importance to straight 
lines radiating from central places is something that emerges in a variety of 
cultural contexts in pre-Columbian, historical, and modern South America. 
The Nasca lines seem to represent an early manifestation of conceptual prin- 
ciples attaching significance to radial lines that may have been remarkably 
widespread in Andean thought even in pre-Inca times, before becoming in- 
tegrated into Incaic worldview. Fragments of this principle survive in the 
present day in a few modern, remote Andean villages. 

What does this suggest about the purpose of the Nasca lines? The Incaic 
ceque system, as we know from historical evidence, was a basic organizing 
principle of empire, a mechanism of social and political control. Something 
similar may have been true at Nasca, at least in later, Incaic times. Post- 
conquest documents relating to land and water use in the vicinity of the pampa 
shortly after the Spanish conquest suggest that a scheme of social organization 
not unlike the one that prevailed in Cusco also existed in that region. 

The Nasca lines find a counterpart at an elevation of over four thou- 
sand meters (thirteen thousand feet) in a series of lines high in the Bolivian 
Andes. Some of these connect villages to the summits of nearby hills and ap- 
pear to have been maintained until very recently. In a village southwest of La 
Paz, anthropologist Johan Reinhard chanced to witness an annual proces- 
sion along one such line to a hilltop shrine. Here is a community still main- 
taining and using a straight line during an important springtime festival. Af- 
ter dark, the devotees make their way along the line, which is over one 
kilometer long. At the summit of a nearby hill, they worship local mountain 
gods, petitioning for fertility for animals (which are believed to be owned by 
the mountain) and rain for crops. They descend again to the village in the 
morning. At similar rituals in other villages there is a sacrificial element, 
where offerings are made to mountain gods that involve a llama sacrifice. 
Comparable practices took place during the Inca period. 

Some of the Nasca line centers are located at higher points on the pre- 
dominantly flat plain. Others are on the edges of the pampa, and in some 
cases lines running up to them from the valleys are still visible. It may well 


be, then, that the Nasca lines were meant to be walked upon after all, but in 


a formal sense—according to strict protocols, at the correct times, and in the 
context of the appropriate rituals. In such an arid environment, it is scarcely 
surprising that some of these ceremonials may have related to rain and fer- 
tility. Nor it is surprising, then, that statistical analyses of the line orienta- 
tions demonstrate a degree of correlation with local directions of water flow. 
On the other hand, we should not conclude that there was no connection 
with astronomy at all. A few evident alignments, for example on solstitial 
sunrise or sunset, may well have been formed as a deliberate part of the gen- 
eral scheme of things, just as a few of the Cusco ceques seem to have been 
astronomically aligned. 

In short, there is no simple explanation for the lines and figures on the 
pampa. Looking for simple solutions to a mystery and ignoring the wider 
cultural context is not the right approach. The Nasca geoglyphs can only 
ever be understood by trying to understand more about the totality of that 
cultural context viewed, at best, obscurely through a historical haze.

Nationalism 

The idea that certain peoples in the past had sophisticated astronomical 
knowledge has sometimes been conflated with issues of national identity and 
invoked in support of nationalist agendas. This happened most notoriously 
when the Nazis used ancient astronomical achievements as part of their 
demonstration of supposed Aryan superiority. Apart from the fact that po- 
litical motivations as strong as this are almost certain to compromise scien- 


tific objectivity in assessing the actual evidence, the whole agenda stems from 


a misguided belief that the achievements of past communities can be rightly 
judged against our own—a clear manifestation of ethnocentrism. It is quite 
different from the proper agenda of archaeoastronomy, which, in common 
with many aspects of anthropology and other social sciences, strives to high- 
light human diversity in order to promote wider understanding of the 
breadth of human achievements and tolerance of humanity in general.

Navajo Cosmology 

Navajo country stretches across the four-corners region of the U.S. South- 
west. The bulk of it lies in northern New Mexico and northern Arizona, with 
a small part spilling over into southern Utah and the southwestern tip of 
Colorado. It is bounded by four sacred mountains: Turquoise Mountain in 
the south (Mount Taylor, New Mexico, between Gallup and Albuquerque); 
Obsidian Mountain in the north (Hesperus Peak, Colorado, in the La Plata 
Mountains); in the west Mount Humphrey, Arizona, one of the San Fran- 
cisco Peaks near Flagstaff; and in the east by a mountain called Sis Naajini, 
which is probably Blanca Peak, Colorado, in the Sangre de Cristo range. 

Navajo territory exists at the center of things, integrated into the cos- 
mos through a fourfold harmony: four directions, four seasons, four times 
of day, four sacred colors, four precious stones, and so on. Each direction is 
associated with a different one of the four things in a particular category: 
thus, for example, south is associated with the color blue and the middle of 
the day. In this four-ness, Navajo cosmology has much in common with the 
worldview of other native American groups, but it is fixed geographically by 
a particular sacred topography. The four-directional awareness perpetrates 
all aspects of life. West, for instance, portrays family life and is associated 
with being at home in the evening with the family around the fire. In learn- 
ing, east is associated with the arts, west with the social sciences, north with 
the hard sciences, and south with technical skills. These associations are re- 
flected in the layout of Diné College (formerly Navajo Community College) 
at Tsaile, Arizona. 

The relationship between earth and sky is central to Navajo thought. 
Father Sky stretches out over Mother Earth: the space in between them is in- 
habited by living beings that live on top of the earth, and the stars which 
adorn Father Sky. The life force of all living and growing things derives from 
Mother Earth and Father Sky (or Father Sun). 


Various supernatural beings helped create the world, and they inhabit 
it alongside ordinary mortal humans. These Holy People can be dangerous 
and harmful, but are generally concerned for the welfare of the Earth Sur- 
face People. The Holy People include First Man and First Woman, who 
showed, by building the first dwelling, or hogan, how all hogans should be 
constructed, modeling the cosmos in various ways in order to ensure the 
well-being of their inhabitants. Black God was responsible for placing the 
stars in the sky—by some accounts helped by First Man and First Woman. 
Dilyéhé (the Pleiades) were his own stars. Each time he stamped his foot, 
they moved up his body until they finally settled on his forehead. The crys- 
tals that would form the other stars were carried in his pouch, or in some 
versions of the story, in a blanket. Black God carefully placed various stars 
in the sky: Fire Star (Polaris), Revolving Male (Ursa Major), Revolving Fe- 
male (Cassiopeia), First Slim One (Orion), Man With Legs Ajar (Corvus), 
First Big One (head of Scorpius), and Rabbit Tracks (tail of Scorpius). 

These principal constellations not only lit up the night in the absence of 
the moon, but also invoked stories and reinforced social laws, confirming 
principles of orderly behavior needed to ensure that the community as a 
whole would survive and flourish. Thus the sight of Revolving Male and Re- 
volving Female turning continuously around Fire Star set an example to be 
followed: only one couple should live in a single hogan and cook over the 
same fire. This served to emphasize the importance of family responsibilities 
and to reinforce the social convention that sons-in-law should avoid looking 
their mothers-in-law in the face. Rabbit Tracks directed social behavior in a 
different way, by means of its seasonal patterns of appearance and disap- 
pearance, which defined the periods when hunting was permitted. 

According to the legend, Black God placed Dilyébé in the sky close to 
First Slim One, then rested. At this time, Coyote was allowed to place one 
star in the south. But Coyote was a trickster. He seized the pouch or blanket 
containing the rest of the stars and flung them across the sky. This is why 
most of the stars are chaotic. In this way, the Navajo creation story neatly 
explains both order and disorder in the heavens. 

A distinctive artifact of Navajo culture is the sandpainting or dry paint- 
ing. These paintings have a life and power of their own. Creating one is a 
formal affair carried out according to strict protocols. When completed, the 
painting functions (in the context of the appropriate ceremonial) to call su- 
pernatural beings and focus their healing powers, for example, in curing sick 
or injured people. Navajo sandpaintings depict a variety of living beings and 
Holy People. A number contain recognizable star groups within representa- 
tions of the sky, for example in the body of Father Sky. 

In sum, the cosmos in general, and the sky in particular, pervades 


everyday life for traditional Navajo people. The night sky with its key con- 


stellations serves as a text, underlying stories that chanters elaborate during 
ceremonials (each in their own way, resulting in many variants). Elements 
of Najavo worldview are also reflected in a variety of ways in material cul- 
ture, for example in the design of the hogan and in the content and use of 
sandpaintings.

Navajo Hogan 

Traditionally, Navajo families do not live in concentrated villages but in 
homesteads scattered about in the landscape. The traditional family 
dwelling is known as a hogan (or hooghan). Today Navajo families may 
live in separate houses or caravans, but the hogan remains the sacred 
dwelling, a place of instruction, healing, or simply a quiet refuge. 

Round or octagonal in shape, the hogan is built in accordance with 
strict cosmological principles. The doorway, for example, always faces east, 
toward the rising sun. The roof reflects the sky, the walls reflect the sur- 
rounding trees and mountains, and the earth floor reflects the earth as a 
whole. Four poles are placed in the four cardinal directions, reflecting the 
overall structure of the cosmos. Different quarters of the hogan are used for 
different activities: everyday crafts and handiwork in the south, telling sto- 
ries and entertaining visitors take place in the west, sacred activities (such as 
preparing masks for ceremonials) in the north. Movement within the hogan, 
between these different areas, is sunwise. 

In short, the hogan is a reflection of the world as a whole—a micro- 
cosm. As a result, its occupants, while occupying their home, are also occu- 
pying the whole cosmos, at harmony with all things, and hence assured long 
life and happiness. 

There is a lesson here for archaeologists who might seek to interpret 


orientation trends among older dwellings for which we have no historical or 


modern informants to interpret their meaning. If, as archaeologists of the fu- 
ture, we measured the orientations of a group of Navajo hogans, we might 
find their entrances facing a spread of directions within the range of horizon 
where the sun rises at some time during the year. If we then became preoc- 
cupied with questions such as “which day of the year did the sun rise directly 
in line with the entrance of a particular hogan?” and “was a hogan built to 
face sunrise on the day of its construction?,” we might lose sight of the 
broader questions and meanings that really mattered to the Navajo people. 
“East” is the quarter of the world—that part of the horizon—where the sun 
shines in at some time of the year. Hogans face “east,” and that may be all 
that matters. Even if there is more, Navajo elders may never wish to tell us, 
and the archaeological record may never reveal it.

Navajo Star Ceilings 

Certain stars and constellations that were of particular cultural signifi- 
cance can be recognized in Navajo sandpaintings, rock art, and certain 
portable artifacts such as gourd rattles used in sacred ceremonies. Small 
crosses representing stars are also found painted on the ceilings of rock 
shelters and on horizontal, downward-facing surfaces of rock overhangs. 
Over seventy-five examples are known, concentrated mainly in the Canyon 
de Chelly area of Arizona. They contain anything from a single star to 
more than two hundred, sometimes mixed with other elements such as 
stylized birds or dragonflies. 

According to Navajo myth, Black God, who put the stars in the sky, 
only had the chance to place a few carefully before the rest were flung across 
the sky haphazardly. As a result, only a few bright stars and constellations 
are important to the Navajo; the rest are regarded as random. Some of these 
constellations are depicted on certain Navajo artifacts, but the important 
thing was to identify them rather than to represent their shape literally (as 
we would see it). Thus where Dilyéhé (the Pleiades) are represented on 
masks of Black God, the seven dots do not reflect the actual form of the con- 


stellation in the sky.

Star ceilings, it seems, do not even depict actual stars. Though there are 
inviting scatters of stars on many ceilings, attempts to identify particular 
constellations are unconvincing. A number of ceilings have the stars 
arranged in regular rows; others are as much as twenty meters (sixty-five 
feet) above the ground, totally out of reach. The stars were likely placed 
there by using bows to fire “arrows” carrying paint-covered stamps—a 
process that could not have resulted in great precision. 

What were star ceilings for? In Navajo thought, stars are regarded as 
beneficent supernatural beings (Holy People) who can restore well-being in 
times of misfortune. A likely answer, then, is that the stars had a restorative 
or protective role. Perhaps the act of painting of a ceiling created a place— 
a shrine—where the healing power of the stars could be harnessed through 
the performance of the appropriate rites. Another suggestion is that they cre- 
ated a supernatural presence within a dangerous place to protect people 
nearby against disasters such as rock-falls. These and other possibilities are 
not mutually exclusive. 

In short, it seems that stars on Navajo star ceilings were symbols con- 
veying the stars’ protective power rather than literal depictions of stars. This 
example cautions against jumping to “literalist” conclusions, especially where 


we do not have access to the cultural evidence that could counter them.

Navigation 

One of the obvious ways in which ancient peoples may have made practi- 
cal use of astronomy was in finding their way through unknown territory, 
where they could not rely on familiar landmarks. Of course travelers in the 
past could always attempt to identify a succession of distinctive places and 
landscape features, preferably ones that were clearly visible from some dis- 
tance along the route. However, in some circumstances—in great plains, 
deserts and tundra, and especially at sea—these were scarce or nonexistent. 
In such situations, the sky can be critical in maintaining a course and, for 
longer journeys, indicating the current location. 

There are obvious broad indicators of direction: the easterly sunrise, 
the westerly sunset, or (in locations north of the tropics) the northerly-fac- 
ing shadows cast by upright objects in the midday sun (in locations south of 
the tropics, the shadows are southerly-facing). However, these only provide 
crude indications, since the rising and setting points of the sun depend upon 
the time of year, and the midday shadow technique presupposes the means 
to accurately determine the time of local noon. 

Stars provide a more direct and more accurate means of determining di- 
rections. Any given star, viewed from a particular place, always rises and sets 
at the same point and follows the same path through the sky. By acquiring a 
knowledge of guiding stars whose rising or setting positions mark different 
directions, it is possible to build up a mental star compass. In practice, ad- 
verse weather conditions can create difficulties, so the more stars a traveler 
knows, the better. Another problem is extinction, the dimming of a star close 
to a low horizon as its light is absorbed by the earth’s atmosphere. Deter- 


mining direction by using stars that are already high in the sky, on the other 


hand, is complicated by the fact that the direction depends on the altitude 
above the horizon, something that is itself generally difficult to determine ac- 
curately. This only ceases to be a problem close to the equator, where the ce- 
lestial bodies rise and set almost vertically. 

From anywhere on earth, there is one point in the heavens whose di- 
rection is unchanging: the celestial pole. The north celestial pole, visible to 
observers north of the equator, is marked by the Pole Star, Polaris (although, 
owing to the steady drift in the position of the pole due to precession, this 
was not the case before modern times). Observing this star, whatever the 
time of night and the time of year, gives a direct indication of due north to 
within about a degree (since Polaris is not quite at the celestial pole). Ob- 
servers in the southern hemisphere have no such bright star to mark the 
south celestial pole, but a good knowledge of the star formations that sur- 
round it, such as the Southern Cross, can be used to obtain quite a good es- 
timate of its position and hence of the direction of due south. 

Voyagers who traveled significant distances to the north or south 
would have begun to notice the changing appearance of the sky with lati- 
tude. The altitude of Polaris, for example, is a direct indication of the lati- 
tude for an observer north of the equator. Even without instruments, trav- 
elers in tropical latitudes can estimate their latitude north of the equator by 
such techniques as holding a finger or hand at arm’s length to estimate the 
angle of Polaris above a level horizon. Another way of keeping track of 
one’s latitude is to identify the stars that pass across the zenith, the point di- 
rectly overhead. 

The value of navigation by the stars is most obvious in the open sea, 
where there are no terrestrial points of reference and distances traveled can 
be great indeed. The most impressive feats of navigation in the past were un- 
doubtedly those of the ancient Polynesians, who successfully discovered and 
colonized innumerable islands, most of which were mere dots in the vast ex- 
panse of the Pacific Ocean. The Polynesian navigators used a combination 
of astronomical observations and other techniques. Estimating one’s longi- 
tude is much trickier than estimating latitude, since it involves relating the 
appearance of the sky to the time of night and the time of year. It is gener- 
ally easier to use other means, such as dead reckoning: estimating the dis- 
tance traveled in order to compute the current position. A method of locat- 
ing known islands was to reach the appropriate latitude and then sail due 
east Or west, using means such as ocean currents or the appearance of cer- 
tain birds to indicate that land was close. 

Navigation by land using the stars is much less well documented. For 
example, despite the vast and open nature of much of the landscape of cen- 
tral Australia, there is little or no evidence of Aboriginal groups—despite 


their detailed knowledge of the skies in other ways—using the appearance of 


the skies for navigation purposes at night. Inuit groups, on the other hand, 
made extensive use of both the sun and stars for wayfinding in the Canadian 
Arctic.

Navigation in Ancient Oceania 

The Pacific Ocean is so huge that it covers a third of the earth’s surface and 
is larger in area than all of the world’s continents put together. When James 
Cook led the first scientific expeditions to the Pacific in the mid-eighteenth 
century, he was staggered to discover that small and widely dispersed is- 
lands spread over thousands of miles were not only inhabited, but by peo- 
ples who spoke essentially the same language. In this way, Polynesia became 
recognized as the most widespread nation in the world, dispersed over an 
area that—if shifted to the other side of the world—would simultaneously 
encompass London, Vladivostok, and the southern tip of India. The islands 
of Micronesia and Melanesia in the western Pacific, generally closer to the 
Asian continent, were also inhabited prior to European contact, but by a 
mixture of different ethnic and linguistic groups. 

Ever since 1520, when Ferdinand Magellan sailed west into the un- 
known ocean from the tip of South America, arriving in the Philippines with 
a starving crew nearly four months later, Europeans had known of the exis- 
tence of (as one of Magellan’s chroniclers described it) “a sea so vast the hu- 
man mind can scarcely grasp it” (Beaglehole 1974, p. 109). For another two 
and a half centuries before Cook’s expedition, long-distance trading ships 
occasionally stumbled upon Pacific islands and to their complete bewilder- 
ment found them occupied by thriving communities. Having themselves only 
recently developed the technology to build ocean-spanning ships, the Euro- 
peans were simply unable to comprehend how Stone Age people, traveling 
in canoes built using stone tools and with no navigational devices, could pos- 
sibly have got there first. 


So how did Polynesian and other Oceanic peoples come to colonize 


such tiny pieces of land in a vast ocean? The navigators must have explored 
widely in order to locate them in the first place. They must have been confi- 
dent of finding them again, in order to bring boatloads of people, tubers, and 
animals. And they must have been sure of returning repeatedly in order to 
maintain communications. Ocean-going canoes were large and generally 
double-hulled or with outriggers. Their sails were woven from pandanus 
leaves (rather like bulrushes) and their ropes manufactured from coconut 
husks. Polynesian canoes typically used a distinctive crab-claw-shaped sail, 
wider at the top than the bottom, which enabled them to catch the wind con- 
tinuously, even in quite heavy swells. Nonetheless, longer journeys would 
still have taken several weeks. During the 1960s, it was seriously proposed 
that the Pacific had been colonized by luck rather than by skill. However, 
this always begged many questions, such as why people left safe islands and 
sailed off into the unknown, taking all their possessions with them, unless 
they were forced; and what proportion of the voyagers (surely large) per- 
ished at sea, making no landfall. The idea of accidental colonization was 
firmly laid to rest by the construction in the 1970s of Hékéle‘a, a tradi- 
tional-style Polynesian canoe, reconstructed as authentically as possible and 
sailed without a compass or any other modern instruments. Between 1975 
and 2000, Hékdle‘a made several successful voyages between the farthest 
corners of Polynesia. 

Polynesia stretches from the Hawaiian islands in the north to Aotearoa 
(New Zealand) in the west and tiny, isolated Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the 
east. The idea that Polynesia was colonized by people drifting westwards 
from South America, famously championed by the Norwegian explorer 
Thor Heyerdahl in the 1950s following the successful voyage of the balsa- 
wood raft Kon Tiki from Peru to the Tuamotus, is completely refuted by a 
range of archaeological and linguistic evidence. This shows conclusively 
that Polynesians ultimately derived from south-east Asia. As early as the 
second milennium B.c.E., peoples characterized by a distinctive type of pot- 
tery (Lapita ware) had spread out along the islands of Melanesia to reach 
the central Pacific islands of Tonga, Samoa, and Fiji. Distinctively Polyne- 
sian characteristics developed here in the central Pacific, and these Polyne- 
sians subsequently moved eastward to the Society Islands, Marquesas, and 
Tuamotus, and finally dispersed to the farther islands. The chronology is far 
from certain, but the Society Islands and Marquesas had probably been set- 
tled by about the year 0, Hawai‘i and Rapa Nui by c.£. 400, and Aotearoa 
by cE. 900. 

One problem remains. The assortment of domestic animals and staple 
crops dispersed by the Polynesians to their many islands included the sweet 
potato, which comes from the Andes, It seems almost ludicrous to suppose 


that—as a one-off occurrence at a remarkably early date, before the main 


Polynesian expansion—a canoe managed somehow to travel halfway across 
the Pacific from central Polynesia and happen across South America, to col- 
lect the vital tubers, and to successfully return with them. Surely, some have 
argued, there must have been more prolonged contact, a period when regular 
voyaging took place across the Pacific, and when regular contact may even 
have been made with other parts of the Pacific rim. Others take the view that, 
since the island societies went on to develop in such different ways, any reg- 
ular contact between distant groups of islands was relatively short-lived. 

Be this as it may, regular long-distance voyages of anything over a few 
hundred kilometers had essentially vanished by the time of European con- 
tact. Nonetheless, we know a remarkable amount about Polynesian naviga- 
tional astronomy from the survival of various oral traditions, many recorded 
in the early years after European contact. Polynesian navigators enjoyed spe- 
cial status. One of the most famous contacts made by Cook on his first voy- 
age in the Endeavour was with a Tahitian navigator, Tupaia. Tupaia could 
name scores of islands in central Polynesia, specifying (with remarkable ac- 
curacy) the direction and distance of each. While the practice of traveling 
these distances had apparently died out, the knowledge of how to do it had 
remained, as was demonstrated when Tupaia subsequently sailed away with 
Cook in the Endeavour. 

Our fragmentary knowledge of Polynesian and Micronesian navigation 
techniques owes much to a succession of ethnographers and cultural inform- 
ants as well as to the experimental voyagers who have researched, and at- 
tempted to use, traditional navigation techniques. Their achievement in ac- 
quiring and preserving much of what we do know is all the more impressive 
given that navigational knowledge was often sacred and known only to a very 
few privileged experts, who were reluctant to reveal it to outsiders. Through- 
out Oceania, navigators were highly respected people and generally had high 
social status. Tupaia was a priest, formerly a chief. In Tonga, knowledge of 
navigation was the preserve of specialist families who had chiefly rank. 

Astronomy was crucial in navigation. By day, direction-finding had to 
depend upon the sun, the winds, currents, and swells. The presence of an is- 
land not far beyond the horizon could sometimes be detected from cloud for- 
mations or the appearance of certain birds. By night, there were the stars. For 
relatively short journeys to familiar destinations, one could learn the succes- 
sion of rising or setting directional stars that marked a desired course. More 
effectively for general use, the navigator could commit to memory a so-called 
star compass, a mental image of the rising and setting positions around the 
horizon of key stars and star groups, some of which would be visible not too 
far above the horizon at any particular time. One of the best-documented star 
compasses derives from the Caroline Islands in Micronesia. 


Techniques were also needed to determine the current position. From a 


Western perspective it seems natural to determine the latitude by estimating 
the altitude of the relevant celestial pole above the horizon. This is facilitated 
in the northern hemisphere by the presence of the bright star Polaris close to 
the pole. Its height above the horizon can be estimated, for example, by 
holding out a hand at arm’s length. Another method is to observe which 
stars pass across the zenith. Determining one’s longitude, on the other hand, 
is extremely tricky without instruments. But Oceanic navigators did not 
think in terms of latitude and longitude. Instead, it seems that they employed 
(what seem to us) highly ingenious and (to our way of thinking) very strange 
techniques for dead reckoning—determining the absolute distance traveled. 
This, in combination with a knowledge of the direction of travel, is sufficient 
to specify the present position. 

The colonization of the Pacific was achieved, as far as we know, with- 
out any tools apart from the navigator’s own body and brain. The only sug- 
gestion of the use of what one might call “navigational instruments” comes 
from Hawai‘i, where there is some evidence for the use of hollowed-out 
gourds as star compasses and sextants, but this is a controversial topic. 

Why was the Pacific settled? To European sailors of the sixteenth to 
eighteenth centuries, this vast ocean was a terrifying void that had to be 
crossed out of commercial necessity. Whatever motivation prehistoric peoples 
had had for setting out across it in no more than dugout canoes was simply 
unimaginable. The ancient Polynesians and other Oceanic peoples, however, 
thought very differently. To them, this great sea was the world: “a familiar, 
life-giving world... strewn with fertile islands on which they could settle, 
plant their taro, bananas, and other crops, and raise their children” (Finney 
1994, p. 3). It is only by starting to appreciate the second of these contrast- 


ing worldviews that we can even begin to understand their motivations.

Nebra Disc 


In 2002, a spectacular discovery came to the world’s attention. It had been 
made three years earlier in the region of Sachsen-Anhalt in central Ger- 
many, close to the small town of Nebra, thirty-five kilometers (twenty-two 
miles) southwest of Halle, at the summit of a 250-meter (800-foot) hill 
known as the Mittleberg. Here, inside a pit within a palisaded enclosure 
dating to the Bronze Age, treasure hunters unearthed a disc thirty-two cen- 
timeters (thirteen inches) across, about the size of a dinner plate, made of 
arsenic-rich bronze. On one side was a decorative pattern of inlaid shapes 
in thin plate gold. Although corroded and slightly damaged, the original ap- 
pearance of the pattern is clear enough. To one side of the center was a cir- 
cle of gold, occupying about a tenth of the whole area. There was also a 
crescent of comparable size, and three bands in the shape of curved arcs, 
two of which were placed along the rim on opposite sides, while the other 
follows a tighter curve, with only its central part touching the rim. The re- 
maining space contained thirty-two smaller dots, scattered unsystematically 
but generally filling it reasonably evenly, apart from one group of seven 
dots placed noticeably closer together. 

Few could fail to imagine, on first sight of the disc, that these were 
meant as representations of celestial objects. The crescent moon is obvious; 
the complete circle could be interpreted either as the sun or the full moon, 
The fact that there are seven stars in the cluster invites suggestions that it 
portrayed the Pleiades, one of the most conspicuous groups of stars in the 
sky. However, the pattern on the disc does not bear any close resemblance to 


the actual pattern of those stars in the sky—it was not a literal depiction, 


The Nebra disc. (Kenneth Garrett/National Geographic Image Collection) 


Likewise, the disc as a whole was clearly not a literal depiction of the sky. 
The sun (or full moon) and crescent moon are vastly out of proportion, and 
the majority of the stars are clearly space fillers. 

Could the disc have functioned as some sort of star map or astronom- 
ical aid? A number of detailed and highly speculative theories have been put 
forward, but the strongest evidence in support of this proposition comes 
from the two golden arcs along opposite rims. Their lengths are almost iden- 
tical, and each covers almost exactly eighty-three degrees, which at the lati- 
tude of Sachsen-Anhalt matches the extent of the eastern and western hori- 
zon over which the sun rises and sets, respectively, during the year. 
Furthermore, the location where the disc was found may well have had cal- 
endrical significance. From this location, the Brocken, the highest mountain 
in northern Germany, is visible on clear days eighty-five kilometers (fifty- 
three miles) away on the northwestern horizon and is in the direction of sun- 
set on the summer solstice. This has led some to suggest that the disc had a 
practical use as a device for fixing the time of year by observing the position 
of sunrise or sunset along the horizon. However, this makes no sense. There 
are no reference points on the disc, whereas the distant horizon, like any 
horizon, was full of distinguishing features that could have been used di- 
rectly to identify different days in an agricultural or ceremonial calendar. 

Even those who have sought hardest to find a pragmatic function for 
the disc tend to acknowledge that the third curved arc, touching the “south- 
ern” part of the rim (the left side in the photo), presents a problem. Some say 
that it resembles a ship sailing through the night: tiny lines on the upper and 
lower edges might even represent oars. If this interpretation is correct, then 
the whole disc may depict a legend relating to a ship sailing under the stars, 
or perhaps sailing through the sky. More speculatively, it could represent a 
myth in which the sun is transported from the western to the eastern hori- 
zon during the night in a ship. On the other hand, if the disc is held the other 
way up, the mysterious curve may simply be a rainbow. 

How can we resolve the apparent contradiction between the interpre- 
tation of the disc as a portrayal of a cosmic myth and the apparent exacti- 
tude of the sunrise and sunset horizon arcs? If we interpret the disc as a rep- 
resentation of the cosmos, there is not necessarily any contradiction. 
Indigenous worldviews commonly incorporate (on an equal footing) aspects 
that we would see as purely mythical and aspects that we would see as re- 
flecting scientific actuality, sometimes observed with impressive exactitude. 
Many indigenous cosmologies assign distinct sets of meanings and attributes 
to the “quarters of the world” represented by a fourfold partitioning of the 
horizon around the solstitial directions. (Two of the dots, or stars, on the Ne- 
bra disc were actually found underneath one of the rim bands, which implies 


that these were added as an afterthought or later elaboration.) 


Unlike the Bush Barrow gold lozenge, another Bronze Age artifact for 
which detailed but highly speculative astronomical interpretations have been 
put forward, the Nebra disc indisputably contains astronomical/astrological 
symbols. On the other hand, to think of the disc as a portable star map is 
probably wide of the mark. It was more likely a remarkable status object of 
aesthetic rather than practical value, owned by someone with considerable 
prestige. As a representation of the cosmos it may well have been an object 
of considerable sacred power.

Necker Island 

Necker Island is one of the farthest flung of the Hawaiian islands, an iso- 
lated rocky outcrop protruding above sea level more than five hundred kilo- 
meters (three hundred miles) to the northwest of the main islands in the 
chain. It is certainly not habitable. It is totally exposed, without fresh wa- 
ter or a natural harbor. It is only some twelve hundred meters (four thou- 
sand feet) from end to end and comprises a single narrow ridge, little more 
than a hundred meters (three hundred feet) at its widest, falling (often pre- 
cipitously) down to the sea on both sides. And yet, staggeringly, it is cov- 
ered in no fewer than thirty-four temple platforms. It has been suggested 
that a shipwrecked party may have been stranded here, building a succes- 
sion of shrines to appease the gods while surviving by catching trickles of 
rainwater and snaring birds. A more likely, although still extraordinary, ex- 
planation is that Polynesians came here deliberately and repeatedly, evi- 
dently in significant numbers, risking life and limb to construct one temple 
after another in this remotest of places. Why? 

One reason might have been that the island was regarded as a highly 
sacred place. Its traditional name in Hawaiian is Moku-manamana, which 
has been taken by some to mean “the island with a great deal of sacred 
power.” Unfortunately, more than one translation is possible: the name may 
simply have meant “branching island.” In any case, this does not in itself tell 
us why Necker might have been regarded as so sacred. 

Archaeology does not provide clear answers; it poses more questions. 
The Hawaiian archaeologist Kenneth Emory, who visited the island in the 
1920s, noted that the design of the rectangular temples on Necker bore a 


striking resemblance to the marae of central Polynesia, even though those is- 


lands were thousands of kilometers more distant than the other Hawaiian is- 
lands. In addition, a number of images of male faces carved out of stone, 
found on one of the platforms, are similar to stone idols found in the Mar- 
quesas, but are quite unlike anything found elsewhere in Hawai‘i. It is pos- 
sible, then, that the activities on Necker have a very early origin, dating to 
an erstwhile phase of long-distance Pacific exploration preceding many cen- 
turies of cultural developments in Hawai‘i prior to European contact. In the 
absence of firm archaeological dating evidence, however, the question re- 
mains an open one. 

Studies of the orientations of the temple platforms on Necker by the as- 
tronomer William Liller have shown that as many as nine are broadly 
aligned with the December solstice sunrise and June solstice sunset. How- 
ever, as this is generally in line with the orientation of the ridge, this does not 
in itself provide conclusive evidence that these alignments were intentional. 

A more controversial but also intriguing astronomical explanation has 
to do with the latitude of Necker Island—23°35' N. There is reasonable ev- 
idence to suggest that Polynesians—and Hawaiians in particular—had a 
keen interest in the passage of the sun through the zenith—the highest point 
in the heavens. At any location in the tropics, the sun passes through the 
zenith on two different days in the year, the actual dates depending on the 
latitude. The Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn represent the limits of this 
region. At a location on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun passes directly over- 
head on only a single day in the year, the June solstice. Necker Island lies 
almost exactly on the Tropic of Cancer, whereas the larger Hawaiian is- 
lands lie farther southwards, well inside the tropics. Could Necker’s sacred 
significance have been because it lay on this limit—the symbolic limit of 
Polynesia? 

The two Tropics are, in fact, drifting gradually closer together owing to 
the slow decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic. Necker was just within the 
tropics (located just south of the Tropic of Cancer) before about C.E. 900. 
Then at around this time the Tropic passed by on its course southwards. 
Thereafter the zenith sun could be seen from the island no more. Could the 
sacred power of the island have been at its greatest when the island was pre- 
cisely on the tropic, and quickly waned thereafter? Such an idea is not in- 
consistent with the broader chronological evidence: in around C.E. 900 it is 
possible that Polynesians were regularly voyaging over long distances in the 
central Pacific. However, all this assumes that people were interested in de- 
termining the zenith passage of the sun very precisely, and for this there is no 
direct supporting evidence. 

If achieving such a high level of precision were not an issue, then the 
idea that Necker was sacred because it marked the limit of the zenith sun 


would fit with a wider range of dates. In this case, it may be relevant that 


unusually large numbers of temple platforms are also found on some islands 
close to the Tropic of Capricorn south of the equator, although the concen- 
trations are nowhere near as dramatic as on Necker. However, it may not be 
necessary to imagine such a specifically astronomical motivation at all. It 
may be that Necker’s sacredness derived simply from its extreme location— 
an end place beyond which there were no more habitable islands.

Newgrange 
Newgrange is one of three large Neolithic passage tombs that are found 
within three kilometers of one another on the northern side of the river 
Boyne west of Drogheda, County Meath, in central Ireland. It incorporates 
one of the most famous astronomical alignments in the world. Around the 
shortest day every year, just after sunrise, a shaft of sunlight suddenly en- 
ters the tomb and shines directly down the long passage, penetrating right 
through to the central chamber for a precious few minutes before, equally 
swiftly, it plunges once again into almost interminable darkness. 
Newgrange is a supreme example of the passage tomb genre, of which 
there are more than three hundred examples to be found across Ireland, 
with many more in northern Scotland. Built in the later part of the fourth 
millennium B.C.E., it is an enormous mound some eighty meters (260 feet) 
across, entered by a passage leading in from an entrance on the southeast- 
ern side. Almost twenty meters (sixty-five feet) long, with a roof formed of 
enormous, flat slabs of rock held up by large, upright side-stones (or- 
thostats), the passage leads to a central chamber deep within the tomb. This 
chamber has an impressive corbelled roof six meters (twenty feet) high and 
is so large that several people can stand together inside comfortably. Three 


smaller chambers open off the main central chamber, one opposite the en-

trance and one on each side. Fragments of human bone, both burned and 
unburned, together with animal bones, pendants, beads, and other grave 
goods were found within the tomb. 

Before Michael O’Kelly began excavations at the site in the early 1960s, 
visitors were perplexed by what appeared to be an additional roof slab 
above the entrance, apparently a false lintel about one meter (three feet) 
higher than the level of the main roof of the passage. This turned out to be 
the top of a roof-box above the passage entrance. It is through this roof-box 
that the sunlight enters at midwinter. This is not a precise phenomenon: it is 
repeated each day for a few days after the solstice, though for a progressively 
shorter period of time each day; and likewise (increasing up to the maximum 
duration) beforehand. Owing to the changing position of the solstitial sun 
over the millennia (due to the changing obliquity of the ecliptic), the shaft of 
sunlight would have appeared for somewhat longer, and for a few more 
days, at the time when the tomb was built. 

There are many beautifully decorated stones at Newgrange, and it has 
been suggested that the interplay of sunlight and shadow across various spi- 
rals, lozenges, and other carvings at certain times of year might also have 
been significant to the builders. However, since eye-catching associations of 


this nature could easily have arisen fortuitously, such ideas are more contro- 


versial. Similarly, claims of alignments involving the circle of standing stones 
that surround the tomb also remain speculative. 

One thing that can be stated with relative certainty, however, is that 
Newgrange was not an ancient observatory. It is ludicrous to suggest that 
people entered the tomb and sat among the bones of the dead, merely to de- 
termine whether or not the shortest day of the year had arrived. Frivolous as 
this point sounds, it is important in that for many years a number of peo- 
ple—most famously the Scottish engineer Alexander Thom—claimed that 
free-standing megalithic sites that had no other obvious primary function 
had been constructed as astronomical observing instruments. In fact, this 
theory runs counter to common sense: people in prehistory would clearly not 
have gone to all the bother of constructing monumental architecture, even 
just one or two standing stones, to do what could be achieved perfectly ef- 
fectively using non-permanent markers and the natural horizon. Where such 
monuments did incorporate intentional astronomical alignments, they ex- 
pressed what was already known, and there was surely some greater pur- 
pose. At Newgrange the greater purpose is self-evident: the site was first and 
foremost a tomb, or (to use a form of words that better reflects its continual 
use over a considerable period) a shrine for offerings relating to the ances- 
tors. Either way, the solstitial alignment surely expresses some link that ex- 
isted in people’s minds between the sun, the seasonal cycle, and the ances- 
tors, although in itself it tells us nothing about the nature of that association. 

At some date, possibly many generations after its initial construction, 
the entrance was blocked off using a closing stone weighing about a ton. 
However, because the critical shaft of sunlight entered through the roof-box 
rather than the entrance itself, the solstice hierophany was unaffected. Some 
have argued that this was intentional: by using the roof-box device, the 
builders ensured that the sun would continue to enter the tomb even after it 
had been sealed off. And yet this interpretation brings its own problems: is 
it not somewhat surprising that the original builders had the intention—or 
at least planned for the possibility—that what was then a dominant practice 
would some day come to a sudden end? 

In Irish legend, Newgrange tends to be identified as Brug na Béinne 
(“the mansion of the Boyne”), and thereby as the abode of some of the old 
gods of Ireland, including one of their principal figures, the Dagda (or 
Daghdha). His cauldron, it is said, was the vault of the sky, and this has led 
some to propose that the solstitial orientation of the tomb could be a mani- 
festation of some long forgotten version of this legend. But the connections 
are too few and tenuous, and the timespan far too long between Neolithic 
times and even the earliest recorded legends in early Christian times, for much 
credulity to be attached to any suggestion of a direct continuity of tradition. 


What, then, might have been the significance of the alignment? Al- 


though we cannot draw direct parallels, modern indigenous practices can 
sometimes give us useful insights in our attempts to interpret practices in the 
past. Thus, for example, it was important to the Skidi Pawnee of the U.S. 
Midwest that the first rays of the morning sun should enter their traditional 
dwelling (“earth lodge”) to bring life-giving strength and power. Could a 
similar conviction explain why people in the past appear to have been so in- 
terested in sunlight entering dark places at special times? This seems evident 
at a variety of prehistoric tombs, of which the solstitial alignment at New- 
grange is merely the most famous. Many of these tombs reflect the structure 
of houses for the living in various ways, and it is not unreasonable to sup- 
pose that they were seen as houses for the dead, or for ancestral spirits. Did 
people believe that the light of the sun imparted strength and power to the 
ancestors, as it did to them? 

The example of Newgrange shows how even a simple, spectacular, and 
relatively uncontroversial astronomical alignment can give rise to many sub- 
tleties of interpretation when we try to explore the nature of its significance 
to people in the past.

Nissen, Heinrich (1839-191 2) 


Heinrich Nissen, professor of history at the University of Bonn, deserves 
more than anyone else to be recognized as the earliest pioneer of modern ar- 
chaeoastronomy. His interests ranged from the orientations of Egyptian and 
Greek temples—on which he published his first paper in 1885—to the ori- 


entations of churches, where he was responsible for demolishing the popu- 
lar myth that all churches faced (precisely) east. He was an almost exact con- 
temporary of Sir Norman Lockyer in England, but he anticipated Lockyer’s 
own measurements of Egyptian temples. Indeed, Lockyer was dismayed to 
discover the existence of Nissen’s published work after returning from his 
own first season in Egypt and, when putting forward his own ideas that the 
temples were aligned upon the rising and setting of the sun and stars, fully 
acknowledged that Nissen had anticipated him in suggesting the possibility. 

The fact that Nissen is rarely mentioned in accounts of the early devel- 
opment of ideas and methods in what subsequently became known as ar- 
chaeoastronomy, whereas Sir Norman Lockyer is generally considered the 
earliest serious pioneer in the subject, is explained by the fact that initial de- 
velopments in modern archaeoastronomy in the 1960s and 1970s primarily 
took place amongst English-speaking scholars. Nissen’s great work on the 
subject, the three-volume Orientation: Studien zur Geschichte der Religion, 
was published between 1906 and 1910 in German. The first volume ap- 
peared in the very same year as Lockyer’s seminal Stonehenge and Other 
British Stone Monuments Astronomically Considered.

Nuraghi 

Nuraghi are tall towers, remarkable because of their scale and the fact that 
they are built entirely of dry stone. Found on the Mediterranean island of 
Sardinia, they are also remarkable for having been built in extraordinary 
numbers. No fewer than seven thousand are known to have been con- 
structed, during the second millennium B.c.£., on an island measuring no 
more than about four hundred kilometers (250 miles) by two hundred kilo- 
meters (120 miles), They are characterized by a central chamber with a cor- 
belled roof, often of magnificent proportions. Several have a second cor- 
belled chamber built directly above the first, and a few have yet a third on 


top of that. An example of this last category is Santu Antine, situated some 
fifty kilometers from Alghero in the northwest of the island. Its lowest 
chamber rises to a height of just under eight meters (twenty-six feet), the 
next to over five meters (seventeen feet), and the highest was of compara- 
ble size but its roof has now collapsed. The remaining tower still stands to 
a height of over 17.5 meters (fifty-seven feet). The majority of the nuraghi 
were simple towers, but some were elaborated by the addition of a sur- 
rounding complex of walls, corridors, chambers, and smaller towers. Com- 
monly, these complex nuraghi—like Santu Antine itself—have a three-fold 
symmetry, the compound stretching out to rounded lobes at three corners 
of a roughly equilateral triangle; others have four or even five corners. 

The function of the nuraghi remains an archaeological puzzle. Astro- 
nomical associations have been suggested at a number of them, including 
solstitial alignments in both directions along two of the three outer walls at 
Santu Antine. Alignments between nuraghi may also have been important: 
local archaeoastronomer Mauro Zedda has identified a number of solstitial 
and also lunar alignments between nuraghi in the vicinity of the town of Isili 
in the center of the island. For example, from the now-ruinous nuraghe 
Nueddas, the tower of nuraghe Is Paras is prominent on the skyline in the 
direction of midsummer sunset, while that of nuraghe Longu marks mid- 
summer sunrise in a similar way. 

However, such alignments can arise by chance—especially considering 
the large numbers of nuraghi in the Sardinian landscape—and systematic 
studies are clearly needed. Recently such a study has been attempted. It con- 
centrated upon the orientation along the main axis toward the entrance and 
measured this direction at 450 nuraghi from all over the island. The study 
concluded that nuraghi are predominantly oriented southeastward and 
southward, a pattern that fits an “orientation signature” common among 
tombs and temples in western Europe, and in particular applies also to the 
tombi di giganti (“tombs of giants”), a type of megalithic tomb attributed to 
the same culture that built the nuraghi. Although this pattern corresponds to 
a general practice of orientations toward where the sun climbs in the sky, a 
strong preference for orientations close to azimuth 150 degrees may be bet- 
ter explained in relation to the rising of the Southern Cross. This suggestion 
appears to be supported by evidence of a gradual orientation change with 
time, which would have resulted if monument alignments had followed the 
inexorable southward movement of this asterism over the centuries that oc- 


curred as a result of precession.

Obliquity of the Ecliptic 

Obliquity of the ecliptic is not a term that trips easily off the tongue, nor is 
it an easy concept to grasp technically. Yet it is vitally important for any- 
one investigating possible architectural alignments upon the sun, moon, or 
planets to take account of the way the obliquity of the ecliptic changes over 
the centuries, just as it is necessary for investigations of possible stellar 
alignments to take account of precession. 

Each day, as the stars and sun move together around the rotating ce- 
lestial sphere, the sun moves by a small amount against the stars. Only af- 
ter a full year does it return to the same position, having traced out a path 
through the stars known as the ecliptic. The ecliptic is a circle, but it is in- 
clined at an angle to the daily paths of the stars, which move around on lines 
of constant “latitude,” or declination. In particular, if we focus on the ce- 
lestial equator because it is the one line of constant declination that is also 
a great circle (a circle of the largest possible size that can be drawn on a 
sphere, its center coinciding with the center of the sphere), then we find that 
the angle of inclination between the ecliptic (also a great circle) and the ce- 
lestial equator is between twenty-three and twenty-four degrees. It is this an- 
gle that is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. 

At a certain time of year, the sun reaches the northernmost point on the 
ecliptic. This is the June solstice, and its declination at this time is approxi- 
mately 23.5 degrees. Six months later, it reaches its southernmost point: this 
is the December solstice, and its declination now is approximately —23.5 de- 
grees. When the sun crosses the celestial equator, in the spring and autumn, 
its declination is 0. These times are known as the equinoxes. 

To understand what the obliquity is and hence to understand how it 
changes, it is best to switch to the astronomer’s perspective, looking in on 
the solar system. The earth, as it orbits annually around the sun, also spins 
daily about its own axis. If this axis were perpendicular to the plane of the 
earth’s orbit, then the sun would simply appear to us to move around the 
celestial equator. But it isn’t. The axis of spin (the earth’s polar axis) actu- 


ally leans over by about 23.5 degrees, and this is the reason that the ecliptic 
is inclined to the celestial equator by this amount; in other words, it is this 
leaning over that gives rise to the obliquity. 

Putting to the back of our minds for a moment that it is also orbiting 
around the sun, the earth in fact resembles a spinning top, in that it not only 
spins daily about its axis, but the axis itself gradually turns, going once 
round approximately every twenty-six thousand years. It is this turning that 
is known as precession. But a spinning top also wobbles; and so does the 
earth. The difference is that a top gradually spins down, so its “obliquity” 
gets greater and greater until the top falls over. The tip of the earth’s axis, on 
the other hand, oscillates slightly up and down. The obliquity in fact swings 
between about twenty-five degrees and about twenty-two degrees over a 
timescale of some forty-one thousand years. 

The last five thousand years represent a small segment of this cycle. 
During this time the obliquity has been gradually decreasing, from approxi- 
mately 24.0 degrees in 2500 B.c.E. to about 23.5 degrees in the present day. 
One practical effect of this is that the ranges over which the rising and set- 
ting position of the sun swings during the year were somewhat wider in, say, 
Neolithic times. In particular, the rising and setting positions of the sun at 
the solstices were about one degree (two solar diameters) further away from 
each other then than they are now. (The shift is actually in declination: at 
higher latitudes, where the rising and setting path is shallower, the shift in 
azimuth is greater than this.) This is important in assessing the astronomical 
significance of later prehistoric monuments such as Newgrange (Ireland) or 
Brainport Bay (Scotland). The rising and setting ranges of the moon and 
planets have contracted correspondingly over recent millennia, and it is im- 
portant for archaeoastronomers to take these changes into account. But for 
the moon and planets the effects of the changing obliquity are superimposed 
upon much more complex shorter-term variations. 

The longer-term cycle of change in the obliquity of the ecliptic be- 
comes important if it is proposed that much older (Palaeolithic) sites might 
have been solstitially aligned. An example of this is Parpalld, a cave in east- 
ern Spain that was occupied from about 19,000 B.c.£. to 8000 B.c.E. and 
into which the light of the sun would have penetrated after sunrise at the 
winter solstice. 

Another practical effect of the changing obliquity is that the Tropics of 
Cancer and Capricorn, and the Arctic and Antarctic circles, move gradually 
up and down on the earth. Apart from affecting the size of the tropics and 
polar regions, this movement might also have had a direct effect upon 
myths associated with, and ritual significance accorded to, places that were 
or had been on the tropic. A classic example of this is Necker Island in the 


Hawaiian chain. 


In summary, precession causes the rising and setting positions of the 
stars to change over the centuries, but it is the change in the obliquity of the 
ecliptic that affects the rising and setting positions of the sun, moon, and 
planets. Compared with the changes to stellar rising and setting positions 
due to precession, the changes in the rising and setting positions of the sun, 
moon, and planets due to the changing obliquity are not great, but they do 
become significant over a time scale of millennia.

Orientation 

Many different factors might have influenced the orientation of an ancient 
dwelling house, sacred building, or tomb. Some would have had clear prac- 
tical benefits. Thus anyone building a house in temperate regions of the 
northern hemisphere might well consider orienting its entrance southeast- 
ward so that the early rays of the sun enter the house and help warm it up 
in the mornings. Similarly, it would be beneficial to avoid having entrances 
facing into the prevailing wind. Tomb entrances might face downhill so that 
water would not run down into them and the interior stayed dry. The pos- 
sibilities seem almost endless. 

But studies of historical and indigenous peoples all over the world re- 
veal a huge variety of less tangible considerations, such as orienting a tem- 
ple upon a sacred mountain seen as the dwelling place of a god, or a tomb 
in the direction whence ancestors are believed to have come. This “intangi- 
ble” category includes a range of astronomical considerations, such as align- 
ing temples and tombs upon sunrise at one of the solstices or the rising point 
of a significant star or constellation. 

A common reason for choosing particular orientations has to do with 
cosmology—people’s understandings and beliefs concerning the nature of 
the world—and is motivated by a desire to keep human activity in harmony 
with the cosmos to ensure the continuity of life, good health, and so on. 
Thus one reason that the traditional earth lodges of the Pawnee face east is 


so that every time people enter their home, they do so in the same manner— 


the same direction—as the stars enter the sky. To a Western mind this might 
amount to little more than superstition, but such considerations are often 
bound up inextricably with others that we might consider more pragmatic. 
Thus, while some archaeologists argue that the majority of Iron-Age round- 
houses in Britain faced the rising sun for primarily cosmological reasons, 
there would also have been practical benefits in terms of warmth from the 
sun in the mornings and shelter from the prevailing wind. Indeed, to the 
minds of the time, the distinction we might make between pragmatism and 
religious or superstitious belief would not have been a meaningful one. All 
these different considerations served the common purpose of sustaining life. 

Interpreting the orientations of archaeological structures can be highly 
problematic, especially if we only have the material evidence to go on. 
Quite simply, everything must point somewhere. The mere fact that some- 
thing points at what we might consider a prominent topographic feature, or 
an important astronomical event, or anything else of apparent significance, 
does not mean that this was deliberate. One solution, where possible, is to 
seek groups of monuments or buildings that are culturally related and sim- 
ilar in form and structure (and hence, probably, purpose) and to look for 
common trends in their orientation. If a certain pattern emerges strongly 
enough, especially if we can obtain a suitable statistical verification, we can 
be reasonably confident that a certain set of orientations was deliberate. But 
even here there are a number of problems. For a start, we have to be care- 
ful about data selection. We delude ourselves, and invalidate any statistical 
results, if we include a sample of orientations that fit a desired pattern but 
exclude others that do not. Secondly, it is quite possible that more than one 
factor was important in determining an orientation, and that compromises 
may have been reached: consider a culture where the prevailing practice 
was to align a temple both upon a sacred mountain and upon the rising sun. 
Another problem is that only the most dominant and widespread common 
practices will be revealed in this way. People do not act like laws of physics: 
even when constrained by the strongest social traditions, people often do 
things in their own manner. According to a burial practice recorded among 
the Ashanti people of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, for example, the dead are 
buried facing away from the village. However, a small percentage of people 
believe that the dead turn themselves around in the grave, so they bury their 
dead in exactly the opposite direction, facing toward the village. This would 
create a tricky problem for an archaeologist of the future trying to make 
sense of the orientations of Ashanti graves. 

Despite all these difficulties, the approach of looking at groups of sim- 
ilar monuments has achieved some startling successes. Perhaps the best ex- 
ample of this is the orientations of later prehistoric tombs and temples in 


western Europe, no fewer than three thousand of which have been measured 


and analyzed by the British historian of astronomy Michael Hoskin. There 
are a multitude of local groups—distinctive types of stone monument built 
in different localities during some two millennia of prehistory—and in nearly 
every case the orientations are bunched, clearly intentionally, into a re- 
stricted range of directions forming a characteristic orientation signature. A 
variety of such orientation signatures is encountered. This shows that orien- 
tation was of near universal importance, although traditions and practices— 
just like other aspects of the design and construction of the monuments— 
varied considerably from place to place and time to time. 

Even where we do have demonstrably strong and consistent trends such 
as these, we cannot always be confident about the motivation. For example, 
three quarters of the Early Neolithic long barrows on Cranborne Chase in 
southern England face southeast. These might be interpreted as alignments 
upon midwinter sunrise until it is realized that their orientation is con- 
strained by the hill ridges along which the barrows are placed; these tend to 
run northwest-southeast as a result of the local geology. And even if we have 
few doubts about the intended target, we need to look beyond mere statis- 
tics—to the social context—in order to infer anything meaningful about 
their purpose and significance.

Orion 

Except insofar as their visibility and position in the sky is affected by lati- 
tude and local conditions, the patterns of bright stars are the same for all 
human cultures. However, what different people “see” in the sky can vary 
enormously from one cultural context to another. First there is the question 
of what people notice at all: it is not always the brightest objects. There are 


also significant differences in which stars people perceive as grouped to-

The constellations of Orion and Taurus, by James Thornhill (1725). (Stapleton Collection/Corbis) 


gether to form constellations, and how people interpret what they see varies 
widely. This said, certain configurations of bright stars are so eye-catching 
that they have assumed importance in a great range of human cultures. One 
of the most obvious is the trapezium of four bright stars with a short line 
of three at its center that we know as Orion. 

The shape of Orion lends itself very easily to being interpreted as a 
person wearing a tunic and belt, especially in temperate latitudes where the 
figure is seen upright. Its nightly motion across the sky encourages the idea 
the Orion figure is chasing, or being chased by, other characters. Our own 
image of the constellation as Orion the hunter derives from Greek tradition, 
but the idea of the Orion figure as a male in pursuit of a group of young 
women (the Pleiades) can also be found in legends as far afield as Aborigi- 
nal Australia. A variant is found in Vedic myth, where Orion is the creator 
figure Prajapati in pursuit of his daughter Rohini (Aldebaran). Orion’s belt 


is an arrow, shot at him from behind by an angered hunter (Sirius). In an- 


cient China the stars of Orion and Scorpius were two quarreling brothers 
who ended up on opposite sides of the sky. 

The calendrical importance of a constellation is often inseparable from 
the mythology and meaning that attaches to it. In Navajo tradition Orion 
was First Slim One, the keeper of the months, whose heliacal phenomena 
(along with those of certain other star groups) were used to keep track of 
the seasons. 

Not all cultures see Orion as a person. Close to the equator, where the 
constellation appears on its side, other interpretations are more common. 
On Kapingamarangi in the Caroline Islands (Federated States of Microne- 
sia), for example, it was seen as a canoe house with three men inside. In ru- 
ral Java, Indonesia, the belt plus three of the four outer stars—Rigel (B Ori), 
Bellatrix (y Ori), and Saiph (« Ori), but not Betelgeuse (o, Ori)—form the 
constellation of the plough, whose annual cycles of appearance and disap- 
pearance traditionally helped regulate the agricultural year. 

Not everyone groups the same set of stars that we see as Orion into a 
single constellation. The three stars of Orion’s belt—Mintaka (8 Ori), Al- 
nilam (e€ Ori), and Alnitak (¢ Ori)—form a prominent asterism in their own 
right: to the Tswana of South Africa, for example, they are three pigs, being 
chased by three dogs (a line of three fainter stars that we know as Orion’s 
sword). To the Lakota of the United States, the stars of Orion merely form 
the central part of a larger constellation, which includes the Hyades and Sir- 
ius: a large buffalo being born out of an even larger circle of stars. 

It is problematic to postulate stellar alignments at prehistoric sites 
where the date is uncertain, but plausible alignments upon the three stars of 
Orion’s belt have been recognized at a few. One of these is the Thornbor- 
ough group of henges in Yorkshire, England. It has also been suggested, both 
at Thornborough and more notoriously in the case of the three Pyramids of 
Giza, that sets of monuments on the ground actually form a spatial repre- 
sentation of these stars. Such arguments are a lot more problematic because 
of the total lack of any convincing evidence for any human society making 
constellation maps of this sort. At Giza, for example, the historical context 
and the local topography provide a far simpler explanation for the layout of 
the three pyramids. 

Orion is close to the celestial equator and hence visible at most times of 
the year from nearly everywhere on Earth. Yet it was not always so. On a 
time scale of centuries and millennia, the position of every constellation 
shifts as a result of precession. Orion may be close to the celestial equator 
now, but this is just about as far north on the celestial sphere as it ever 
reaches. For most of the next twenty-six thousand years, as for most of the 
last, it will be situated well to the south, prominently visible in the southern 


hemisphere but much less conspicuous in northern latitudes.

Palaeoscience 

Where might we hope to find the earliest signs of human enquiry into the 
causes of what we understand as natural phenomena, and what was their 
nature? Many different answers may be found in different parts of the 
world, and not only in the prehistoric past. But they emerged in the con- 
text of conceptual frameworks that bear little resemblance to the way that 
we classify things we perceive in the natural world according to the West- 
ern scientific tradition. Within these other frameworks—as in the develop- 
ment of our own—understanding was not sought as an end in itself but was 
inextricably bound up with ideology and religion, myth and ritual, politics 
and power, and what to us seem the more practical, everyday aspects of 
life—in short, with all aspects of sacred and mundane knowledge and prac- 
tice. Our own ideas about how people conceived of the world in times and 
places where no form of writing had developed, and where no historical ac- 
count is available, can only be formulated in the context of our knowledge 
and theories about human development and behavior in general, and can 
only be directly enlightened by what is left to us in the form of material re- 
mains. Our own interpretations can only be achieved through the filter of 
our own cultural background. 

The very earliest stages in the development of human thought remain 
obscure. Only a few have ventured to explore the development of cognition 
on an evolutionary time scale. Physically, the homan mind has changed lit- 
tle since the emergence of Homo sapiens sapiens between about 100,000 
and 50,000 B.c.£., although some scholars suggest that certain key develop- 
ments, such as the ability to communicate using language, had already taken 
place some two million years before. By combining ideas from evolutionary 
psychology and evidence from palaeolithic archaeology, archaeologist 
Steven Mithen has suggested that in the earlier stages of human evolution, 
human intelligence was compartmentalized into four separate specialist do- 
mains—technical, social, natural historical, and linguistic—and these only 
came together at the time of transition to the Upper Palaeolithic period, 


around 30,000 B.c.£. This is the time when fine cave-art depictions of ani- 
mals appeared in western Europe and when the first clear evidence emerges 
of decorative items being buried with the dead, although deliberate burial 
itself may date back at least to the Neanderthals of the Middle Palaeolithic, 
up to 100,000 years earlier. Though controversial, Mithen’s ideas draw at- 
tention to what is perhaps a key notion in the development of human 
thought: the way people come to terms with, and make sense of, themselves 
and their environment has much to do with drawing associations between 
different things that they perceive in the world around them. 

One challenge is to try to trace evidence for the development of certain 
fundamental concepts. This is not a trivial matter. No concept seems more 
abstract and inviolable than that of number, and yet the anthropologist 
Thomas Crump has identified three types of symbolic number, which he 
takes to represent three levels of conceptual evolution, and examined their 
use in different cultural contexts. This study begins to suggest orders of re- 
lationship between levels of numerical notation and other aspects of cogni- 
tion. Nevertheless, it may be inappropriate to try to trace the evolution of 
most human concepts in this way; they may simply be different in different 
worldviews. For example, Westerners have a concept of direction as some- 
thing precisely defined: two buildings aligned, respectively, due east and two 
degrees south of east would be said to point in slightly different directions. 
There is some evidence, on the other hand, that the four directions that are 
a common feature of indigenous worldviews in North and Central America 
were conceived rather more as (what we would see as) ranges of directions 
centered upon (what we would see as) the cardinal points. Wherever possi- 
ble, we must try to avoid assuming that concepts that seem fundamental to 
us are in fact universal and inevitable. 

Concepts of measurement have a special place in the development of 
thought. These can be recognized in various ways in the archaeological 
record. A classic example is a set of carefully manufactured cubical stones 
from the city of Mohenjodaro in the Indus valley civilization of c. 2000 
B.C.E. The masses of the stones are very close to exact multiples of a unit of 
0.836 grams. From this it can be deduced, among other things, that the peo- 
ple who made and used these stone weights possessed a concept equivalent 
to our notion of weight or mass, a concept of modular measure, a hierar- 
chical system of numeration based on units of four or sixteen, and a notion 
of equivalence. Measuring things is one aspect of trying to make sense of 
the world. But even this does not in itself tell us anything of how people ex- 
plained natural phenomena. Such explanations stem from correspondences 
that people perceive in the world. The mental process of scientific discov- 
ery involves bringing together phenomena and concepts that were not pre- 


viously seen as related. 


The Scottish engineer Alexander Thom suggested that a sophisticated 
“megalithic science” (although he never himself used this term) existed in 
later prehistoric Britain. Thom reasoned that “megalithic man,” as he styled 


him, had 


a solid background of technological knowledge. Here I am 
thinking not only of his knowledge of ceramics, textiles, tan- 
ning, carpentry, husbandry, metallurgy, and the like, but of 
his knowledge of levers, fulcrums, foundations, sheerlegs, 
slings, and ropes. . . . There was also his ability to use boats: 
he travelled freely as far as Shetland, crossing the wide 
stretch of open water north of Orkney, as well as the ex- 
ceedingly dangerous Pentland Firth and the North Channel 
between Kintyre and Ireland. This involved a knowledge of 
the tides and tidal currents that rule those waters. (Thom 
1971, pp. 9-10) 


With this in mind, Thom measured and analyzed the geometrical ground- 
plans and potential astronomical alignments at several hundred megalithic 
monuments (mostly settings of free-standing megaliths such as stone circles 
and stone rows) in northern and western Britain. One of his main conclu- 
sions was that high-precision observations were made of the sun, moon, 
and stars using features such as notches and hilltops on distant horizons as 
natural foresights against which minute changes in their rising and setting 
positions could be measured. There was a “megalithic calendar,” which di- 
vided the year into eight, or possibly sixteen, equal periods, epoch dates be- 
ing marked by precise solar alignments at various megalithic sites around 
the country. He also concluded that sites all over Britain were laid out us- 
ing a small number of precise geometrical constructions using a standard 
unit of length (the “megalithic yard”) accurate to about one millimeter. 

Thom’s theories have not stood the test of time. On the archaeological 
side, detailed reassessments have revealed a variety of subtle biases in the se- 
lection of data that have destroyed the statistical conclusions. Astronomical 
critiques have drawn attention to day-to-day changes in atmospheric refrac- 
tion and to the effects of extinction near the horizon. These have shown that 
programs of naked-eye observations of the precision envisaged by Thom 
could never have been successfully carried out. Similarly, statistical reap- 
praisals have shown that Thom’s ideas about precise megalithic mensuration 
and geometry cannot be supported on the evidence available. 

Observations and perceptions of astronomical phenomena do, 
nonetheless, frequently feature in symbolism associated with places of sig- 
nificance in the landscape or the design of monumental architecture. This is 
because human activities tend to reflect the perceived cosmos, of which the 
sky is viewed as an integral part. The alignment of numerous European pre- 


historic temples and tombs upon horizon astronomical events is probably 
best understood in this way. But such alignments are not the only manner in 
which ancient obsessions with the skies may show up in the material record. 
There is widespread evidence, for example, of the deliberate positioning and 
design of art and architecture to permit the interaction of sunlight and 
shadow at certain times, a famous example being the “sun dagger” at Fajada 
Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. 

It is tempting to speak of astronomy as the oldest science, but in doing 
so we may fail to recognize that attempting to make sense of what was per- 
ceived in the sky merely formed an integral part of human understanding of 
the natural world in an integrated way. The solstitial orientation of the pas- 
sage tomb at Newgrange, Ireland, expressed something about the perceived 
association between ancestors and the sun; it was not set up to measure or 
track the solar motions. Likewise, in designing their earth lodges the Skidi 
Pawnee of North America paid attention to details of light and shadow and 
used viewing stations for astronomical observations. However, we would be 
wrong to view the earth lodge as an observatory in the Western sense. It was, 
according to ethnoastronomer Von Del Chamberlain, “primarily a shelter to 
protect its builders from the intense solar heat, cold winter air, wind, rain, 
snow, and creatures that might molest them” (Chamberlain 1982, p. 166).

Pantheon 
This extraordinary temple, one of the main tourist sites of Rome, was com- 
pleted in the first half of the second century c.E. The building itself survives 


almost intact and is undoubtedly one of the architectural wonders of the 
world. Its enormous dome, more than forty-three meters (142 feet) in di- 
ameter, remained the largest in the world for thirteen centuries. It is made 
of solid concrete and is near-perfectly hemispherical on the inside (al- 
though, for practical reasons, it is thinner and less dense toward the top), 
and supported upon masonry walls more than six meters (twenty feet) 
thick. At its apex is a circular hole nine meters (twenty-nine feet) across, so 
that the visitor feels at once enclosed and yet exposed to the elements. 
Though now largely empty, the building was once richly and colorfully dec- 
orated. The ceiling of the dome was stuccoed, and stones of different colors 
(porphyry, marble, and granite) were used in the walls and floor. We can 
imagine the numerous recesses filled with statues of the gods. 

Although more recently consecrated as a Catholic church, the temple 
was originally dedicated to the sun and stars. An intriguing question is the 
extent to which religious and astronomical symbolism was reflected in the 
architecture. Proportionality evidently mattered, in that the height is pre- 
cisely the same as the width; in other words, if one were to imagine the dome 
being extended into a complete sphere it would just touch the ground in the 
middle. A more controversial matter is whether sun-and-shadow effects were 
deliberately incorporated. It is certainly true that as the sun moves through 
the sky at different times of the year and day, natural light entering through 
the apex creates eye-catching patterns on the walls and floor. To what extent 
particular effects were intentional and orchestrated to occur at significant 
times remains largely a matter of speculation.

Pawnee Cosmology 

The Pawnee are one of the best-known native American groups in the U.S, 
Midwest. Before the spread of Europeans into the area, they inhabited what 
was to become northern Kansas and southern Nebraska. The Skidi (or 
Skiri), one of four Pawnee bands, received particular attention from ethno- 


graphers in the early twentieth century, which provided a strong basis for 


more recent studies of many different aspects of traditional Pawnee lifestyle, 
including myths and rituals relating to the sky. 

The Skidi Pawnee creation myth tells of how Tirawahat (or Tirawa), 
creator of all things, instructed various sky gods, including the Sun, the 
Moon, Bright Star (Evening Star), Great Star (Morning Star), and Star-that- 
does-not-move (Polaris). The four World Quarter Stars were charged with 
holding up the heavens and were given the power to create people. Sun pur- 
sued Moon to produce the first boy; Great Star pursued Bright Star to pro- 
duce the first girl. The gods in the heavens provided people with materials 
for tools, weapons, and clothing, and also with precious objects that they 
would need to create sacred bundles. Different star gods created different 
groups of people with complementary knowledge and different sacred bun- 
dles. By coming together and keeping their lives in tune with the patterns es- 
tablished by the gods in the heavens, and in particular by undertaking the 
appropriate ceremonies associated with each of the bundles at the right 
times, the Skidi people as a whole were able to live in harmony with them- 
selves and with the cosmos for many generations. 

The traditional cosmology, or worldview, of the Skidi Pawnee is based 
upon a rich set of associations that are perceived to exist between people, the 
earth, and the sky, intricately woven together to form a complex framework 
of understanding. Thus each of the four World Quarter Stars occupied one 
of the intercardinal directions and was associated with a color, one of the 
four seasons of nature, one of the four seasons of life, a meteorological phe- 
nomenon, an animal, a type of wood, and a type of corn. The various ethno- 
graphic accounts differ slightly in some of the finer details, but we can say 
with reasonable confidence that Yellow Star occupied the northwest, con- 
trolled the setting sun, and was associated with the spring, childhood, light- 
ning, the mountain lion, willow, and yellow corn. Likewise Red Star occu- 
pied the southeast and was associated with summer, youth, cloud, the wolf, 
box elder, and red corn. Big Black Star occupied the northeast and was as- 
sociated with autumn, adulthood, thunder, the bear, elm, and black corn. Fi- 
nally, White Star occupied the southwest and was associated with winter, old 
age, wind, the wildcat, cottonwood, and white corn. Black Star (male) and 
White Star (female) were mates, as were Red Star (male) and Yellow Star (fe- 
male). Red Star controlled the coming of day, while Black Star controlled the 
coming of night. White Star stood by the Moon. Black Star was the patron 
of knowledge. The associations seem endless. (The question of whether the 
World Quarter Stars represented actual stars, and if so, which, has been in- 
vestigated extensively but remains unresolved.) 

The Skidi view of the world was reinforced by story and by observa- 
tions of nature itself. For example, the Sun continually chased the Moon 


across the sky, regularly (once every month) catching up and causing her to 


disappear. It was also continually enacted in activities and ceremonies that 
ensured harmony with the cosmos. As an outsider might see it, the Skidi 
Pawnee based their lives around observations of the heavens. However, it 
would be a more accurate representation of the complete picture to say that 
the pattern of their lives reflected the structure of the cosmos in many dif- 
ferent ways, both in space and time. 

This is particularly evident in the layout of individual dwellings, often 
known as earth lodges. They are round because the world is round; the floor 
represents the earth and the ceiling the sky. The lodge entrance faces east, to- 
ward Morning Star, so that people can enter the lodge in the same way as 
the stars enter the sky; the altar is located in the western part, the domain of 
Evening Star, to symbolize creation and renewal. The roof is held up by four 
main posts that represent the World Quarter Stars. They are placed in the in- 
tercardinal directions and each is painted with the appropriate color. These 
reflect the four quarters of the world, and symbolize the connection between 
the earth and the sky. 

The structure of the cosmos was not only reflected in individual 
dwellings; the whole landscape reflected the arrangement of the sky gods. 
Four villages were particularly associated with the World Quarter Stars and 
were situated in appropriate intercardinal directions in the landscape. Each 
possessed sacred bundles bestowed by the World Quarter Star in question and 
led ceremonials at certain times of year. These ceremonies, in turn, were re- 
lated to seasonal activities such as planting, harvesting, and buffalo hunting. 

The Skidi Pawnee provide an excellent example of why, and how, hu- 
man communities strive to keep their lives in tune with the cosmos as they 
perceive it.

Pawnee Earth Lodge 

The traditional dwelling of the Pawnee, often referred to as an earth lodge, 
symbolized the cosmos in many ways: in the materials used, the techniques 
of construction, in its orientation, and in the spatial configuration of activ- 
ities taking place there. The lodges of one of the four Pawnee bands, the 


Skidi Pawnee, have been studied in particular detail. They faced eastwards, 


with altars in the west. Their four main supporting posts represented the 
World Quarter Stars, each placed in the appropriate intercardinal direction, 
thus reflecting the four quarters of the world and symbolizing the connec- 
tion between the earth and the sky. At the top of the lodge, directly over the 
hearth, was a smoke-hole, which was said to reflect the shape of the Coun- 
cil of Chiefs, a group of stars corresponding to our constellation Corona 
Borealis. In short, the earth lodge was a model of the world—a micro- 
cosm—in which people, in carrying out their daily lives within their homes, 
also lived at one with, and within, the cosmos as a whole. 

The lodge also functioned as a place for observing the heavens. The 
first rays of the morning sun, passing in through the entrance, imparted life- 
giving strength and power. During the day, and depending upon the season 
of the year, sunlight slanted down through the roof hole and passed around 
the lodge, touching objects and people, bringing light and warmth. It is also 
recorded that Skidi priests used the smoke hole to observe stars passing over- 
head, in order to schedule ceremonies. In this sense, the lodge had a prag- 
matic function for calendrical observations: it truly was an observatory. 

This juxtaposition of the practical and the symbolic may come as a 
surprise. It also has implications for some of the questions that have been 
asked in the past about the significance and meaning of prehistoric remains, 
and about whether astronomical alignments at prehistoric monuments in 
Britain represented science or symbolism. Earth lodges clearly combined el- 
ements of both.

Pawnee Star Chart 


In 1906, the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago acquired an oval- 
shaped piece of thin leather measuring fifty-six by thirty-eight centimeters 
(twenty-two by fifteen inches) with lace holes around the edge. One side is 
covered with several hundred four-pointed stars of various sizes, painted in 
irregular patterns, with a band of smaller dots running across the middle 
(on the narrower axis). Several configurations of larger crosses stand out as 


possible bright stars or constellations, and the band of dots could be inter- 


preted as the Milky Way. That this was a representation of the sky seems 
beyond question. 

Early attempts to identify particular stars on the star chart tended to start 
from the assumption that it was a literal map of the night sky. Larger crosses 
were thought to represent brighter stars and positions were assumed to be 
marked with considerable accuracy. Yet even though some groups of stars such 
as the constellations Ursa Major and Corona Borealis, and the Pleiades, are 
certainly recognizable, it quickly becomes clear that their shapes, positions, 
and relative sizes are approximate at best. Most of the smaller stars seem to be 
just a backdrop, not representing any stars or groups of stars in particular. 

It is a mistake to take an indigenous artifact out of context and to judge 
it by our own standards of precision. Before anything else we should ask 
what its purpose was. Fortunately, cultural data do exist in this case: ethno- 
graphic notes associated with the chart indicate it was part of a medicine 
bundle used in various ceremonies that ensured well-being. It was used, in 
other words, to harness the sacred power of the stars. 

Examples such as this expose the dangers of imposing our own criteria 
when trying to interpret an astronomical artifact from another culture. We 
might seek a literal representation of the configurations of the stars and be 
impressed if it achieved a high degree of accuracy, but in doing so we are be- 
ing ethnocentric: imposing our own predilections on another culture. Accu- 
racy in this literal sense might matter to us, but we cannot expect that it mat- 
tered to them. These dangers are especially great where we do not have a 
cultural context, as in the case of the prehistoric Nebra disc. A similar lesson 
can also be extended to those who try to find literal representations of con- 
stellations in the positions of monuments on the ground.

Pilgrimage 
The term pilgrimage tends to be applied to journeys in search of spiritual 


fulfillment made in historical and modern times, particularly in the context 


of global faiths such as Christianity and Islam. However, the idea of mysti- 
cal journeys that are undertaken exceptionally—trepresenting a complete 
break from familiar places and/or practices—may well be more widely ap- 
plicable to peoples in the past, and even in prehistory. Of course, such an 
experience can be totally individual and personal, but it is very often moti- 
vated by the perceived need to be in a particular place to undertake one or 
more specific acts of idolatry, and very often at a particular time. If similar 
ideological perceptions are widely shared, then mass pilgrimages can easily 
result. Small-scale, and even individual, acts of reverence in the past could 
have resulted in the placing of votive offerings that are discoverable by ar- 
chaeologists—a possible example is the “formal” deposits found in the 
ditch and postholes of the early earth and timber circle at Stonehenge in 
England; however, mass pilgrimages seem most likely to be archaeologically 
visible. How do we recognize potential places of pilgrimage? And how do 
we proceed to address the questions of who came to them, from where, 
when, and why? 

Answering even the first of these questions is a task that is far from 
straightforward. It seems clear that for a place to become the focus for pil- 
grimage, it must be exceptional in people’s minds. This idea is fine as far as 
it goes, but a place could have been seen as exceptional for a whole variety 
of reasons that could apply equally well to distinctive natural places or to 
human constructions on any scale. Just because a place was large and im- 
portant enough to have attracted mass gatherings does not mean that we 
would necessarily wish to describe it as a pilgrimage center—consider trad- 
ing centers on market day; nor does a place need to be remote or to attract 
participants from great distances in order to qualify (a good example is the 
peak sanctuaries of Minoan Crete). Nonetheless, evidence of religious or rit- 
ualistic activity and participation from afar are key indicators for the ar- 
chaeologist, and a place of pilgrimage may be more obvious archaeologically 
if these pilgrims from afar deposited “foreign” artifacts that can be convinc- 
ingly interpreted as cult objects or votive offerings. 

Another characteristic aspect of pilgrimage is the journey itself. The act 
of making a pilgrimage can be as important as the place finally reached, and 
the idea of pilgrimages in the distant past may be supported by the existence 
of “formalized” routes of approach or by sets of shrines strung out along 
routes through the landscape. A possible example of the former is the enig- 
matic Cursus Monuments of Neolithic Britain, whose low earthen ditches 
and banks could have prescribed movement at special times or for special 
purposes without constraining it at other times, given (as seems likely) that 
they were easily walked across. Elsewhere, and later, stone and timber av- 
enues may have served a similar purpose. Such arguments are more con- 


vincing when the formal route in question leads directly to an obvious can- 


didate for a pilgrimage center, as did the three-kilometer-long avenue that led 
up to Stonehenge in the late second millennium B.c.£. Far away in space and 
time, the impracticality for normal purposes of many of the roads and track- 
ways converging upon Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, around the eleventh 
century C.E. implies that their function was largely symbolic and adds 
strength to arguments that Chaco was a huge pilgrimage center, its Great 
Houses full to capacity only at certain times. Likewise, the ceremonial com- 
plex of Cahuachi in the valley south of the Nasca pampa in Peru has been 
interpreted as a focus for pilgrimage, and it is possible that some of the fa- 
mous geoglyphs—long straight lines running across the arid pampas sur- 
rounding the site—could have been ritualistic paths of approach. 

One of the most important aspects of many pilgrimages is timing. 
Many places acquire particular significance and are seen as charged with 
particular sacred power at certain times. Astronomical phenomena such as 
sunrise alignments and shadow hierophanies are often of key importance in 
this context—witness the modern crowds eager to view the equinox hiero- 
phany at Kukulcan in Mexico, midsummer sunrise at Stonehenge, or mid- 
winter sunrise at Newgrange in Ireland. (These examples also demonstrate 
that such practices do not necessarily bear any relation to the actual original 
intention of the builders—as opposed to the perceived or assumed inten- 
tion—something that may well have also been true in the past when people 
ascribed sacred significance to even older monuments.) If such phenomena 
inspired mass pilgrimages, then an interesting question arises: how did peo- 
ple from afar know when to set out? 

A possible answer is that they observed the stars. The heliacal rising or 
setting of a prominent star or asterism can, for example, provide a sure way 
of determining the time of year to within a few days, even if there are peri- 
ods of bad weather. If the astronomical event in question occurred suffi- 
ciently far ahead of the sacred ceremony (which might itself have been trig- 
gered by an astronomical event), then each pilgrim would have sufficient 
time to prepare for and make the journey. For example, the Delphic oracle 
in ancient Greece was originally only available for consultation on one day 
in the year. It has been suggested that the trigger, both for the oracle itself 
and for pilgrims to set out, was the first pre-dawn appearance of the con- 
stellation Delphinus. At Delphi itself, however, the heliacal rise of Delphinus 
was considerably delayed owing to the high eastern horizon, giving pilgrims 
time to arrive there. 

The Thornborough henges in northern England demonstrate how var- 
ious strands of evidence can be brought together to make a plausible argu- 
ment for a prehistoric site being a pilgrimage center. These include a con- 
centration of non-local flints that suggest a mass influx of people from a 


considerable distance, and repeated alignments upon the rising position of 


Orion’s belt and Sirius (which reflect their changing position over many cen- 
turies), suggesting that ceremonial activity here might have been directly re- 
lated to these two prominent objects in the sky. It makes sense that a major 
ceremony would have been held in the early autumn, when the harvest was 
completed but before the onset of cold weather. The heliacal rising of Orion’s 
belt and Sirius took place some three weeks apart in the late summer and 
early autumn. The first appearance of Orion’s belt could have provided the 
sign for pilgrims to set out on their journey, while the subsequent appearance 
of Sirius provided the signal for the festivities to begin. 

Although the term pilgrimage is broad and in some ways ill-defined, the 
past is undoubtedly full of instances where large numbers of people—often 
coming from large distances—converged on sacred places at particular 
times. Where this happened, watching the skies would have provided an easy 
and reliable way for pilgrims to judge when to commence their journeys. Pil- 
grimages of this type, even in prehistory, may be detectable by carefully com- 
bining evidence from archaeology and archaeoastronomy.

Polynesian and Micronesian Astronomy 


The ancient Oceanic peoples populated a vast area of the earth, successfully 


colonizing a diverse range of island environments prior to European con- 
tact. Astronomy was a major factor in their ocean navigation. Directional 
stars were used to guide navigators to familiar and not-too-distant islands. 
On land, directional stones or even stone canoes were set up so that 
would-be voyagers could sight along them and learn the appearance of the 
stars in the required direction of travel. For longer journeys, one of the 
most important prerequisites was acquiring a knowledge of the rising and 
setting positions of various stars around the horizon, the so-called star 
compass. This, combined with various techniques for dead reckoning, al- 
lowed navigators to estimate their current position in relation to the island 
they had left or to the one they were trying to reach. There is also patchy 
evidence for the use of a variety of other techniques, such as the use of 
zenith stars passing directly overhead to estimate the current latitude, and 
even (in the Hawaiian islands) the use of gourds as instructional aides or 
navigational devices. 

But objects and events in the skies were also important to ancient 
Oceanic peoples in a variety of other ways. They certainly had an extensive 
knowledge of astronomy: ethnographers in the nineteenth and early twenti- 
eth centuries recorded a great many names for stars, planets, nebulae (such 
as the Magellanic Clouds), areas of the Milky Way, and so on—things actu- 
ally visible in the sky—as well as for purely conceptual constructs related to 
the motions of the heavenly bodies. As an example of the latter, the Hawai- 
ians had names for what we might call the celestial tropics—the most 
northerly and southerly paths followed by the sun around the sky at the 
times of the June and December solstices, respectively. The northern tropic 
they termed “the black shining road of Kane” and the southern one “the 
black shining road of Kanaloa,” Kane and Kanaloa being two principal cre- 
ator-gods. The same or similar names for certain celestial objects (with di- 
alectic variants) can often be found right across the linguistically homoge- 
nous area of Polynesia and even farther afield, which indicates considerable 
antiquity. For example, the Pleiades were known in Hawai‘i as Makali‘, in 
Samoa as Li‘, in Tonga as Mataliki, in Tahiti as Matari‘i, and by the Maoris 
of New Zealand as Matariki. To the west of Polynesia they were known, for 
example, within Vanuatu (Melanesia) as Matalike and in Pohnpei (Microne- 
sia) as Makeriker. 

Stars and constellations were frequently associated with gods, culture 
heroes, or living chiefs, as well as featuring in stories of ocean voyaging and 
of ancient homelands. A form of genealogical prayer chant common in Poly- 
nesia served to place those of the highest rank in a cosmic scheme of things 
that includes everything in the sky as well as on earth. A famous example of 
this is the Hawaiian Kumulipo. 


Another way in which astronomy permeated the lives of Oceanic peo- 


ples was through the calendar, which had a common form all over Polyne- 
sia and Micronesia. It consisted of an annual cycle of months based on the 
lunar phases, with a named sequence of days (or rather, nights) in each 
month. Many of the same or similar month or day names occur over a wide 
area, indicating considerable antiquity, and in certain places there is clear 
evidence that months shared their names with stars or constellations used 
to identify them. Yet some of the variants from region to region were ma- 
jor, such as when in the solar year a given month actually occurred. There 
were also significant, though generally more minor, local variations (for ex- 
ample from one Hawaiian island to another, or between different Maori 
groups in New Zealand). Systems of prognostications and observances as- 
sociated with the calendar seem to have grown to their most complex on 
those groups of islands where powerful social hierarchies developed. The 
Hawaiian calendar at the time of European contact, for example, involved 
an elaborate system of cycles of ritual observances and taboos tied both to 
the time of the year and the time of the month. 

Traditional astronomical practices in Oceania have left their mark in 
the material record in a number of ways. The purposes of some of the 
more recent artifacts, such as sighting stones, can be verified using 
recorded oral history or ethnography. Clues to older, pre-contact practices 
within Polynesia may be encapsulated in the temple enclosures and plat- 
forms that were ubiquitous throughout this region. These do not manifest 
any systematic astronomical alignments on a large scale, but a few are 
known from oral history to have been used for sighting the sun or stars. 
Occasionally we find firmer archaeological evidence of deliberate orienta- 
tion, such as a group of temple enclosures (/eiau) on the Hawaiian island 
of Maui that are aligned upon the rising position of the Pleiades, appar- 
ently for reasons associated with the calendar and worship of Lono, a 
prominent god of agriculture. 

Although a number of claims have been made that Oceanic peoples de- 
termined the solstices and equinoxes to high precision, most of these stem 
from a desire (witting or otherwise) to impose Western aspirations and do 
not fit the evidence. However, ethnography confirms that the inhabitants of 
one Polynesian island, Mangareva, did indeed mark the solstices to consid- 
erable precision by erecting pairs of stones as horizon foresights. 

In the Hawaiian islands there is a particularly rich heritage of oral lit- 
erature in the form of creation myths, stories, and chants. Some were 
recorded by early missionaries or published in the Hawaiian language in lo- 
cal newspapers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The small 
proportion that have been translated and republished contain numerous 
references to the sun, moon, stars, and planets. Some chants clearly describe 


places in the landscape and appear to provide explicit descriptions of as- 


tronomical alignments. An example is the so-called “Na Pali chant” from 
the islands of Ni‘ihau and Kaua‘i. 

Throughout Oceania, astronomical knowledge was sacred knowledge, 
much of it the exclusive preserve of navigators and priests. This fact, added 
to all the other processes of change that have occurred since European con- 
tact, means that only a few fragments have been preserved of what was with- 
out doubt an enormously rich and far-reaching knowledge of astronomy. 
Sky knowledge was nonetheless framed within worldviews that governed all 
aspects of existence and were woven into everyday life in a variety of ways. 
In the Gilbert Islands, for example, conceptual divisions of the sky (the “roof 
of voyaging”) were based upon the structure of actual house roofs. If we are 
trying to understand more about that worldview, then it is misleading to di- 
vide Oceanic astronomical knowledge using such categories as pragmatic 
and ritualistic, or useful and conceptual. These are divisions that only have 
meaning from a Western perspective. To ancient Polynesian and Micronesian 
peoples, all their sky knowledge was useful, all vital within their framework 
of understanding the cosmos and how it functioned.

Polynesian Temple Platforms and Enclosures 
Undoubtedly the best known and most conspicuous material remains of 
Polynesian culture are the temple platforms and enclosures, variously 
known as marae in much of central Polynesia (the Marquesas, the Society 
Islands) and Aotearoa (New Zealand), abu in the Tuamotus and remote 
Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and heiau in the Hawaiian Islands (where the 
term ahu refers just to the altar). The abu of Easter Island, with their fa- 
mous statues, or moai, are undoubtedly the best known, but many hun- 
dreds of these temple platforms and enclosures are found throughout Poly- 
nesia, and very many more existed in the past. 

The temple platform or enclosure was a sacred place constructed, used, 
and maintained by a particular family or social group, or for people of a cer- 
tain social rank. In the Society Islands, for example, there existed maraes 
serving individual households; the inhabitants of a district; people in the 
same kinship group; those in particular occupations such as healers, canoe 
builders, and fishermen; and the high chiefs or ari‘ nui. Temple sites were 
used for a variety of purposes. Thus in Hawai‘i, the large and elaborate Ju- 
akini heiau, which were the exclusive preserve of high chiefs, might be used 
for investitures or religious rites including sacrifices, while at the other end 
of the scale, modest ko‘a were built by commoners as simple fishing shrines. 
There existed war heiau, medicinal heiau, navigational heiau, agricultural 
heiau, and a host more, all dedicated to the appropriate gods. 

Why a given temple site was located in a particular place or constructed 
in a particular way is generally lost to us, but there is every reason to sup- 
pose that a strict set of sacred protocols had to be followed, as can still re- 
main true today. It is possible, for example, that an extraordinary concen- 
tration of temple platforms on the tiny and remote Hawaiian outlier of 
Necker Island may be due to the location of this isolated rocky outcrop pre- 
cisely on the Tropic of Cancer. It has been suggested that many of the tem- 
ple sites were astronomically oriented, as was, for exmple, the inland abu 
Huri a Urenga on Easter Island. However, attempts to identify overall pat- 
terns have met with little success. On many islands, Rapa Nui being a par- 
ticularly clear example, it is evident that the predominant trend is simply to 


orient temple sites with respect to the coast, either reflecting a general rela-

tionship with the sea or the constraints of the local topography. This has 
caused some archaeologists to conclude that astronomy played no part at all 
in determining temple orientations. 

The truth undoubtedly lies between these two extremes. The fact that 
there are no obvious systematic astronomical associations is hardly surpris- 
ing, given the widely ranging functions and purposes of the different types of 
temple site. Even where they were important, astronomical considerations are 
likely to have been just one of a range of factors affecting temple location and 
design, and were not necessarily reflected in the orientation. Some surviving 
snippets of oral history do indicate an interest in the annual progress of the 
rising sun up and down the eastern horizon (one of the few observation points 
mentioned explicitly is Cape Kumukahi in the Big Island of Hawai‘i), but this 
account does not point to a direct connection with any heiau. 

Accounts do exist of temple platforms being used for sun observations 
in Hawai‘i, and of the use of artificial horizon foresights in Mangareva, an 
island in French Polynesia. But no accounts mention platforms being actu- 
ally aligned upon the sun. In one case, a surviving sacred ula chant appears 
to describe a solstitial alignment from a heiau on the Hawaiian island of 
Kaua‘i stretching along the high cliffs of the Na Pali coastline of the island. 


But even here, there is no suggestion that the alignment is directly reflected

in the orientation of the platform itself. Similarly, certain navigational heiau 
are said to have been associated with voyaging stars, without suggesting that 
they were oriented upon them. All this complicates efforts to tie together ar- 
chaeoastronomical field data with relevant fragments of oral tradition, but 
does not make it impossible, as the following example shows. 

Kahikinui is a remote area on the leeward side of the Hawaiian island 
of Maui, on the southern slopes of the volcano Haleakala. Recent survey 
work here has revealed an unusually well preserved pre-conquest landscape 
including households, cultivation areas, and almost thirty beiau, mostly of a 
distinctive notched enclosure design, which all date to a similar period 
around C.E. 1600. It is very unusual to find so many heiau in such a restricted 
area and within such a well-defined archaeological context. This enables us 
both to spot consistent orientation patterns that are likely to have been in- 
tentional and meaningful and to suggest plausible interpretations related to 
our broader knowledge of the cultural context. The structure, location, and 
orientation of the Kahikinui beiau suggest that they may be divisible into 
four categories, each of which relates to one of the four main gods in the 
Hawaiian pantheon. One set face north, one east, and one relate to the sea. 
The last tend to overlook plantation areas and may relate to Lono, the god 


associated with dryland agriculture. Their orientations are consistently 


around twenty degrees north of east, which strongly suggests a particular ce- 
lestial target—the horizon rising position of the Pleiades. This asterism is 
known to have been of particular significance in the Hawaiian agricultural 
and ritual calendar, because its heliacal and acronical rise marked the begin- 
ning of the two halves of the Hawaiian year. On the northern side of Maui, 
on the isolated peninsula of Kalaupapa, is another hbeiau incorporating a 
similar alignment. It is found on a promontory whose traditional name— 
Makali‘i—means Pleaides in Hawaiian. 

The example of the Kahikinui heiau serves to illustrate how little we 
would know (and generally do know in other parts of Polynesia) about the 
meaning of temple orientations but for being able to combine alignment ev- 
idence from a well-defined group of sites with oral history.

Power 

In many human societies of the past, knowledge and beliefs relating to the 
sky served to reinforce the political status quo. In some cases, the power of 
the ruler was directly linked to the sky or to sky gods in the form of celes- 
tial objects. Thus Old Kingdom Egyptian pharaohs’ power depended upon 
sun worship, as did that of the ruling elite of the Inca empire and that of 
Roman emperors at the time when Mithraism held sway. Chinese emperors, 
on the other hand, established their place at the head of the political order 
by analogy to the north celestial pole—the hub of the turning sky—and un- 
derpinned this by aligning the buildings of the Imperial Palace (Forbidden 
City) along the meridian. The layout of the greatest medieval Hindu city, 


Vijayanagara, together with its position in the landscape in relation to sa- 


cred hills, helped to establish the place of its kings within the cosmic order. 
Similarly, the sarsen monument at Stonehenge, undoubtedly a potent sym- 
bol of the power of the chiefs who controlled it, incorporated a solstitial 
alignment that, by linking the monument to the workings of the cosmos, 
may have contributed to its symbolic power every bit as much as the exotic 
stones and the scale of its construction. 

Considerable social prestige and political power could accrue to anyone 
who was seen as able to control or influence phenomena that could not be 
controlled by anyone else. For this reason, an astronomer-priest might hold 
the solstice ceremony around the time that the sun set in a particular horizon 
notch so that he could demonstrate the power of “turning it around.” Align- 
ments that “worked” only at special times—the appearance of the midsum- 
mer full moon low over the recumbent stone of a Scottish recumbent stone 
circle, for example, or the sudden entry of sunlight into places that were nor- 
mally dark, such as the cave below the zenith tube at Xochicalco in Mexico— 
would have been highly impressive and could have been used to help justify 
the power and prestige of the priest in command. Such apparent control ulti- 
mately relies, of course, on the regularity of astronomical phenomena—reli- 
able cycles that are tied to other, observable events in the natural world. 

Where a priest or shaman professed the ability to predict phenomena 
such as eclipses or the appearance of comets, the results (as we know) would 
be a lot more unreliable. Indeed, unexpected events would undermine their 
authority and could even cause social and political instability. Certainly they 
were commonly taken as bad omens. In c.E. 549, an unexpected lunar 
eclipse led two Teutonic armies to flee the scene of battle and thus postponed 
the Roman occupation of the Carpathian basin by two years. The appear- 
ance of Halley’s Comet in the spring of 1066 portended disaster for King 
Harold at the battle of Hastings. And a spectacular meteor seen in the Aztec 
capital of Tenochtitlan around 1515 caused great fear among the people. 
The Spanish conquest followed just a few years later. 

Observations of the regular cycles of the skies had a clear practical 
value within a wide variety of human societies in the past by helping to keep 
subsistence activities in step with the seasonal cycles of nature. However, as 
often as not—and especially within larger political units with strong and 
powerful social hierarchies—they also played a significant role in perpetuat- 
ing the power of the ruling elites.

Precession 

Technically, precession is quite a difficult concept, but it is an important one 
for anyone wishing to study perceptions of the skies in the past. Precession 
has the effect of shifting the overall positions of the stars in the sky over a 
time scale of centuries, and (from any given place) can make some stars dis- 
appear completely from view while others become visible for the first time 
(in thousands of years). For example, when prehistoric farmers first colo- 
nized the area of southern England where they would eventually build 
Stonehenge, the Southern Cross was prominently visible in the night sky at 
certain times of year. However, it has not been visible from this latitude for 
over 5,000 years. Taking account of precession is critically important for 
anyone investigating possible architectural alignments upon stars. But it 
also enters into archaeoastronomy in a different way, in that some have 
claimed that the effects of precession are described and documented in 
myths that have been perpetuated over many centuries. 

In order to explain precession, it is best to adopt the astronomer’s per- 
spective, looking in on the solar system. 

As it progresses on its annual orbit around the sun, the earth also spins 
once daily around its own axis. This axis maintains the same orientation in 
space, so there is one point in the earth’s orbit where its north pole leans di- 
rectly toward the sun while the south pole leans directly away from it. When 
the earth is at this point in its orbit, for people in the northern hemisphere, 
the sun is seen following its highest daily path through the sky, while for peo- 
ple in the southern hemisphere its path is the lowest. This is one of the sol- 
stices: the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere and the winter solstice 
in the southern. In the modern (Gregorian) calendar this solstice falls on or 
very close to June 21. The opposite point in the earth’s orbit, when the north 
pole is leaning directly away from the sun and the south pole toward it, is 
the December solstice. A quarter of the way around the earth’s orbit, 
halfway between the solstices, are the two equinoxes, where the axis joining 
the two poles leans neither toward nor away from the sun. 

The earth’s axis maintains a fixed direction with respect to the stars. 
This is because the stars are so staggeringly far away compared with the di- 
mensions of the solar system that the earth’s motion around the sun makes 


no difference. If the sun were scaled down to the size of a beach ball, then 


the earth would be the size of a ball bearing about thirty meters (a hundred 
feet) away from it, and the farthest planet, Pluto, would orbit the sun at a 
distance of a little over one kilometer (a little under a mile). On this scale, 
the distance of the nearest star from the sun would be about the distance of 
London from New York, with some of the other visible stars considerably 
farther away still. Having established these vast distance scales, it is concep- 
tually far easier to pretend that the solar system is surrounded by an enor- 
mous sphere with all the stars attached to it. This means that the earth’s axis, 
extended out through the north pole, is always pointing at a fixed position 
on the celestial sphere: this is called the north celestial pole. Similarly, the 
axis extended out through the south pole is always pointing to the south ce- 
lestial pole. 

Over a time scale of centuries, the direction of the earth’s axis in space 
(and with respect to the distant stars) does change. This is because the earth 
not only spins about its axis, but the axis itself gradually turns in a way that 
resembles a spinning top. One effect of this is that the position in the earth’s 
orbit where we find (say) the north pole tilted toward the sun is now differ- 
ent: in fact, it has “precessed” around the earth’s orbit. So have the positions 
corresponding to the other solstice and to both the equinoxes. This is the 
reason that the term precession is used to describe this phenomenon: it is in 
fact short for precession of the equinoxes. 

From the point of view of someone watching the skies from the surface 
of the earth, precession makes it seem that the celestial poles gradually 
change position. In fact, each of them traces out a wide circle on the celes- 
tial sphere, completing one circuit every 25,800 years. Occasionally during 
this period, one of the poles will come close to a bright star, making it easy 
to identify the pole; this is the case with Polaris at the present time, but it is 
more often not so. 

The principal effect of precession is that the declination of every star in 
the sky changes over the centuries. One consequence of this is that the hori- 
zon rising and setting positions of any particular star as viewed from any 
particular place on earth will generally change significantly over a period of 
a few centuries (although how significant this effect is depends upon the pre- 
cision of the alignment being considered). This means that there is a nasty 
trap waiting to ensnare the modern investigator looking for possible astro- 
nomical alignments—at least, stellar alignments—at prehistoric monuments 
such as stone circles. The danger is this: these monuments are rarely datable 
to within a few centuries (and very often the range of possible dates is far 
wider than that). If we notice that a particular structure is aligned upon a 
horizon point fairly close to the rising or setting position of some bright star 
in the past, then we may well be able to find a date within the permissible 


range that fits the alignment perfectly. While there may be exceptions (such 


as the prehistoric sanctuary at Son Mas in Mallorca), this sort of astro- 
nomical dating generally proves nothing because of the ease by which such 
alignments can arise fortuitously. To give an idea, suppose we take the fif- 
teen brightest stars in the sky and a date range of five hundred years. Then 
by choosing an appropriate combination of star and date we can cover 
about a third of the horizon. In other words, if an alien giant were to come 
along and scatter fake prehistoric aligned structures randomly over the 
landscape, it would be possible to choose a star and a date within the per- 
mitted range that would fit one in three of them. The problem is further 
confounded by atmospheric extinction. What all this means is that the as- 
piring archaeoastronomer must pay particular attention to problems of 
methodology. Two case studies that illustrate the dangers particularly well 
are the stone row at Ballochroy in Scotland and the stone configuration at 
Namoratung’a in Kenya.

Precision and Accuracy 

These two terms, which mean similar things in common usage, have distinct 
meanings to archaeologists and others who undertake surveys as part of 
their fieldwork techniques. Suppose that we use a magnetic compass to 
measure the azimuth of a prominent mountain peak on the horizon. The 
compass, we find, is graduated in degrees but it is possible to estimate the 
angle to the nearest half-degree. When we take the same reading three or 
four times we get readings consistent to the nearest half-degree. Half a de- 
gree, then, is the precision of our compass reading. 

Accuracy, on the other hand, refers to how close that reading is to the 
truth. We may have forgotten to take into account the fact that compasses 
point to magnetic north rather than true north. There may also be a local 
magnetic anomaly. As a result, it may be that the reading we obtain is actu- 
ally four degrees higher than the true value. The accuracy of our reading, 
then, is only four degrees. Great precision is no guarantee of great accuracy. 

Overprecision can be very misleading. If we use a theodolite with an 
electronic distance measurement (EDM) capability to measure the distance 


between, say, the center of a stone circle and an outlier, then we will be able 


to read off the result to the nearest millimeter. However, standing stones are 
generally large and irregular in shape and may have shifted somewhat dur- 
ing the millennia since their original construction. The circle may not be ex- 
actly circular and its center may be ill-defined. To measure, precise to one 
millimeter, the distance between two points which are themselves arbitrary 
to within several centimeters or more is completely pointless. Worse, it can 
be misleading: there is a danger that such “falsely accurate” measurements 
will be used subsequently, say, in calculations that explore the possible exis- 
tence of a precise unit of measurement. 

Finally, we may also speak of the precision with which prehistoric peo- 
ple set up an astronomical alignment. Thus it could be that a group of peo- 
ple in Bronze Age Britain constructed a row of standing stones aligned upon 
the solstitial sunrise to a precision of about half a degree (thirty arc minutes); 
that a team of surveyors in 1999 measured the alignment to an accuracy of 
a few arc minutes; and that the results were published in 2001 quoting dec- 
linations to a precision of one arc minute.

Prehistoric Tombs and Temples in Europe 
Scattered through western Europe from Scandinavia and Scotland down to 
the Mediterranean (and extending into North Africa) are a staggering vari- 
ety of later prehistoric monuments that still remain conspicuous in today’s 
landscape. Built in some areas as far back as the fourth millennium B.c.£. 
and even earlier, and in some places only a few centuries before the coming 
of the Roman empire, many hundreds of great constructions in stone have 
stood the test of time remarkably well. More modest examples, however, 
tend to be little known, and many remain under serious threat. Some were 
tombs, some undoubtedly functioned as temples where sacred rites took 
place, and some—like the great alignments of hundreds of standing stones 
at Carnac in Brittany, northwest France—seem to defy explanation. Within 
this broad custom of constructing monumental architecture were a wealth 
of local traditions, resulting in groups of monuments as diverse as the re- 
cumbent stone circles of eastern Scotland, Irish wedge tombs, Causse-type 
dolmens of south-central France, Portuguese antas, Sardinian nuraghi, 
Menorcan taulas, and many more. 


Orientation is a basic and relatively uncontroversial aspect of most of 


The Dolmen del Coll de Medas I near to Cantallops in Cataluna, northern Spain, close to the French border. From its 
location in the Pyrenean foothills it commands a stunning view to the south, In this region, eastern and western prac- 
tices of tomb orientation were commingled. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


these monuments, in that they have an axis of symmetry and face in some 
direction. The study of the orientations of these monuments, and in particu- 
lar of their possible astronomical associations, has been extensive in Britain, 
Ireland, and Brittany. Indeed Britain was the birthplace of modern ar- 
chaeoastronomy, which has resulted in a great deal of attention being lav- 
ished on sites such as Stonehenge. Yet, surprising as it seems, there was little 
or no interest in—let alone large-scale investigations of—monumental ori- 
entations in the remainder of western Europe until a systematic survey was 
undertaken by the British historian of astronomy Michael Hoskin during the 
1990s. Hoskin measured and documented the orientations of over three 
thousand later prehistoric tombs and temples in Portugal, Spain, southern 
France, and the islands of the western Mediterranean. Within this consider- 
able area and time span one can identify numerous local traditions resulting 
in characteristic types of monument broadly consistent in their design and 
methods of construction. Some occur in large numbers, like the Sardinian 


tombi di giganti (“tombs of giants”), of which over 250 remain; others con- 


sist of only a handful of extant examples, such as the dolmenic hypogea of 
the Fontvieille region of southern France, of which there are only four. 

The remarkable fact that emerges is that nearly every local group has a 
discernible orientation signature, as characteristic as the architectural design 
of the tomb or temple itself. The vast majority of the three thousand monu- 
ments faces broadly toward the east, southeast, or south. Some local groups 
cover the whole range from northeast to south, while others fall exclusively 
within a much narrower span. A few groups of monuments, on the other 
hand, face predominantly westerly or southwesterly. South-facing groups are 
rare and north-facing monuments are virtually unheard-of, there being only 
two examples in the whole set. This shows beyond any doubt that, through- 
out a significant area of the world and through three or more millennia of 
prehistory, the orientation of a monument was of almost universal impor- 
tance—as important, evidently, as the materials used or the techniques of 
construction. At the same time, it is clear that dominant practices with re- 
gard to orientation varied from place to place and time to time just as much 
as those relating to design and construction. The orientation data give us 
some clues about how certain practices may have propagated from one re- 
gion to another. West-facing tombs, for example, are rare in the Iberian 
peninsula and western and central France, but predominate in the Mediter- 
ranean coastal region of France. It seems likely that this practice developed 
in Provence or Languedoc, where it prevailed, spreading both east toward 
Italy and southwest toward Spain, but then (in both cases) became increas- 
ingly mixed with rival traditions. 

It is much trickier to identify the targets that determined a set of orien- 
tations, let alone their meaning and significance to the people who built and 
used the monuments. However, one thing is clear: even the most modest lo- 
cal groups of similar monuments are scattered through a sufficiently large 
area, and placed in a sufficient variety of landscape situations, to rule out 
any suggestion that the determinant was topographic, or even that the ori- 
entations were due to factors such as the prevailing wind. We are forced to 
conclude that reference must have been made to the north-south line defined 
by the diurnal motion of the heavens. This demonstrates, at least at the most 
basic level, that reference was made to the skies. 

How reliably particular targets, astronomical or otherwise, can be 
identified for particular groups is debatable. One of the clearest cases is that 
of the seven-stone antas (dolmens) of central Portugal, where the orienta- 
tions of all 177 examples measured fall within the sunrise arc on the east- 
ern horizon. A common orientation signature stretches from northeast 
round to due south, and Hoskin suggests that the motivation here was to 
orient monuments either in the direction of sunrise or of the sun climbing 


in the sky. Similarly, some of the westward-oriented groups correspond to 


the range of directions of sunset and/or sun descending in the sky. An ex- 
ceptional group of monuments are the taulas of Menorca, whose orienta- 
tions fall in a range centered upon the south. It is dangerous to try to fit stel- 
lar alignments in such a case, since there are many bright stars, and their 
positions shift significantly over the centuries, owing to precession. How- 
ever, there is quite strong independent evidence to support the argument 
that the taulas were associated with particular stars, most notably the 
Southern Cross and Pointers. 

Later prehistoric tombs and temples farther north, in Britain and Ire- 
land, have been much more intensively studied. In some cases, more specific 
astronomical associations have been identified: for example, the Scottish re- 
cumbent stone circles appear to be related to the midsummer full moon. 
However, taking a broader European view it is clear that their general ori- 
entation signatures are very similar to those found elsewhere in western Eu- 
rope. This implies that more detailed investigation of the monuments in con- 
tinental Europe may have a great deal more to tell us.

Presa de la Mula 

In northeast Mexico, beyond the northern frontiers of the great Mesoamer- 
ican civilizations, hunter-gatherer groups still roamed at the time of the 
Spanish conquest, as they had done for more than ten thousand years. By 
the end of the eighteenth century they had been annihilated, but several 
hundred of their rock art sites are known in this region. The dating is gen- 
erally uncertain within wide bounds, but many are clustered in certain lo- 
cations, usually where there are wide views of the surrounding landscape, 
horizon, and sky. These petroglyphs contain numerous depictions of ani- 
mals and weapons but also, intriguingly, abstract designs consisting of short 
lines organized in rectangular arrays, and groups of dots organized in sets 
of parallel rows or columns, crosses, concentric circles, and meandering 


lines. Anthropologist Breen Murray has examined the numerical character- 


istics of these designs in an attempt to identify patterns of numerical order 
that might give some insight into their meaning. 

The vertical face of a rock at Presa de la Mula, near Monterrey, contains 
one of the most extensive arrays of lines. This petroglyph, which measures 
some three meters (ten feet) across by one meter (three feet) high, contains 
207 short vertical lines organized in a grid pattern with six rows and four 
columns, which divides them into twenty-four cells. Reading horizontally 
from left to right, and from the top row downwards, it is possible to discern 
sequences of 29, 27, 29, 28, 27, 7, 30, and 28 days. Each of the larger se- 
quences is subdivided into subsequences such as 11+11+4+3 and 7+8+7+6. 

Murray suggests that the lines are “tally marks” that reckon the days 
in relation to the phases of the moon. The number 207 corresponds exactly 
to the number of days in seven synodic (lunar-phase-cycle) months, and there 
are seven subtotals of between twenty-seven and thirty days. The fact that 
these are generally shorter than the true length of the synodic month (29.5 
days) could be attributed to the vagaries of observing the moon (especially 
the thin crescent before and after new moon), and the additional seven days 
after the fifth month could be a correction, required to bring the “calendar” 
back into line at this point. The fact that this cell of seven days is marked by 
two otherwise unexplained arrow-shaped lines backs up this speculation. 
The whole design, then, appears to be a record of actual day-by-day obser- 
vations of the phases of the moon lasting over half a year. Perhaps they had 
a seasonal camp near here, and after this period they moved on. 

This interpretation has been arrived at by post hoc reasoning. Reading 
the count from left to right gives the best fit to a lunar interpretation, so that 
is what is suggested. A skeptic might argue that the various cells could be con- 
joined in different ways, or read in a different sequence, and to some extent 
this is undeniable. However, the interpretation is inherently plausible and is 
backed up by the presence of circles that seem to mark the completion of the 
months. Furthermore, the number 207 occurs in at least one nearby petro- 
glyph—an array of dots found forty kilometers away at a site called Boca de 
Potrerillos. Finally, the total numbers of dots in several smaller dot counts on 
other petroglyphs in the area seem to have possible lunar significance.

Pyramids of Giza 


The three Pyramids of Giza, to the west of Cairo, were built by three 
despotic pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty, in the twenty-seventh to the 
twenty-fifth centuries B.c.E.: Khufu (Cheops), Khafre (Chephren), and 
Menkaure (Mykerinos). Khufu’s pyramid, most likely constructed in c. 
2528 B.C.E., was an extraordinary feat of engineering (and of labor organi- 
zation), built using over two million blocks of limestone, each weighing 
some fifteen tons and rising to an incredible height of over 145 meters (480 
feet). Khafre’s was only slightly smaller, while Menkaure’s, at sixty-seven 
meters (220 feet), was modest by comparison. Each was actually part of a 
funerary complex serving not only as the king’s tomb but also as a place of 
continuing ritual. Khafre’s complex included the famous Sphinx. 

The sides of each of the Giza pyramids were carefully aligned upon the 
cardinal directions (north-south or east-west). This alignment followed es- 
tablished practice, but the accuracy with which it was achieved at Giza is 
truly impressive, particularly in the case of Khufu’s pyramid. Each of its sides 
is cardinally aligned to within six arc minutes, or one tenth of a degree. This 
is equivalent to no more than one fifth of the apparent diameter of the sun 
or moon. The other pyramids are only slightly less well aligned: Khafre’s to 
within about eight arc minutes and Menkaure’s to within sixteen. 

Why this careful alignment? The broader Old Kingdom practice of car- 
dinal orientation of tombs and temples almost certainly had to do with pre- 
serving the perceived cosmic order. Thus the northerly direction, where the 
imperishable (circumpolar) stars resided, was the resting place of the im- 
mortal. The westerly part of the horizon, where the sun set each night, was 
the entrance to the Duat, the otherworld, which had to be traversed on the 
path to immortality. But why was it important to be so accurate? Here we 
are reduced to speculation. Perhaps the north celestial pole, the one fixed 
place in the heavens, was seen as the very resting place of the immortal soul, 
and the successful path of the pharaoh’s soul to immortality could be en- 
sured only if the pyramid faced this spot exactly. 

What is certain is that great accuracy was achieved, and many different 
theories have been put forward to explain how. One of the most plausible 
answers is that this was done by direct reference to the celestial north pole. 
But there is a problem with this explanation. It is only by chance that we 
have, at the present time, a bright star close to the pole. In Old Kingdom 
times the closest star to the pole was Thuban in the constellation Draco, 
While it had been almost exactly at the pole just after 2800 B.c.E., by 2500 
B.C.E. it was 1.7 degrees, or three and a half moon-diameters, away (Polaris 
is less than half that distance from the pole today). On the other hand, there 
were a number of bright stars circling the pole then, as now. By carefully ob- 
serving these night after night, it would have become obvious that certain 


The Pyramids of Giza, near Cairo, Egypt. (Corel Corp) 


pairs were (more or less) on opposite sides of the pole, or in line on the same 
side. Suppose that the architect set up some form of vertical plumb line de- 
vice to determine accurately when one of the chosen pair of stars was di- 
rectly above the other. The direction of the stars when this happened would 
be close to due north. Even then, it is not possible to explain the extraordi- 
nary accuracy of the Khufu pyramid except as a result of good fortune, but 
if the same two stars were used in successive generations we can explain why 
the other two pyramids are not quite so accurate. After a few decades, pre- 
cession would have moved them slightly farther out of line. 

Celestial observations may well have had a greater part to play in the 
construction of the pyramids than merely determining their orientation. The 
Khufu pyramid contains various chambers and passages, but also two small 
shafts running directly from the walls of the King’s Chamber deep in the in- 
terior up to openings on the outside of the pyramid, one on the north side 
and one on the south. Each shaft runs horizontally for a short distance at 
both ends, but their main parts rise perfectly straight and at a steep angle, 
the north one inclining at thirty-one degrees and the south one at forty-four 
degrees. To archaeologists, the obvious explanation for a long time was that 
they were for ventilation, although it seemed strange that they were not sym- 


metrical. Then, in the 1960s, it was discovered that the northern shaft was 


aligned upon the star Thuban at the time of construction, and the southern 
upon one of the stars of Orion’s belt. They were clearly not for observation, 
but we do not need to put these stellar alignments down to chance. The 
pharaoh needed to visit these stars in the afterlife; this is clear from the pyra- 
mid texts found in later Old Kingdom pyramids. It is likely that these align- 
ments were quite deliberate and that the shafts’ purpose was to symbolize, 
or perhaps to facilitate, his passage. 

In the 1990s, the Pyramids of Giza attracted astronomical speculations 
of a different sort, following from an observation by writer Robert Bauval 
that the layout of the three pyramids on the ground appeared to mimic the 
formation of the three stars of Orion’s belt in the sky. Bauval, and later Gra- 
ham Hancock, elaborated on this in a number of bestselling books. The rep- 
resentation of Orion’s belt, they argued, was part of a larger “sky map” on 
the ground, which included the Milky Way, represented by the river Nile it- 
self. Unfortunately, the map was wrongly oriented in the third millennium 
B.C.E.: it would only fit correctly in the middle of the eleventh millennium 
B.C.E. This much older date, argued Bauval and Hancock, was the true date 
reflected in the design. 

These ideas attracted a great deal of publicity in the 1990s, along with 
a torrent of criticism from Egyptologists, astronomers, and archaeoas- 
tronomers alike. The main problem is that there are more than seventy pyr- 
amids altogether in Egypt, and the selection of those claimed to be part of 
the star map is arbitrary. (The same problem is evident at the Holy City of 
Angkor in Cambodia, where a similar theory was proposed.) Another prob- 
lem is that over a time scale of millennia, the course of the Nile is variable. 
But the main problem is the 10,500 B.c.£. date: it flies in the face of all the 
archaeological evidence—it is completely fanciful. One can only conclude 
that the resemblance to Orion’s belt is fortuitous. The configuration of the 
three pyramids is perfectly well explained by the need of successive pharaohs 
to locate a pyramid with a clear view to the north in the same general area, 
given the constraints of the local topography. 

The Giza pyramids illustrate two very different ways in which an at- 
tempt can be made to use astronomical alignments for archaeological dating. 
The first procedure presupposes a technique for fixing the pyramids’ orien- 
tation that is plausible enough, given our knowledge of Egyptian construc- 
tion techniques and instrumentation in later periods. Each candidate pair of 
circumpolar stars that could possibly have been used to fix the pyramids’ 
orientation would have produced particular errors at particular dates. Ex- 
amining the different possibilities may help archaeologists resolve outstand- 
ing questions concerning the precise dates of construction of these pyramids 
and of the reigns of the pharaohs concerned. This is in complete contrast to 


the second procedure, which rests upon a set of unsupported speculations 


and produces conclusions that are at complete odds with all the archaeolog- 


ical evidence.

Quipu 

Unlike the city-states of Mesoamerica, the great Inca empire of South 
America produced no written records of which we are aware. However, in- 
formation was encoded in mysterious knotted string devices known as 
quipu, or kbipu. Many hundreds of examples are known, held in museums 
in Peru and all over the world, and new ones are still being uncovered. In 
1996, thirty-two quipu were discovered in a remote region of northern 
Peru, in burial chambers built into a rock overhang surrounded by thick 
forest, close to a lake known as Lake of the Condors. At first the quipu ap- 
peared to have been mechanisms for recording fairly mundane numerical 
data, but there is reason to believe that at least some of them contained a 
more permanent record of sacred information relating, for example, to the 
calendar or astronomy. More intriguingly still, some of them were appar- 
ently read as texts by storytellers, so they seem to have conveyed histories 
and myths. 

Quipu generally comprise a number (in some cases, as many as several 
hundred) of pendant strings attached to a single primary string. Sometimes 
some of the pendant strings have further strings (subsidiaries) hanging off 
them, and there are other minor variations, but overall the consistency in 
form is remarkable. Quipu can be bundled up, or held or laid out to display 
the various strings, which can be of many and various yarn types and col- 
ors. On the strings are knots. These normally contain up to nine turns, and 
it is generally accepted that they encode digits from one to nine. Further- 
more, in the majority of guipu the knots on each string are carefully 
arranged in a way that suggests that they represent a number of two or more 
digits—in other words, a number expressed in a base-ten counting system 
the same as our own. (The Mesoamericans, in contrast, used a base-twenty 
counting system.) The lack of a knot in a significant place is used to signify 
the digit zero. 

In addition to the numerical data contained in the knots, the guipu 
have the potential to convey information in a variety of ways, for instance 


in the spatial configurations of strings, the type of yarn used in each partic- 
ular string, its color, its direction of twist, and so on. Unfortunately, we 
know next to nothing about how information was encoded and must try to 
reconstruct this from scratch. On the other hand, ethnohistory and archae- 
ology do tell us something of the context in which some of the quipu were 
used. Accounts by early Spanish chroniclers, such as Felipe Guaman Poma 
de Ayala, attest to their use as tallying devices by local officials, perhaps 
recording the payment of tributes, or census information. Archaeologically, 
the fact that some quipu are found, like those already mentioned, among 
grave goods—evidently part of the personal paraphernalia of ordinary indi- 
viduals—suggests that they were of significance to the individual or to their 
immediate household or local social group (ayllu). It is certainly plausible, 
then, that they contained a more permanent record of things of (local) cul- 
tural and historical relevance. Finally, and perhaps most intriguingly, we 
know that some of the native storytellers who recounted histories, chiefly ge- 
nealogies and myths to the early chroniclers, did so by “reading from,” or at 
least by interpreting in some way, certain guipu. 

A few of the better-known quipu have been studied for many years. But 
recently new large-scale and comparative analyses have become possible, 
thanks to an extensive database being compiled at Harvard University by 
Gary Urton and his colleagues. This work has revealed, for example, com- 
mon sequences of numbers on different quipu, implying perhaps that local 
tallies were copied by regional officials, further up the Inca hierarchical 
chain, and incorporated into summaries covering wider areas. 

Some quipu appear to contain calendrical information. One of the 
largest of the thirty-two found at Lake of the Condors, known simply as 
“UR6,” has 762 pendant strings, 730 of which are systematically organized 
into twenty-four sets, each containing twenty-nine, thirty, or thirty-one 
strings. An obvious interpretation is that each set represents a synodic 
month, that is, a month defined by the phase cycle of the moon, and that 
the whole represents a period of two years. However, this does not neces- 
sarily mean that the purpose of the quipu was to represent calendrical in- 
formation. The strings themselves contain knots representing numbers. The 
obvious conclusion is that guipu UR6 contained information (as yet un- 
known in nature) organized calendrically. If this is true, it shows that while 
no quipu may in itself have been a calendar, we can nonetheless retrieve in- 
formation about calendars in everyday use within the Inca empire from cer- 
tain quipu indirectly. 

To judge from a sample of over 350 quipu studied recently by Urton, 
the knot information on about a third of all guipu does not resolve obviously 
into base-ten numbers. An intriguing possibility is that these quipu (or at 


least some of them) may have been “narrative” guipu, somehow providing 


information from which a practiced interpreter could have generated, or re- 
constructed, a story or account. We may never know the particulars of the 
information encapsulated in this way on certain quipu, or the nature of the 
process by which narratives were extracted. And yet some of the first tenta- 
tive steps in identifying some of the non-numerical information contained on 
quipu may now have been taken. A few numbers much larger than the rest 
appear on quipu UR6, but only in sequences of three together. The sugges- 
tion is that these were not actually number triples as such but ayllu labels or 
identifiers, tags that identified the ayllu to which associated numerical infor- 
mation referred. If this interpretation is correct, then we have made our first 
identification, and tentative interpretation, of non-numerical information 
contained on a quipu. 

Beyond the fact that they recorded tallies and used a base-ten number- 
ing system, interpretations of the purpose of the guipu and the nature of the 
information contained in them have, until recently, remained largely specu- 
lative. This is now changing, thanks to painstaking analyses of the numeri- 
cal data combined with new archaeological evidence. The process of decod- 
ing these idiosyncratic recording devices may just have begun.

Recumbent Stone Circles 

A recumbent stone circle (RSC) is a distinctive type of stone circle contain- 
ing one stone placed on its side. RSCs occur in just two regional groupings 
at opposite corners of the British Isles: one is in the Grampian region of 
northeastern Scotland around the modern city of Aberdeen, and the other 
in the southwestern corner of Ireland, in Counties Cork and Kerry. In both 
cases, the recumbent stone is generally found on the southwestern side of 
the circle. In the Scottish circles it is large and set between two tall uprights, 
known as flankers, that are normally the tallest stones in the circle. The 
heights of other stones tend to taper away as one goes round the circle, so 
that the smallest are found on the opposite, or northeastern, side. In the 
Irish circles, on the other hand, the tapering works in the other direction; 
the recumbent stone is small and placed in isolation, and the tallest stones 
are normally a pair called portals on the opposite northeastern side. 

The clear similarity and obvious systematic difference between these 
two groups, together with the fact that they are separated from each other 
by sea and several hundred kilometers, have generated a long debate about 
the degree of relationship between them. It seems highly unlikely that such 
a similar idea could have developed independently in the two places. But 
was there necessarily direct communication between these two areas? Or 
was the idea carried by a single influential person or group of people, traders 
or emigrants, from one place to the other? Although some archaeologists, 
such as the British stone circle specialist Aubrey Burl, refer to both groups 
as RSCs, others, such as the Irish archaeologist Sean O Nualldin, prefer to 
avoid implying such a close relationship and refer to the Irish group as ax- 
ial stone circles. 

As a group, the Scottish recumbent stone circles present us with some 
of the clearest evidence from Neolithic or Bronze Age Britain or Ireland that 
the builders of a particular group of stone monuments carefully configured 
them in relation to a particular astronomical body or event. In this case the 
astronomical body concerned is not the sun, but the moon,

Scotland. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


The RSCs are confined to a small geographical area, about a hundred 
kilometers (sixty miles) by sixty kilometers (forty miles), and the archaeo- 
logical evidence, such as it is, suggests that they were constructed within a 
period of no more than a few centuries, probably in the later part of the third 
millennium B.c.E. However, it is their configuration that is of primary inter- 
est to archaeoastronomers. Their orientation is remarkably consistent. Over 
fifty RSCs are sufficiently well preserved for us to be able to determine the 
orientation, and there is a clear candidate for the principal orientation at 
each site: the axis of the circle through the recumbent stone. With not a sin- 
gle exception, the recumbent stone is placed within the quarter of the circle 
centered upon south-southwest, that is, between west-southwest and south- 
southeast. Some have argued that this orientation may simply reflect a rela- 
tionship with the local topography or the prevailing wind, but this idea does 
not stand up to closer scrutiny: the topography of the area is varied and the 
patterns of wind flow are diffused around irregular hills and winding valleys. 
In fact, the reverse is true: the consistency in orientation that has been 
achieved over wide area despite the varied topography makes it clear that the 
sky was used in determining the orientation. At the very least, the builders 
must have determined the orientation in relation to the diurnal motion of the 


celestial bodies that defines the north-south axis. 


But there is more to it. As viewed from within the circle, the recumbent 
stone and flankers frame a part of the horizon, so it is a natural supposition 
that this direction might be the one of significance (though most analyses 
have also checked the opposite direction). There is always at least a reason- 
ably distant view beyond the recumbent, and quite often the stretch of hori- 
zon framed by the recumbent and flankers contains a conspicuous hill. This 
strongly suggests that it was important to stand inside the circle looking out- 
wards toward the horizon. When one examines the declination ranges of the 
horizons, then the goal of such observations seems to be revealed: they seem 
to relate to the motions of the moon. Put simply, the full moon would pass 
low over the recumbent stone around midsummer each year. 

It is tempting to imagine these monuments being used for ceremonies 
or rituals that took place by the light of the moon on a midsummer evening, 
when the moon was seen to reach its correct configuration with respect to 
the circle. Some archaeological evidence backs this up. Scatters of white 
stone and particularly quartz, which are perceived in some human commu- 
nities as reflecting or encapsulating the light of the moon, have been found 
around the base of the recumbent stone at one excavated site, Berrybrae. At 
another recently excavated RSC, Tomnaverie, the recumbent stone itself con- 
tains more quartz than the other stones; at two others, Auchmallidie and 
North Strone, the recumbent stone is itself one huge block of quartz. 

The other feature that reinforces the idea that the people who built and 
used these circles were interested in the moon is cup marks. There are few 
cup-marked stones at RSCs; cup marks occur only on the recumbent stone 
or flankers, or in one case only on the adjacent circle stone. They are never 
found in other parts of the circle. Remarkably, the orientations of these cup 
marks from the center correspond quite closely to specific rising and setting 
points of the moon, namely the most southerly limits, known as the major 
and minor standstill limits. 

However, the image of people dancing by moonlight in a recumbent 
stone circle on a midsummer night may be a misleading one. Excavations un- 
dertaken by the British archaeologist Richard Bradley in 1999-2001 show 
that at least four RSCs were put up around an already existing feature, such 
as a funerary pyre or platform. They also reveal quartz scatters at different 
positions in the circle. Although there is also some evidence that the eventual 
addition of a stone circle was anticipated from the outset, it may be that we 
are seeing structures transformed from other materials, such as wood, into 
stone. This possibility does not detract from the importance of the lunar 
alignment, but it does alter how it can be interpreted. On the one hand, it re- 
minds us that people must have identified a sacred place and perhaps used it 
for a variety of ritualistic purposes in order to make the necessary preliminary 


observations that enabled them to get the astronomical alignment right when 


it was set into stone. But it is also possible that the erection of the stones may 
have closed off rather than initiated a period of use, so that the alignment, 
once set up, was not used by people at all—or at least not by living people. 

The Scottish recumbent stone circles are important to archaeoas- 
tronomers because they provide evidence of a consistent trend of astronom- 
ical orientation, one so strong that it is unthinkable that it could have arisen 
by chance. On the other hand, we will never know as much as we would like 
about why such alignments were set up or how (or even if!) they were sub- 
sequently used. The recent excavations show how, by looking more closely 
at stratigraphic, dating, and artifactual evidence, we can begin to gain a 
firmer idea of how particular monuments developed and what people did 
there at different times. We need this knowledge in order to put our tenta- 
tive interpretations of symbolic relationships that we find encapsulated in 
monuments such as the RSCs into a more reliable context. 

By comparing different groups of monuments we can also attempt to 
explore where cognitive principles, such as the interest in the moon that is so 
clearly manifested at the RSCs, first originated and where and how they 
were propagated. For example, evidence of lunar-related orientation can be 
found at the Clava cairns of Invernessshire to the northwest of the RSC area 
and also at many of the short stone rows found more widely in western Scot- 
land and western Ireland. On present evidence, it seems that the concern 
with the moon that we see at the RSCs emerged in Britain and Ireland late 
in the Neolithic period and continued well on into the Bronze Age (from the 
late third until the mid or late second millennium B.c.£.). This contrasts with 
the solar orientation of certain monuments such as cursus monuments 
(Dorset Cursus, for example), passage tombs such as Maes Howe and New- 
grange, and stone circles such as the group in Cumbria. Such practices ex- 
tend back to some of the earliest farmers in Britain and Ireland in the fourth 
millennium B.C.E.

Refraction 
Atmospheric refraction, the bending of light downwards as it passes 


through the atmosphere, causes astronomical bodies to appear higher in the 


sky than they actually are. At high altitudes the effect is slight, but close to 
low horizons—when light rays have to travel through more of the earth’s 
atmosphere to reach the observer—the apparent altitude can be as much as 
half a degree above the actual altitude. Certainly if something appears at the 
horizon, it is actually below it. 

When we are calculating the declination of a celestial body following a 
field survey, it is necessary to take refraction into account. Because of the ex- 
tremely high precision of the sightlines he was postulating, Alexander Thom 
went to pains to estimate atmospheric conditions at the time of supposed ob- 
servations in order to calculate the appropriate refraction correction. How- 
ever, as astronomers Bradley Schaefer and William Liller have since pointed 
out, day-to-day changes in atmospheric conditions effectively rule out sight- 
lines precise to just a few arc minutes. For most purposes, a mean refraction 
correction (related only to the horizon altitude concerned) will suffice.

Roman Astronomy and Astrology 

Unlike the temples in ancient Greece, Roman temples are not obviously 
consistent in their orientation. Nor did any great innovations in philosoph- 
ical cosmology or mathematical astronomy emerge in the Roman world— 
at least none that are well known to modern historians of science. Roman 
astronomy, it seems, was more pragmatic in nature, often intimately bound 
up with prognostication and astrology. 

One of the best-known manifestations of Roman astronomy is the Ju- 
lian calendar. It evolved initially from a simple sequence of indigenous festi- 
vals related to the farmers’ seasonal year, then became increasingly formal- 
ized as Roman society became increasingly urbanized. At first the civic 
calendar was based on the phase cycles of the moon, but it faced increasingly 


serious problems in getting out of step with the seasonal year because of po- 


litical interference in the process of intercalation. All this culminated in 45 
B.C.E. in the switch from a lunar to a solar calendar, dividing the year into 
twelve “months” that were in fact completely independent of the moon. 

The civic calendar aside, there is little doubt that astronomy played a 
significant role in many aspects of Roman life. Land surveyors, employed all 
over the empire with simple instruments, needed good astronomical knowl- 
edge: this is clear from surviving surveyors’ manuals. Other books instruct 
the navigators of commercial ships in navigating by the stars. Sundials were 
in common use for telling the hour of the day: over thirty were recovered in 
Pompeii alone. 

Astrology, popular among the Romans’ Etruscan predecessors as well 
as in Hellenistic Greece, had an uneasy relationship with the Roman state at 
first, but increased greatly in popularity in the second century C.E. with the 
rise of mystery cults such as those of Isis and Mithras. These were astral re- 
ligions, and for many people the sun itself became an object of direct wor- 
ship. Later, these cults came into direct conflict with Christianity.

Rujm el-Hiri 

The megalithic monuments of Britain and Ireland have been studied in great 
detail by archaeoastronomers. Numerous systematic investigations of the 
orientations of prehistoric tombs and temples throughout the western 
Mediterranean have been carried out. But comparable effort has rarely been 
directed towards similar sites elsewhere in the world. One exception is a cu- 
rious circular construction built by Early Bronze Age peoples in the Golan 
Heights, close to the border between Israel and Syria. Its name, Rujm el- 
Hiri, means “stone pile of the wild cat.” Built around 3000 B.c.£., it con- 
sists of a massive circular (actually slightly oval) wall some one hundred 
fifty meters (five hundred feet) across and over three meters (ten feet) thick 
with broad entrances to the northeast and southeast. Inside this are four 


further concentric and successively thinner walls with irregularly placed 


openings. Between the circular walls are curved corridors, some of them di- 
vided into segments by blocking walls built perpendicular to the circles (ori- 
ented radially out from the center), but there is no evident pattern to them, 
Most of the walls still stand to between two and three meters (seven to ten 
feet) high. The result resembles the sort of maze encased in plastic into 
whose center children try to guide ball bearings. Filling most of the central 
space, which measures some thirty meters (one hundred feet) across, is a 
cairn still standing to a height of almost five meters and built over a burial 
chamber oriented towards the northeast entrance. It is surrounded by three 
terraces with circular stone kerbs. The obvious conclusion—that the walls 
were built successively around the cairn—seems to be contradicted by the 
archaeological evidence, which suggests instead that the central cairn was 
actually built more than a millennium after the original construction, in 
around 1500 B.c.E. Rujm el-Hiri, in other words, appears to be a temple 
that later became a tomb. 

Various astronomical alignments have been identified at the site, the 
clearest being the solstitial alignment of the northeast entrance, which is re- 
flected in the orientation of the later burial chamber. Curiously, though, the 
southeast entrance is not aligned upon the other solstitial axis: it is too far 
to the south. On the other hand, two exceptionally large boulders on the 
eastern side could have referenced sunrise close to the equinox, and it has 
been suggested that the purpose of this was to indicate that the first spring 
rains were imminent, allowing final preparations to be made for water to be 
efficiently collected for irrigation. Statistical analyses of the alignments of 
over thirty radial wall segments suggest that they may have been used as stel- 
lar sighting devices. 

What should we make of these alignments? It is almost certainly mis- 
leading to think of the site as an astronomical observatory. As a center for 
religious rituals, however, cosmic referencing would have been important. 
The location of the temple may have been significant in this regard, in that 
it resulted in the two most prominent mountains—Mount Hermon and 
Mount Tabor—appearing, respectively, almost due north and close to De- 
cember solstice sunrise. By visually linking places of vital cosmic signifi- 
cance, some in the landscape and some in the sky, the builders would have 
reinforced the sacred power of the temple itself. More controversial, per- 
haps, is the idea that the radial walls could have functioned as stellar-align- 
ment-fixing devices. But then, what other purpose could they have served? 
One possibility is that they simply served to restrict and confound access to 
the central space, the act of negotiating an asymmetric labyrinth serving to 
instill in the visiting pilgrim a heightened sense of the sacred power of the 
place. The approximately solstitial orientation of the (later) tomb was cer- 


tainly nonfunctional but may have been deliberate and symbolic, following 


the alignment of the original temple. 

Although Rujm el-Hiri has been hailed as a Stonehenge of the Levant, 
and its construction is certainly broadly contemporary with the earliest 
known (earth and timber) constructions at Stonehenge, the comparison may 
be misleading and inappropriate. It is a magnificent temple in its own right 
and gives us some special clues about the beliefs and practices of the Bronze 
Age cultures of this part of the Near East.

Sacred Geographies 

The term sacred geography stems from the realization that people in the 
past conceived the landscape as charged with meaning, some of which 
stemmed from the common worldview developed by their community as a 
whole, and some of which worked on a personal level. The significance as- 
signed to particular places, routes through the landscape, and other (gen- 
erally more visual or perceptual than physically marked) divisions, connec- 
tions, and directions might well be a result of real events or memories. But 
it might equally well derive from mythical or sacred connotations that 
make little sense from a modern, Western perspective. Time is an important 
factor, too. The sacred power of a place was often thought to be enhanced 
at particular times, for example, when it was visually reinforced or revealed 
by a brief play of sunlight. Once we realize this, we are in a better position 
to appreciate conceptions of landscape in the context of worldviews—cos- 
mologies—other than our own; conceptions that are unlikely to view land- 
scape simply as a resource to be exploited and can give rise to actions that 
we would not necessarily perceive as rational. 

At the same time, using the term sacred geographies (or sacred land- 
scapes) to describe these conceptions has a major drawback. It implies that 
there was a clear separation between the sacred and the secular. That this is 
unhelpful is demonstrated by innumerable anthropological studies of his- 
torical and modern peoples. There are different degrees and types of sa- 
credness; and while some sacred places were very special indeed, mundane 
places often had sacred aspects as well, helping to integrate the need for pre- 
serving worldly harmony into many different aspects of everyday life. Rites 
to ensure continuity and regeneration were often related to particular 
places, whether public temples or personal shrines, and tended as well to be 
related to natural (that is, seasonal) phenomena: accordingly, they were of- 
ten carefully timed in relation to the cycles of the celestial bodies. 

In all probability, true sacred landscapes, devoid of all mundane activ- 
ity, simply did not exist. However, the sacred aspects of all landscapes were 


crucially important. The methods of archaeoastronomy are particularly im- 
portant in their potential to reveal sacred aspects of prehistoric landscapes 
(for which, by definition, no historical evidence is available) where these 
have resulted in spatial patterning with respect to the heavenly bodies.

Sarmizegetusa Regia 

The Carpathian mountains run through northwest Romania in a wide arc, 
enclosing an area that stretches down westwards into the Carpathian basin 
in Hungary. This region forms modern-day Transylvania, but in the cen- 
turies immediately before and after the birth of Christ it was home to the 
Dacians, a powerful kingdom whose later resistance to the Roman conquest 
is famously depicted in Trajan’s Column in Rome. The rugged landscape to 
the south of the modern town of Orastie contains a number of impressive 
Dacian monuments, including settlements, stone-built fortresses and “sanc- 
tuaries,” assumed to have been places of religious worship. It is in this area, 
at an elevation of over 1,000 meters (3,300 feet), that one encounters 
Sarmizegetusa Regia, the ancient capital of the Dacians. 

Sarmizegetusa Regia contained a citadel and living areas with dwellings 
and workshops, but it also contained a sacred zone. A number of rectangu- 
lar temples were located there, the bases of their supporting columns still vis- 
ible in regular arrays. Perhaps the most enigmatic construction at the site, 
however, is the large circular sanctuary. This comprised a “D”-shaped set- 
ting of timber posts surrounded by a timber circle, which was surrounded in 
turn by a low stone kerb. The original timber posts have long since rotted 
away, and the ones currently visible on the site are modern reconstructions 
in the original postholes. They help the modern visitor visualize the layout 
of the original construction, although the heights of the posts is completely 
speculative. 

The layout of the timber settings bears a broad resemblance to the 
sarsen stone monument at Stonehenge in England, where five trilithons laid 


out in a horseshoe shape are surrounded by a complete circle. This has led

some people to proclaim Sarmizegetusa Regia as a “Romanian Stonehenge” 
and to propose it as an ancient observatory comparable in importance to the 
British site. In fact, this logic is flawed on several grounds. First, the two sites 
are culturally unrelated and well separated in time: Sarmizegetusa Regia was 
not built until 1,500 years after Stonehenge had fallen into disuse. The im- 
portance of the Romanian sanctuary must be measured in the context of the 
Dacian cultural heritage. Second, Stonehenge is no longer considered by se- 
rious scholars to have been an ancient observatory. Its main axis was cer- 
tainly aligned toward the solstices, and the same has been claimed of the 
large circular sanctuary. But in fact there are problems. The Romanian 
“horseshoe” (if one excludes the straight side of the “D”) faces southeast 
rather than northeast as at Stonehenge, so it is the midwinter rather than 
midsummer sunrise upon which it is claimed to be aligned. This would be 
the direction of sunrise on the shortest day of the year if there were a distant, 
level horizon in this direction. But there is not. The horizon altitude in this 
direction is several degrees, and the midwinter sunrise would occur over ten 
degrees farther south. 

Yet the circular sanctuary and other structures in the sacred zone may 
well have had astronomical or calendrical associations. It has been sug- 


gested, for example, that a large circular block of stone 1.5 meters (five feet) 


in diameter, laid flat and known popularly as the “Andesite Sun,” was used 
as a sundial. It has been suggested that a circle of rectangular grooves cut 
into the stone might have been used to mark the length of the shadow from 
a central gnomon, but the existence of such a gnomon is pure speculation. 
Others have argued that the stone was simply used for sacrifices or other rit- 
uals. Yet the idea of as sundial is far from absurd, since there are known to 
have been influences on Dacian culture from Hellenistic Greece, and these 
may well have included ideas about geometry and astronomy.

Saroeak 
Basque stone octagons are symmetrical arrangements of eight small stones 
found scattered across the northern coastal parts of the Iberian peninsula 
but concentrated mainly in the Basque country—a culturally and ethni- 
cally distinctive region spanning four provinces in northern Spain and ex- 
tending into southwestern France. The stone octagons represent an enig- 
matic class of monument constructed, apparently, using well-defined 
astronomical and geometrical principles. Each was of similar size, with a 
diameter of about 320 meters (1050 feet), and the stones were placed ac- 
curately on the cardinal and intercardinal points. (Sometimes an additional 
eight stones were placed at points in between, making sixteen in all.) In the 
center was a distinctive stone known as an artamugarri. The term saroeak 
(the plural, in the Basque language, of saroe), refers to the area demarcated 
by these stone arrangements. One closely studied area surrounds the 
coastal town of Donostia (San Sebastian) and the villages of Hernani and 
Urnieta to the south. Even though it is an area of only about forty square 
kilometers (fifteen square miles), nearly forty saroeak have been identified 
in this locality alone. 

Until the 1990s, saroeak had been of little interest to archaeologists, 
who believed them to be a relatively modern phenomenon. However, it was

known that their distribution tended to coincide with places used for graz- 
ing by transhumant shepherding peoples as part of a strong pastoral tradi- 
tion within the Basque Country. Then, during the 1980s and 1990s, regional 
cultural heritage projects combining documentary research and small-scale 
excavations revealed a quite remarkable continuity of material tradition ex- 
tending over almost 2000 years. The historical documents showed the 
saroeak to be the material remnants of a system for organizing communal 
grazing lands dating back at least to the Early Medieval times—a system 
that, in some cases, remained in use until early in the twentieth century. The 
archaeological investigations showed that some center stones were con- 
structed as far back as C.E. 200. 

Some of the historical records actually specify the geometrical design of 
the saroeak and the methods that should be used in their construction, indi- 
cating that they were laid out using standard units of length, and confirming 
the importance of celestial orientation in relation to the cardinal and inter- 
cardinal directions. They also tell us that the saroeak could act as local seats 
of government and law and order; as meeting places; as safe grazing 


grounds; as farmstead boundaries; and as centers for religious rites. The im- 


portance of reflecting the perceived cosmic order in their design perhaps 
comes as no surprise, then, especially in view of the last of these. 

The archaeological evidence shows that the design principles underly- 
ing the saroeak had already remained relatively constant for many centuries 
before the earliest documents relating to them were written. Furthermore, 
the earliest saroeak respected even earlier megalithic tombs and dolmens, in 
that they never enclosed them, although such monuments are sometimes 
found just outside a saroe boundary. Some have interpreted this as evidence 
of an even longer continuity of tradition dating back to the Neolithic or 
Bronze Age. Support for this view has been sought from the fact that the 
Basque language is unique in western Europe in not belonging to the Indo- 
European linguistic family, suggesting that its roots are more localized and 
pre-date the spread of Indo-European languages across the continent. If such 
a long continuity of tradition did indeed exist in the Basque country, then the 
Basque saroeak could be relevant to interpretations of later prehistoric mon- 
uments all over western Europe, including the famous Neolithic and Bronze 
Age stone circles of Britain and Ireland. This is because—despite efforts by 
some scholars to argue otherwise, for example in relation to the “mega- 
lithic” calendar—such interpretations are normally constrained by the fact 
that the only direct evidence available is archaeological. 

Yet it is also possible that the earliest saroeak simply implemented sa- 
cred or symbolic principles that respected what were already, even by the 
early centuries C.E., conspicuous ancient features in the landscape, just as the 
Nahua (Aztecs}—in another continent and another millennium—respected 
the already ancient pyramids of Teotihuacan as works of the gods. However, 
if we become prepossessed by the possibility of even longer continuities of 
tradition, we divert attention away from the broader significance of the 
saroeak in a different respect. They demonstrate remarkably well that func- 
tions and meanings can vary considerably while a material tradition remains 
essentially unchanged. (Another, very different, example of this is the 
Mesoamerican cross-circle designs.) And they also provide an important case 
study concerning the ways in which this can happen in practice, over a pe- 


riod of nearly two millennia.

Science or Symbolism? 

In the early days of modern archaeoastronomy, in the 1970s and early 
1980s, there was a long and occasionally rancorous argument about 
whether prehistoric astronomy, as manifested in astronomical alignments at 
British megalithic sites such as Ballochroy and Kintraw, was scientific or 
symbolic in nature. This question was intimately bound up with the issue 
of whether, as proposed by Alexander Thom, prehistoric people created de- 
liberate sightlines on the rising and setting points of the sun, moon, and 
stars, making use of features on distant horizons as “foresights” to achieve 
pinpoint precision in their astronomical observations. The interpretation fa- 
vored by many archaeologists was that the high-precision alignments 
picked out by Thom were fortuitous and that the people who built large 
stone monuments were aware only of rougher alignments, such as the fa- 
mous midwinter sunrise alignment at the Irish passage tomb of Newgrange. 
They argued that these lower-precision alignments were more likely to be 
related to rituals and symbolism associated with seasonal activities, death, 
renewal, ancestor worship, and so on rather than used as precise “scien- 
tific” measuring instruments. 

There are two ironies here. One is that “high precision” should not 
necessarily be equated with “scientific” and “low precision” with “sym- 
bolic.” Many historical and modern instances demonstrate that human 
communities perform remarkably painstaking and exact astronomical 
measurements for what, ultimately, are “merely” (as we might mistakenly 
see it) ceremonial purposes. (A much-cited example is the traditional calen- 
dar of the Hopi in the southwestern United States.) Furthermore, the fact 
that prehistoric people went to the bother of encapsulating astronomical 
alignments, whether rough or more precise, in stone argues that they were 
more than mere observing instruments—that they had strong symbolic mo- 
tivation and meaning. 

The second irony in that “our” science—the modern Western way of 
understanding the world—is not likely to be the way that homan communi- 


ties understood the world in prehistory, any more than in indigenous com- 


munities today. One might well see other worldviews as representing alter- 
native forms of “science,” insofar as they explain what people see in the 
world (the cosmos) around them and often have a predictive capability. (A 
good example of this is the role of the Caterpillar Jaguar constellation of the 
Barasana people of the Columbian Amazon in relation to earthly caterpil- 
lars.) Such “alternative sciences” often have a strong ceremonial element, 
since appropriate observances help to keep human actions in tune with the 
cosmos as it is perceived and understood. Incorporating alignments in ar- 
chitecture to symbolize and reinforce the properties of the world is another. 
(This is evident, for example, in the design of the earth lodges of the Pawnee, 
or the hogans of the Navajo, to name but two of many examples.) If we are 
really interested in understanding more about prehistoric “science,” then we 
should probably be looking for evidence of the kind of symbolical align- 
ments and ceremonial activities that were seen by many back in the 1970s as 
its very antithesis.

Short Stone Rows 

Among the most enigmatic of all the different types of megalithic monuments 
in Britain and Ireland are the short rows of up to six standing stones that are 
found scattered around northern and western parts of the islands, as well as 
in northwest France. Well over 250 examples are known, and the dates that 
exist suggest that the majority of them were erected at a relatively late stage 
as far as megalithic monuments go: in the Early to Middle Bronze Age, well 
into the second millennium B.c.£. Typically, the stones are one to two meters 
(three to six feet) in height and placed a few meters (up to about fifteen feet) 
apart, although there are some spectacular exceptions, such as the three-stone 
row at Gurranes in County Cork, Ireland, where the slender stones rise to 
over four meters (thirteen feet), Most of the rows stand in apparent isolation, 
though some are associated with burials or other megalithic structures such 
as stone circles. Particular concentrations of short stone rows are found in 
western Scotland—in Argyll on the mainland and on inner Hebridean islands 


such as Mull—and in southwestern Ireland, in Counties Cork and Kerry.

Unlike stone circles, stone rows do not enclose an area so cannot be in- 
terpreted as demarcating a central place or sacred space. They can, however, 
easily be envisaged as pointing at something, and hence have long evoked the 
interest of archaeoastronomers. Certain solstitially aligned rows have 
achieved considerable public notoriety, such as Gleninagh in Connemara, 
western Ireland. Alexander Thom certainly saw their potential as megalithic 
“observatories.” He included many British examples in his lists of monu- 
ments aligned upon horizon features such as hilltops and notches that marked 
significant rising or setting positions of the sun, moon, and stars. The row at 
Ballochroy, on the west coast of the Kintyre peninsula in southern Argyll, 
Scotland, was one of his earliest published and most quoted solar observatory 
sites, but it also became one of the most important case studies in demon- 
strating why apparent astronomical alignments, and especially those of high 
precision, have to be treated with considerable care and caution. 

Studies of repeated trends among regional groupings have provided the 
strongest evidence that many stone rows do have astronomical connections, 
though at a lower level of precision than that envisaged by Thom. In both of 
the strongest geographical concentrations, the clear consistency in the orien- 
tation of the rows is not a simple consequence of the local topography. It ap- 
pears that the location of some of the monuments was carefully selected in 


order to follow the prevailing tradition of orientation (and the need for a dis- 


tant view in certain directions) despite the general lie of the land. In south- 
western Ireland there are just over fifty measurable rows, and their orienta- 
tions are strongly clustered around northeast-southwest. The orientations of 
the western Scottish rows are just as consistent, but clustered around north- 
south. In both cases the evidence indicates a linkage with the moon, but for 
a stone row as opposed to a stone circle (the prime example being the Scot- 
tish recumbent stone circles), it is not obvious where in relation to the stones 
any moon-related ceremonials might have taken place. Only in the case of 
the handful of short stone rows on the northern part of the Isle of Mull in 
western Scotland does there seem to be a clearer answer to this question. 
These rows are all situated so that a prominent distant mountain is on the 
very limit of visibility—in other words, it is not clearly visible unless ones 
moves to one side of the row. This side, then, must be where any moon-re- 
lated observances would have taken place. But this in itself doesn’t help to 
explain why the rows should, in the first place, be so carefully located on the 
very limit of visibility. 

In recent years, many archaeologists have started to question the as- 
sumption that, once farming spread to islands such as Britain and Ireland, 
marking the beginning of the Neolithic period, people settled into permanent 
villages, tending their crops and animals. Many peoples may have remained 
essentially mobile, with animal herders or perhaps whole communities fol- 
lowing seasonal paths around the landscape. On an island such as Mull, 
where soils are poor and the agricultural potential is low, it is possible that 
few people lived there, even in the Bronze Age, and that they were essentially 
mobile. Could monuments such as the stone rows, then, mark places that 
were only visited occasionally? Or could they mark boundaries, social or 
symbolic? Such ideas do not imply that lunar alignments were not an inte- 
gral part of these monuments but may suggest different ways in which they 
could be interpreted.

Sky Bears 
The constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Great Bear and Lit- 


tle Bear, circle the north celestial pole each night and have done so for sev- 


eral millennia, although the position of the pole gradually shifts owing to 
precession. These twin formations of stars, though identified in a variety of 
ways by different peoples, have formed a conspicuous feature of the skies 
for every human culture in the northern hemisphere—particularly from 
temperate latitudes northward, where they are circumpolar and thus remain 
visible on every clear night of the year. 

Since the two constellations have similar shapes, it is not surprising that 
many peoples have perceived them as larger and smaller versions of the same 
thing. It is more mystifying why anyone would have conceived of them as 
bears. The idea comes down to us (along with many other constellation iden- 
tifications) from ancient Greece. It does not require too much imagination to 
interpret their shapes as pans or ladles, wagons or ploughs, but it is a great 
deal more difficult to liken them to bears. This makes it all the more curious 
that a number of culturally unrelated groups also, apparently, saw these con- 
stellations as bears. Examples include several indigenous North American 
groups, such as the Iroquois and the Mi’kmaq of Nova Scotia. The desire not 
to dismiss this as a coincidence has led some people to propose a radical ex- 
planation. 

The general idea of a bear, or bears, in the sky is widespread, especially 
in northerly latitudes. A variety of traditions—folk tales, public perfor- 
mances, and shamanic rituals—involving terrestrial bears and connected to 
a Celestial Bear exist among cultures scattered throughout Europe and the 
northernmost parts of Asia and the Americas, including the Basque country, 
Finland, Siberia, the Kamchatka peninsula of eastern Russia, Alaska, and 
eastern Canada. A common feature of many of these fragmentary traditions 
is that bears were seen as the ancestors of humans and suitably revered, the 
common ancestor of all being the Celestial Bear or Great Sky Bear. 

In several parts of Europe, plays are still performed as part of seasonal 
festivities in the winter or spring in which the players enact the story of a 
bear who is hunted and killed, but subsequently returns. In Andorra, for ex- 
ample, the bear actor—or even a live bear—performs a dance accompanied 
by musicians and masked actors representing other animals. In some places 
older traditions have been reported in which an actual bear was hunted and 
sacrificed, then eaten at a banquet. The American linguist Roslyn Frank ar- 
gues that such ceremonies represent the surviving fragments of a tradition in 
which the earthly bear was seen as being “sent home,” its soul ascending up 
the “sky pole” to the ancestral bear in heaven, to whom it would report on 
its treatment in the earthly world. A positive report guaranteed health and 
well-being for another year. 

Frank argues that many of these bear myths may have a common ori- 
gin in an ancient worldview that predated by several millennia the great an- 


cient civilizations, possibly dating back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic pe- 


riod over 10,000 years ago. If so, then Ursa Major and Ursa Minor might 
have been recognized as bears as long ago as this. And if this was the case, 
it might explain how such a conception could have arrived in the Americas— 
carried there by the earliest settlers entering Alaska across the land bridge 
that then connected it to Siberia. But such ideas are highly controversial, and 
it is better to separate them into three different strands. 

The first is the suggestion that in modern European folk performances 
involving bears we may be glimpsing one aspect of a widespread world- 
view—prevalent at least as far back as Medieval times and existing alongside 
the dominant Christian tradition—in which bears, seen as human ancestors, 
played a key part in ensuring seasonal renewal through their connection 
with an ancestral bear spirit or spirits in the sky. The second is that folk tales 
and practices relating to sky bears in Europe relate directly (as opposed to 
bearing a fortuitous resemblance) to indigenous cosmological beliefs and rit- 
uals in other parts of the northern hemisphere, with the implication that this 
must represent a tradition whose origins stretch back to the very distant past. 
The final strand is that these practices relate specifically to the identification 
of one or two bears circling around the northern celestial pole: in other 
words, that the bear(s) in the sky can consistently be identified with Ursa 
Major and/or Ursa Minor. Each of these strands provides its own challenges 
in terms of the available evidence and its interpretation. 

Nonetheless, if we do not accept Frank’s scenario we are left with the 
open questions of why celestial bear myths are so commonplace, and why 
such an inherently improbable identification of these two groups of stars 
seems to crop up repeatedly in entirely different places. Finally, there is the 
mystery of why the celestial bear was perceived by the ancient Greeks as hav- 
ing a long tail, unlike terrestrial bears. There is no satisfactory explanation, 
and it has been suggested that this might itself be a consequence of the trans- 
fer into ancient Greece of a much older tradition.

Solar Eclipses 
It is a staggering coincidence—but a coincidence nonetheless—that, as seen 


from the surface of the earth, the apparent diameter of the sun is more or 


less the same as that of the moon. It is only because of this fluke of nature 
that total solar eclipses appear as spectacular as they do. 

A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly in front of 
the sun, just covering its disc, but rendering visible the ethereal white light 
of the surrounding solar corona—the sun’s outer atmosphere—and reduc- 
ing the remainder of the sky to a dusk-like half-light. The same fluke of na- 
ture also ensures that total solar eclipses are rare, since if the alignment is 
not exactly right, then the disc of the sun will never be completely covered 
and the eclipse will only be partial. As long as only a small part of the sun’s 
disc remains uncovered, its light will continue to light up the sky much as 
normal and the eclipse might easily pass unnoticed. The same is true of an 
annular eclipse, which occurs when the alignment is exact but the moon is 
slightly farther away from the earth than it is on average, so that its disc ap- 
pears slightly smaller than usual; in this case, a thin ring of the sun’s disc re- 
mains uncovered. 

A total solar eclipse can be seen from somewhere on earth about once 
every year and a half on average, but each one is only visible from within a 
narrow track, typically about 160 kilometers (100 miles) in width, though 
stretching for several thousand kilometers across the surface of the planet. 
From a typical spot on earth, a total solar eclipse will only occur once every 
four hundred years on average. Fewer than one in four people in the past, 
lacking the benefit of modern scientific foreknowledge and travel possibili- 
ties, would have experienced a total solar eclipse during their lifetime. 

Witnessing a total solar eclipse at first hand is an awe-inspiring experi- 
ence. In a few moments the sun is transformed from something too bright to 
be directly visible into a black disc surrounded by a wispy white halo, and 
the remainder of the sky becomes as dark as early dawn or late dusk, with 
planets and bright stars visible. All around, nature reacts: the atmosphere 
cools, birds stop singing, and other animals are in confusion. Then, after no 
more than a few minutes, and equally rapidly, normality is restored. Even in 
the modern world, knowing what to expect, one is left with a profound sense 
of the power and immutability of nature. There can be little doubt that the 
psychological effect upon people and cultures in the past for whom such an 
event occurred entirely without warning—upsetting the rhythms of nature 
known and relied upon since time immemorial—was potentially devastating. 

Despite this, hardly any eclipse sightings in prehistoric times have left 
a definite trace in the archaeological record. Most claims of depictions of 
eclipses in rock art are purely speculative. For example, on one panel in a 
large petroglyph field at Pu‘u Loa on the Big Island of Hawai‘ is a design 
consisting of a full circle with four adjacent crescents, increasing in size 
away from it. It has been suggested that these represent the stages of a so- 


lar eclipse, up to and including totality. However, the crescents vary in size 


rather than shape, as one would expect if they were literal depictions, and 
there are no symmetrical crescents on the other side of the circle, which one 
might expect to represent the phases after totality. Furthermore, the cres- 
cent sun cannot be viewed directly. It is more likely that these symbols have 
another meaning entirely. Similarly, a group of petroglyphs on a rock out- 
crop at Ekenburg in Sweden have been interpreted as a literal depiction of 
the sky during a total eclipse in 1596 B.c.z. However, this interpretation de- 
pends upon a number of unsupported assumptions. Given the likely impact 
of such an unexpected event on the people of the time, it seems unthinkable 
that, in less than three minutes, they could have recorded the appearance of 
the sky in enough detail to then reproduce it faithfully in stone. 

Even in some of the great ancient empires and city-states, where liter- 
acy permitted detailed records to be kept of a variety of astronomical (and 
meteorological) phenomena, total solar eclipses could not be reliably pre- 
dicted and remained greatly feared. In ancient China, for example, records 
of total eclipses of the sun go back at least to about 700 B.c.E., but even two 
complete millennia after this date there was no means to predict them. When 
they did happen, they were taken as particularly disastrous omens for the 
state, or for the Emperor himself. Babylonian astronomers were the first to 
discover that lunar eclipses tend to recur after certain fixed periods of time. 
This enabled them to predict lunar eclipses but not solar ones, which re- 
mained a sign of an impending calamity. 

Across the world in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, the Maya almanac 
subsequently known as the Dresden Codex contained a tabulated record of 
eclipses that, once again, could have been used to provide warnings of fur- 
ther lunar eclipses, with a reasonable (although probably not good) success 
rate—but not solar ones. The Maya city-states had collapsed by the time the 
Europeans arrived, but the Aztecs continued to record eclipses, even after the 
conquest. The tremendous fear felt by those natives who witnessed a total 
solar eclipse in 1531 is recorded in graphic detail by the chronicler Fray 
Bernardino de Sahagin. 

The problem with predicting total solar eclipses is that regular cycles 
(such as the Saros cycle of eighteen years and eleven days, which the Baby- 
lonians identified) are only crude. They take no account of various addi- 
tional, more complex irregularities in the motions of the earth and moon. 
These small irregularities are relatively unimportant in predicting eclipses of 
the moon, which affect half of the earth, but are critical if we need to pre- 
dict the narrow path of totality of a solar eclipse. 

Many people have been keen to demonstrate that prehistoric people 
could predict eclipses. Famously, the Aubrey Holes, a ring of fifty-six pits 
surrounding the sarsen circle at Stonehenge in England, was interpreted by 


astronomers Gerald Hawkins and Fred Hoyle in the 1960s as an eclipse-pre-

dicting device. The two astronomers proposed slightly different methods, 
but both schemes involved wooden posts being moved around the holes in 
prescribed ways. Both methods would have successfully identified “eclipse 
danger periods”—periods when a solar or lunar eclipse could occur—at 
roughly six-month intervals. Eclipses of the moon could only occur at full 
moons, and eclipses of the sun at new moons, falling within these danger pe- 
riods. However, even partial solar eclipses would only occur on average once 
every two and a half years, and a total solar eclipse would only happen on 
average once in several generations. Hawkins’s scheme only successfully pre- 
dicted a fraction of eclipses; Hoyle claimed that his own method would have 
successfully predicted about half. However, further debate about the relative 
merits of either scheme is unnecessary. The Aubrey Holes are just one of the 
several Neolithic pit circles known in Britain, of a range of sizes. It is ar- 
chaeological nonsense to pick this one as a potential eclipse predictor while 


ignoring the rest. 


Few would doubt that total solar eclipses, when they did occur in the 
past, could have made a huge impression on the people who witnessed them. 
Where historical or written records exist they give us concrete information 
about particular eclipse observations and their social impact. But we must 
beware of letting our eagerness to find notable accomplishments back in pre- 


history lead us to invent archaeological evidence that is simply not there.

Solstices 

If one were to go to a fixed spot every morning and watch the sun rise be- 
yond a horizon full of distinctive features, such as distant mountains and 
valleys, it would soon become obvious that the rising position moves along 
the horizon day by day. During the months of January to May, the daily 
change is northward, becoming noticeably smaller in early June and finally 
almost imperceptible, until it comes to stop on or very close to June 21. Af- 
ter this, the motion is southward once again, at first imperceptible, but 
gradually hastening until by August the change is almost a whole solar di- 
ameter each day. By the end of November, the daily progress noticeably 


slows once again, until the southerly limit is reached on or about December 


21. Exactly the same pattern would emerge if one were to watch sunsets 
rather than sunrises. The dates when the limits are reached, June 21 and De- 
cember 21, are known as the solstices. 

In a location north of the tropics, the farther north the sun rises and 
sets, the higher it climbs in the sky during the day. The June solstice occurs, 
as a consequence, in summer. Thus in the northern hemisphere, June 21 is 
generally known as the summer solstice and December 21 as the winter sol- 
stice. In the southern hemisphere the converse is true. However, as this can 
cause confusion, especially within the tropics, the terms June solstice and 
December solstice are sometimes preferable. 

Outside the polar regions, the summer solstice also represents the 
longest day and shortest night (technically, this may actually occur a couple 
of days before or afterward, but the difference is negligible). The winter sol- 
stice represents the shortest day and longest night. Within the tropics, 
though, this makes little difference—as one approaches the equator all days 
in the year come to have the same length. 

The solstices are widely recognized culturally. Historically, summer and 
winter solstice festivals are documented the world over. The winter solstice 
in particular is a time of death and renewal, a time when, for many human 
communities, the sun must be halted in its southward (or northward in the 
southern hemisphere) progress and brought back—for example, by shaman- 
istic intervention—to enable a new growing season. The indigenous Chu- 
mash of California were just one of many peoples who held a major cere- 
mony at this time because they believed human intervention to be necessary 
in order to maintain the delicate balance of nature. Similar principles may 
well have motivated a variety of rituals and ceremonies held at and around 
the time of winter solstice, such as the Hawaiian makahiki and the Incaic 
Inti Raymi. Pagan solstice festivals underlie the timing of the Christian festi- 
vals of the feast of St. John and Christmas.

Solstitial Alignments 
The term midsummer is loosely applied: it derives from the common name, 


Midsummer's Day, for the feast of St. John, which was timed to coincide 


with the earlier pagan festivals associated with the summer solstice. Mid- 
summer sunrise, then, really means “sunrise at the summer solstice.” Like- 
wise, midsummer sunset means “sunset at the summer solstice,” and mid- 
winter sunrise and sunset refer to sunrise and sunset at the winter solstice. 

The direction of midsummer sunrise is always in the northeast quad- 
rant of the horizon for an observer in the northern hemisphere (southeast in 
the southern hemisphere), but the exact azimuth depends upon the ob- 
server’s latitude and the altitude of the horizon in that direction. The same 
applies to midsummer sunset (northwest in the northern hemisphere, south- 
west in the southern hemisphere), midwinter sunrise (southeast in the north- 
ern hemisphere, northeast in the southern hemisphere), and midwinter sun- 
set (southwest in the northern hemisphere, northwest in the southern 
hemisphere). The only exceptions to this rule occur in the Arctic and Antarc- 
tic regions, where the midwinter sun never rises and the midsummer sun 
never sets. 

A great many architectural alignments upon midwinter sunrise have 
been noted from a variety of places and times. The most famous is the align- 
ment of the passage at Newgrange passage tomb in Ireland, built in the late 
fourth millennium B.c.E. Similar—in the sense that sunlight only penetrates 
into a dark space just after sunrise at the winter solstice—but very much 
older is the palaeolithic cave at Parpall6é in eastern Spain. If deliberate, this 
alignment may date back as far as 19,000 B.C.E. 

Midsummer sunrise alignments include what is arguably the most fa- 
mous solstitial alignment of them all, along the axis of the sarsen monument 
at Stonehenge in England, toward the Heelstone. Ironically, though, it is 
quite likely that the alignment in the opposite direction, toward midwinter 
sunset, was of greater significance to the builders. 

Alignments upon sunset at one or the other solstice seem to be no less 
common than those upon sunrise. A well-known example from North 
America is the Serpent Mound, a 180-meter- (600-foot)-long serpent-shaped 
effigy mound in southern Ohio, whose head faces the direction of midsum- 
mer sunset. Midwinter sunset at Kintraw in western Scotland was one of the 
earliest claimed examples of a high-precision sightline using a prominent 
notch in the natural horizon as a foresight. But that claim has not withstood 
the test of time. 

Other controversial examples of solstitial alignments include the 
Bronze Age site at Brainport Bay, again in Scotland, where a fierce debate 
arose about whether the alignment of archaeological features, indubitably 
oriented upon midsummer sunrise, was precise and “calendrical” or less pre- 
cise and “ceremonial.” The circular sanctuary of timber posts at the Dacian 
sanctuary of Sarmizegetusa Regia in Romania (late first millennium B.c.E.) is 


said to face midwinter sunrise, but here the problem is that the alignment ex- 


ists only in a theoretical sense, since the high horizon in the relevant direc- 
tion displaces the actual direction of sunrise on the shortest day by some ten 
degrees along the horizon. 

The significance of the solstitial directions is often cosmological rather 
than practical/calendrical, although the two are not mutually exclusive. In 
Hopi tradition, the main importance of the solstitial directions is that they 
define the fundamental divisions of the world into four parts. However, ob- 
servations of the changing position of the rising and setting sun are also cru- 
cial in regulating their elaborate seasonal calendar. This includes, on the sol- 
stices themselves, laying prayer sticks on shrines that are themselves placed 
in the landscape along the solstitial directions. 

A key issue is the extent to which we find solstitial alignments because 
we are looking for them. Nobody would deny that the directions of sunrise 
and sunset at the solstices are hugely significant in many cultures; the ques- 
tion is the extent to which we approach other cultural traditions armed with 
a “toolkit” that reflects our own predilections and preferences, and whether 
this can make us (perhaps unwittingly) selective with the evidence and hence 
biases our interpretation. To give just one example, the solstitial orientation 
of the Big Horn medicine wheel in Wyoming, when first announced in the 
1970s, engendered much debate because of the suspicion that archaeoas- 
tronomers were simply extending the techniques and methods of British ar- 
chaeoastronomy uncritically into North America. In general, such issues can 
only be satisfactorily addressed by paying careful attention to field method- 
ology, the cultural context, and the broader archaeological/historical evi- 
dence of the site.

Solstitial Directions 

The direction of sunrise at the June solstice represents the northernmost 
limit of the range of horizon, centered upon east, where the sun will rise on 
different days through the year. Similarly, the direction of sunrise at the De- 
cember solstice represents the southernmost limit of this range. Likewise, 
the directions of sunset at the June and December solstices represent, re- 
spectively, the northern and southern limits of the western range of horizon 
where the sun sets at different times of the year. 

Everywhere on earth apart from the polar regions, the directions of 
June solstice sunrise and sunset, and of December solstice sunrise and sun- 
set, fall respectively within the northeast, northwest, southeast and south- 
west quadrants of the horizon. These four directions divide the horizon into 
four distinct parts. The eastern part represents the range of horizon within 
which the sun always rises; everywhere in this range is a point where the sun 
will rise at some time during the year. Similarly, the western part represents 
the range within which the sun always sets. In northern temperate zones, the 
southern part represents the horizon the sun passes over each day; the di- 
rection of the sun in the middle of the day. Things facing in this direction will 
be open to the light of the sun. The north, on the other hand, is a “dark” di- 
rection. (The properties of the north and south parts are reversed in the 
southern hemisphere.) 

Each of these four directions, in other words, has distinct properties 
and, in different human societies, can acquire distinct cosmological conno- 
tations. In one type of quadripartite cosmology (perceived division of the 
world, as viewed from some central place, into four parts), the boundaries 
between the different quarters of the world are formed by the solstitial di- 
rections. One example of this is the worldview of the Hopi people of Ari- 
zona. Another example is the layout of the Andean village of Misminay. It 
can be misleading to speak of a “quartering” of the world, since the four 
“quarters” are generally nowhere near equal in size: in fact, equal quarters 
are only possible (depending upon the horizon altitude) at latitudes of 
around fifty-five degrees (north and south). Closer to the equator, the east 
and west parts become narrower and the north and south parts wider. At the 
equator itself, the east and west parts are only about 47 degrees wide, and 
the north and south parts are 133 degrees wide. 

As one approaches the polar regions, the northern and southern 
“quarters” rapidly shrink away, and in the polar regions themselves the 
quadripartite model is not applicable at all. Here, every part of the horizon 
is the rising or setting point of the sun at some time in the year. Indeed, there 
is a period around the winter solstice when the sun never rises above the 
horizon at all, and a period around the summer solstice when the sun never 


sets. The length of this period depends upon the latitude, but it is clearly a 


critical time for indigenous groups living in northern polar regions, such as 
the Inuit.

Somerville, Boyle (1864-1936) 


Henry Boyle Townshend Somerville was one of a handful of keen amateur 
astronomers and surveyors in the early part of the twentieth century who 
extended the work of Sir Norman Lockyer by carrying out their own sur- 
veys of megalithic monuments. Having risen to the rank of vice-admiral in 
the Royal Navy, he retired in 1919. After he returned to his native County 
Cork, he was responsible for the first published archaeoastronomical sur- 
veys and interpretations of a number of Irish chambered tombs, stone cir- 
cles, and rows. It was he, for example, who first drew attention to the sol- 
stitial orientation of the stone circle at Drombeg. 

Somerville is best known, however, for first drawing attention in 1912 
to the possible lunar orientation of some of the standing stones at Callanish 
on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland. One consequence of his paper on Callanish, 
published in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association, was to trig- 
ger the interest of Alexander Thom, who went on to become one of the most 
influential twentieth-century figures in the field. More fundamentally, 
though, it contained the first suggestion that a prehistoric monument might 
have been aligned upon the horizon rising or setting point of the moon, not 
just of the sun or stars. This initiated a line of inquiry that is still bearing fruit 
today among the Bronze Age monuments of Scotland and Ireland, in partic- 
ular the Scottish recumbent stone circles and some of the short stone rows 
found in western Scotland and western Ireland. 

Somerville was murdered in 1936 by Irish republican activists, who saw 
him as encouraging Irish recruits into the British armed forces.

Son Mas 


Scattered around Mallorca, the largest and most mountainous of the 
Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean, are a number of walled sanc- 
tuaries built during the first millennium B.c.£. that seem to have been the 
setting for various ritual activities. Son Mas, near the northwest coast, is 
one of the largest of them but seems to have been in use for a far longer pe- 
riod: radiocarbon dates stretch back into the third millennium B.c.z. How- 
ever, there is a curious gap around 1700 B.c.E., when the site seems to have 
been abandoned for several centuries for no reason that is apparent from 
the archaeology, before being rebuilt and reoccupied. 

The reason that the earlier sanctuary was so precipitously abandoned 
remained unexplained until the site was studied archaeoastronomically. 
Like the taulas of Menorca, it faces south, but in the direction of a nearby 
valley flanked by steep hills. This is indicated by a curious, artificial groove 
cut into the side of a large upright boulder in front of the sanctuary. When 
the Southern Cross and Pointers appeared down low in the southern sky, 
passing almost horizontally, from east to west, they would have passed 
across this valley and hung spectacularly in the sky just above it. But due to 
precession they would have gotten gradually lower century by century un- 
til they were beginning to disappear in around 1700 B.c.£. The result, quite 
plausibly, would have been a crisis, and it was that which caused the sanc- 
tuary to be abandoned.

Space and Time, Ancient Perceptions of 

Long before the invention of writing or the construction of observing in- 
struments, people made sense of the world by linking objects, events, and 
cycles of activity, both on the land and in the sky. The regular cycles of the 
skies were often vital in developing notions of temporality, in the sense that 
they were used to regulate both practical and ritualistic aspects of human 
activity and played a crucial role in the development of calendars. But this 
is a very different matter from saying that astronomical periodicities were 
used to measure units of time, because this assumes an abstract notion of 
time that may not be appropriate in a non-Western worldview. The same 
can be said of an abstract notion of space. 


For us, time progresses along a line and provides a backdrop against 
which we live our lives, constantly measurable from calendars and clocks that 
have become divorced from the physical, observable phenomena in the natu- 
ral world that once generated them. Likewise, we measure our position in 
space using maps or GPS receivers that fit comfortably in the hand and, at the 
touch of a button, deliver our spatial coordinates to within a few meters. 

Prehistoric peoples and others in the past who lacked such devices 
would have been no less aware of the passage of time. The basic needs of 
survival and subsistence would have forced them to keep their own actions 
in tune with various regularly recurring events going on in the natural world 
around them. It is also likely that the regular cycles of the heavens, starting 
with the most obvious one of them all—the phase cycle of the moon—pro- 
vided a key point of reference for many and led to the eventual development 
of early calendars. But we must be careful not to approach the issue too 
naively. The passage of time (as we would think of it) might have been con- 
ceived in many different ways. One of the most fundamental conceptual dis- 
tinctions is between circular and linear time—the one implying an endless 
perceived repetition of regular events and the other a single history and fu- 
ture. The ancient Maya are noted for having used both conceptions in par- 
allel, in the form of the Calendar Round and the Long Count. Even the dis- 
tinctions between past, present, and future break down differently in many 
other systems of thought. 

Similarly, there are numerous ways of perceiving the world that differ 
from our view of things separated by empty space, from which stems our 
own idea of space as an abstract backdrop. Notions of the spatial interrela- 
tionship of things were inherently contextualized in places and paths with 
particular qualities and meanings. Furthermore, spatial and temporal attri- 
butes of things were intricately bound together in many ways, with the dis- 
tinction between them (as we would see it) rather blurred. Thus, for the 
Lakota, the names and meanings of some places changed according to the 
time of year as they followed the buffalo through the landscape, mimicking 
the passage of the sun through the sky. The Aztecs, it has been claimed, 
linked the mountain dwelling of the rain god Tlaloc, the time when the sun 
rose in line with this mountain as viewed from an ancient pyramid 
(Cuicuilco), and the time when child sacrifices should be offered to Tlaloc in 
order to ensure rain and fertility in the coming growing season. And more 
generally, horizon calendars such as those of the Hopi, or those thought to 
have operated in central Mexico in pre-conquest times, function by directly 
associating time (a particular calendar date) with place (the point on the 
horizon where the sun rises or sets on the day in question). 

Although such arguments give us a number of reasons for seeking as- 


tronomical alignments in the prehistoric context, they also provide a warn- 


ing against pre-judging potential horizon targets of astronomical signifi- 
cance. Thus, while the solstitial directions have an obvious physical reality 
(as the limiting positions of sunrise or sunset on the horizon), the equinoxes, 
in general, do not. They are commonly taken as self-evident horizon targets, 
but in fact they only make sense as half-way points between the solstices in 
space and/or time, and this implies an abstract view of either or both. For a 
Neolithic Briton standing in a sacred stone circle, the date when (say) a cru- 
cial crop should be planted, or when the sun rose behind a particular sacred 
mountain—both very concrete associations (though of very different 
types)—are much more likely to have been significant than the abstract 
equinoxes. This makes it much more difficult for the modern archaeoas- 
tronomer to determine whether any stone circles intentionally incorporated 
symbolic alignments upon sunrise on significant days, since different days 
are likely to have been significant—and so the “targets” would have dif- 
fered—from one stone circle to another. Only solstitial alignments could 
show up consistently in a statistical analysis of several sites taken together.

Star and Crescent Symbol 
A conjunction of the thin crescent moon and the planet Venus is one of the 
most striking sights in the sky—even visible within a modern city where the 


nighttime stars are all but forgotten. The spectacle of these two conspicu-

ous objects hanging close together in a clear blue (and otherwise quite 
empty) sky, either in the early evening or the early morning, is likely to have 
given rise to what is one of the best known and most widespread celestial 
icons—the star and crescent symbol. In various forms it can be found on the 
flags of several modern Islamic countries, including Turkey, Pakistan, Alge- 
ria, and Azerbaijan; on modern coins from European countries such as Italy 
and Romania; on coins from ancient Rome, Greece, and Persia; and even in 
prehistoric rock art from various parts of the world. 

The star and crescent is mostly widely recognized in the modern world 
as a symbol of the Islamic faith, although its origin in this context is much 
older. It originally passed into several Islamic countries from the Ottoman 
Empire, and its use within what is now Turkey can be traced back to the 
third millennium B.c.£. Although it is often claimed that the symbol (in this 
context) owes its origins to a particular astronomical event, several different 
candidates have been proposed, and there is really no firm evidence to sup- 
port any of them. 

Elsewhere, where the symbol arose in quite independent cultural con- 


texts, the motivation is most likely to have been one or more sightings of a 


conjunction of the crescent moon and Venus. This was an event that was 
spectacular but not unduly rare. And one of the most famous rock art de- 
signs in North America including a star and crescent, the so-called “super- 
nova petroglyph” on a rock overhang in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, is ac- 
tually a set of four symbols used to mark a sun-watching station.

Star Compasses of the Pacific 

Micronesian and Polynesian navigators used the stars in different ways to 
help them find their way across the open waters of the Pacific Ocean at 
night. One method was to learn the sequence of stars that would rise or set 
in the direction in which one wished to sail—the relevant star path or 
kavienga (as it was known in Tonga). The New Zealander David Lewis 
recorded a few surviving stone structures used for committing a given star 
path to memory. A single sighting stone in Tonga and two sets of sighting 
stones in the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) farther to the north seem to have 
been set up to mark the directions to various distant islands. (The direction 
marked was usually somewhat displaced from the actual azimuth of the tar- 
get island, so that landfall could be achieved by running with the prevailing 
wind and current.) By sighting along one of these lines sufficiently often and 
for sufficiently long periods, the novice navigator would come to recognize 
the succession of stars that marked a particular course. On the island of 
Beru in Kiribati, Lewis observed the continuing use of a stone canoe fora 
similar purpose. 

When traveling greater distances, following more complex courses, or 
exploring rather than traveling to predetermined and familiar places, navi- 
gators needed a wider knowledge of the stars in order to set different courses 
from different locations in the ocean. The difficulty is that there are so many 
stars in the sky that to memorize the rising and setting positions of many 
hundreds of them would surely be impracticable. One Micronesian example 
of a star compass, which was analyzed in detail by the ethnographer Ward 
H. Goodenough in the 1950s, overcame this problem in a clever way. (It ex- 
isted in a number of slightly different forms among the Caroline Islands of 
the western Pacific, although the underlying principles are common to all the 


variants.) The Carolinian navigator typically relied on just fifteen reference 


stars or star groups whose rising and setting positions marked thirty direc- 
tions around the horizon. The north and south directions, in addition, were 
indicated by Polaris and the upright Southern Cross. The relative positions 
of these thirty-two guide points around the horizon were carefully memo- 
rized: the spacing was not particularly regular, but then it didn’t need to be. 

In practice, at a given time on a given night, few of the guide stars 
would generally be anywhere near to rising or setting, and many would not 
be visible in the sky at all. However, the Carolines are situated quite close to 
the equator, and the paths of the stars through the sky in this region are more 
or less vertical (this is only not the case in the vicinity of the celestial poles). 
This means that it was relatively easy to trace the paths of visible stars down 
to the horizon. This technique provided a number of reference points. The 
experienced navigator could then fill in the gaps and deduce the positions of 
all of the thirty-two guide directions that constituted his mental compass in 
order to orient himself. 

No such detailed accounts exist of star compasses in Polynesia, al- 
though it is clear from the accounts of Captain James Cook and other early 
European explorers that Polynesians made extensive use of directional stars 
for navigation. There is, however, a suggestion that a navigational device in 
the form of a large hollowed-out gourd was used in Polynesia. The “sacred 
calabash” was carried in the canoe for use as a horizon compass or a sort of 
sextant for determining latitude. This interpretation has been hotly con- 
tested, but there is certainly evidence of the use of navigation gourds in the 
Hawaiian islands after European contact. In addition, at least one Hawaiian 
account recorded in the nineteenth century suggests that large gourds were 
used, back on land, as visual aids for teaching about the skies.

Star Names 

Individual stars and groups of stars have different names in different cul- 
tures, but in order to speak of these we need to identify them unambigu- 
ously using reference names acceptable to everyone. It makes sense to fol- 
low the nomenclature used by modern astronomers. 

Many stars have generally agreed upon proper names, such as Sirius, 
Arcturus, Vega, Rigel, and Betelgeuse. However, just as the world is divided 
into countries, so the sky is now divided up into strictly defined regions— 
modern constellations. This means that all stars, whether named or not, be- 
long to a modern constellation. The convention is to label the most promi- 
nent stars in each constellation, usually in order of brightness but sometimes 
according to their position, using the Greek letters—o, (alpha), B (beta), y 
(gamma), 6 (delta), € (epsilon), ¢ (zeta), and so on—combined with the con- 
stellation name (actually the Latin genitive): thus Sirius, the brightest star in 
Canis Major, is & Canis Majoris. One example best known by its name in 
this form is @ Centauri. 

Each constellation also has a three-letter abbreviation, for example Dra 
for Draco(nis), CMa for Canis Major(is), and Ori for Orion. Thus Betel- 
geuse is o Ori, Rigel is B Ori, and Sirius is «» CMa. Other conventions hold 
for fainter stars but are generally of no relevance to archaeoastronomy or 
ethnoastronomy.

Star of Bethlehem 


According to the Christian scriptures—specifically, the Gospel of St. 
Matthew—wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem to worship the King 
of the Jews, declaring that they had seen his star in the east. As they jour- 
neyed southward to Bethlehem the star went before them until it stopped 
over the place where the child was. Ever since the third century, scholars 
have struggled to find a concrete explanation for what has become known 
as the Star of Bethlehem. Twentieth-century efforts are reflected in scores of 
books and literally hundreds of articles in academic journals. 

Although translations differ, one reading of Matthew’s account, as- 
suming that it does indeed have its basis in observed fact, interprets “star in 
the east” as “star at its rising.” We must then assume that the journey to 


Bethlehem was made when the star was high in the sky ahead of the Magi, 
to the south. Clearly it could not have stopped dead in the sky, so “stopped 
over” is then taken to mean “set behind.” 

Several types of spectacular astronomical phenomena have been identi- 
fied as leading candidates. The historical context, which fixes the date of 
Christ’s birth to around 6 B.C.E., provides a strong constraint. On the as- 
sumption that the Star of Bethlehem was literally a star, but an unfamiliar 
one that suddenly appeared in the sky at the time, an obvious possibility is 
a nova or supernova. The latter is a dying star that gains hugely in bright- 
ness for a short period, typically just a few weeks. Some supernovae are even 
visible by day, so we would not be forced to speculate that the Magi traveled 
by night. Unfortunately, if a supernova had occurred at the time we would 
expect Chinese astronomers to have recorded a “guest star.” They did not, 
unless one counts a “tailed object,” more probably a comet, seen in the 
spring of 5 B.c.E. Another possibility is a conjunction (close coming together) 
of two planets, each themselves among the brightest objects in the sky. In the 
summer and autumn of 7 B.C.E., the planets Jupiter and Saturn passed each 
other three times. Nonetheless, eye-catching as this would have been, they 
would still have been seen as two “stars” and would only have led the way 
at night. Some have argued that it was the succession of several rather un- 
usual astronomical phenomena that augured great events, but this stretches 
credulity even further. 

A serious weakness in all of these arguments is that they fail to take ac- 
count of the Magi’s own worldview. The Magi were astrologers, probably 
from Persia. We know that astrological prognostications of the time derived 
from a complex set of interrelationships between the planets and the zodia- 
cal constellations they appeared in. We also know that each constellation 
had terrestrial associations, and that Aries or Pisces was associated with Ju- 
daea. American astronomer Michael Molnar has recently argued from this 
standpoint that an occultation of the planet Jupiter by the moon (in other 
words, the moon passing directly in front of the planet) that occurred in the 
constellation of Aries in the spring of 6 B.C.E. was an astrological portent of 
enormous significance and pointed directly to the birth of a new king in Ju- 
daea. In Molnar’s reading, Matthew’s “rising in the east” refers to a plane- 
tary heliacal rising, and “stopping” to retrograde motion. Aspects of this in- 
terpretation continue to be strongly debated. Most controversially, the 
occultation in question would actually have been rendered invisible by the 
light of the sun. This would not have diminished its astrological significance, 
but the question remains of whether the astrologers of the time would have 
been able to calculate it. 

Be this as it may, it seems obvious in retrospect that the solution to the 


Star of Bethlehem mystery lies not in events that would be considered con- 


spicuous by modern astronomers but in events that would have stood out in 
terms of the horoscopes generated by the astrologers of the time.

Star Rising and Setting Positions 
Any given star, viewed from a given place, traces the same path across the 
celestial dome night after night. Though it always rises and sets in the same 
place, the time of day when these two events occur alters constantly, getting 
earlier by about four minutes each night. Each of them will occur during 
daylight for about half of the year, and hence be invisible. So also will all or 
part of the star’s daily passage across the sky, whenever the sun is in the sky 
at the same time. When people in the past observed the rising of certain 
stars and aligned sacred structures upon them, the event of particular sig- 
nificance was often the heliacal rise, the annual event when the star first 
rose sufficiently long before the sun to become visible in the predawn sky. 

Observations of the rising and setting of stars are especially useful to 
the navigator wishing to set or maintain a course. Micronesian and Polyne- 
sian navigators, for example, had an excellent knowledge of the stars asso- 
ciated with various directions, and this served them well during their long 
voyages across the Pacific. In practice, such observations are hampered by 
extinction, the dimming of a star’s light due to absorption in the intervening 
atmosphere. This problem is most severe when a star is close to the sea hori- 
zon because its light has had to travel through a great deal more of the 
earth’s atmosphere before it reaches the observer than when it is higher in 
the sky. This is a potential headache for the navigator, as all but the bright- 
est stars may need to be considerably above the horizon to be visible at all. 
However, it is less of a problem close to the equator, where the celestial bod- 
ies rise and set almost vertically. 

Over a long timescale, the slow tumbling of the whole celestial sphere 
due to precession gradually causes the rising and setting positions of stars 
to drift. As a result, the place on the horizon where a star rises or sets in the 


present day may be several degrees away from where it rose or set at the 


time of interest (for example when a monumental alignment was built) sev- 
eral centuries or more in the past. Some stars that (for locations in the 
northern hemisphere) rise and set close to due south (or close to due north 
in the southern hemisphere) may not have appeared above the horizon at 
all at certain times in the past, while others visible then may since have dis- 
appeared. 

Precession limits our confidence when we try to identify putative stel- 
lar alignments at ancient monuments, since there is invariably some (and of- 
ten considerable) uncertainty about the date of construction and use. Ex- 
tinction adds a further complication to the interpretation of such alignments, 
especially at high latitudes where stars rise and set at a considerable angle to 
the vertical, since it is difficult to be sure about exactly where a given star 
was when it appeared or disappeared.

Statistical Analysis 

The need for statistical analysis arises in archaeoastronomy because astro- 
nomical patterns we perceive in the archaeological record may have come 
about purely by chance, or to be more precise, as a result of factors quite 
unrelated to astronomy. Doubts about intentionality can apply to a whole 
range of types of evidence concerning ancient astronomy: monuments 
aligned upon the rising and setting positions of astronomical bodies; dis- 
plays of sunlight and shadow only visible on rare occasions; groups of mon- 
uments placed so that their positions on the ground mimic the shape of a 
constellation; patterns of tally marks carved on rocks or portable artifacts 
that include could have functioned as calendars; and so on. 

In the formative days of archaeoastronomy in the 1960s to 1980s, sta- 
tistical analysis was most extensively applied in assessing monumental align- 
ments. Indeed, this approach came to characterize the “green,” or European, 
approach to archaeoastronomy, which focused on prehistoric monuments 
without the benefit of related historical or written evidence. Broadly speak- 
ing, the approach taken was that pioneered by the Scottish engineer Alexan- 
der Thom, which was to accumulate data from many alignments and deter- 
mine the declination of the horizon point “indicated” by each alignment, 


and then to use statistical methods to determine whether observed declina- 


tion “peaks”—repeated occurrences of particular declinations—were in fact 
significant. If so, then a consistent astronomical purpose was evident and the 
question could be asked, which astronomical body the given declination 
might have corresponded to. 

Devising a suitable statistical test is by no means straightforward. 
Sometimes one can only resort to Monte-Carlo testing, a method by which 
one generates, for example, randomly oriented sets of monuments in the 
computer and sees in what proportion of cases they contain at least as many 
of a particular type of alignment as were found in the “real” data. If the an- 
swer is, say, only once in every thousand runs, then one can conclude that 
the chances of the real data having arisen fortuitously are only one in a thou- 
sand; as this probability is so small, it is fair to conclude that the alignments 
were deliberately intended. However, there are a number of dangers and pit- 
falls with this method. An obvious one is that the data must be fairly se- 
lected. Even leaving out one site simply because it seems to be pointing in a 
different direction from all the rest (and it is often easy enough to find ret- 
rospective reasons for doing this) can badly distort the results and so under- 
mine any statistical conclusions. 

A less obvious but more fundamental difficulty relates to the whole na- 
ture of hypothesis testing in this way. Many statistical procedures assume 
that the hypothesis preceded the data, whereas in an archaeological context, 
a particular interpretation is generally first suggested by the data (or most of 
it), since archaeologists do not have the opportunity for repeated experi- 
ments. The hypothesis that we choose to test may itself be selected from in- 
numerable possibilities. To take an example, it is a well-known though as- 
tonishing fact that if twenty-three people are selected randomly, there is an 
even chance that two of them will have the same birthday. However, if we 
took such a group, observed that two of them had birthdays (say} on July 
27, and on the basis of that chose to assess the chances (test the hypothesis) 
that two July 27 birthdays could have arisen among the group purely fortu- 
itously, we would obtain the result “highly unlikely.” The reason, of course, 
is that we chose to test the “July 27” hypothesis (rather than any one of 364 
others) because the data contained that pattern in the first place. In short, 
statistical methods must be used with considerable care, especially where 
they purport to assign significance levels to particular results. 

Nowadays there is a much greater reliance on simply displaying the 
data. If certain trends are strong enough, then their intentionality is obvious, 
as is the case for the orientations of numerous local groups of later prehis- 
toric tombs and temples in western Europe. Where we need to assess sets of 
measured declinations, Alexander Thom’s method of curvigrams—graphs 
showing accumulations of probability—seems as good a method of visualiz- 


ing the likely significance of repeatedly occurring declinations as any. The 


fair selection of data remains a much more crucial issue. 

In recent years archaeoastronomers have begun to recognize the poten- 
tial of a rather different statistical approach: the Bayesian paradigm. This 
approach allows one to assess data repeatedly against different “prior” ideas 
and to take into account background information. It is especially useful 
where we are trying to integrate different types of evidence, such as histori- 
cal records. 

However, we must look beyond statistical analysis if we wish to do 
more than establish the intentionality of astronomical alignments or other 
astronomically related patterns evident in the archaeological record. No 
amount of statistical analysis can help with the interpretation of their signif- 
icance and meaning to the people who built and used them.

Stone Circles 

The stone circle is a type of later prehistoric monument that is commonly 
found in northwestern Europe but is also found elsewhere in Europe and 
also in certain other parts of the world. Over 1,300 examples survive in 
Britain, Ireland, and Brittany, ranging from a few meters to over 350 me- 
ters in diameter and containing from five to over thirty standing stones. The 
stones at some stone circles are mere stumps and rounded boulders; at oth- 
ers they are great monoliths several meters in height. 

Stone circles are not always found in isolation. They can be found sur- 
rounding tombs, as at Newgrange, or within the banks and ditches of 
henges, as at Avebury; they can also be connected to lines or avenues of 
stones, as at Callanish and Beaghmore. Some of the most complex arrange- 


ments of several circles and stone alignments are the stone monuments of

mid-Ulster. The designs of individual circles are also quite diverse, with a 
number of regional variants. One of the most distinctive of these is the re- 
cumbent stone circle, where one stone is placed on its side. Others include 
stone circles with entrances, circles with outlying standing stones, enbanked 
circles, and “circles” with distinctive shapes such as ellipses or flattened cir- 
cles. (Since many are nowhere near true circles, some have suggested that 
stone circles should more correctly be called “stone rings.”) 

It is difficult to date a stone circle, but most northwest European ex- 
amples are thought to have been built in the Later Neolithic or earlier part 
of the Bronze Age, broadly in the third and second millennia B.c.£. Stones 
were sometimes transported several kilometers to the site; famously (al- 
though exceptionally) the Stonehenge bluestones, weighing up to four tons 
each, were transported over sea and land some three hundred kilometers 
(two hundred miles) from the Preseli mountains in southwest Wales. 

The purpose of stone circles has long been a mystery. Only a minority 
are directly associated with tombs. Cists containing small burials are found 


in some of them, but these are often late additions, perhaps placed at what 


was already an ancient hallowed or ancestral place whose original purpose 
was long forgotten. Other than this, archaeological excavations tend to find 
little in the way of stratigraphy and artifacts, so that for many years stone 
circles were largely ignored by archaeologists—so much so that the British 
archaeologist Aubrey Burl once referred to them as the “personae non gratae 
of British prehistory” (Ruggles 2002, p. 176). Yet an obvious assumption— 
as for any open ring, whether built of earth, timber, or stone—is that they 
demarcated a piece of special or sacred ground, perhaps a place used for a 
ceremonial gathering or ritual activity. This means it makes sense to study 
the form of the rings, their position in the landscape, and their relationship 
to visible features in the surrounding environment, including objects in the 
sky. Such investigations are now carried out by archaeologists, but until late 
in the twentieth century they were the almost exclusive preserve of engineers, 
astronomers, and others from outside the discipline. 

One of the most famous of these was the engineer Alexander Thom, 
who proposed that many British stone circles were laid out using a standard 
unit of measurement, the “megalithic yard,” of 0.83 meters (2.72 feet). He 
also claimed that many evidently noncircular rings represent precise geo- 
metrical constructions, such as ellipses and various types of “flattened cir- 
cle,” laid out using Pythagorean triangles more than a millennium before 
they were (re)discovered by Pythagoras. Given all this, Thom’s other main 
idea—that many stone circles incorporated remarkably precise alignments 
upon the rising and setting positions of the sun, moon, and certain stars— 
seemed less surprising. 

However, time has dealt harshly with the specifics of “megalithic men- 


6 


suration,” “megalithic geometry,” and “megalithic astronomy,” even though 
Thom himself is remembered as an important pioneer in getting people to 
think about such issues. Statistical reappraisals of the diameters of stone cir- 
cles, given the large size of the stones and their often poor state of preserva- 
tion, only gives marginal support for the notion that some common unit 
(perhaps related to the average human pace) was used in setting out many of 
them; there is no sustainable evidence whatsoever for the idea of a precise 
measuring stick being carried the length and breadth of later prehistoric 
Britain. Similarly, the observed shapes of stone circles can all be adequately 
explained by the use of simpler construction techniques: there is no need to 
resort to Thom’s geometrical constructions. Some have even argued that 
these monuments may all simply be poor attempts at circles, or that the pre- 
cise shape didn’t matter and was simply laid out by eye. 

A major problem with studying possible astronomical alignments at 
stone circles is the number of different ways in which such an alignment 
might have been set up: in the direction of the entrance where one exists; in 


the direction of the tallest stone; from the circle center to an outlier where 


one exists, or vice versa; (either way) along the main axis where one can be 
identified (e.g., in the case of an elliptical ring); (either way) between the 
tallest stones; and so on. At many stone circles, many potential alignments 
of various types may exist, making it quite likely—even, in some cases, 
highly probable—that one or more of them will align purely by chance upon 
a prominent feature in the landscape or a major celestial body or event. This 
means that in order to have some degree of confidence that any alignment 
we spot was actually intentional and meaningful, we have to pay particular 
attention to questions of methodology. 

In just a few types of stone circle, one direction of alignment stands out 
from any others as possibly significant. Where this occurs we find some of 
the strongest evidence of an intense interest in the sun and/or moon, al- 
though not consistently. In this context the Scottish recumbent stone circles 
and the Irish axial stone circles are particularly important. However, as with 
mensuration and geometry, the high precision astronomical alignments en- 
visaged by Thom have not withstood the test of time. They simply cannot be 
convincingly demonstrated on the basis of the evidence available. Though 
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, until and unless such evi- 
dence emerges, we have no need to fit chiefs, shamans, or priests obsessed 
with the minutiae of the moon’s motions over several generations into our 
models of later prehistoric societies in Britain and Ireland. 

On the other hand, solar and lunar alignments of less than pinpoint ac- 
curacy are nonetheless highly fascinating. They suggest, for example, that 
circles may have become charged with meaning at certain times, when the 
celestial bodies reached particular configurations in relation to the stones of 
the circle. At some sites, other forms of archaeological evidence reinforce the 
idea of ceremonies taking place when the celestial configuration was right. A 
good example of this is the scatters of moon-reflecting white stones such as 
quartz that are found around the base of the recumbent stone at some Scot- 
tish recumbent stone circles, reinforcing the idea that ceremonies took place 
here by the light of the full moon on a midsummer evening when it appeared 
low over the recumbent stone. Such ideas must be considered in the broader 
context of cosmological ideas that could have viewed these monuments as 
microcosms or placed them conceptually at the very center of the world.

Stonehenge 
Stonehenge, one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, has 
long been associated with astronomy. Situated on the chalk uplands of the 
Wessex region in southern England, in the county of Wiltshire, the monu- 
ment is characterized by its huge sarsen stones, some of which stand over 
seven meters (twenty-two feet) tall. The tallest are the remains of five 
trilithons (two uprights with a horizontal lintel placed across their tops) 
arranged in the shape of a horseshoe, and these are surrounded by what 
was once a continuous ring of only slightly less tall uprights and lintels. Al- 
most unimaginably, these huge stones, weighing up to forty tons apiece, 
were dragged here, down- and uphill, over a distance of some thirty kilo- 
meters (eighteen miles) from the Marlborough Downs to the north. Where 
the stones have collapsed it is possible to see some of the carefully carved 
mortice-and-tenon and tongue-and-groove joints (joints that would nor- 
mally be associated with woodworking) that were used to hold them to- 
gether. The horseshoe is oriented northeastwards. Looking out in this di- 
rection through a well-preserved section of the outer circle of sarsens, one 
sees a much rougher stone, leaning over and badly weathered. This is the 
famous Heelstone, which stands some sixty meters outside the outer ring. 
The purpose and function of the great stone monument at Stonehenge 
has been a source of speculation for centuries. That it was a place of great 
power is self-evident. Regarding astronomy, it has been portrayed variously 
as a cosmic temple, a calendrical device, an observatory, and an eclipse cal- 
culator. Many of these ideas have attracted widespread public interest. 
However, the majority of astronomical theories concerning Stonehenge 
have little hard evidence to support them. Many are based on the idea that, 
at one stage or another, the monument incorporated deliberate architectural 
alignments upon the rising and setting positions of celestial bodies, particu- 
larly the sun or moon. The problem is that every architectural alignment must 
point somewhere, and many factors might have influenced any particular ori- 
entation. Just because a pair of stones is aligned upon, say, the position of 
sunrise at one of the solstices, does not mean that this was deliberate or that 
it meant anything at all to the people who built and used the monument. We 
must be particularly cautious if we only find a modest number of potential as- 
tronomical alignments among a great many possibilities: and there are hun- 


dreds of ways of aligning different pairs of stones at Stonehenge.

stone is visible in the distance to the right of the axial alignment; another stone, probably similar, once stood symmet- 
rically to the left. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


One of the most famous astronomical speculations about Stonehenge is 
that it functioned as a calculating device for predicting eclipses. Put forward 
in the early 1960s in a popular book by Gerald Hawkins entitled Stonehenge 
Decoded, and later elaborated by the astronomer Fred Hoyle, the idea is ba- 
sically that a small number of wooden posts were moved around the Aubrey 
Holes according to strictly defined rules (the two authors suggested different 
methods). When certain configurations were reached, then it was a “danger 
period” when eclipses could occur. 

The Aubrey Holes are a ring of fifty-six pits surrounding the sarsen 
monument, named after the antiquarian John Aubrey who discovered them 
in the seventeenth century. Concrete markers mark their positions for the 
modern visitor. Those who challenged the theory were often asked “why 
were there fifty-six Aubrey Holes, then?” But to try to answer this question 
is to miss the point. There has to be some number of holes in the ring, even 
if it was created for some other purpose; and we may never know with any 
certitude what that purpose was. Some astronomers in the 1960s showed 
that the number fifty-six is not that special with regard to predicting eclipses: 
similar post-moving schemes can be devised with other numbers of holes in 


the circle. Archaeologists know of many similar pit circles in Britain, vary- 


ing in number from less than twenty to over a hundred. The number fifty- 
six is not special, then, either archaeologically or astronomically. Finally, to 
further confound the Hawkins/Hoyle theory, the archaeological evidence 
shows that at least some of the Aubrey Holes at Stonehenge held permanent 
timber posts, albeit possibly after being left open for a time. 

To be plausible, astronomical theories at Stonehenge must be consistent 
with what we know of the chronological development of the monument 
from the many archaeological investigations that have taken place there, 
particularly during the twentieth century. The great sarsen circle and 
trilithons, constructed in about 2400 B.c.E., were not the first construction 
that left its trace at this spot. The smaller bluestones had been brought there 
all the way from the Preseli mountains in South Wales, a distance of some 
300 kilometers (200 miles), perhaps a century earlier. And some four or five 
centuries earlier still, an earthen enclosure, consisting of a circular ditch and 
inner bank, was built here, probably broadly contemporary with the Aubrey 
pits/posts. Yet, more remarkably, the postholes of five huge timber poles, 
erected several millennia earlier, in about 8000 B.c.E., were discovered dur- 
ing the construction of the Stonehenge parking lot in the 1970s. 

During the first half of the third millennium B.c.£., the earthen enclo- 
sure seems to have been left to decay. The ditch silted up and the timber posts 
eventually rotted away, leaving only the Aubrey Holes. People did come, 
though, and carefully placed offerings such as articulated animal bones and 
later animal and human cremations, in the ditch and in the Aubrey Holes 
themselves. The distribution of these offerings around the site is far from 
haphazard and does seem to have been related to the motions of the sun and 
moon, perhaps reflecting the cosmological beliefs of the visitors to what may 
already have been a sacred ancestral site. This recent discovery is important, 
because it demonstrates that in order to understand better how and why 
people’s activities related to the celestial bodies in the past we must try to 
look beyond the architecture of monuments. Archaeological excavations, 
which can reveal evidence of ritualistic activities that have no apparent “ra- 
tional” explanation in our terms, may give us some important insights. 

When stones were first brought to Stonehenge, its axis was changed. It 
was now aligned in the northeast upon midsummer sunrise. In other words, 
at dawn on the longest day of the year (and for some days before and after) 
the sun would have risen squarely between the Heelstone and a companion 
that has since disappeared, a beam of light shining along a corridor of stones 
and into the interior of the sarsen ring. The axis was also aligned, in the 
opposite direction, upon sunset on the shortest day. It is likely that this was 
the real focus of the monument, since the ceremonial approach was along an 
avenue from the northeast, so that people would have approached facing the 


southwest.

Among many other astronomical alignments claimed at Stonehenge, 
one of the most intriguing concerns the four station stones. Two of these re- 
main in situ, just inside the ditch where the timber circle once stood. They 
appear to be broadly contemporary with the first appearance of other stones 
at the site (though this is unconfirmed archaeologically) and formed a rec- 
tangle. The lengths of its sides are in the ratio 5:12, a fact that has led some 
people to speculate that the builders had knowledge of Pythagorean geome- 
try, since this ratio gives a diagonal whose length is a whole number (thir- 
teen) of the same units. The shorter sides of the rectangle are aligned along 
the main axis of the monument, on midsummer sunrise and midwinter sun- 
set, while its longer sides are aligned toward the southeast upon a point close 
to the most southerly rising point of the moon. This alignment has led to 
claims that the latitude of Stonehenge was carefully chosen to optimize this 
arrangement. However, such an argument is flawed on a number of grounds, 
most obviously because the earlier monument had already existed on this 
spot for several centuries. In any case, the optimal latitude would actually be 
well to the south, somewhere in the English Channel. 

In comparison, there is little doubt that the solstitial alignment of the 
main axis of Stonehenge in its later phases was intentional. Its purpose may 


have been as a display of power, showing that this monument, erected with 


a huge input of human labor from exotic materials (stone brought from 
great distances), was in harmony with nature. Its power would reinforce the 
power of those who were seen to be in control of it. Certainly by the middle 
of the third millennium B.c.E., Wessex cheftains were powerful and com- 
manded great long-distance exchange networks. During the ensuing millen- 
nium, dozens of rich and powerful chieftains were buried along with their 
personal treasures in round barrows within sight of Stonehenge, relating in 
some way to the power of this great ancestral monument.

Sun, Motions of 
On any particular day of the year, the sun occupies a certain position 
among the stars. As the celestial sphere turns in the course of its daily (di- 
urnal) rotation, the sun—like all the stars—appears to trace out a line of 
constant “latitude” (for which the technical term is declination) on that ro- 
tating sphere. Unlike the stars, though, during the course of a year—as the 
sun moves gradually along its annual path through the stars, known as the 
ecliptic—its declination changes. It is at its farthest north at the June sol- 
stice, when its declination is about +23.5 degrees, corresponding to the lat- 
itude of the Tropic of Cancer on the earth. Conversely, it is at its farthest 
south at the December solstice, when its declination is about —23.5 degrees, 
corresponding to the terrestrial latitude of the Tropic of Capricorn. Over 
the years its declination varies continuously between these limits in a 
smooth, wave-like manner. In the same way, its rising position moves con- 
tinually to and fro along the eastern horizon, reaching its limits at the sol- 
stices; and the same is true of its setting position in the west. 

If we have an alignment that we suspect relates to the rising or setting 


position of the sun, then we only have to determine the declination of the rel- 


evant point on the horizon in order to deduce when in the year the sun will 
rise or set there. There are always two such times: one when the sun is mov- 
ing north (in the northern hemisphere spring or southern hemisphere au- 
tumn) and the other when it is moving south. There will be a slight uncer- 
tainty of up to a day in each case, mainly because of the leap-year cycle. It is 
convenient to express the resulting dates in terms of the modern Gregorian 
calendar, but when we interpret our alignments, we must bear in mind that 
the people who set them up would have used different calendars. For exam- 
ple, when medieval churches were constructed, the Julian calendar was in 
use. The other complication is that if we delve deeply into the past, we must 
make a slight correction (only normally significant on a time scale of mil- 
lennia) to take into account an effect known as the change in the obliquity 
of the ecliptic.

Superior Planets, Motions of 
The planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn revolve around the sun on orbits 
outside that of Earth. As a result, they travel round the sun more slowly. 
Suppose for a moment that the earth simply vanished, leaving a sentient 
space monster orbiting the sun in its place, its head upward to the north. 
For want of anything better to do, the monster decides to ignore every- 
thing else in the sky but the sun and Mars, keeping its face toward the sun 
and watching Mars gradually progressing around it. At intervals it sees 
Mars pass slowly by the sun on the far side (only rarely will it pass directly 
behind it): this is known as conjunction. Mars is actually traveling to the 
monster’s left, but the monster is traveling faster and in the opposite di- 
rection, so Mars appears to emerge from behind the sun traveling right. As 
Mars continues its journey round the sun, its angle rightward from the sun 
steadily increases, slowly at first, but more rapidly as the monster catches 
it up. Eventually, it passes round behind the monster, an event known as 
opposition, and the sequence is then repeated in reverse on the monster’s 
left until Mars eventually approaches the sun again from the left prior to 
another conjunction. 

The sequence of events for an Earth-based observer reflects those just 


described, except that we view them from the surface of a spinning planet. 


An observer in the northern hemisphere perceives the celestial sphere to be 
turning to the right. If Mars is to the right of the sun, it rises earlier, passes 
across the sky to the right (west) of the sun, and sets earlier. The directions 
are reversed for an observer in the southern hemisphere, whose perceptions 
can be modeled by turning the space monster upside-down. 

About sixty days after conjunction, then, Mars appears in the eastern 
sky before sunrise. This event is known as the heliacal rise—a similar con- 
cept to the heliacal rise of stars. As it gradually draws away westward from 
the sun, it rises earlier and climbs higher in the sky by sunrise. It also in- 
creases in brightness as it comes closer. The changes become more rapid as 
the planet approaches opposition, when it is at its closest and brightest. At 
this time, it rises at about sunset and can be seen in the sky all night before 
setting at about sunrise. The sequence is now repeated in reverse and in mir- 
ror image. The planet increases in distance and decreases in brightness, rap- 
idly at first. It is now visible only in the evenings and gradually approaches 
the sun, appearing ever lower in the sky at sunset and setting earlier. Even- 
tually, it ceases to be visible (this is known as its heliacal setting). This is fol- 
lowed by another conjunction, and the cycle is repeated. 

Returning to the monster for a moment, suppose that it turns its atten- 
tion to the apparent motion of Mars against the background stars. Suppose 
that it now keeps its face toward Mars, watching it pass steadily leftward 
(eastward) through the stars as the weeks and months go past. It probably 
expects this to be fairly uneventful, but it is in for a surprise. As it ap- 
proaches opposition, Mars appears to stop and go into reverse. (Actually, it 
does not stop, because there is a slight up-and-down motion as well, so that 
the path traced out against the stars is a U-shape or loop.) At opposition, it 
appears to be going backward (westward), but then, some days later, it stops 
a second time and resumes its forward (eastward) progress. This phenome- 
non is known as retrograde motion. Around the time Earth is overtaking 
Mars, it is traveling faster than Mars in roughly the same direction, so Mars 
must appear to be moving backward relative to the distant stars. At other 
times the two planets are heading in very different directions, so the compo- 
nent of the earth’s motion in the same direction as Mars is either much 
smaller or, for much of the time, in the opposite direction. This means that 
Mars will still appear to be moving forward in relation to the distant back- 
drop of stars. 

The period between successive occurrences of the same configuration 
(the synodic period) of Mars is 780 days. Invisibility around conjunction 
lasts for about 120 days, and retrograde motion around opposition for 
about 75 days (with wide variations). Jupiter and Saturn, being much farther 
from the sun, progress much more slowly around their orbits, taking several 


years to complete even one circuit. This means that their synodic periods are 


shorter, since these are mainly determined by the rate of the earth’s rotation 
around the sun. However, the essential characteristics of their motions are 
the same as for Mars. The synodic period of Jupiter is 399 days, disappear- 
ance around conjunction lasts for about 32, and retrograde motion for 
around 120. For Saturn the respective figures are 378, 25, and 140 days. 

Retrograde motion was an enigma to pre-Copernican astronomers. 
Some of their solutions—such as the Greek epicycles—were extremely ele- 
gant, but they were ultimately doomed to failure.

Swedish Rock Art 


Scattered among the fertile plains of central and southern Sweden, and 
found on boulders, outcrops, and flat rock surfaces, are a remarkable quan- 
tity of prehistoric rock carvings. Mostly attributed to the Bronze Age, and 
thus dating to the second and the early part of the first millennia B.c.E., they 
include depictions of people, boats, horses, and other animals; wagons and 
wheels; the soles of feet, resembling footprints, either barefoot or wearing 
sandals; and more abstract elements such as spirals, discs, and cup marks. 
Particularly impressive are those sites where we find combinations or accu- 
mulations of scores, or even hundreds, of rock carvings in a single place. 
One small area to the northwest of Stockholm, covering just nine parishes, 


was studied recently by British archaeologist John Coles. It alone was found 


to contain 840 rock art sites containing over 1,500 boats, 350 people and 
animals, and 300 soles of feet, together with around 19,000 cup marks. 

Some Swedish rock carvings have been interpreted as representations of 
ancient constellations and calendars, along with depictions of spectacular 
events such as comets, supernovae, and eclipses. These ideas, developed in 
great detail during the 1980s and early 1990s by the Swedish astronomer 
Goran Henriksson, received a good deal of publicity within Sweden, but also 
proved controversial and even contentious. The main criticism leveled at 
them was that they were highly subjective. Attributing meaning to rock art, 
where there are no “informants” to give us any sort of clue, is notoriously 
difficult—many would say impossible—since meaning is highly dependent 
upon cultural context. Archaeologists, for this reason, normally tend to limit 
themselves to formal analyses of the frequency of certain designs, the loca- 
tion of rock art sites in the landscape, and similar questions, and to broad 
interpretations relating to the cultural setting and to ancient perceptions of 
the environment. Attributing specific meaning to particular carvings is un- 
avoidably speculative and especially dangerous, since there is very wide 
scope for fitting complex explanations to complex data. 

A particular scene found on a rock panel at Ekenburg near the town of 
Norrképing, about 140 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Stockholm, has 
been claimed to depict the sky as seen during a total solar eclipse. The event 
in question took place in 1596 B.c.£. For just under three minutes, as the sun 
was covered by the moon, people would have seen four bright planets and a 
spectacular comet—Comet Encke—close to it in the daytime sky. A set of 
concentric rings with a dagger-like object sticking into one side is interpreted 
as the eclipsed sun with the tail of Comet Encke adjacent to it. Four nearby 
cup marks are interpreted as the planets, and a nearby boat is interpreted as 
a constellation comprising parts of Gemini and Taurus. 

Attractive as it might seem, there are a number of problems with this in- 
terpretation. For one thing, some astronomers dispute the calculation of the 
time of the eclipse, which depends on certain assumptions about the slowing 
of the rate of rotation of the earth. Others point out that the orbit of Encke’s 
Comet cannot be calculated prior to c.z. 1100 owing to a close encounter 
with Jupiter. In any case, the attribution of this particular astronomical event 
is speculative; the choice of which carvings are included while other adjacent 
ones are dismissed as not part of the eclipse scene is arbitrary (and influenced 
by the interpretation being put forward); and the goodness of fit—in other 
words, the positions of (for example) the cup marks compared with the posi- 
tions of the actual planets in the sky at the time—is not good. 

The lesson to be learned here is a methodological one. Enthusiasm in fit- 
ting an astronomical explanation to an archaeological phenomenon is no sub- 


stitute for fairly assessing the data. Fitting a complex astronomical explana- 


tion to complex archaeological data brings the danger that any number of 
different, equally complex theories might fit the data equally well. If this is 
so, then we cannot claim that the evidence supports our theory in particular. 
How, then, do we estimate how many other complex explanations could 
have fit equally well? This is not an easy question to answer and not always 
of immediate interest to those who see that the data appear to fit their fa- 
vored theory well enough; but a scientific approach demands that we be pre- 
pared to consider this question, and that we make a serious attempt to as- 
sess it fairly.

Symbols 

Many archaeologists now believe that it is possible to reconstruct elements 
of human cognition from material remains. But in order to do so, it is cru- 
cial to recognize a means of expression unique to human beings: the use of 
symbols. The digit “2,” for example, is a symbol used by Europeans to de- 
fine a certain numerical concept. But if a hypothetical future archaeologist, 
ignorant of all other aspects of twentieth-century European culture, were to 
try to interpret the digit “2” carved, say, on an isolated stone, they could 
not deduce its meaning from the form of the symbol alone. On the other 
hand, they might be able to deduce something from the fact that stones 
marked “1 km,” “2 km,” “3 km,” etc. occurred at intervals a fixed distance 
apart by the side of a road. The context of the symbols—their association 
with one another, as well as their association with the road, which seems 
relevant to the way in which they were used, and their spatial distribution— 
clearly does suggest possible meanings. A complication is that symbols may 
mean several different things at once; they may convey different meanings 


to different people, some of which may be very different from those in- 


tended; and the meanings may well change through time. But just as the 
Stars and Stripes would be recognized by virtually everyone in the modern 
world as a symbol of the United States, people sharing a common cultural 
background are likely to perceive common sets of meanings. It is this set of 
shared meanings that gives us some hope of retrieving meanings that reflect 
certain worldviews. 

Designs found in prehistoric rock art, especially those that do not ob- 
viously “literally” represent something like an animal, may have had sym- 
bolic meaning, and it is possible to try to deduce something about that mean- 
ing from its context. For example, it has been suggested that many circles 
and rayed circles in megalithic art all round the Atlantic fringe of Europe 
may be sun symbols or representations. Such a design, along with other dec- 
orations, was carved onto the back corbel of the roof-box above the en- 
trance of the Neolithic passage tomb at Newgrange, Ireland. The tomb was 
apparently designed so that shortly after sunrise on days around winter sol- 
stice, the sun would shine through the roof-box and down the nineteen-me- 
ter-long passage, reaching the chambers in the interior of the tomb. 

Can we do more than simply recognize possible symbols and possible 
meanings? Can we use them to reconstruct elements of other worldviews? 
What gives us hope is the human propensity to express and reinforce the na- 
ture of the cosmos, as a given group of people perceives it, in many different 
ways in order to keep their own lives and activities in harmony with the 
world. Verbal or visual metaphors might be expressed in myth, exhibited in 
activities that we might interpret as either ritualistic or mundane (or both), 
or displayed in architecture. For example, hogans, traditional round or oc- 
tagonal buildings built by Navajo families in the southwestern United States, 
reflect the harmony of the cosmos in various ways. Their single door faces 
the rising sun, and the space within is conceptually divided into four quar- 
ters used in different ways, reflecting the four directions of the cosmos and 
their associated properties and qualities. Movement within the hogan is al- 
ways clockwise, reflecting the motion of the sun around the sky. 

Where we have only the material record to go by, associations between 
symbols, if we can fathom their meaning, may give us insights into corre- 
spondences that form part of a worldview. We might notice, for example, the 
consistent orientation of hogans toward the solar rising arc in the east; if in 
addition we consistently found material evidence of different activities in the 
four quarters of the hogan, we might correctly deduce the quadripartite 


structure of the Navajo cosmos.

Taulas 

Taulas are a distinctive type of later prehistoric monument found exclu- 
sively on the Mediterranean island of Menorca. Attributed to the talayotic 
culture—so called because it is characterized by a type of dry-stone tower 
known as a talayot—they date broadly to the late second and early first 
millennia B.C.E. Taulas consist of two large rectangular blocks of stone, one 
standing upright and the other placed across the top, balanced centrally, so 
as to form a shape resembling the letter “T.” These were placed within 
stone-walled precincts. One side of the “T” was worked flat and smooth. 
This side faced the visitors as they came in through the single entrance, as 
well as the wider landscape beyond. Each major village seems to have had 
its taula, and some twenty-five examples are known, in various states of 
preservation, scattered about the small island. 

The orientations of taulas (and the precinct entrances) are not random; 
they face generally southwards, within a range from southeast to south- 
southwest. In every case there is an uninterrupted view out to a distant hori- 
zon, suggesting that it was important to have a clear view of the sky in that 
direction. Yet this direction does not correspond to that of the rising or set- 
ting position of the sun, moon, or planets, leaving only the possibility that 
the taulas were aligned on certain stars. It is possible that the asterism of in- 
terest was the Southern Cross and Pointers, a very conspicuous group of 
bright stars appearing low in the southern sky at this latitude in the second 
millennium B.c.£. This might also explain the puzzling fact that no taulas are 
found on neighboring Mallorca, despite the fact that talayots are equally 
abundant there. Mallorca, unlike Menorca, is mountainous and the land- 
scape around the principal Mallorcan villages (concentrated in the fertile 
northern part of the island) would not have permitted a clear view of the 
southern sky. In other words, people living on Mallorca had no possibility 
of seeing the Southern Cross and so did not build taulas. However, if the 
Menorcan taulas were indeed linked inextricably with the Southern Cross 


and Pointers, then the passage of time would have presented the ancient

Menorcans with a problem. Owing to precession, these stars dropped lower 
and lower in the southern skies as the centuries progressed, until by the on- 
set of the first millennium B.c.E. they were hardly visible at all. 

Taulas certainly had sacred associations, as is clear from broken stat- 
ues and sacrificed animal bones strewn about the precincts. In one case 
these included a statue of the Egyptian god of medicine, Imhotep, complete 
with a hieroglyphic inscription; at another, excavations uncovered a hoof 
from a bronze statue, evidently of a horse (or centaur), the remainder pre- 
sumably having been plundered. Since there is no other evidence of local 
horse gods, this again suggests links with the eastern Mediterranean. In an- 
cient Egypt, it was common to associate gods and goddesses with stars and 
constellations, and in Greek mythology the god of medicine, Asclepius 
(counterpart to the Egyptian Imhotep), was tutored by a centaur—Chiron. 
Tentatively weaving together these threads, the British historian of astron- 
omy Michael Hoskin suggested that the taula sanctuaries may have been 
places of healing and were oriented upon the constellation of the centaur— 
Centaurus. The Southern Cross and Pointers are at the feet of the centaur 
in the sky, the Pointers (& and B Centauri) forming the two brightest stars 


of the modern constellation.

Temple Alignments in Ancient Greece 

The first systematic study of temple orientations in ancient Greece was car- 
ried out by Heinrich Nissen in the nineteenth century. William Dinsmoor, 
carrying out another study in the 1930s, concluded that almost three quar- 
ters (73 percent) of them were oriented eastward within the range of sun- 
rise. Some were oriented on sunrise on the feast day of the deity to whom 
the temple was dedicated. One example is the Parthenon itself, dedicated to 
Athena. It is not only aligned upon the sunrise on the feast day of Athena 
but also upon a prominent hill—Mount Hymettos. How widespread or 
long-lasting this practice was is a hard question to answer. The evidence is 
complicated by the fact that many temples were reconstructed on a differ- 
ent orientation or their dedication was changed. Historical sources also 
make it clear that sunrise was not always the principal concern. The Greek 
writer Vitruvius, in his work De Architectura, indicates that there was 
sometimes a preference for facing nearby cities or directions of approach 
along rivers or roads. 

It has been suggested that the predominantly easterly orientation of 
Greek temples may reflect broader orientation practices extending back as 
far as the Bronze Age. The Minoan culture survived on the island of Crete 
until the middle of the second millennium B.c.£., after which the Mycenaeans 
from the Greek mainland took control. Elements of both Mycenaean and 
Minoan orientation practices may have come to influence Archaic and, in 
due course, Classical Greek temples, but the practice of easterly orientation 


seems to derive from the Minoans. Studies of the orientations of over three

hundred Bronze Age passage tombs on Crete, dating back to the mid-third 
millennium B.c.E., show a very strong easterly trend, with over 80 percent of 
them lying within the solar arc. An even higher proportion (about 87 per- 
cent) are within the slightly wider lunar arc. Over half the data are derived 
from a single cemetery, Armenoi in western Crete. Each of the more than 
two hundred tombs there is oriented within the range of moonrise; and it is 
surely not coincidental that three kilometers (two miles) to the east is Mount 
Vrysinas, upon whose summit was a peak sanctuary apparently, although 
not certainly, dedicated to a moon goddess. 

The development of mathematical astronomy in ancient Greece from 
around 400 B.c.E. onward seems to have derived in large part from ancient 
Babylonia. However, in constructing large stone temples as far back as the 
seventh century B.C.E., the ancient Greeks acquired both inspiration and 
technological expertise from ancient Egypt. This linkage opens up the possi- 
bility that some of the more symbolic aspects of Greek temple construction, 


such as architectural alignments upon celestial objects, also derived from an- 


cient Egypt, where there is cultural continuity stretching back into the third 
millennium B.c.£. Studying the common aspects of astronomical symbolism 
incorporated in Greek and Egyptian temples may throw more light on this 
possibility in the future.

Teotihuacan Street Grid 

Teotihuacan was the first pre-industrial city in the New World. Rising to 
prominence in about 100 B.c.£., it subsequently reached massive propor- 
tions, supporting at its height (between about c.£. 350 and 650) a popula- 
tion of around 200,000 and covering some twenty square kilometers (eight 
square miles). This entire area was partitioned by a regular street grid into 
about two thousand rectangular “apartment compounds,” some containing 
groups of occupational specialists and others housing different social 
classes or ethnic groups. Most remarkable of all is the ceremonial center, its 
wide main street (the so-called Street of the Dead) lined with splendid court- 
yards, palaces, and temples. It also contained the two great pyramids that 
have subsequently become known as the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyra- 
mid of the Moon. 

Like many other Mesoamerican cities, the street grid is precise and ori- 
ented slightly askew from the cardinal directions. There are two different 
parts to the city, one around the Pyramid of the Sun, which deviates from the 
cardinal directions by about 15.5 degrees clockwise, and another farther to 
the south that deviates by about 16.5 degrees. Curiously, quite a large area 
in between seems to follow one north-south convention but the other an 
east-west one, resulting in street intersections, and even individual buildings, 
that have corners of around eighty-nine degrees and ninety-one degrees. 

In all likelihood, one or two different sightings fixed the original align- 
ments in each direction and were then propagated as more streets were con- 
structed. But what was being sighted upon? One possibility is that the north- 
south direction reflects the orientation of the Pyramid of the Sun directly upon 
the hill Cerro Gordo to the north. Indeed, when viewed from the south, the

tesy of Clive Ruggles) 


pyramid does seem to “reference” the hill behind by mimicking its shape. Oth- 
ers have argued that the focus of interest was topographic features on the east- 
ern horizon. But it may be misleading to consider the Teotihuacan street grid 
in isolation. Systematic studies of the orientations of the street grids of 
Mesoamerican cities show that deviations of between fifteen degrees and eigh- 
teen degrees clockwise from north-south-east-west are surprisingly common; 
indeed, they form a distinctive orientation group. This characteristic strongly 
implies that they were fixed using a common astronomical determinant. 

Yet no overwhelmingly convincing possibilities emerge, especially 
among celestial objects rising to the east. A possible explanation of the east- 
west direction is that it aligned in the west with the horizon setting position 
of the Pleiades, but if so it is curious that the orientations of structures span- 
ning many centuries remained on the same orientation, while the setting di- 
rection shifted owing to precession. Another possibility is that the direction 
corresponds to sunset on April 30 and August 13, dates significant because 
the longer interval between them is exactly 260 days, or the length of the sa- 
cred cycle that was a defining feature of all Mesoamerican calendars.

Theodolite Surveys 

The theodolite, sometimes referred to in the United States as a surveyor’s 
transit, is the surveying instrument that is most useful in determining the as- 
tronomical potential of structural alignments at archaeological sites such as 
prehistoric monuments. Although the designs of theodolites vary consider- 
ably, as they have throughout the century or so that they have been manu- 
factured, their fundamental components remain invariable. These consist of 
a telescope that can be pointed in any direction, together with two gradu- 
ated circles, mounted horizontally and vertically, which enable that direc- 


tion to be defined quantitatively. In order to determine the astronomical po- 


tential of (say) a point on the horizon as viewed from a given observing po- 
sition—in other words, to determine the apparent positions of the distant 
celestial bodies in relation to that closer feature—the direction of that point 
from the observer is precisely what we need. 

Any direction can be defined in terms of two angles: a horizontal angle 
measured around from some suitable zero point, and a vertical angle meas- 
ured up or down from level. Determining the second of these is straightfor- 
ward. When a theodolite is first set up on its tripod, a leveling process in- 
volving various bubbles ensures that the vertical circle is properly zeroed and 
will give us the required angle, which is known as the altitude. The situation 
regarding the horizontal angle is more complicated. The leveling process en- 
sures that the horizontal circle is truly horizontal, but the zero point on this 
scale will be pointing in an arbitrary direction. What we actually want is the 
angle measured clockwise around from true north, which is known as the az- 
imuth. However, generally we can’t know the direction of true north (at 
least, to the required accuracy) in advance. What is normally done in prac- 
tice is to measure what is called the horizontal plate bearing: the clockwise 
angle around from the arbitrary zero point. We must make the adjustment 
from plate bearings to azimuths in retrospect. This will involve making the 
same correction to each reading, by adding the actual azimuth of the zero 
point, sometimes known as plate bearing zero or PBZ. 

But how do we determine PBZ once we have set up the theodolite? 
One way is to take a series of timed observations of the sun (it is very im- 
portant not to look through the telescope when it is pointing at the sun, but 
the sun’s image can be projected on to a piece of paper). The plate bearing 
of each reading can then be compared with the sun’s actual azimuth as de- 
termined using published or on-line ephemerides. Each direction we meas- 
ure (e.g., of a point on the horizon) will eventually be defined in terms of 
azimuth and altitude, from which we can calculate the declination and 
hence know what rises and sets there, or would have risen and set there at 
any given era in the past. 

A modern theodolite will typically measure the azimuth and altitude 
of a distant object to a precision of twenty arc seconds or better. For work 
that does not warrant anything like this sort of accuracy, it may be possible 
to obtain the necessary information on site using a magnetic compass and 
a clinometer, or by using large-scale topographic maps or digital topo- 
graphic data. 

In addition to determining the directions of horizon points, etc., it is im- 
portant to fix the position of the theodolite in space, for example, in relation 
to a monument. This can be done using a tape, but modern surveying in- 
struments are very useful for this. Theodolites incorporating an electronic 


distance measurement device (EDM) provide a convenient way of determin- 


ing the distance between the instrument and a reflector placed within a range 
of distances appropriate for most site surveys. Total Stations combine this 
technology with a computer chip that can convert direction-and-distance de- 
terminations of measured points into positions in space expressed in a cho- 
sen coordinate system. They can also store measurements for downloading 
directly to a computer, which not only allows the surveyor to dispense with 
the task of recording measurements manually on site, but also allows for a 
quick display of the results, using appropriate software.

Thom, Alexander (1894-1985) 


Alexander Thom is widely acknowledged as one of the founding fathers of 
modern archaeoastronomy. An engineer by profession, he was also a keen 
amateur astronomer, and he was aware from an early age of the writings of 
Sir Norman Lockyer on the possible astronomical significance of ancient 
stone monuments in his native Scotland and elsewhere in the British Isles. 
His own active interest in the megalithic monuments of Britain, and partic- 
ularly in his native Scotland, is said to have been aroused in 1933 by the 
sight, one evening as he was sailing in the Outer Hebrides looking for an 
anchorage, of one of the stone circles at Callanish silhouetted against the 
rising moon. Twenty years and many dozens of site surveys later, he began 
to publish research papers in which he proposed three ideas that, during the 
1960s and 1970s, would shake the archaeological world. 

The first of Thom’s ideas was that stone circles were laid out using a 
precisely defined unit of measurement, which he called the “megalithic 
yard.” The second, and related, idea was that each circle was laid out ac- 
cording to one of a small number of particular geometrical designs using 
techniques based upon Pythagorean triangles. The third idea was that a va- 
riety of “megalithic sites” incorporated alignments of remarkable precision 
upon the rising and setting positions of various celestial bodies. Taken to- 
gether, these showed that “megalithic man,” to use Thom’s own term, was a 
competent engineer with considerable technical knowledge, whose accom- 
plishments included sophisticated numeration, geometry, and astronomy— 
three things that would come to be known together as “megalithic science.” 


Thom’s ideas first appeared in book form in 1967, in a slim but highly tech- 


nical volume called simply Megalithic Sites in Britain, which contained the 
detailed analysis of survey results from over 250 standing stone monuments. 

Thom’s second book, Megalithic Lunar Observatories, published in 
1971, set the archaeological world into a turmoil that did not calm down 
fully until more than a decade later. His claim was that many standing stone 
monuments were deliberately aligned upon “notches” and other features in 
distant mountainous horizons, and that these horizon points marked ex- 
treme rising and setting points of the moon with incredible precision. To at- 
tain that level of precision, prehistoric astronomers would have had to carry 
out meticulous programs of observation, following them consistently for 
years if not decades (in other words, over generations). The problem was 
that these conclusions were completely unpalatable to most prehistorians at 
the time. Their social models, informed by a variety of archaeological evi- 
dence, simply did not fit with such ideas. Yet Thom’s results could not eas- 
ily be refuted: they were based on careful fieldwork and supported by rigor- 
ous statistical analysis. 

When detailed reappraisals of Thom’s ideas on “megalithic astron- 
omy” were eventually completed in the 1980s, it emerged that the sup- 
posed astronomical sightlines of very high precision could all be explained 
away as chance occurrences. On the other hand, certain groups of monu- 
ments, such as the recumbent stone circles of eastern Scotland and the 
short stone rows of western Scotland and southwest Ireland, definitely did 
contain consistent lunar alignments, though at a much lower degree of pre- 
cision, that could not be ignored. Similarly, although the idea of a precise 
“megalithic yardstick” being used all over Britain is not sustainable as 
Thom conceived of it, the idea that there was a widespread practice of lay- 
ing out stone circles and other monuments using broadly consistent meas- 
urements based upon the human body (such as arm lengths or paces) re- 
mains a distinct possibility. 

In hindsight, even though Thom’s theories have been largely super- 
seded, his work led archaeologists to start thinking about issues and facing 
problems that they had largely avoided. In particular, Thom’s work moti- 
vated others to investigate intentional astronomical alignments at prehistoric 
monuments and eventually resulted in this area of study becoming archaeo- 
logically informative and respectable. Finally, Thom pioneered ways of car- 
rying out site surveys using a theodolite, analyzing the data, and presenting 
the results that are now a fundamental part of field methodology within ar- 
chaeoastronomy.

Thornborough 

Situated on a gravel plateau near Thornborough in Yorkshire, northern 
England, is a remarkable monument consisting of not just one, but an align- 
ment of three large, round Neolithic earthwork enclosures with high outer 
banks, known as henge monuments. The three henges are almost identical 
in size and form, each being some two hundred meters across with two en- 
trances on opposite sides, and they are more or less equally spaced some 
five hundred meters apart, forming an alignment over 1.5 kilometers (1 
mile) long. The entrances are oriented along the alignment. Surrounding the 
henges are a number of other prehistoric features, including two large pits, 
which appear to have held sizeable wooden posts, aligned upon a double 
ring-ditch that represents the remains of a ploughed-out barrow. 

What makes this monument fascinating from an astronomical point of 
view is the possibility that it was a pilgrimage center whose astronomical as- 
sociations tell us not only the time of year when the major ceremonies took 
place here, but also reveal how people from far afield may have known when 
to set out in order to arrive in time for those ceremonies. 

A number of factors support the pilgrimage center idea. First, the 
henges were constructed along what is known from other archaeological ev- 
idence to have been an important routeway. Second, the formal design of the 
monuments was evidently important, and it developed over time. The henges 
are embellishments of earlier, smaller earthwork enclosures, and the central 
one was built over the central part of an earlier linear earthwork known as 
a cursus monument, itself over two kilometers (1.5 miles) long. Third, the 
high outer banks would have obscured the view of the distant skyline (some- 
thing that is still evident from what remains of the banks today), and this 
suggests that the henge interiors were exclusive places, cut off from the out- 
side world. Fourth, archaeological field-walking has revealed an almost 
complete absence of surface scatters of flints from the area immediately 
around the henges, strongly implying that this was not a place where people 
routinely lived and worked. Finally, and most extraordinarily, about one 
kilometer (half a mile) to the east is a large concentration of surface flint, but 
a good deal of it is non-local and from scattered sources, and lightly worked. 


It appears that people came here from some distance and brought the stone 


with them, which implies in turn that this may have been a visitors’ en- 
campment, rather than a permanent settlement. 

There are a number of locations at the site where prominent features 
of the monument seem to frame parts of the horizon. Intriguingly, several 
of these align upon the same asterism, namely the three stars of Orion’s belt. 
It is worryingly easy to identify potential astronomical, and particularly 
stellar, alignments at almost any site, whether or not they were intentional. 
But this consistency argues in favor of the Thornborough alignments being 
deliberate. Viewing along the cursus to the west, the three stars would have 
been framed by the western terminal as they set. Viewing along the line of 
the two large timber posts, toward the barrow, an observer would have seen 
them rising in the alignment. And by the time the bright star Sirius rose, in 
roughly the same alignment, Orion’s belt would have moved up and to the 
right, to be in line with the henge alignment itself and visible from the henge 
interiors over their southern entrances. A final, more speculative suggestion 
is that the three henges themselves formed a representation on the ground 
of Orion’s belt. Because of precession, the rising and setting positions of any 
star or group of stars varies significantly over a time scale of centuries. 
Though it is highly inadvisable to try to date sites astronomically by fitting 
stars to alignments, precession serves at Thornborough to reinforce the 
Orion’s belt alignments, in that the “best fit” dates are wholly compatible 
with the archaeological estimates of the dates of different features at the 
monument. 

If Thornborough really was a pilgrimage center, then two questions 
arise. Were there particular times when people congregated here, perhaps for 
large ceremonies? And if so, and if people had to come from some distance, 
how did they know when to leave in order to arrive on time? 

The astronomical associations of the site may provide answers to both 
questions. The annual first appearance of Orion’s belt in the eastern sky be- 
fore dawn—its heliacal rise—would have occurred in the late summer. The 
annual reappearance of Sirius—the brightest star in the sky—would have oc- 
curred two or three weeks later. Once Orion’s belt had appeared in the 
predawn sky, it could have provided the necessary reminder for surrounding 
peoples that a ceremony was imminent. The actual ceremony could then 
have taken place somewhat later, at the time of the dawn reappearance of 
Sirius, with Orion’s belt now prominently visible above the southern en- 
trance of each henge just before dawn. Such a ceremony would have taken 
place in early autumn, when the harvests were in and the seasonal workload 
had eased up for a while. 

This interpretation of the Thornborough henges was made possible us- 
ing a combination of sky visualization software and virtual reality software. 


It shows the potential of this type of approach in contrast to the more tra- 


ditional procedure, which is to survey horizon alignments and then calcu- 
late declinations.

Tri-Radial Cairns 


Tri-radial cairns are a distinctive type of Bronze Age monument found on 
the moorlands of northern England, comprising three radial “arms” of 
stones, typically no more than two meters (six feet) long and half a meter 
(two feet) high, extending out from a common center. Modest in size and 
easily mistaken for sheep shelters or other more modern constructions, their 
status as prehistoric monuments was only recognized in the 1990s. Over 
twenty examples are now known, with a major concentration of eight at 
Lordenshaws in Northumberland. 

The state of preservation of the known tri-radial cairns varies. It is of- 
ten difficult to determine with any great precision the original direction of 
each of the arms, even assuming that they were straight in the first place. 
Nonetheless, there is a clear general consistency in the orientations, and this 
invites an astronomical explanation. In each case one of the arms points ap- 
proximately due north, always to within about thirty degrees and in the ma- 
jority of cases to within ten degrees. The remaining two arms point south- 
eastward and southwestward respectively, with a similar scatter in the 
“best-fit” directions. 

A group from the Border Archaeological Society who discovered the 
cairns has suggested that they might have been constructed by making ob- 
servations of the sun around the time of the summer solstice. The technique 
would have been to erect a vertical post and to build the three arms in the 


direction of the shadow at sunrise, noon (when the shadow is shortest), and 


sunset. This might not have been done to any great precision, so we might 
expect a considerable scatter in the resulting orientations even at the time of 
construction. (It would also require clear skies, but given the tiny change in 
the sun’s motions on days near the solstice, there would be many opportu- 
nities to take advantage of suitable weather conditions.) The result would be 
radial orientations concentrated around azimuths of 0 degrees, 135 degrees, 
and 225 degrees respectively. 

But there is a simpler explanation that fits the data just as well—in fact, 
better. Suppose that one arm was oriented to the north, either by using the 
sun’s shadow at noon (on any day of the year), or by reference to the diur- 
nal motions of the stars at night, the other two arms being simply placed at 
regular intervals round the cairn. This would result in radial orientations 
concentrated around azimuths of 0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees. 
Of course this begs the question of why the chosen number of arms was 
three, but the explanation could well have nothing to do with astronomy. 

There is no conclusive evidence to support either of these explanations, 
but the fact that they are both viable shows the dangers of fitting particular 
astronomical orientations too readily, and not considering equally plausible 
alternatives. It also demonstrates the principle known as Occam’s razor, 
which advises us that there is no need to resort to a complex hypothesis to 
explain some data if a simpler one will explain the data just as well. Here, 
the “regular spacing” explanation is arguably the simpler one and more con- 
sistent with the data.

Venus in Mesoamerica 

The planet Venus is the third brightest regularly visible object in the skies, 
behind the sun and moon. Its cycle of morning and evening appearances 
was well known to the ancient Mesoamericans, partly because it seemed to 
fit naturally with other astronomical cycles, in that five Venus cycles ex- 
actly equaled eight year-cycles of 365 days. In fact, five Venus cycles do not 
quite equal eight years, and we would view the near-coincidence of these 
two periods merely as an accident of nature. The ancient Mesoamericans, 
on the other hand, saw it as a significant property of the cosmos and this 
had two far-reaching consequences. The first was that they, and particu- 
larly the Maya, could integrate cycles of Venus with ease into the other in- 
termeshing cycles of their calendar. Direct evidence of the care with which 
the synodic cycles of Venus were observed by the Maya comes from the 
Dresden Codex, where the motions of the planet are carefully tabulated 
and correlated with other astronomical cycles. The heliacal rising of Venus 
was probably the most significant event to the Maya, and certainly a time 
of dread for the Aztecs. 

The second consequence was that Venus appeared to have a relation- 
ship with the seasons, even though a particular seasonal configuration of 
Venus would only recur after eight years, and so Venus became strongly as- 
sociated with rain, fertility, and maize. It also appears to have become 
strongly associated with warfare and ritual sacrifice, with military cam- 
paigns carefully timed according to Venus-related prognostications. The 
two are related, since one of the main purposes of human sacrifice was to 
petition the gods for rain. There was also a clear association between Venus 
and the sacred ballgame played throughout Mesoamerica; this is evident 


from the common occurrence of Venus symbols both in depictions of the 


game in codices and on the garments and body decoration worn by the 


players themselves.

Wedge Tombs 

Wedge tombs are a distinctive type of megalithic passage tomb found all 
over Ireland, but mainly in the west. Over five hundred examples are 
known, and while they vary widely in size, they do have a defining charac- 
teristic: a trapezoidal central chamber, its sides formed by two lines of 
large, upright stones (orthostats), which is wider and higher toward the en- 
trance end, forming a wedge shape. The bulk of wedge tomb construction 
took place in the second half of the third millennium B.c.£., placing them 
chronologically toward the end of a rich tradition of Neolithic tomb con- 
struction in Ireland. 

The other property that confirms the wedge tombs as a useful category 
of monuments is the strong consistency in their orientations. Nearly all 
known examples face the western arc of the horizon, with the majority fac- 
ing southwest. It is unusual to have such a clear preference for westerly ori- 
entation among a group of Neolithic tombs, let alone such a substantial one. 
The only other example in Britain or Ireland is the few dozen Clava cairns 
of northeast Scotland. The fact that the Clava cairns also seem to represent 
a late development suggests that a strong predilection for westerly/south- 
westerly orientations only developed toward the end of the Neolithic. A sim- 
ilar preference is evident in the orientations of the axial stone circles of 
southwest Ireland, a region where there is a major concentration of wedge 
tombs, as well as among the recumbent stone circles of northeast Scotland, 
which occupy an area close to that where the Clava cairns are found. 

What is the astronomical significance of the wedge tombs? Viewed in 
the context of groups of later prehistoric temples and tombs found all over 
western Europe, their pattern of orientation fits the “sun descending or set- 
ting” model. In other words, each tomb was oriented upon a position where 
the sun was seen either to set, or to be descending in the sky, on a signifi- 
cant day—perhaps the day on which construction was begun. However, 
there is one well-studied example that provides tantalizing evidence of more 
particular concerns. This is the tomb of Altar, situated on the south coast of 


the Mizen peninsula at the very extreme of southwest Ireland, close to the 
village of An Tuar Mér (Toormore). 

The Altar tomb commands a clear view down toward the tip of the 
Mizen peninsula, and is directly oriented upon the conspicuous Mizen Peak, 
which forms a distinctive pyramid shape on the horizon some twelve kilo- 
meters (eight miles) away. Added to this, the tomb’s orientation may have 
had a calendrical significance. As was first pointed out by Boyle Somerville, 
who surveyed the monument in 1931, it is oriented upon the position of sun- 
set within a couple of days of February 4 and November 5. These are two of 
the mid-quarter days, which along with the solstices, equinoxes, and the 
other two mid-quarter days divide the year into eight equal parts. This in- 
terested Somerville because the November date corresponded to the festival 
of Samhain in the Celtic calendar. 

The problems with this interpretation apply to all supposed equinoctial 
and mid-quarter-day alignments, many of which were highlighted in re- 
assessments of the “megalithic” calendar proposed in Britain by Alexander 
Thom. On the other hand, an intriguing aspect of Altar is the existence of 
archaeological evidence that suggests a sequence of ritual activity stretching 
from around 2000 B.c.E. up to at least the first century C.E. This evidence 
might support the argument of continuity of tradition into “Celtic” times. 

However, Altar does not seem to be typical even of the wedge tombs in 
its immediate vicinity, at least to judge from an analysis of nine other wedge 
tombs in the Mizen peninsula. Even the impressive topographic alignment 
appears to be a “one-off.” This means that, as with other single instances 
among groups such as the solstitially aligned axial stone circle at Drombeg, 
one must continue to wonder whether the alignments could have arisen for- 
tuitously rather than intentionally.

Years B.c.E. and Years before O 

There is great potential for confusion between the ways that archaeologists 
and astronomers reckon dates before the birth of Christ. For the archaeol- 
ogist, the year before C.E. 1 is 1 B.c.E. In other words, there was no “year 
0.” The convention amongst astronomers, on the other hand, is to count 
years backward on a linear scale, so that the year before the year 1 was the 
year 0, the year before that was —1, and so on. This means, for example, 
that the archaeologist’s year 331 B.C.E. is the astronomer’s year —330. 

This issue becomes crucially important, for example, at the Iron Age 
causeway site of Fiskerton in England, where it has been proposed that 
episodes of reconstruction may have been associated with lunar eclipses. In 
order to test this idea, archaeologically determined tree-ring dates need to be 
compared with astronomically determined eclipse dates.

Yekuana Roundhouses 
The Yekuana live amid the rainforests of southern Venezuela, along the 
banks of the river Orinoco and its tributaries. Their traditional dwellings are 
communal roundhouses large enough to house several families. They have 
walls of wattle and daub and a huge conical roof, thatched over, through 
which the central pole protrudes, pointing directly upwards at the heavens. 
According to Yekuana myth, the design of the roundhouse was handed 
down by the Sun (Wanadi) himself, the creator of the world, and reflects the 
properties of the cosmos in a variety of ways. A circular inner room repre- 
sents the sea (this is used as sleeping space for bachelor men as well as a 
place for rituals and ceremonials presided over by the village shaman), and 


the outer ring, divided radially into compartments where different families 
live, represents the land. The roof is seen as a reflection of the celestial dome: 
it is supported by upright posts known as “pillars of the stars,” and the hor- 
izontal crossbeam supporting it, always placed in a north-south orientation, 
has the name of the Milky Way. The center post reaches down into the un- 
derworld and up, beyond the roof, to the heavens. Placed centrally within 
the roof space, about three meters (ten feet) above the floor, is a set of tie 
beams forming a rectangular structure. This has a practical purpose in help- 
ing to support the crossbeam and providing a frame from which the men 
sleeping in the central space can hang their hammocks. However, its precise 
rectangular shape also has a cosmological significance: the directions of the 
four corners from the center pole are the directions of sunrise and sunset at 
the solstices and, together with the pole itself, represent the four corners and 
center of the world. 

A trapezoidal opening in the western or southwestern side of the roof 
doubles as a vent for smoke and as a source of light. It is closed in the wet 
season (when the roundhouse fills unpleasantly with smoke), but opened up 
in the dry season; at this time its orientation, well away from the southerly 
or southeasterly direction of the prevailing wind, ensures that only rarely 
will it catch the wind thus blocking the escaping smoke. However, this does 
not explain why a northerly or northeasterly orientation could not equally 
well be chosen in many cases. The reason for this may be that the opening 
originally had a third purpose, as an observation window. The beam of the 
afternoon sun crosses the interior of the house, its movement marking out 
the time of day and the time of year. The interior of the house is richly dec- 
orated with paintings depicting scenes and figures important in Yekuana 
myth, some of which are lit up by the beam of sunlight at certain times. 
There are structural alignments, too: thus on the winter solstice, the sun- 
beam reaches the northeastern corner of the internal rectangle. 

The Yekuana roundhouse was truly a model of the cosmos. It may also, 
in some senses, have functioned as an observatory, in the sense that obser- 
vations of sunlight through the roof opening could have been used as a clock 
or calendar. It may even have been used to observe the night sky. There is no 
ethnographic evidence to support this claim directly, although the same is 
known to have been the case among some indigenous North America 
groups, such as the Pawnee. 

The Yekuana creation myth, and a very specific set of principles of con- 
struction conceived within the framework of that myth, ensure that the tra- 
ditional roundhouse not only incorporates sound structural principles and 
pragmatics for living, but also reflects and reinforces the prevailing world- 
view. It is interesting to speculate on how much of the cosmological sym- 


bolism incorporated just in the overall structure of the roundhouse could 


have been guessed at by an archaeologist of the future if all historical records 
had been lost. The answer is probably very little, a sobering thought when 
we struggle to interpret, for example, roundhouses surviving in Europe from 


the Iron Age.

Zenith Passage of the Sun 

If you are within the tropics—but only if you are within the tropics—you 
will have the opportunity to see the sun pass directly overhead. The high- 
est point in the sky is known as the zenith, so this event is known techni- 
cally as solar zenith passage. Solar zenith passage will happen at local noon 
on two separate days in the year, but what those days are will depend upon 
your latitude on the earth. Right on the Tropics themselves, it happens on 
just one day in the year: the June solstice at the Tropic of Cancer in the 
northern hemisphere, and the December solstice at the Tropic of Capricorn 
in the south. A little south of the Tropic of Cancer, the dates of solar zenith 
passage will be a little before and after the June solstice: the farther south 
you are, the further apart these dates will be. At the equator, the dates oc- 
cur exactly six months apart, at the two equinoxes. Moving farther south 
again, the two dates gradually converge on the December solstice. 

One way of visualizing this is to imagine a tightly coiled spring 
wrapped around the earth with its open ends on the two Tropics, and its 
183 coils not quite following lines of latitude. There is always some point 
on the earth where the sun is currently overhead, and from the June solstice 
to the December solstice this point will trace slowly along the coils of the 
spring, going around once every twenty-four hours and moving inexorably 
southwards along the coils, until the December solstice is reached and the 
sun starts to move back northwards again. 

Times when the sun passes close to the zenith stand out, because peo- 
ple and other upright objects cease to have shadows. Such times have sacred 
and practical significance in a variety of cultures within the tropics. A num- 
ber of legends identify it as a time when the way is open into the upper 
world. In some Guatemalan villages, for example, the two dates of zenith 
passage coincide with springtime and August rains, and are marked by rit- 
ual observances that still live on in Christian tradition in the form of pa- 
rades. In ancient Hawai‘i, the moment of solar zenith passage was a time 
with great mana, or sacred power. It was a time when a person’s shadow 


was no longer visible and was thought to have retreated directly into the 
brain through the top of the head; a person’s spirit could exit at this time. 

The coming of the days when the sun will pass through the zenith may 
be recognized in various ways, for example, by observing the rising or set- 
ting position of the sun on the horizon, or by watching for the heliacal rise 
or set of certain stars or asterisms. Sometimes we have evidence of devices 
that marked the actual moment of solar zenith passage, often in a dramatic 
way. Zenith tubes, which allowed the light of the sun to pass down into a 
dark place only at the time of zenith passage, are known at the Mesoameri- 
can cities of Monte Alban and Xochicalco. 

The zenith sun may hold one of the keys to the mystery of why Necker 
Island, a remote and uninhabitable rock lying well beyond the larger islands 
of the Hawaiian chain, is covered in temple platforms. It may have been an 
especially sacred place because it lay right on the Tropic of Cancer, at the 
very edge of the region where the sun reaches the zenith.

Zenith Stars in Polynesia 

The paths of the stars across the sky depend upon the observer’s latitude. 
At any given latitude, only certain stars will pass directly overhead. Con- 
versely, any given star will only be seen to pass overhead from one particu- 
lar latitude on earth. For this to happen, the observer’s latitude has to be 
equal to the “latitude” of the star on the celestial sphere—in other words, 
its declination. 

The New Zealander David Lewis, in his efforts to trace surviving frag- 
ments of traditional methods of navigation in the Pacific, encountered a 
number of references to “the star on top,” “the overhead star,” “the star that 
points down upon an island,” and the like. Taken together, these suggest the 
former existence of a Polynesian tradition in which different islands were 
seen to have distinctive “marker” stars. Most intriguingly, a Tahitian chant 
recorded in 1818 listed eight “pillars that hold up the heavens.” The decli- 
nations of several of these stars, Lewis found, corresponded in c.E. 1000 


(since they change slightly over the centuries, owing to precession) to the lat- 


itudes of various southern Polynesian islands, from the Line Islands in the 
north down to New Zealand in the south. The implication is that the over- 
head stars, marker stars, and pillar stars could have been zenith stars for par- 
ticular islands. 

The extent to which zenith stars were used by Pacific navigators is an- 
other question. Zenith stars cannot be used to plot a course, merely to de- 
termine the current latitude. Even to do the latter at all successfully, one has 
to identify the upward direction with reasonable accuracy, which is of course 
difficult on a swaying canoe. On the other hand, Lewis himself did achieve 
this reasonably satisfactorily by siting up the mast, and there are various 
documented references to zenith stars being used for navigation, particularly 
in Micronesia. However, even with zenith star observations as a back-up, 
Oceanic navigators would still have needed to use other methods (such as a 
combination of star compasses and dead reckoning) in order to locate dis- 
tant islands.

Zenith Tubes 


Most people who lived in the tropics in the past would have been broadly 
aware of the two times of year when the sun passed more or less directly 
overhead at noon and they ceased to have shadows. If they wished to de- 
termine the precise dates when zenith passage occurred, though, they would 
have needed to construct an instrument. A vertical, straight-sided post 
would have sufficed—a gnomon whose shadow would have dwindled to 
nothing at the appropriate time. So runs a plausible argument; but to rea- 
son in this way is to approach the issue from a modern Western perspective. 
If people had wished instead to harness the sacred power of such a moment, 
for whatever ideological or political ends, they would surely have created a 
hierophany. One way to achieve this would have been to construct a long 


vertical tube opening into a dark chamber below. This would create a 


breathtaking effect when the light of the zenith sun suddenly passed directly 
down the tube and, for a few precious moments, brought a sudden trans- 
formation to the normally dark space. 

Two of the most discussed examples of possible zenith tubes are found 
in Mesoamerica. One is at the Early Classic site of Monte Alban, a little un- 
der four hundred kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Mexico City, close to 
the modern city of Oaxaca. Monte Alban was the capital city of the Zapotec 
state, which formed in the valley of Oaxaca around 500 B.c.E. and grew 
steadily in power and influence until it reached its apex around C.E. 
300-600. The massive main plaza, built on a flattened hilltop, was its cere- 
monial heart. Visitors cannot fail to be impressed by the sheer size of this 
plaza, which measures more than three hundred meters by two hundred me- 
ters (1,000 feet by 650 feet). Nor can they fail to notice something extremely 
strange about Building J, situated on the central axis towards one end: it is 
wildly skewed with respect to all the other buildings. Rather than being ori- 
ented along the plaza like all the others, it is aligned directly upon Building 
P, one of several stepped buildings along the eastern side. And halfway up 
the steep steps of Building P is a curious feature. Here, reached through a 
narrow entrance, is a small room built directly under the steps, and at the 
back of it is a bench. Above the bench is a narrow vertical tube about 1.5 
meters (five feet) high leading up to an opening higher up the staircase. Some 
have suggested that this tube could be merely a chimney. But several other 
features in the alignments at Monte Alban suggest that it could have been an 
astronomical observing device. 

The other Mesoamerican zenith tube, at Xochicalco, is on an altogether 
different scale from the one at Monte Alban. Located in the state of More- 
los, some seventy kilometers (forty-five miles) south of Mexico City and 
about fifteen kilometers southwest of the city of Cuernavaca, Xochicalco’s 
situation—draped over a series of artificially flattened and terraced hilltops 
overlooking a deep valley over a hundred meters (330 feet) below—is noth- 
ing short of stunning. This city-state flowered early in the Epiclassic period, 
c. CE. 700-900 following the collapse of Teotihuacan to the north and 
Monte Alban to the south. The tube here is over forty centimeters (sixteen 
inches) wide and descends for more than five meters (sixteen feet) before 
opening out into the roof in the far corner of a cave chamber almost twenty 
meters (sixty-five feet) long and twelve meters (forty feet) wide, dug out of 
the living rock. The chamber is supported by three rock pillars and reached 
by a network of subterranean passages. 

The effect of the midday sun shining down the Xochicalco zenith tube 
is spectacular indeed, sending a vertical beam of bright sunlight down into 
the dark cave. But because of the width of the tube, this phenomenon is not 


confined to the days of solar zenith passage. In fact, the sun first shines di-

aligned. (Courtesy of Clive Ruggles) 


rectly down the tube, producing a brief spot of sunlight on the chamber 
floor, at local noon on April 30. As the sun passes closer to the true zenith 
at noon on successive days, the length of time when its light shines directly 
onto the floor increases, as does the proportion of its disc that is visible at 
maximum, until May 15, when it passes directly across the zenith at noon, 
After this, the length and proportion visible start to decrease again until the 
solstice is reached, when the noonday sunbeam has almost disappeared. The 
sequence is then repeated in reverse: zenith passage is reached on July 29, 
and the last spot of direct sunlight is seen on around August 12. A number 
of early descriptions dating back to the mid-nineteenth century reassure us 
that no dubious reconstructions have taken place and that these alignments 
are reliable. 

Since it was first investigated astronomically, there have been many fur- 
ther suggestions about the Xochicalco tube. One is that this is just an ap- 
proximate zenith device, but others argue that the dates of appearance and 
reappearance of noon sunlight are significant, since they fall exactly fifty- 
two days before and after the solstice respectively, and the fifty-two-day in- 
terval is calendrically significant. Furthermore, the length of the period of 
darkness—before the sun starts to appear at noon again—is (within a day or 
two of) 260 days, exactly the length of the sacred calendar cycle or tonalpo- 


hualli. Still others suggest that the moon might have been at least as impor- 


tant as the sun at Xochicalco, since at minor standstill it passes directly 
through the zenith at this latitude. The idea is given some credence by the 
discovery, in excavations during the 1980s, of a unique crescent-moon- 
shaped stele. 

We cannot be certain that the Monte Alban and Xochicalco zenith 
tubes were really used for the purposes of astronomical observation, but a 
good deal of circumstantial evidence supports this view. Furthermore, the ex- 
istence of solar zenith passage devices like this seems plausible enough in the 
context of Mesoamerican worldview, in which (with variations) the up- 
down axis is a fundamental means of orientation, together with the four car- 
dinal directions. The importance of the zenith sun is also well attested in his- 
torical accounts, iconography, and ethnography. The effect of sunlight 
entering the underground chambers is certainly spectacular, and it is hardly 
surprising that the Xochicalco “observatory” has become a popular tourist 
attraction. If we are lucky, other examples still wait to be discovered in the 
future, in Mesoamerica and elsewhere.

Bibliography 


This general bibliography contains the principal sources used in compiling the en- 
tries, together with a number of additional works. Some focus upon broad themes 
and issues in cultural astronomy and typically include a range of case studies; some 
relate to particular cultures with a greater or lesser emphasis on practices relating 
to the sky; and some serve to put such astronomy in a broader cultural context. 
Others provide essential information for those wishing to visit and investigate par- 
ticular monuments first hand: this category includes serious guides and gazetteers. 
The list also includes a small number of works that introduce background concepts 
and information, both from astronomy and from the human sciences. Journal arti- 
cles are included only where they address broad themes and include material of 
which summaries cannot readily be obtained in any available book. Likewise, web 
sites are cited only in exceptional cases, because they do not constitute a permanent 
medium. A small number of the cited works describe the development of this field 
of study, or themselves form landmarks within that development. The cited works 
are in English unless otherwise stated. 

The reader should approach the literature on ancient astronomy with caution. 
Because of its interdisciplinary nature, peppered with popular misconceptions, the 
subject is particularly prone to sensationalism and uncritical scholarship. These 
creep all too frequently into academic publications from which they can easily be- 
come propagated further in books directed at a wider audience. Collective works 
and conference proceedings may, likewise, contain articles varying widely in con- 
tent, approach, and quality. Short notes are included against many of the works 
listed in the bibliography, in an attempt to help the reader navigate this minefield 
and to select reliable and authoritative sources, or else to approach the wider avail- 
able literature with a duly critical eye. Various encyclopedia entries elaborate fur- 
ther on some of the main problems and issues.

Glossary 

This glossary gives short definitions of certain terms that occur regularly within 
thematic entries and case studies. Some readers will find useful a fuller explana- 
tion of some of these concepts, and an asterisk indicates that the topic is elabo- 
rated further in the main body of the encyclopedia. Italicized words cross-refer to 
other glossary entries. 


* ACCURACY. The closeness of a measurement to the true value. Cf. Precision. 

*ACRONICAL RISE. [Alternatively spelled “acronychal,” for example in British 
usage.] Strictly, the rising of a star at sunset. This event is not directly visible and 
the term is sometimes loosely applied to the annual last visible rising of a star in 
or after the evening twilight. 

*ACRONICAL SET. [Alternatively spelled “acronychal,” for example in British 
usage.] Strictly, the setting of a star at sunrise. This event is not directly visible 
and the term is sometimes loosely applied to the annual first visible setting of a 
star in or before the morning twilight. 

* ALTITUDE. The angle between the direction to an observed point and the hori- 
zontal plane through the observer, with a positive value indicating that the point 
is above the observer. Cf. Elevation. 

ANTIZENITH. The point directly beneath the observer, also known as the nadir. 
Cf. Zenith. 

ARC MINUTE. An angle equal to one sixtieth part of a degree, and hence 1 / (60 
x 360) or one 21,600th part of the whole circle. This angle is roughly equiva- 
lent to the distance between the front and back of a sheep or similar-sized ani- 
mal viewed side-on (one meter, or three feet) at a distance of about three kilo- 
meters (two miles). The apparent diameter of the sun and moon, by comparison, 
is about thirty arc minutes. 

ARC SECOND. An angle of one sixtieth of an arc minute, and hence 1 / (60 x 60 
x 360) or one 1,296,000th part of the whole circle. This angle is roughly equiv- 
alent to the distance between the eyes of a sheep or similar-sized animal viewed 
front-on (ten centimeters, or four inches) at a distance of about eighteen kilo- 
meters (eleven miles). 

ASTERISM. In modern astronomy, a grouping or pattern of stars that does not 
form a (modern Western) constellation; in cultural astronomy the term may also 
be applied to a (historical or indigenous) constellation. 

ASTROLABE. An instrument for measuring and determining the positions of the 
sun and bright stars as seen from given locations at given times; in many senses 
a precursor to the modern planisphere. 

* AZIMUTH. Bearing clockwise from due north. 

CELESTIAL NORTH POLE. Point on the celestial sphere, visible from any loca- 
tion in the northern hemisphere where the relevant part of the sky is unob- 
scured, around which the celestial bodies appear to rotate daily (in a counter- 
clockwise direction). 

CELESTIAL SOUTH POLE. Point on the celestial sphere, visible from any location 
in the southern hemisphere where the relevant part of the sky is unobscured, 
around which the celestial bodies appear to rotate daily (in a clockwise direction). 

*CELESTIAL SPHERE. Imaginary sphere surrounding the observer on which the 
celestial bodies can be considered to be positioned. 

*CIRCUMPOLAR STAR. For a given location on earth, a star that is always above 
the horizon and so never sets or rises. 

CODEX. In the Mesoamerican context, an indigenous “book” made from pages of 
painted tree bark folded together in concertina fashion. 

CODICES. Plural of Codex. 


COSMOGRAM. A symbolic representation of the cosmos, as found in some 
Mesoamerican codices. 

CULMINATION. The moment when a celestial object reaches its highest altitude, 
which happens when it crosses the meridian. 

*DECLINATION. “Latitude” on the spinning celestial sphere. 

*DIURNAL MOTION. Daily rotation of the celestial sphere. 

DOLMEN. Most usually, a megalithic monument comprising a large horizontal 
stone supported by a number of upright stones. Sometimes the term is applied 
to a wider range of megalithic tombs. 

*ECLIPTIC. The annual path of the sun through the stars on the celestrial sphere. 

*ELEVATION. Height above sea level. Cf. Altitude. 

*EQUINOXES. Technically, the times when the sun’s declination is zero, but often 
loosely taken to mean the halfway point in time between the solstices. 

*EXTINCTION. The dimming of a star at low altitude due to the earth’s atmos- 
phere. 

GNOMON. A rod, pole, or equivalent device whose function is to cast a shadow 
for the purposes of reckoning time, typically as part of a sundial. 

*HELIACAL RISE. The annual first appearance of a star, or the first appearance of 
a planet, in the eastern sky before sunrise after a period of invisibility. 

*HELIACAL SET. The annual last appearance of a star, or the last appearance of a 
planet, in the western sky after sunset before a period of invisibility. 

HENGE. A prehistoric enclosure consisting of a circular ditch and adjacent exter- 
nal bank, of which many were constructed in Britain and Ireland during the Late 
Neolithic period. Associated rings of timber posts or stone circles were common 
but not universal, and were not always part of the original design. Although the 
term “henge” derives from Stonehenge (that is, like Stonehenge but without the 
stones), Stonehenge itself—ironically—is not now generally considered a henge, 
since the circular ditch and bank at the site are of early (Middle Neolithic) date 
and the bank is internal to the ditch. 

HIEROPHANY. An appearance of the sacred, or the experience of this. The term is 
commonly used to describe a spectacular effect perceived as mystical, such as those 
produced by sunlight and shadow at ancient sites, but only on rare occasions. 

INFERIOR PLANET. A planet whose orbit is closer to the sun than the Earth’s. The 
two inferior planets, Venus and Mercury, are both visible to the naked eye, al- 
though Mercury, being closer to the sun, is more seldom seen. Cf. Inner planet 
and Superior planet. 

INNER PLANET. One of the four planets closest to the sun, namely Mercury, 
Venus, Earth and Mars. Cf. Inferior planet and Outer planet. 

KIVA. A subterranean building in the southwestern United States, roofed and used 
as a meeting place or for sacred ceremonies. 

LATITUDE. Angular distance from the equator of a location on the earth. Because 
of a confusion of terminology it is better to speak of declination on the spinning 
celestial sphere. 

LUNATION. The time that it takes the moon to complete its cycle of phases. Equiv- 
alent to synodic month. 

MAJOR STANDSTILL LIMITS. The most northerly or southerly possible rising or 
setting positions of the moon, which can only be reached around the time of a 
“major standstill,” which only occurs every 18.6 years. See the encyclopedia en- 
try Moon, Motions of. 

MEGALITHIC MONUMENT. Any monument built of large stones, applied par- 
ticularly to prehistoric tombs and temples built in Europe during the Neolithic 
and Early Bronze Age. 


*MERIDIAN. Imaginary line across the sky, joining the north point on the horizon 
to the south point and passing through the zenith. 

MIDSUMMER SUNRISE. Popular term for sunrise at the summer solstice. 

MIDSUMMER SUNSET. Popular term for sunset at the summer solstice. 

MIDWINTER SUNRISE. Popular term for sunrise at the winter solstice. 

MIDWINTER SUNSET. Popular term for sunset at the winter solstice. 

NADIR. The point directly beneath the observer, also known as the antizenith. Cf. 
Zenith, 

NEOLITHIC. Broadly speaking, a prehistoric society whose subsistence is based on 
animal herding or agriculture but lacks any knowledge of metallurgy. Meaning 
“New Stone Age,” the term is a remnant of the “three-age” classification (Stone 
Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age) that has long been superseded as a primary indica- 
tor of social development but is often still retained for convenience. The term is 
seldom used in reference to the Americas. 

*OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTIC. The amount by which the earth’s axis is “tilted” 
with respect to the plane of its orbit about the sun. More precisely, the angle be- 
tween the earth’s axis and the direction perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. 

OUTER PLANET. One of the five planets furthest from the sun, namely Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Only Jupiter and Saturn are visible to the 
naked eye. Cf. Inner planet and Superior planet. 

*PARALLAX. The difference between the position of an object in the sky as viewed 
(conceptually) from the center of the earth and (actually) from somewhere on 
the earth’s surface. It is only significant in the case of the moon. 

*PRECESSION. Short for “precession of the equinoxes.” A gradual change in the 
orientation of the earth’s axis with respect to distant space, which results in the 
positions where the solstices and equinoxes occur slowly shifting along the 
earth’s orbit. This significantly alters the position of any given star in the sky 
over a timescale of centuries. 

*PRECISION. The degree of consistency of several measurements of the same thing 
by a particular method. Cf. Accuracy. 

QUADRANT. An instrument for measuring the altitude of a celestial body. 

QUADRIPARTITE COSMOLOGY. A perception of the world, or cosmos, as 
viewed from a central place as being divided horizontally into four quarters, 
each with distinctive properties and qualities. 

*REFRACTION. The bending of light, in particular as it passes through the at- 
mosphere, which causes astronomical! objects near to the horizon to appear 
higher than they actually are. 

SARSEN. A type of large sandstone block found extensively in southern England 
and used in the construction of Stonehenge. 

*SOLSTICES. The times of year when the sun reaches its highest or lowest decli- 
nation and moves on its most extreme daily path across the sky (which, outside 
the tropics, is its highest or lowest). One solstice occurs on or close to June 21 
and the other on or close to December 22. 

SUMMER SOLSTICE. June solstice (northern hemisphere) or December solstice 
(southern hemisphere). 

SUPERIOR PLANET. A planet whose orbit is farther out from the sun than the 
earth’s. The superior planets visible to the naked eye are Mars, Jupiter, and Sat- 
urn. Cf, Inferior planet and Outer planet. 

SYNODIC MONTH. The time that it takes the moon to complete its cycle of 
phases. Equivalent to lunation. 

TRILITHON. A formation of three stones, with two vertical uprights holding up a 
horizontal lintel, as at Stonehenge and Ha‘amonga-a-Maui. 


TROPICAL YEAR. The seasonal year, equal to the time taken by the sun to com- 
plete one circuit around the celestial spbere. It is not quite the same as the time 
taken for the earth to complete an orbit of the sun (the “sidereal year”) because 
of precession. 

WINTER SOLSTICE. December solstice (northern hemisphere) or June solstice 
(southern hemisphere). 

ZENITH. The point in the sky directly above the observer. Cf. Antizenith or nadir. 

ZODIAC. A set of asterisms spread around the ecliptic and hence useful as refer- 
ence points for the sun’s annua! motion through the stars. The term is commonly 
used to refer to the particular set of twelve zodiacal constellations that has come 
to be recognized in the modern Western world. 


Topic Index 

This list indicates the different types of entries to be found in this encyclope- 
dia. CONCEPTS includes broad definitions and explanations of KEY CONCEPTS, 
together with nontechnical explanations of more BASIC CONCEPTS, mostly as- 
tronomical, often elaborating on short definitions to be found in the glossary. 
Some entries elaborate upon key THEMES and ISSUES relating to ancient astron- 
omy. CASE STUDIES, which illustrate these and other key issues and themes, are 
organized in this list by continent: the Americas are split into North, South, 
and Mesoamerica, and Europe is divided into Britain and Ireland and Conti- 
nental Europe. The entries also include a very small sample of PEOPLE impor- 
tant in the development of our knowledge of ancient astronomy, and an 
equally small sample of SKY OBJECTS AND EVENTS AND THEIR CULTURAL SIGNIF- 
ICANCE. Items such as Sirius and the Pleiades that do not receive entries of their 
own may nonetheless appear in others, and these can be located using the gen- 
eral index. Finally, there are brief descriptions of a number of PROCEDURES AND 
TECHNIQUES that are used in the modern practice of archaeoastronomy.

Chronological Index 

This list provides a broad indication of the date range, or the principal data 
range, within which particular case studies fall. The ranges chosen are un- 
avoidably arbitrary, and in such a very wide variety of examples the accuracy 
to which a date can be quoted varies considerably, both because of the inher- 
ent nature of the example concerned and the different types of dating evidence 
available in any given case. As a general rule we can only present a best esti- 
mate on the basis of current evidence. Some items span more than one date 
range, and the “Modern indigenous” category includes several examples where 
cultural traditions demonstrably extend back well into the past. Entries not 
confined to a single date range or even a few such ranges are listed separately 
at the end. 

Labels such as Palaeolithic, Neolithic, Copper/Bronze/Iron Age, etc. have 
been avoided here on the grounds that they reflect developments occurring at 
(sometimes very) different dates in different parts of the world and place un- 
due emphasis upon purely technological innovation. Readers interested in the 
correlation between astronomical practice and the nature of the human society 


concerned are referred to the Cultural Index that follows.

Cultural Index 
In this list, case study entries are classified according to the type of society con- 
cerned, Such categorizations inevitably oversimplify, in that they ignore and ob- 
scure many important variations between one human society and another. In the 
1960s and 1970s, many archaeologists believed that one could classify human so- 
cieties in straightforward terms—the main ones being band, tribe, chiefdom, and 
state—arguing a strong correlation between the size of the political unit, social 
and economic organization, and means of subsistence. Such naive ideas have 
largely been superseded. One problem is that they carry the implication that we 
can measure every human society’s progress along a single inevitable path of so- 
cial development. Added to this, in the case of past societies, the very categoriza- 
tion is a matter of interpretation from the available archaeological or historical 
evidence and (particularly in prehistory) can in itself be highly questionable. The 
extent to which (for example) communities in Neolithic Britain developed from 
segmentary societies (i.e., with no social group or village dominating over the oth- 
ers) into chiefdoms has been a matter of intense debate, and even to focus on this 
question is arguably to be distracted from more interesting and more complex is- 
sues of settlement organization and the development of social differentiation. 
For these reasons, the set of categories used in this list is intended merely to 
give the broadest indication of the nature of the human society responsible for a 
particular set of practices relating to the sky. Thus the pastoral/agricultural cate- 
gory covers, on the one hand, communities that are primarily mobile pastoralists 
and herders, and on the other, societies whose principal means of subsistence is 
agriculture and who live in fixed homesteads, whether scattered through the land- 
scape or clustered together into villages; the common feature is that they are not 
organized into chiefdoms or larger political units. It is a broad category but not 
easy to subdivide, since there is no clear demarcation between mobile pastoralism 
and sedentary agriculturalism. Likewise the “state” category spans a range from 
small, competing city-states (as, for example, in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica) to 
large empires.
