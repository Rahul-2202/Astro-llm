Preface 



jr\the term samhita connotes 'compilation', it cannot be expected 
to be an original work. Its business is to condense many Shastras. 
It, therefore, includes details of many subjects found in varied works. 
The samhita in astrological parlance is nothing but an encyclopaedia 
of astrological and other aspects of human interest. It is also mundane 
astrology with many scientific topics and other subjects in which 
human beings have an abiding faith, Hence, the samhita can rightly 
be termed a work of social science, for social science has reference to 
and explanation of almost all the aspects of social life and those that 
have a human appeal. 

Varamihira expresses his indebtedness to ancient sages like Kapila, 
Garga, Kasyapa, Atri, Bhrigu etc; for according to him, a country 
that does not possess a good astrologer is damned. A good astrologer 
must be an all-rounder. Though there is no dearth of books available 
on predictive astrology in this world, which are grand in their own 
way, most of them are neither easy to the satisfaction of general 
public nor comprehensive enough to satisfy the experts. So keeping 
this in view, Bhrigu Samhita has been invoked. The primary view of 
this book is that because the mystery of whole human life is hidden 
in the nine planets of a horoscope, it will not be possible to discover 
the events of the whole life of the native till the effects of every 
planet is not clearly known without which the complicated science 
of astrology cannot be simplified. It is with this foundation that 
every ascendant is described in the book. 

The book gives very valuable hints on how to find out the character 
of a native, his moral inclination, and his fortunes and misfortunes 
in various walks of life. It also provides useful information with 
regard to longevity and prosperity of the native, his parents, brothers 



8 • Bhrigu Samhita 

and children. This will enable any amateur or professional astrologer 
to predict with accuracy the future of the native and to form an 
opinion as to how a planet is disposed in a particular nativity. 

In the course of writing this book, several publications were referred 
to and I have endeavoured to present in this book the essential 
principles culled out from various standard and published works. 

The author is highly grateful to Pustak Mahal, New Delhi, who 
showed their keen interest in publishing this book.

Introduction 



Sage Bhrigu — The Father of Hindu Astrology 

Astrology is a Vedanga, that is, one of the limbs of the Vedas. Vedas 
were studied by the ancient sages and rishis, out of whom Saptarishis 
were the most famous. Bhrigu was one of the Saptarishis. He is 
Manasaputra (wish-born-son) of Lord Brahma, who simply wished 
him into existence, to assist the processes of creation. He was married 
to Khyati, the daughter of Daksha. He had two sons from her — 
Dhata and Vidhata. Goddess Laxmi* the consort of Vishnu, is 
considered to be his daughter. He had one more son, Shukra, who 
was better known than Bhrigu himself. The sage Chyavana was also 
believed to be his son. 

The Bhrigus, also known as Bhargavas, were a clan of sages descending 
from the ancient fire-priest Bhrigu. They instituted the ritual of 
offering the juice of the Soma plant to the old duties. Some of them 
were also warriors in addition to being priests. The Bhrigus are 
intimately linked with the composition ofAtharva Veda. 

Bhrigu Samhita 

Bhrigu is credited as the father of Hindu astrology, and the first 
astrological treatise Bhrigu Samhita is attributed to his authorship. 
This treatise is said to contain over 5 million horoscopes, in which 
he wrote down the fate of every being in the Universe. According to 
the popular tradition, only about a hundredth of these horoscopes 
have survived to this age. 

The Bhrigu Samhita is an astrological classic written by Maharshi 
Bhrigu during the Vedic period, although the available evidence 



10 • Bhrigu Samhita 

suggests that it was compiled over a period of time by the various 
students of Bhrigu. It is a confirmed fact that Saint Bhrigu was the 
first compiler of predictive astrology, which came to be known as 
the Fifth Veda of Treta Yug, which is an ancient age marking the 
beginning of the Hindu Culture, He compiled about 5 lakhs 
horoscopes with the help of Lord Ganesha and recorded details and 
events of the persons along with their ages. This formed the database 
for further research and study. The study culminated in the birth 
of the science (Shastra) of determining the quality of time (Mora), 
known as the Brihat Prasara Mora Shastra. These horoscopes were 
based upon the planetary positions of the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, 
Venu s , M ars , Jupiter , S aturn , Dragon ' s Head (Rahu) and Dragon' s 
Tail (Ketu). After that, Maharshi Bhrigu gave his predictions on 
different types of horoscopes compiled by him with the help of 
Lord Ganesha in a brief and concise manner. 

During the foreign invasions in India, Brahmin community was 
dispersed all over India. The invaders also captured these prime 
assets ofBrabmins. For them, it was a miraculous form oftelling the 
fortune of a person and so some parts of the Bhrigu Samhita were 
taken away by them to the foreign countries, The most unfortunate 
and destructive happening was the destruction of Nalanda University 
library. It is really unfortunate that some people having a cheap and 
fraudulent form ofBhrigu Samhita claim to have the original Shastra 
in their possession. 

If an original Bhrigu Samhita? s leaf containing the horoscope of an 
individual is obtained, we will find that it not only reveals the 
consulting day, time and date of the individual, but also the remedial 
measures. Some thousands of leaflet horoscopes from the original 
Bhrigu Samhita are believed to be available with one pundit in 
Hoshiyarpur, in Punjab. It is also very unfortunate that dozens of 
pundits in India claim to have the original Bhrigu Samhita 
with them.

Uniqueness of Bhrigu Samhita 

Many of the books available on predictive astrology are neither easy 
enough to be understood by the general public nor fully satisfactory 
for the pundits. Therefore the primary view kept in this book is that 
because the mystery of the whole human life is hidden in the nine 
planets of a horoscope, it will not be possible to discuss the events 
of the whole life of the native till the effects of every planet is not 
clearly known. Without it, the complicated science of astrology 
cannot be simplified. It is with this understanding in the book that 
every ascendant has been treated with the placement of the planets 
in each of the 12 houses in a zodiacal diagram. 

1st House: (Ascendant) Physique, will-power, fame, figure and physical 
complex 

Ilnd House: Finance, family, speech, treasure and bondage 

Illrd House: Brothers and sisters, energy, physical work and courage 

IVth House: Mother, motherly relations, land and buildings, peace 
and happiness 

Vth House: Education, children, speech and knowledge 

Vlth House: Enemies, diseases, diligence, occultism, maternal 
grandfather, defeats and victories 

Vllth House: Wife, diurnal occupation, father-in-law and his family, 
sexual pleasures 

VHIth House: Wealth, age, daily routine, old and serious things 
helping in life, career and troubles 

IXth House: Destiny, Dharma, devotion, Divine power and fame 

Xth House: Father, government and society, occupation, splendour, 

sovereignty 

Xlth House: Wealth, income and gains, fulfilment of necessities 

Xllth House: Expenditure, contact of foreign places, loss

Important Observation 

Sometimes the ascendant is calculated wrongly due to the mistake 
of an hour or so in the birth time. But the same can be corrected 
in the given manner, though the mistake might have occurred due 
to wrong watches or wrong calculations by the ones casting the 
horoscope or due to the carelessness of parents to remember the 
exact time of birth. 

Take for example, if a person's lagna is Aquarius and the results are 
not tallying, you must correct the lagna as Capricorn and study the 
case. Also cast it as Pisces and study the results. The one that gives 
correct predictions should be taken as correct. So by permutations 
and combinations, you can get the correct lagna. 

Points to be borne in mind while casting the lagna 

1. Aries lagna will be examined with the help of Pisces and Taurus. 

2. Taurus lagna will be examined with the help of Aries 
and Gemini. 

3. Gemini lagna will be examined with the help of Taurus 
and Cancer. 

4. Cancer lagna will be examined with the help of Gemini 
and Leo. 

5. Leo lagna will be examined by the help of Cancer and Virgo.

6. Virgo lagna will be examined with the help of Leo and Libra. 

7. Libra lagna will be examined with the help of Virgo and Scorpio. 

8. Scorpio lagna will be examined with the help of Libra 
and Sagittarius. 

9. Sagittarius lagna will be examined with the help of Scorpio 
and Capricorn. 

10. Capricorn lagna will be examined with the help of Sagittarius 
and Aquarius. 

1 1 . Aquarius lagna will be examined with the help of Capricorn 
and Pisces. 

12. Pisces lagna will be examined with the help of Aquarius 
and Aries. 

Differences in the Charts of Men and Women 

The predictions in this book are applicable to the horoscopes of 
women in the same sense as they are applicable to the horoscopes 
of men with the only differences that (1) the predictions about wife 
in the male horoscope applies to the predictions about husband in 
the female horoscopes, and (2) the predictions about the occupations 
in the female's horoscope will apply to the husband. 

The events of the periods of life should be predicted through 
y Vimsottari and y Antaradashas\ 

When in the horoscope of men, the Vims ottari Dosha is benefic, it 
is the period of outright progress of destiny. When between husband 
and wife, the dosha of one is good and that of the other is bad, it 
is the period of ordinary rise. Similarly, when both have malefic 
dashas the period is harmful. When there is the Antara of the best 
planet in the dosha, it is the most fortunate period. 

How to Remove Doubts 

If in the horoscope of a native, a planet causes benefit about a 
particular matter and the other planets cause maleficence about the 
same matter, it should be understood that both the predictions 
would take place in the life though may be in any shape. The 



14 • Bhrigu Samhita 

timings and shape of the event can change but the effects cannot be 
eliminated. The other point to be borne in mind is that it is the 
combined effect of all the nine planets which forms the life, nature 
and their features of human beings. Everybody should consider the 
decisions regarding his destiny through the combined effect of all 
these nine planets. 

The Twelve Signs 

The following are the twelve signs: 

(1) Aries (2) Taurus (3) Gemini (4) Cancer (5) Leo (6) Virgo

Daitya - Venus, Saturn, Dragon's Head, Dragon's Tail 

The Deva planets are friends among themselves and are enemies of 
the planets of the Daitya. Mercury is a friend of all. 

The planet which is the lord of its sign is said to be lord of that 
house also in which that sign is placed.

Example 

Just to broach on the subject, Mars is the significator of 3 rd house, 
which stands for adventure, valour and foreign travel. It is the same 
thing which Mars also signifies. Hence, Mars is called the significator 
of 3 rd house. 

If proper attention is not paid on the signification planets in the 
matter of predictions, there are chances of the prediction going 
wrong. For example, the Moon is the significator of the 4 th house 
and hence if it relates to 4 th house, then irrespective of the possibility 
of the 4 th lord being weak, the native gains the happiness of house 
and vehicle. Similarly Sun is considered as benefic for the 1 st , 9 th 
and 10' houses because he is the significator of soul, mind, body, 
fortune, wealth, position, honour, power, fame, promotion and 
fatherly happiness . 

Moon has a very important role to play and has a changeable 
character. Moon when in conjunction with Venus will become 
deceptive in nature. 



Introduction • 1 1 

Mercury is a planet which causes depression when it is weak. Similarly 
Mars, when debilitated and aspected by Saturn becomes extremely 
dangerous. Any important principle to be understood is that planets 
like the Mars and Jupiter when debilitated or weak will give negative 
results and if associated with negative forces of Saturn and Venus 
might be helpful. They rather help Saturn and Venus. 

Degrees of the Planets 

The degrees ofthe different planets are extremely important, assuming 
that there are three planets, Mars, Venus and Rahu, which are 
conjoined in one house. We need to know the degrees and then 
decipher which planet is ahead in the sign. If Mars has the highest 
degrees followed by Venus and Rahu, the results would be highly 
different than Rahu having the highest number of degrees followed 
by Venus and Mars in the same house. Therefore, it is important to 
have the degrees of all the planets in each sign and then analyse 
the conjunction. 

The planets in the zodiacal diagrams when move to the other houses 
in the moveable do 25% work of that house and 70% work ofthe 
house in which they are posted, 

The planets occupying the particular house being 'Vakri take care 
of the previous house and cause great progress of their occupied 
house though with some perplexity. 

(3-4-5-6) The planet posted in good or bad houses in 'Navamsd 
give some effect or Navamsa predictions also in the predictions 
about house where they are posted in Rashi Chakra. 

The planets having more than 28 or less than 2 at the time of birth 
are weak and therefore give weak effects. The planets having 10-20 
are strong and therefore give strong effects. The planets fading 
due to Sun at the time of birth are weak planets and hence do not 
affect completely.

and 

Case Studies 



Some Basics (Terminology) 
of the Planets 



Lhe study of the astrology is centred on the nine planets viz. Sun, 
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. Out 
of these, the first seven planets have their own houses while the last 
two do not have houses of their own. 

The zodiac has twelve houses, which are named as: 

1 . Aries or Mesha 

2. Taurus or Vrishubha 

3. Gemini or Mithuna 

4. Cancer or Karka 

5. Leo or Sinha 

6. Virgo or Kanya 

7. Libra or Tula 

8. Scorpio or Vrishchika 

9. Sagittarius or Dhanu 

10. Capricorn or Makara 

1 1 . Aquarius or Kumbha 

12. Pisces or Meen 

Out of these, Sun and Moon have only one house, while the other 
planets have two houses each. They are as given on the next page:

not have their own houses but occupy the houses of other planets 
and behave like them.

Lhe primary view kept in this book is that the whole human life 
is hidden in the nine planets of a horoscope, it will not be possible 
discuss the events of the whole life of the native till the effects of 
every planer is not clearly known without which the complicated 
science of astrology will not be easy. It is with this understanding 
in the book every ascendant has been treated with the placement of 
the planets in each 12 houses in a zodiacal diagram.

lagna, the native will share the characteristics of Aries blended with 
those of Mars and Venus. The subject will be of middle stature, fair 
complexion, broad temples and narrow chin. He will be a man of 
independent thinking, self-made, and will rise to a very high position 
in life after much struggle. The situation of Sun Thanukaraka with 
Rahu is not a desirable combination. The subject loves beauty and 
elegance, as Venus is in the lagna. He nurtures human principles 
and a sacred idea of friendship. The Moon being hemmed between 
Mars and Saturn makes the mind worried almost always. As both 
lagna and Moon sign are moveable signs, the subject will have a 
wavering mentality .

Lagna is not occupied by any planet but aspected by Jupiter, the 
Moon and Mars. Lagna is Vargottama and hence strong. Lord of 
lagna Mars aspects lagna in Rasi and is in the Navamsa. In physical 
characteristics, the subject is Martian. Because the lagna is with 
Rahu in the Navamsa, there is blending of the influence of Rahu 
and Mars. As in the previous phase, the subject rises from a humble 
existence. He is not fair as the subject of Chart 1. The Sun is in his 
own house with Jupiter. His stature is middle and his sight is sharp. 
The dispositions of lagna, the Sun and the Moon denote a stable 
mind with the power to concentrate, a mind capable of resistance

while here Mercury is exalted with the ascendent lord. The native

Lagna no doubt is occupied by Ketu, but Ketu is actually in the 
12th bhava. Thus lagna is free from malefic associations. Jupiter 
aspects lagna and hence it gets fortified. In Navamsa Jupiter is the 
lord of lagna, Venus is in a friendly sing with exalted Mars. Hence 
the family is powerful. The Sun is situated in an inimical sign but 
since it happens to be a Kendra, the native becomes strong. In 
appearance, character and mental disposition, the subject reflects 
the characteristics of Mars and Venus. The subject is short tending 
towards carpal (Jupiter aspecting) body, squarely built, fair 
complexion, broad forehead and a handsome appearance. He is 
self-reliant. He has a lot of endurance, latent power and energy. He 
is not happy as far as children are concerned. Saturn is in the 5 th. 
The Moon is aspected by Saturn. Therefore, the native is always 
worried. The native is a worshipper of Lord Vishnu (Lord of the 
lagna in the 9th).

Lagna is Mithuna or Gemini. It is aspected by neither good nor bad 
planets. Lord of lagna Mercury is in the 3rd with Ketu and Venus 
aspected by Mars. The Sun (Thanukamka) is with exalted Jupiter. 
This is the horoscope of a middle-class man. He is also aspected in 
the Navamsa by Mars. In his physical features, the native shares the 
characteristics of Mars, Mercury and of course Ketu. The subject is 
unassuming, simple in habits, forgiving in temperament and 
self-reliant. In this case, the fortunes are subject to much change. 
There should be no contact between the lord of 1st and 6th either 
by aspect or association. Here lord of lagna is aspected by Mars, 
lord of the 6th and 11th. The native is once implicated in a 
defamation case but is subsequently acquitted .

Most of the planets are concentrated in the 1st and 10th house 
indicating the powerful nature of the horoscope. Lagna is occupied 
by Mars and Ketu, and aspected by Rahu, which is not a very good 
combination for health. Lord of lagna Mercury is in the 10th in 
debilitation, but there is Neechabhanga (cancellation of debility) . 
Lord of the 5th is exalted in the 10th. Jupiter is in his own house 
in the 10th with the Sun. There are five planets in the 10th, which 
is a very good combination. The native is a great journalist or a 
politician, moderate in view, firm in action, and obliging in nature. 
In physical features, Mars is prominent - thin face, sanguine 
complexion, active, clever, inherent conversational power. The Moon 
is free from any evil association and aspects. There are no fewer than 
six planets in the ascendant and midheaven. This indicates an active 
and rapidly moving mind fitted to play a mighty part. On account 
of malefic aspect on lagna, the native suffers hostile comments, 
criticism and opposition.

The lagna is occupied by the Sun and Mercury, lords of the 2nd 
and 3rd. This is not very propitious. Lord of lagna, viz. the Moon 
is in the 5th with Ketu, hence bad. The Sun is with the lord of the 
3rd. Lord of lagna is aspected by Jupiter (in the Navamsa) and is 
hammed between Saturn and Ketu, thus subject to what is called 
Papakartariyoga. All the three factors pertaining to the first house 
are unfavourably disposed; the subject is of stout build, nervous, 
extremely sensitive and dark in complexion. The conjunction of 
Saturn and Mars, the Moon and Ketu spoil the several good 
indications of the horoscope. The native is unimaginative, miserly, 
mean, undignified and overcautious. The Sun and Mercury are 
malefic and their situation in lama is not desirable.

Lagna is Cancer. Mars yogakaraka for this lagna, is deputation in the 
ascendent but there is Neechabhanga for Mars, as Jupiter - the 
planets which gets exalted in Cancer - is in a quadrangular house 
from the Moon. Moreover lagna is aspected by its own lord. This 
lagna is powerful. Coming to the lord of lagna, he is aspected by 
Mars and Saturn. The first aspect is good, while the second is evil. 
In the Navamsa again, the Moon is with Mars - a good combination. 
The lord of lagna may be declared as middling in strength. The Sun 
(Thanukaraka) is in Libra - in debilitation with Mercury and Jupiter 
- Mercury being evil and Jupiter good. In the Navamsa again, the 
Sun is with two malefics - Saturn and Mercury. There is no 
Neechabhanga in the Rasi for Sun. Thus so far as the first house is 
concerned, the lagna is fairly strong - the lord of lagna middling 
and Thanukaraka, somewhat blemished. Martian and Lunar 
characteristics will be well marked. The presence of Mars in lagna 
produces smallpox marks on the body. Mars gives a fair ruddiness 
to the person, healthy constitution, a sturdy figure inclined towards 
corpulence, and a temperament principally of heat and dryness. The 
Moon aspecting indicates better proportion and greater delicacy of 
figure. Occult tendencies are well marked. Fleshy neck, fond of 
wealth and heavy gait are also the common characteristics. The 
mind is not at ease, as Saturn and Mars aspect the Moon.

Lagna is occupied by Ketu and aspected by Rahu. Lagna is therefore 
weak. Lord of lagna viz., the Sun is in Taurus an inimical sign with 
Mercury lord of the 2nd and 11th and the Moon. In the Navamsa, 
the Sun is in Capricorn, an inimical sign. Thus all the three factors 
concerned with the 1st house are weak. The subject is lean and has 
a sickly constitution. He psychologically feels that there is something 
wrong with his health. His height is average, face oval in shape and 
countenance thoughtful. He possesses considerable philosophical 
knowledge, is a voracious reader, lacks natural policy with ambitions, 
and remains unfulfilled to a great extent. Jupiter is exalted. 
The Moon's position and aspects are more fortunate than those of 
the Sun.

Mars aspect on lagna gives a fair mddiness to the person, healthy 
constitution, sturdy figure, while Jupiter's aspect is responsible for 
fair complexion, big eyes and dignified stature. The native has a 
chequered career, is subject to varied fortunes once in the lap of 
wealth but in ordinary circumstances. 

In all the cases stated above important factor should be borne in 
mind viz., the strength or otherwise of lagna, the Sun and of course 
Moon also. A steady flow of fortune is generally assured if at least 
two of the three factors mentioned above are well-disposed.

Lagna is occupied by its own lord in exaltation with the Moon and 
aspected by Jupiter in debilitation. Jupiter of course is free from 
neecha effect. Saturn also aspects lagna. Lagna is subject to 
papakartariyoga as also its lord. In the Navamsa, again Mercury is 
subject to malefic effects. The Sun is in his own sign but in Navamsa, 
his situation is unfavourable as he is with Mars aspected by debilitated 
Mercury and also Saturn. The 1st house is not well-fortified. Virgo 
is a watery sign. The native is stout, has shoulders and arms rather 
drooping, dark hair, and a good forehead. He is truthful and kind, 
fond of learning, and lacks self-confidence. He is shrewd, prudent, 
and somewhat indolent and has a speculative bent of mind. 
Thanukaraka is with Mars and aspected by Saturn. The native has 
smallpox marks all over the body. Mutual aspects between evil planets 
is not desirable.

the Navamsa, lord of lagna Mercury is delimitated both in the Rasi 
and Navamsa the Sun is aspected by Saturn. Lagnadhipathi and Sun 
are therefore middling in strength. The Moon is aspected by Saturn. 
The native is stout and dark in complexion, prudent, economical, 
diplomatic and shrewd. Since the foundation of the horoscope is 
strong, the general disposition is sound. He is a businessman or a 
money-lender and is financially very sound. The appearance is not 
attractive, probably due to Saturn aspecting Lagnadhipathi.

The Sun is in Pisces a friendly sign, but is in association with Ketu 
in Rasi and with Rahu in Navamsa. The ascendant lord and Sun are

He is inclined towards corpulence because Jupiter is in lagna. The 
Ascending is occupied by Mercury, Jupiter, Rahu and aspected by 
the Moon and Ketu. Mercury and Jupiter are nearly 20 degrees 
behind Rahu, so that they are free from the effect of Ruhu's 
conjunction. Lagna is in lull association with benefics and thus gets 
considerable strength. The lord is in the 2nd with the Sun, Saturn 
(malefics) and Venus is a benefic. Lord of lagna also causes a 
parivarthanayoga with Jupiter. In the Navamsa, Lagnadhipathi is 
fairly well disposed. The Sun {Thanukaraka) is moderate in strength 
because, though in a friendly sign, is in conjunction with Mars and 
Saturn and of course with Venus too. He is hemmed in between 
Rahu and Saturn in the Navamsa. The health of the native is not 
very good. The subject has an attractive personality, broad face, fair 
complexion and is inclined towards corpulence. He is somewhat 
assuming and ambitious. He is in generous position, fickle-minded, 
possesses grit and enterprise, and his constitution is somewhat

Lord of lagna Jupiter is in the 3rd, again hemmed in between Ketu

but even this aspect is not good because Venus is the Lord of 6th 
and 11th Mars also aspects Jupiter from his own sign. This is 
passable. In the Navamsa again, Jupiter is with Rahu aspected by 
three malefics Saturn, Ketu and the Sun. Jupiter is certainly weak. 
The Sun is debilitated in the 11th but the relieving features are 
cancellation of debility and Jupiter aspecting the Sun. Added to 
these all the planets are disposed in the 2nd and 12th from each 
other. These dispositions indicate strides in career and lack of 
happiness. In the disposition of physical features, the characteristics 
of Jupiter, Venus and Mars are blended. The native is not inclined 
towards corpulence. The face is long, thin figure but good-looking 
with well proportioned features. Venus adds softness and great 
delicacy, while Mars gives fair ruddiness to the personality. The 
body is full of hair (Saturn aspecting Jupiter in Navamsa), the native 
is sympathetic and sometimes restless, hates external show, is 
God-fearing, honest and free from hypocrisy and of temperate habits. 
The mind is clear and quick. Manners are gentle. The native is 
simple in his mode of living. He is a lover of peace. He is very 
affectionate and seldom bears malice. He lacks happiness.

The body is thin and bony. He possesses sympathy and generosity. 
He has good manners and puts on superior airs. He has great

Saturn lord of lagna, is in his own house or sign. In the Navamsa

appearance and an elegant disposition . Jupiter gives him a fair 
complexion, large eyes and dignified stature. The lips are flashy, 
cheeks are broad and have prominent temples. He makes friends

If the Sun is in the 10th house, the native will make distinctive 
achievements in the educational sphere by his 18th year, and will 
become famous and quite capable of learning well. He will be very 
well-behaved and valorous, and will earn good reputation. If the 
Sun is exalted (in Aries) or in his own sign Leo, the native will 
become powerful and famous on account of his good qualities and 
achievements. If the Sun is in the sign of a malefic, or aspected or 
associated with a malefic, there will be obstructions in his professional 
career. He will indulge in evil deeds, will be of undesirable conduct, 
and immoral and sinful. When Sun is exalted in the 10th, the 
ascendant will be Cancer and Sun as exalted, lord of the 2nd in 
10th. This will give rise to an excellent Dhanayoga which will 
make the native very wealthy and prosperous, and a man of high 
status, as obvious in the given horoscope which belongs to Pundit 
Motilal Nehru.

IfMars is in the 6th house, the native will be famous, he will be 
successful in all his undertakings, will defeat his enemies, will be 
blessed with children, will have a successful marriage and will acquire 
conveyances in his 27th year, and his enemies will cease to exist. If 
Mars is associated with or aspected by a malefic, the above results 
will be realised in their entity, but the native will suffer from 
rheumatism, pains, etc. IfMars is posted in any of the signs owned 
by Mercury (Gemini or Virgo), the native will suffer from skin 
diseases. He will recover if it is aspected by a benefic. The 6th house 
signifies diseases also. While eradicating enemies, the native will 
suffer. In the given horoscope Mars and Rahu are in the 6th, the 
native has suffered from ill health throughout his life and has been 
suffering from many diseases. He is also troubled by enemies.

Bhrigu Samhita 



If Mercury is in the first house (ascendant) the native will be educated, 
will have early marriage and will be a devout listener of the recitation 
of the mantras and scriptures. He will like to travel to many places. 
He will be soft-spoken and learned, of forgivable nature and kind- 
hearted. He will go on pilgrimages in his 27th year, will have 
enormous gains of wealth and will attain distinction in academic 
pursuits. If Mercury is in his own sign of exaltation (Virgo) or in 
his own house (Gemini) or Virgo), he will have happiness from the 
side of his brothers. He will go to heaven after death. If associated 
with or aspected by a malefic or in his sign of debilitation (Pisces) 
the native will go to hell after death. He will be deprived of bed 
comforts (sexual pleasures) and will appropriate evil Gods. If Mercury 
is in his own sign or in his sign of exaltation in the first house 
(which is also lagna kendra) Bhadrayoga {Panchantahapurushayoga) is 
formed. Those born under Bhadrayoga will be strong, will have a 
lone-like face, well developed chest, well-proportioned limbs, he 
will be taciturn, will help relatives and will live up to good old age. 
The given horoscope given of late Dr S. Radhakrishanan, the former 
President of India, is a good illustration of Bhadrayoga.

If Mercury is in the 10th house, the native will be successful by 
performing virtuous deeds. He will be patient, will have a good 
reputation and will be a great thinker. In his 28th year, he will 
suffer from troubles . If Mercury is in his own house of the sign of 
exaltation or is in conjunction with Jupiter, the native will perform 
many kinds of religious rites; if Mercury is in the enemy's house or 
associated with malefic, the native will be stupid, and will indulge 
in sinful deeds and will be of bad conduct. 

Mercury in the IOth in his sign or in his sign of exaltation being 
in kendra to the ascendant will also give rise to Bhadrayoga. If 
Mercury as a benefic occupies the 10th house from the ascendant, 
Amlayoga is formed, which results in the native achieving lasting 
fame and reputation. His character will be spotless and he will lead 
a prosperous life.

and the 10th, as lord of 7th and the 10th, as lord of 4th and 7th

If Jupiter is in his own sign (Sagittarius or Pisces) in the first house 
(ascendant) the native will be a good speaker and well versed in 
Shastras* He will have full knowledge of the Vedas, a good number 
of children and will be happy, long-lived and learned. If Jupiter is 
in a sign of exaltation (Cancer) , all the above results will be fully 
released and in his 1 6th year, the native will enjoy the effects of the 
Maharajayoga so caused by Jupiter. 

If Jupiter is in the house of enemy or the house of a malefic or 
associated with malefics or in his sign of debilitation (Capricorn), 
the native will indulge in sinful deeds; he will have an unstable 
mind and a medium span of life. He will be childless, ungrateful, 
full of false vanity, and will forsake near relations and well wishers. 
He would like to travel, would be inimical towards others and also 
miserable. If Jupiter is posted in a kendra position to Moon, it will 
ward off all evils caused by all the planets. This means that if 
powerful Jupiter is posted in a kendra (1, 4, 7, 10), he alone wards 
off all the aristas. The disposition of Jupiter in Sagittarius, Pisces,

and Cancer in the ascendant (Lagna Kendra) also gives rise to 
Hamsayoga {Pachmahapurushayogd). Hamsayoga gives handsome body, 
good relations with others, righteousness in disposition, and purity 
in mind. The above horoscope is that of President Sanjiva Reddy, a 
good example of Hamsayoga.

The native will be religious-minded and will perform righteous 
deeds, study Gita, will be very able, will have widespread reputation 
and will be respected by masses. If the lord of the 10th is strong, 
the native will perform high class religious duties. If the lord of the 

10th is associated with a malefic or is in the house of a malefic, 
there will be obstacles in his professional career and the native will 
indulge in evil deeds and will suffer financially. If Jupiter is in the 

10th house in his sign Sagittarius, Pisces will be the ascendant, 
Jupiter will be in the 10th as lord of the ascendent and the 10th 
house. If Jupiter is in Pisces, Gemini will be the ascendent and the 
Jupiter will be in the 10th as lord of the 7th and 10th houses. For 
Virgo ascendant, Jupiter will be in the 10th as lord of 4th and the 
7th houses. For Sagittarius ascendant Jupiter will be in the 10th as 
lord of the ascendant and the 4th house. These positions will give 
rise to powerful Dhanayogas . The disposition of Jupiter in the

powerful Rajyogas .

If Venus is in 10th house, the native will be iully of glory. If Venus 
is associated with (or aspected by) a malefic, the native will have 
difficulties and obstacles in his undertakings. If Venus is associated 
with Mercury, Jupiter and Moon the effects will be: 

1. The native will enjoy the comfort of many conveyances. 

2. The native will perform religious ceremonies. 

3. The native will enjoy worldwide reputation. 

4. The native will enjoy many Rajyogas (that is, he will be wealthy, 
honoured and famous). 

5. The native will be very fortunate and talkative. 

For Virgo, Capricorn and Aquarius ascendants, Venus will be in the 
10th as lord of the 2nd and 9th, the 5th and the 10th, and the 4th 
and 9th respectively. These dispositions will give rise to very powerful 
Dhanayogas. Venus in the 10th is in kendra to the ascendant. The 
disposition of Venus there in his own sign or in his sign of exaltation 
will give rise to Malyayoga. The above given horoscope of late 
President Zakir Hussain is an illustration of this yoga. Here Venus 
is in the 10th in his sign of exaltation. Venus being a benefic in the 
10th to the ascendant also gives rise to Amlayoga which here under 
gives rise to lasting fame and reputation. The character of the native 
is spotless and he leads a prosperous life.

If Saturn is in the 1st house (ascendant), the native will suffer from 
rheumatism and bilious diseases. If Saturn is in is sign of exaltation 
(Libra), the native will have lordship over a village or town, and will 
have financial and agricultural prosperity. If Saturn is in his own 
sign Capricorn or Aquarius, the father of the native will be rich. If 
Saturn is in the ascendant in the sign of the lord of the 4th or 10th, 
the native will be very fortunate and will enjoy the effects of 
Maharajayoga (name, fame and wealth). If Saturn in the ascendant 
is aspected by Moon, the native will earn his livelihood by beginning. 
This will not happen if Saturn is aspected by a benefic (Jupiter or 
Venus) also. The disposition of Saturn in the ascendant {lagna kendra) 
in his own sign of exhaltation will give rise to Sasayoga which gives 
rise to the native having a command on good servants. His character 
will be questionable. He will be a head of village or a town or even 
a king. He will covet others' riches and will be wicked in disposition.

If the Moon is in the 1st house (ascendant), the native will be very 
handsome looking but unsteady mentally. He will suffer from bodily 
trouble and will be happy at watery places. He will undertake many 
journeys in his 15th year. Ifthe Moon is in Aries, Taurus or Cancer, 
the native will be well-versed in shastras (Hindu religious scriptures), 
wealthy, happy and soft spoken. He will have soft skin and a strong 
built. If Moon is aspected by benefics, the native will be powerful, 
wise, intelligent, healthy, a clever conversationalist and wealthy. If 
the lord of the ascendant is weak, the native will suffer from 
ill-health. If he is aspected by a benefic, the health will be good. 
Very good results will occur when Jupiter is in the 7th to Moon 
(this disposition will give rise to Gajakesariyoga - a very benefic yoga 
conferring wealth, name and fame upon the native). For a planet to 
give good results, it is very necessary for the lord of the sign in 
which it is posted to be strong and well-placed. In the love chart, 
Jupiter is in his house of exaltation and aspecting Moon with his 
9th aspected a very good and strong position. Hence Moon is 
very strong in the ascendant and hence the native will be wealthy 
and healthy. 



Conclusion 



y^^tthe behest of Pustak Mahal, New Delhi, for writing a book on 
Bhrigu Samhita, J have authored this book providing all the relevant 
and required information. I have dealt with this subject under 4 
headings starting from preface to general principles on various aspects 
that are essential regarding the positions of various planets with 
reference to each of the 12 signs from Aries to Pisces with special 
reference to the birth chart. 

This being a forgotten subject, a few relevant horoscopes (case studies) 
have been given. This is one of the astrological methods used by 
Bhrigu for finding out the events based on the nine planets and 
their position in each house with reference to each sign as an 
ascendant, which highlights the events of a native in his lifetime. 
This area still requires further exploration and a lot of research. I 
sincerely hope that the interested astrologers Would think about 
undertaking studies on this subject. 

Hence it is expected that this book will be used as an initial tool 
by the astrologers who will pursue this method also for making 
various kinds of predictions. J pray to God to bestow long life and 
prosperity upon all the readers of this book. 

The author undertakes astrological consultations on various aspects
