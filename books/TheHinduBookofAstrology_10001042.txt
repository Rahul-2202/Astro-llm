THE H IN DU BOOK

For thousands of years the H indu Astrologers
have by their knowledge of the solar system been
enabled to formulate a system of A strology which
enables them to speak with scientific authority and
certainty with respect to the planetary influences
upon mankind .

Each person is born in or under one of the twelve
signs of the 'odiac and is thus influenced more or
less throughout life by the planetary conditions at
time of birth .

In this work I propose to state the natural tend
cucice of each person and in a certain way indicate
what they shou ld do and what they should not do
to make their l ife a success.



8 T H E H I N DU B OOK OF A ST R OL OGY .

By referring to your sign which is indicated b, y
the date and month when you were born you will

,

see what your natural tendencies are and what it
,

is best for you to do to attract and use unseen
forces and powers which are your birthright and

,

which will aid you to make your future bright .
Each and every person is naturallv endowed

with peculiar and great powers which make for
good and also are born with tendencies which must

,

be corrected in order that the higher and good
powers and forces may be able to work to advan

tage . No matter how had your lot may seem to
you and how difiicult it is for you to get along in

,

the world you can readilyr change all darkness to,

the brightest sunshine if you only go about it in
the right spirit .
The first step to take is to fix in your mind a

strong desire for what you wish and persistently
,

and patiently hold this desire until you get it ful
filled . In India men through the advice of emi

, ,

nent astrologers will have an aspiration to aecom
,

plish a certain thing and will persistently hold, and

believe they will be successful in attaining what
they desire until they get their aspiration satisfied .

There are three things absolutely essential to
happiness and which will always bring success ;
viz . , hope patience and determination— persistent,



T H E HINDU B OOK OF A ST R OL OGY . 9

determination to reach success . When we learn to
exercise our mind and will on hope patience and

,

determination we find a wide door open to per
,

manent health wealth honor and happiness . One
, ,

who grumbles and complains and whines and mur
murs because others are successful will never have
fai r Fortune’s sm ile ; the unseen powers cannot and
will not help any soul who whines complains and

,

murmurs in a world that is filled with health
,

wealth and happiness . The grum bler and com
pla iner is never loved ; no one desires to help such
a being. Indeed the world has no use for such

,

persons as they are repulsive . Their natures are
,

poisoned with pessimism and they repel and drive
from them constantly millions of good things .
The Devas (angels'can and do help the bright

and cheerful ones who are full of hope and aspire
,

to great and good things ; while the lazy indolent,

and whining beings are surrounded by low and de
grading forces which keep them always from,

everything that is good in this world of good
things .
There is a cause for every effect. There is a

reason why some men and women are successful
,

and a reason why others are sick and worried and

poverty-stricken miserable and unhappy
, .

No one can reach success or happiness until he

SUCCESS .
It is always wise to calmly reflect upon the past ;

but very unwise and exceedingly foolish and weak
en ing to brood or worry about the missteps we have
taken . No matter what happens to you keep a
cheerful and hopeful mind and you will eventually
succeed beyond all your fondest expectations .
Health success and happiness is always abundantly

,

measured out by the higher and unseen powers to
those who are persistently patient hopeful and

,

courageous .
No matter what one of the twelve signs of the

'odiac you are born under you can develop into a
,

”

good and successful person if you will pay strict
attention to the golden truths printed in this book .

S carcely one person of the large and growing hu

times and carefully studied because it contains

as easy as we can train and develop the muscles by
persistent physical exercise “

fully and vitally realize who and what we are we

.

A s long as one thinks he is weak ; that he is a
poor worm of the dust ; that he has no chance ; that
his fate is to be whirled hither and thither by forces
over which he has no control just that long he will

,

be at the mercy of such forces . But I tell you
, ,

everyone can control these forces and powers and
can accomplish grand results the very moment
he cleanses his mind of fear and doubt about his
ability to succeed . A S A MA N TH INKS SO H E

continually be weak and sick ; continually think
poverty and you will continually be poverty

abolish poverty we must work with faith and hope.
and banish once and for all time any and all fears
of failure — worry about the past, or apprehension,

about the future . We must live intensely in the

Each one occupies a good place in the Universal

lack of knowledge and wisdom . Now my sole aim

in writing this book is to wake people up out of
,

the delusions in which they live . I tell you all you
,

are greater beings than you imagine you are ; that
your dormant or latent powers and forces are great
and wonderful ; that YOU and YOU alone limit
yourself and suffer because you will not rouse your
self to the grand truths which wise and good men
have taught for thousands of years namely that

Allpersons bor nfrom D ecem ber 2 1 to Jan uary 1 9 ,

inclusive, were born und er the S ign ofCapricorn .

This is the last Sign of the Earth Triplicity and,

is the dark or mysterious sign of the earth . It will
be well for you to study read much and do a lot

, ,

of thinking. Many professional men and women
come out of this sign especially orators lecturers, ,

and teachers . E ducation and knowledge of all

kinds will be very beneficial for vou . Work hard
at one thing at a time and don’t try to accomplish

,

too many things in a given time . A ct as you think
best and don’t permit anyone to run your affairs .

,

By attending strictly to your own business and,

not meddling or interfering with the affairs of
others, you will become very successful . A t times
you are liable to become blue and depressed .

Really there is no cause for any Capricorn person
to ever feel dejected or disheartened as every

, thing
good in the Universe is attracted to this sign . By
being kind , gentle noble and generous you Wil, i

become very magnetic and charming and people
will love you especially those of the opposite sex .

,

You also have wonderful hypnotic powers whi ch
can be brought to a very high degree of develop
ment by always being patient and never allowing
yourself to become angry or to feel envious
or jealous of others . B oth your magnetic and
hypnotic powers will lead you to wealth and suc
cess . Be careful of your money and don’t try

,

to help others too much . A lways keep well
informed of the progress of the world and
keep your mind open broad and tolerant res

, , pect
ing the opin ion of others even if you don’t
believe in them . Always put your whole heart

,

soul and energy into everything you under
take no matter if the under

, tak ing is a small one .

I kn ow your nature is to do large and great things ,
and that is all right ; but ever remember if you do
the smallest thing in the world successfully it will
put you in a position to do something better
and greater . A ll Capricorn people ought to have
a good business education and should ever strive

,

to acquire and save money. I don’t mean to be
stingy, mean or penurious about money matters,
because no one in this great and wonderful age
wi ll be much of a success who is not liberal and
broad-minded with respect to money m atters. The



1 6 T H E HINDU BOOK OF ASTROLOGY .

women of this Sign are very sensible practical and,

lovable ; they make excellent wives managers of,

homes and housekeepers of large institutions .
Music to you is very beneficial . Some excellent
singers musicians actors an d actresses come out

, ,

of this sign . Enjoy yourself all you can in a ra

tional and sensible way such as attending social,

gatherings entertainments concerts lectures and
, , ,

public meetings . B e moderate and temperate in
all you do and your success and happiness is as

,

sured . Never doubt your ability to amass money
in any line of work which you really love ; it is
foolish for you to engage in work that is utterly
distasteful to you and in which you cannot will

,

ingly put your whole heart head and soul . Ever
,

remember that while wealth is a great thing to

have there are other equally as great things for you
to acquire viz . perfect health and a thorou cu

, , gh l
,

tivation Of your mind and higher nature . Don’t
be proud arrogant or dictatorial ; remember we are,

all of one family and that we are all God ’s chil
dren . It is difli cult to get Capricorn people to
give much time to the cultivation of the spiritual
side of their natures ; yet when once aroused in,

this respect they often become enthusiastic and
earnest workers in religious causes . Right here
I desire to state that it will be well for you to re

if you see fit to do so. There is scarcely any limit
to your powers if you only will exercise your won
derful will intelligently. A happy marriage is es
sential to the success and happiness of Capricorn
people of both sexes . In India the Yogic astrol
ogers say to you people get married and follow the,

Divine command by raising a family of children .

We also are very strict in our advice to Capricorn
people that they must love their fellowmen and do

,

unto all as they would be done by. The Golden
Rule has been practised in India for thousands of
years before the Christian Era . Your sign is gov
erned by S aturn and you are continually sur

,

rounded by plan etary forces and solar fluids which
can help you . Now dear friend be guided by

, ,

what I say as I love you dearly and wish to see you
,

make your life a grand success . You can read
every word in this book many times to great ad
vantage . A Capricorn person is very foolish to
ever doubt his or her ability to succeed .

This Sign is governed by S aturn an d the gems
,

are white onyx and moonstone . The astral colors
are garnet brown silver-gray and black

, , .

The diseases that you are most likely to suffer
'

from are indigestion and m elancholia. You are

also given to over-work because of your determin
, a

tion to succeed in whatever you undertake .

This is the last sign of the A ir Triplicity, and
people born under it will do well to give the strict
est heed and attention to what I say here . Your
strength and power lies wholly within your own
hands and it is very importan t that you so think

,

and live as to bring out your great possibilities .
You m ust not rely on your friends for help but

,

must be thoroughly self-reliant selflsupporting and,

independent. But you should rely on and pay
great attention to the teachings and writings of
good and great men and women who are striving

,

to help mankind . You have days of great happi
ness and days of great misery and you m uSt learn

,

how to avoid these blue spells and have all of your
days bright and happy . This can be done by your
understanding once and for all time that you are
possessed Of unusual powers and abilities ; but if,

you are lazy and blue you cannot use these powers.

doubts of your ability to make a grand success of
life. When you do this then will come to you great
health and wealth and your rare and natural tal,

ents will be amply rewarded . You have wonder
ful magnetic and hypnotic powers which you can

,

develop to a very high degree by keepm g quiet and
calm and free from all worry . A s a matter of fact
your planetary and solar forces will carry you
through any and all sickness or trouble if you will
only remain quiet and give them a chance to work .

B ut the very moment you begin to doubt
,

fret or w orry about any good thing com ing
to you these forces cannot work . Work

,

and lots of it is what you require and you
, ,

will not am ount to a great deal until you keep fully
occupied in some line of work which you have a
taste or inclination for . You must not be proud
or vain or think too much of yourself. If

, you do
you will not be as charming as you could by being
quiet and modest. Persons born in your sign have
no reason whatever to idly sit about deploring their
misfortunes or inability to succeed for I tell

, u
, yo ,

positively you can succeed far beyond your fondest
,

expectations if you will go about it as directed
,

here and elsewhere in this book . Read this book
carefully and thoughtfully many times when you
are calm and quiet ; i ts teachings can direct you to

all you desire . People of your sign who worry and
fret and become discouraged surround themselves
with the repelling forces of the Universe which

,

will cause their friends and acquaintances to dis
like them ; indeed they drive people from them,

who could be of great assistance when in moody or
,

blue fits . Don’t live in the senses too much . R e

member you are not here to eat drink and be merry
,

all the time. Realize that you have duties to per
form ; that God intends each one of H is children to
do certain work reap the reward and be cheerful,

and happy. Don’t be afraid or timid or half
hearted in your undertakings whether it is in

amass ing money making love or acq uiring knowl,

edge. Whatever you attempt to do or desire to be
come will be accomplished providing you have full,

faith in your ability to succeed . You ought to read
a great deal—of newspapers , magazines and books .
Reading the lives of successful men and women will
help you wonderfully. Don’t care what people
think or say about your actions . Be good and
honest and do the very best you can without fear of
criticism or without caring what your friends will
think about it. Forge ahead with strong will

, ,

and grim determination to succeed and your suc

cess will be assured . Don’t talk at all wi th your

about doing your work or carrying out your plans,

Economy and strict application to business is the

A ll persons born from February 1 9 to March 20,

Pisces people are born in the last sign of the
Water Triplicity and have a deep, hidden love na ’

,

ture they are naturally noble generous and help,

ful. In India the A strologers give much atten
tion to Pisces people and I intend here to give you
words of advice which if heeded and followed

, , ,

will lead you into the very highest realms of hap
pinces. First you must understand that your
realm is the kingdom of the soul ; that you must
ever strive to live a clean pure life be kind gentle

, , ,

and loving to all beings especially animals . The
,

world always needs loving people and it al
,

ways amply rewards them with all the good
things of the world . You can help others
and by doing so will help yourself. The
most successful men and women in this world
are those who are charming magnetic and

,

powers in their highest degree is for you to always
think well of everyone to wish everyone in the

,

world success and happiness and never in the

slightest way have any feelings of anger jealousy
,

or envy . The very best of us at times are apt to
have these bad thoughts enter our minds but with

,

patience and practice we can learn to throw such
bad and weakening thoughts out of the mind and
put in their place higher and better thoughts . Now

,

this is what you must ever strive to do and then
,

you will attract powers and forces which will make
every being dearly love you especially the oppo

,

site sex . The world will never love or serve a
low-minded man or woman You must always
aspire to be great and good and distinctly under

,

stand that if you are good honest ju t nd t ue
, s a r

, ,

you will do a great amount of good in the world
and reap the richest awards . By letting your
higher or best nature dominate your lower nature
you will draw to vou anvthing you desire . Great
health prosperity an d happiness is yours if you,

will only be true to yourself. Many fine musicians
,

artists art critics poets writers and lecturers come, , ,

out of this sign . Pisces peoplealso naturally have
good judgment and discriminating powers which

,

place them in high positions of trust and responsi
bility and we find am ong them private secretarie

stenographers bookkeepers cashiers and treasu r
, ,

crs . A lways avoid anything that is low, vulgar ,
coarse or comm on . Spend a great deal of your
time in reading poetry history, biography and,

other good and elevating literature . Listening to
much music will be very beneficial to your health
and also in developing latent forces within vou .

I would also advise you to gi ve time to outdoor ex
croise especially in the fields and woods where

, ,

you can observe nature . A ssociate all '

you can

with quiet calm and thoughtful persons and be
, ,

alone with good thoughts some time each day . If
you have a tendency to talk about yourself stop it

, ;

no one loves an egotist . At times you may feel that
all the world is against you but I sav positivelv,

that this is bad thinking and is not true ; for as a,

general thing all the world loves a Pisces person
, ,

especially when they have cultivated the higher
nature . You are really a very powerful person

,

and you can increase your force and powers by al

ways being patient calm and cheerful . God has
,

endowed you with great n atural gifts and vou
,

must realize this fact and then you will be very
,

successful and very happy . B e broad liberal and
,

tolerant, and never think falsely such as f r i

stance, that any one religion is the only true one .

God, in His great wisdom , manifests Himself in

many ways and through many religiou s and many
sects . Therefore I say with divine knowledge

, ,

and wisdom that all religions are good for m an .

,

This is the age of tolerance and liberality . Dog
mas and Creeds keep one in bondage .

Fretting worrying anxiety and impatience are
, ,

your faults at times and if you wan t health wealth
, ,

and happiness it will be necessary for you to stop
,

this sort of thing at once an d for all time . Mor
,

bid and gloomy feelings will on ly keep you down
and cause untold suffering and agony of mind . If
you are inclined to be blue,dejected or depressed ,
go off in a quiet Spot all alone and silently and

,

earnestly pray to God for Light Love and D irce
,

tion and your prayers will be immediately an
,

swered— immediate relief wi ll come to you . Peo
ple of your sign reach their highest achievement
and greatest happiness when they learn to place all
their trust and hope in the Blessed One— God

Good . He is the All in A ll and All Love and is,

always ready to help us if we will only give Him a
chance to do so .

Don’t be obstinate or stubborn or unreasonable
,

as this attitude of mind will make you suffer from
painful nervousness melancholy and despondency .

The Pisces people must be very careful to not a]
low their minds to dwell on one thing too much

and therefore ought to have diversified employ
ments . Another thing you must curb all foolish,

emotions and learn to attend strictly to your own

, , ,

with the business of others . Pisces people of both

pleasant harmonious home of their ow n is very se

sential to their happiness .
In amassing wealth you can do it easily if you

will be qu iet patient and calm about it ; but if you,

hurry and worry about money you are apt to be

poor— invite poverty . You must learn to become

powers and forces which are yours by birth will
help you . We Yogis positively know that the

faith in themselves and are hopeful cheerful and

When the higher or spiritual side of the A ries

are published and if you have a strong desire to

dwarf their nature . To counteract this bad and
injurious state of mind learn to give forth thoughts
of love and kindness to all your fellow beings and

espec ially learn to love your enemies and those
who are more successful than you are . In love
affairs you will be a dire failure if you are the least
bit jealous . No one can really love or admire any
one tainted the least bit with jealousy. Love is
always driven away by jealousy. Moreover there

you should never gloat over the failure Of anyone
who is competing with you . A great man or

Selfishness anger intense greed and impatience, ,

can also block your way to success . You must
always strive to be large and broadminded, liberal,

great heed to doing certain things or else they will
,

suffer much . In the first place you must control

your appetites and passions . I know you are gen

dinners but don’t do too much of it as you often

, ,

place them in an embarrassing position as they
,

are not able to always return your kind and gen

tunes if, they are true to their higher nature which

,

is to be large-minded broad and liberal in all they
,

do . It is easier for you to make money than it is to
save it. I would advise you to get into the habit of
saving a little money regularly for a rainy day ;
although the true developed Tauru s person will

come out of your sign . It does not make much
difference what profession or line of work you
choose you will be very successful in it provided

, ,

you will put all of your mind heart and soul into
,

it. In other words your success depends upon
,

being earnestly enthusiastic over anything you
have under way. You are a natural born leader,
and must not allow others to dictate to you what
to do . Don’t be proud vain or arrogant or even

, ,

dictatorial but go along quietly carrying out what, ,

ever plans you may have in hand and which
,

seem right to you without permitting anyone to

wonderful planetary forces and solar fluids which

surround all Taurus people . Mildness, gentleness
and consideration for others whom you feel are
inferior to yourself will make you a wonderful

man or woman . Women of this Sign must not be
overbearing and dictatorial but gentle mild and

calm and then they will wield a tremendous force .

,

Anyone who has not self-control is not reliable and
,

does not inspire confidence or respect.
Taurus people as a rule have a natural tendency

to eat and drink too much and by not curbing

ever you feel blue or dejected fast for a day or stop

and you will soon recover your spirits and be bright

A lways look upon the opposite sex with pure

minds, for overwhelming disaster now and then
comes to the Taurus person who is not pure in
mind with respect to the opposite sex . Your great
force and power is in making your higher nature
rule and dominate your lower nature— your brutal
instincts . When in a passion Taurus (the Bull'

of an Infuriated bull . You should always be on

your guard to not let your angry passions rise and
make you ridiculous to all who see you perform .

Anger is very weakening and always destroys
,

charm of character . No one can love one who gets
angry spells . One of the worst faults of the Tau
rus sign is anger. Many a person can trace mis
fortune sickness and even failure to a spell of

,

anger. Madness and anger are the signs of an un
balanced mind ; indeed it is Often the sign or fore,

runner of insanity. Don’t be too exacting arbi
,

trary or domineering and understand others have,

rights which must be respected . Naturally no
,

matter how careful you may be to avoid it you will
,

have your own way especially when your way is
,

the right and true way.

Taurus men must not be harsh or cruel to their
wives but kind and loving . If you are a married

,

man and disobey this command of the Yogis you
, ,

will suffer greatly . iVOInan i s the grandest and
best being in the world ; she is not the weaker ves

creation . Many Hindus worship God— as Mother

All Taurus people will find much happiness in
marriage especially if the marriage is blessed with

his highest success after marriage. In love affairs
you can be very successful if you will exercise

true work speak louder than boastful talk . Don’t
get discouraged or make yourself miserable because

home that it will be an example to others to do
likewise. In love affairs the Cancer people are
very successful when they are sincere and per
sistent. Laziness selfishness vanity jealousy and

dishonesty are sometimes natural to the Cancer '

or happiness can be had . You ought to dress well
,

but must not run in debt for fine clothes ; every
dollar you spend for anything ought to be a dollar
that you have earned . Don’t let people make you
vain silly and foolish by flattering you ; flattery,

can work you great harm if you listen to it . Don’t
be fickle or inconstant because a fickle person is

,

soon known and no one will place any confidence
, i

in such a person . Some women of the Cancer sign
are very fickle. Cancer is governed by the Moon

and as this satellite of our planet is changing every
month it accounts for the restless and impatient

nature of people born in your sign . You can easily
remedy all of your bad tendencies and become
very strong and great by holding in your mind all

The pronounced faults of the Virgo people are
A too strong desire to rule and dominate over peo
ple seeing the faults of others and not seeing their

,

own weak points ; false pride and false ambition ,

meddling with other people’s business and affairs
and not attending strictly to their own business ;
taking drugs and medicines for Imaginary diseases
and ailments ; conceit vanity and egotism ; false,

hood misrepresentation exag
, geration and making,

extravagant statements about matters and things
,

especially with regard to their achievements ; run
ning in debt for the sake of keeping up appear
ances. All of these bad qualities are likely to ap
pear in the lower uneducated and uncultivated

,

persons of this Sign and if you have any or all of
,

these tendencies I advise you to root them out of
your being once and for all time as they will be

,

the millstones around your neck which will keep
,

you from rising to a superior position . I do not
know of a higher or grander character than the
highly developed Virgo person ; or of a meaner and
lower being when this Sign lives on the low plane
-in ignorance and darkness . So you see it is of

the utmost importance for you to cultivate your
higher nature which is always true and

In love you will be successful when you learn to

not be too critical or exacting. If not married
,

you wi ll do well to select a life partner who is
cheerful and does not look on the dark side of
life . If you are married you can make your home

,

a very happy one by not expecting too much from
your wife or husband . Your weak point is seeing
faults in others and often a married Virgo person
carries his criticism into his or her married life
and sees too many faults in the chosen wife or
husband .

Spend much time with nature— in the green
fields and woods . Love animals and surround
yourself with flowers and domestic pets . If you
will be temperate in your eating and don’t drug
and dose yourself with medicines you can live
many years and retain youthful spirits and vigor
up to the time you pass on to the other world . The
elixir of life is yours if you will only realize that

Many eloquent speakers come out of this sign,
such as lecturers of note and preachers of promi
nence. A lso some of our best writers are Scorpio
people . When not ignorant but educated these, ,

people can turn their minds and hands to any line
of work with success .
Therefore it is very important that you read,

a great deal and acquire all the knowledge you can .

It is important that you always maintain a quiet
,

modest and dignified bearing. It is well for you to
be fond of the good things of the world dress well

, .

and have a comfortable home . In money matters
you can amass wealth by steady and persistent en
deavor in one line . A lways be provident and sav
ing and put by money for future needs or invest

,

ments . B u t don’t be stingy mean or penurious
, ;

you can be careful with money and yet spend con
siderable sums in improving your surroundings
in improving your mind . Much of your leisure
time should be given to outdoor exercise as your

only aim as being too deeply engrossed in the ac
,

quiring of riches often with Scorpio people defeats
the very end sought. Sometimes a person of thi s
S ign will get money mad and break down their
health and destroy the vigor and vi tality necessary
to everyone who amasses money. Don’t worry ;
don’t hurry ; take it easy. I mean work steadily at
something which you like and give more thought
to doing your work honestly and thoroughly and

,

in the best possible man ner than to what money it
,

will bring you . Learn to work and be busy with
the idea of the good your work will do rather than
with the thought of how much money you can get
out of it.
In love affairs you will be successful from the

very moment that you can fully control any feel
ings of anger jealousy envy or hatred . Indeed

, , ,

the worst fault of this sign and the fault which,

retards progress and success is a tendency that you
,

are likely to have -to get angry and disturbed if
things don’t go just as you think they ought to go.

For th is cause some S corpio people are not success
ful in love and business . Be kind gentle amiable

, ,

and polite to all and all will love you and your

success i s assured . By following this advice you
will become magnetic hypnotic fascinating charm

sociate with you and do business with you . This
,

means success . If you are not m arried I would ad
,

vise you to look about and select a good life partner
,

as marriage will bring you great success and hap

piness. This advice applies equally to both sexes .
And while speaking of marriage let me say the

,

Hindu Yogis positively know that the man or
woman who gets married no matter what sign

,

they are born in makes a move which can bring
,

more prosperity and happiness than anythi ng else .
We always advocate marriage and the rearing and

raising of children . It is the divine command .

God intended all of His children to marry and
raise children . Countless men and women make
life a failure and are very miserable and unhappy

,

bec ause they have disobeyed God’s command about
marriage . If you are of a nagging or jealous na
ture don’t think of marriage until you are thor
oughly cured of this mean low and bad habit ; there,

i s nothing meaner or lower in our natures than
jealousy and its twin brother envy. A jealous or
envious person will never be happy ; is never loved ;
always drives people away. Now I want you to
overcome all bad tendencies and become a good and
true being and then you can be anything you

ther and understand that in all history there never

be suspicious or want to scold or find fault with

to love God is to love all human beings and all ani

environment— be cheerful and happy, and let God
take care of the rest . When you can learn to think
this way you will be the real God-man, and the
apparent-man or shadow will vanish forever. You
are then at one with the Great One, and all force
