PREFACE  
 Our sincere thanks to Sri. Prabhu Hingorani and Smt. Savitri 

We are very happy to present this work for the rest of the Hingorani of Sadhu Vaswani Center, Dracut, Massachusetts, USA 
Vedic Astrology student community. We the students of SJC-Boston for giving us the premises free of cost for conducting the astrology 
group are very fortunate to have a Jyotish Guru like Sri. PVR classes. 
Narasimha Rao, teach us the concepts in Vedic Astrology from  
ground zero. We have been maintaining the mp3 audio of these Any mistakes in this book are totally on that part of us, the 
lessons at http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net we hope this book to students and will rectify them in due course. 
supplement the mp3 audio.   

  
 Suddenly we realized that when we wanted to go back and  

listen to a particular concept, it has been very difficult to track where Students of Narasimha 
that concept was talked about and in which lesson. So, it was an SJC-Boston 
idea to provide a summary of each class highlighting the topics 21 July 2005. 
covered and the keynotes for each of the classes. That is the 
purpose of this book. A different student summarized each lesson 
and we tried to keep the overall format of the structure very similar. 
But, there would be some differences in the presentation due to 
individual’s style of writing. 

 
Each of the classes has several important concepts covered, 

examples solved along with key points in astrology that were 
relevant to the topic of discussion but, not really part of the concept 
that was being talked about. The intention was to capture all those 
points under “key points” section. In most cases other than the 
obvious the name of the person in the example charts is left out in 
this book so that, the listener of the audio will not be biased while 
analyzing the chart. In this volume we are capturing all lessons from 
1 through 45 which were taught between 6 May 2004 and 12 June 
2005. Appendix “A” highlights all the abbreviations used in this book. 
Appendix “B” is gives quick reference of all the lessons with example 
chart’s data. 

 
We are extremely thankful to Sri. P.V.R. Narasimha Rao for 

teaching the classes to benefit all astrology students. 
 
We are thankful to Pt. Sanjay Rath for the astrology 

conferences and allowing us to associate with Sri Jagannath Center 
for learning of Vedic Astrology. 

 
We are extremely thankful to Sri.Narayan Iyer of Sri 

Jagannath Center for readily accepting our request to provide the 
guidance in putting together this material.  

 
Our thanks to Master Manasvi Putcha and to Sri.Vijay Chitra 

for the graphics on the cover design and the Audio CD preparation.

31. If two Kroora Grahas have Graha Drishti on Ju then it is called  

Brahmana Sapa.  If Sa is involved, it is sad, if Ma is involved, Compiled by Kiran Chandrashekar 
then angry and if Ra is involved, then cheated. Other sapas are  
Matru, Pitru, Kalatra, etc... Topics Covered:

of fame.  

Key Points: 
1. Concept of Hora: 

a. Weekdays, Sunday (Su), Monday (Mo), Tuesday (Ma), 
Wednesday (Me), Thursday (Ju), Friday (Ve), Saturday (Sa). 

b. What is the logic behind this order? ->HORA is the reason, 
there are 24 horas. First hora of the day starts at sunrise. 

2. Brahma Gayatri (sunrise), Vishnu’s or Achyuta’s time (noon), 
Siva gayatri (sunset), Kali gayatri (not auspicious). 

3. Distance from sun, speed w.r.t. to earth, the rule used for 
allocating houses to planets. (Sa is slowest). 

4. Hindus consider 1day starting from one Sunrise to the next. 
5. Astronomical fact is, Sa is slowest (takes 2.5yrs to move one 

sign, or 30yrs), Ju (takes 1yrs to move one rasi OR 12 yrs), Ma 
(1.5yrs), Su (1yr), Ve and Me and Mo - This is the order. 

6. For Saturday, the horas starting with Sa will be Sa, Ju, Ma, Su, 
Ve, Me. Mo. This makes one cycle of 7 hours, so for one day (of 
24hrs or horas), there will be three cycles followed by (24-21=3 
horas of) Sa, Ju, Ma - Next day begins with Sun's HORA 
(Hence, the day after Saturday is Sunday) and so and so forth. 

7. This is what Narasimha knows about an explanation for a Day 
consisting 24horas -> 12 rasis - one for day and one for night, 
hence, there are 24 hours. HORA is taken from AHORATRA, 
AHO is Day, and RATRA is night.  

8. Four houses are considered base of Purusharthas. 1, 10, 7 and 
4 are bases of the DHARMA, ARTHA, KAMA and MOKSHA 
purusharthas. 

9. DIGBALA - how close a planet is close to the base? (one of the 
strengths relate to a planet).  

10. Me and Ju are planets of dharma, Sa is planet of Kama, Su and 
Ma are planets of Artha and Mo and Ve are planets of Moksha 
depending on how far away they are to a base, they are 
accordingly given strength. This planet association is used to 
compute “shadbalas” other strengths, which will be detailed in 
future classes.

Swami Chandra Sekhar Saraswati 

 
Key Points: 
Mantra Sastra: 
1. Krishna is not only a significator for marriage and he is also for 

Learning. “Kleem krishnaya namah” – Krishna sits in 9th house of 
Guru. 

2. Siva and Parvati are the natural karakas for marriage – when 
they are in the 7th house they can give marriage. Ex: “Namah 
Sivayai cha Nama Sivaya” 11 letters, 3 words – Siva and Parvati 
in 7th house bless the marriage. These are very effective, but are 
not from a particular Veda. 

3. For specific Mantras from Vedas, it is a good idea to pray to the 
Guru who gave that Mantra or to the Rishi of that mantra before 
reciting them. Ex. Vishwamitra is the Rishi for Rigveda mantra 
“Vrishabam Charsha….”  

 
Chart Analysis: 

4. Each house signifies several matters –relevant house for that 
matter is seen from that house in the corresponding divisional 
chart. Ex 4th house stands for several things like mother, 
education, comfort, heart, real estate etc, so for education see 
4th house in D-24, for mother see 4th house in D-12 etc. 4th in 
Rasi chart shows heart. 

5. In any chart note the following in that order in seeing charts 
a. First find the divisional chart that we want to see.  
b. Then see the house that we are interested in. For ex. to 

see the learning of Jyotisha, see 8th house in D-24. 4th 
shows general education. 

c. Who owns (lord of) that house? The planet is the boss 
for that aspect. This planet can set the rules for that 
house.

Key Points: 
Arudha Padas: 
1. Grahas, Rasis, Bhavas and Vargas are the Four basic pillars of 

Vedic astrology. 
2. Arudha Padas are often mistaken to be Jaimini Astrology (Refer 

Jaimini Upadesas Sutras by Pt Sanjay Rath). Parasara has 
talked about them too (Refer BPHS). It may be noted that 
Jaimini has written in depth about the subject. 

3. The actual houses, for example, 5th house of abilities does not 
really show the measurable or perceivable aspect of the ability. 
Whereas an award marks in an examination, trophies are 
perceivable. 

4. Arudha means a “risen one”. Arudha Pada is the risen aspect – 
the perceivable aspect of any given house. It is the tangible 
aspect of a given house. 

5. Arudha of the 5th house is represented by “A5” (Refer JHORA 7) 
and so on. 

6. The analogy is, the actual house is like an object, the lord of the 
house is like a mirror and the Arudha is the image of object in 
the mirror (lord). From any house, find the distance from that 
house to its lord and Arudha of that house is the same distance 
from the house containing the lord. 

7. AL is Arudha Lagna and UL is the Arudha of 12th house, 
otherwise known as Upapada Lagna (UL). AL is one’s image – 
how people perceive the native. 

8. 1St house is Brahma sthana, 7th house (house of desire, 
marriage) is Siva Sthana and stronger of these two is where 
Narayana lives. Both 1st and 7th are to be seen for judging one’s 
attitude. 

9. 1st and the 7th houses are of Satya and Arudha is the Maya. So, 
there is an exception in this case – if the Arudha falls in the 1st or 
7th of corresponding house (not from Lagna) – then take the 10th 
house from where the computed Arudha is, to find the real

Brahma. Naisargika karakas are very useful in phalita Jyotish, i.e.

important role in one’s sustenance and achievements. Examples are 
– mother, father, wife, advisors etc.  
 
Sthira karakas include only 7 planets because only they have 
physical bodies. They are presided by Shiva. As Shiva presides over 
death, they show the destruction of body. Sthira karakas are useful 
in timing the death of various near relatives.

h. Ra it is 9th – House of dharma, temple. Ra is misfit there. 
i. Ke – There is no marana karaka sthana. 

53. For business, 7th house. 7th lord should be strong. Also some 
planets in kubera amsa can give business. 6th house being very 
strong means he will be in service. But, if he is in business, he 
will be working as hard as if he is in business since it is 6th 
house. 

54. Mo is 11th lord and also A7 and is in ASC with A3. So, the link 
with A3, A7 and 11th house can give a business in Mo dasa in 
2011. A7 is fructification of desire. A3 is the tangible initiative. 
Kind of business will be - Mo can give hospitality, restaurants 
etc… and is in Anantamsa – something related to spirituality. So, 
it is like spiritual gain helping people in that way. 

55. Next 2002-2011 is Su dasa. Taking Su in Li as LA, Ma is in 7th 
house and is 8th from original LA, so there is a potential of 
anxiety and sudden change in Ma period. Ma dasa will make 
people argumentative. Ma AD one needs diplomacy.  

56. To recommend a mantra, see the Palana devata. 
57. Look at Palana Devata. Go to Navamsa – take 6th house from 

Amk – Mo in this case. If there is a planet there in 6th house take 
that planet, if it is empty take its lord. In this chart, 6th from Mo in 
D-9 is Ta with Me. So, the god or goddess to propitiate is Shakti 
form Vishnu Avatara corresponding to that planet. For Sa, it is 
Kali; Ve  it is Lakshmi; For Mo is Parvati or Lalitha; For Ra it is 
Durga or Chinna masta; Ke it is dhoomavati; Ju is Tara or 
Saraswati; Ma it is Chamundi, Bagla Mukhi or Anjana Devi; Su 
Pingala, Matangi, Raja Rajeshwari etc… For Me it is Tripura 
Sundari (form holding sugar cane) – This will take care of 
sustenance in job and gives food. Choose any mantra for 
Tripura Sundari.

Topics Covered: 
1. What houses in a rasi chart show whether a person is a real 

saint or not. 
2. Example Chart 1: Swami Jayendra Saraswati - July 18, 1935; 

7:00 pm; 5:30:00 (East of GMT); 79E26 10N42. 
a. Analysis of dasa and antardasa indicate the arrest of 

Swamiji. 
b. Predictions about his release. 

 
Key Points: 
Rules to see if a person is a saint: 
1. 3rd house is the house of initiative and drive and 6th house is the 

house of defeating enemies. If naturally benefic planets such as 
Jupiter, Venus, Me etc., are in 3rd & 6th from AL, the person 
does not want to fight and he is not inclined materially. He is 
very gentle and restrained in public behavior. This combination 
is generally present in the charts of saints and mild natured 
people. 

2. Malefic planets in the 3rd and 6th houses from AL are good for 
materially successful persons like politicians or businessmen. 
These people are perceived as bold and who hit enemies hard. 
If there are no planets in those houses, the nature of the signs 
(malefic or benefic) and the lords of the signs will give the 
results. The sign aspect on these houses will give the secondary 
results. See if there are any benefic or malefic planets in those 
signs. 

3. If Ma is in the 3rd and Ju is in the 6th from AL, that person’s first 
instinct is to hurt his enemy, but he won’t. If Ju is in the 3rd and 
Ma is in the 6th, that person does not have the initiative to fight, 
but once he decides to fight he will finish the enemy. 

4. For the matters of Dharma and marriage Su behaves like a 
benefic, especially if he is in a friend’s sign. 

 
Moola dasa and Vimsottari dasas: 
5. To find when the results of various past life karmas are 

manifested in this life, look at the Moola dasa. This dasa shows 
the root of events from our past life. 

6. In a saint’s chart, the 9th house and the karma the 9th lord carries 
is very important. For example if the lord of 9th house is in Deva 
(divine) Shashtyamsa, a high level of dharma will be granted to 
that person. And if the ninth lord is in Rakshasa Shashtyamsa 
the dharma that person follows is defined by a lot of negative

16. Ra and Ke in the 2nd house show that the prediction is based on  
intuition not based on solid logic. Key Points: 

 1. ND talks about the ultimate truth. 
 2. Brahma lives in Lagna. Shiva governs the 7th house. Narayana is 

either with Brahma (Lagna) or with Shiva (7th house).  
3. Choosing where to start the ND is based on the following: 

a. more planets in that sign (ASC or 7th) 
b. Ju, Me, or the lord of the sign aspects (in ND, use only 

rasi aspects). 
c. Exalted planets in that house. 
d. Oddity of the sign and lord. If both are different, that 

wins. 
e. Look at the degrees occupied by the lord of the sign. 

The more the better. 
4. For further progressions, follow the order below.  

a. For a movable sign (Brahma) follow regular order. (i.e. 
next sign, next to next sign etc..). 

b. For fixed signs (Shiva) take the 6th from that sign. 
c. For a dual sign (Vishnu), go by 1, 5, 9 (dharma trikonas), 

then 10, 2, 6 (artha trikonas) then 7, 1, 3 (kama 
trikonas).  

5. One you decide on the starting sign, going forward or backward 
is based on the 9th from the dasa sign. If the 9th sign is odd 
footed (from the dasa sign), then go forward. Else go backward. 
(Ar, Ta, Ge, Li, Sc, Sg are odd footed; Cn, Le, Vi, Cp, Aq, Pi are 
even footed signs). 

6. Maximum duration for ND is 144 years. 
7. 3 different angles to interpret the chart using ND are:  

a. See where Narayana is placed. See the current ND with 
respect to natal Lagna (ex: say Ar dasa is the 8th house 
from natal LA, of occult knowledge, working hard etc).  

b. See the progressed ASC and take that as ASC and 
analyze the chart. (Take the dasa sign as ASC if 
progression starts from ASC itself. Else take 7th from 
the dasa sign as ASC and analyze the chart).

Key Points: 
 
1. Question: Does there have to be Ra/Ke in the 9H for foreign trip 

to happen during the period of the Narayana Dasa of the 9H 
sign? 

Ans: Not necessarily. The involvement of 9H or 12H and 
their lords with Ra/Ke is suffice. Ra is the karaka for the project of 
foreign travel. The house, say 9H, represents the project, the planet 
in the 9H represents the persons working in the project, the 9th lord is 
the manager of these persons. If the karaka (Ra) has sufficient 
control, or if the karaka is a good friend of the people-manager, then 
the project will be done successfully. This is true in Rasi and also in 
D-4.

In each divisional chart, there is a particular placement of AL and  
there are various planets that influence it. This shows that in Key Points: 
each areas of the life, there are different influences, which may Example Chart 1 and explanation of Rule 
also change with respect to time. 1. Ar is the present Narayana Dasa of the Rasi Chart. Ar is in 8H. 

 Hence, during this dasa, 8H results can be given. Lord of Ar is 
Ma which is 3L as well. Hence, during this dasa, 3H results can 
also be given. Lord of Ar is 8H, hence in this case 8H results (i.e. 
the result of the house containing the Dasa Lord) again may also 
be given. If there are planets, which are aspecting the Dasa rasi, 
they can also give their results during the period. Hence, several 
results are possible in Ar dasa itself. 

2. Also for example, if Le is the running dasa, then 12H results can 
be given as Le is in the 12H. Additional results that are possible 
are: 10H (as Le is 10th from AL), 7H (as its Lord Su is in 7H), 
result of Ke, result of 3H (as 3L is Ke), results of Ju, Ve, Ma, Me 
and Sa (as they aspect Le by rasi drishti). Thus again a number 
of results can occur in Le dasa. There are clear rules to find out 
which result is experienced in which part of the dasa. 

3. To prove the point further, Cn is the second dasa and is in the 
11H. Hence during this dasa, there could have been gains. As 
11L Mo is aspecting it by rasi drishti, there may be some gains 
related to food business or nursing business (Mo significations). 
Again, Mo is in the 6H of enmity and also afflicted by Ra. Hence 
some enmity may also be experienced. Whether the enmity is 
related to gains is a different issue, but the fact that there is a 
possibility of enmity is clear. Suppose, the 4 L or 7L Ju is placed 
in Cn, there could be gain related to 4H and 7H (home/car/wife 
etc) or relationship with the spouse may be harmonious (as Ju in 
Cn would be exalted). 

4. Parasara defined some signs as Sirshodaya Rasis (Sirsha or

quadrant lord placed in develoka. So these results are likely to 4 minutes in the D-24 and every 6 minutes in the D-20 and every 2

Chandra vimsottari, even if ASC is marginally stronger.  

 Q2: How do you predict events and what planets do you look at and 
also what houses to see the effects? 
Every planet’s position can be taken as an ASC and looked at issues 
covering those planets. We look at the moon as the ASC to judge 
how the mind of the person is. To see what the level of energy or 
drive is, we look at mars as the LA. To look at the wisdom or 
intelligence we use Ju as the LA. For sense pleasures and 
happiness we look at Ve as the LA.  The philosophy of Astakavarga 
is based on this principle. If you want to see the hard work and 
discipline the person will have then look at Sa as the LA. Look at the 
ownership, occupancy, avastha.  
 
For example if Ju is the 8th lord in the 8th house we first see what 
planet it is and then its agenda and how is it disposed. The ASC 
stands for the sum total of your being. So if you take Ju as ASC here 
the first thing you see is that Ju is well placed in its own house, then 
look at how the other planets are in relation to Ju in the 8th house as 
the LA. See if the planets are helping or hurting Ju and its agenda. 
Ju in the 8th is a good yoga in its own house. The agenda is the 8th 
house so all the positive aspects of the 8th house (sudden 
developments in life, beneficial changes) will come into play. The 8th 
lord in the 8th house is called Sarala yoga and since it is Ju its effect

pray which is most effective.  
 Key Points: 

Example Chart 1:  
1. This chart is presented  with 10 minute uncertainty. Discussed 

below is GMT and Local Mean time. 
2. Every place had its own time before the standard time came into 

vogue. In JHORA, If you use LMT instead automatically, it will 
make Time Zone 0 basically making it mutually exclusive.  

3. Reason, Look at the Longitude, 2 W 13 minutes of GMT. Apply 4 
minutes for every degree...13minutes can be approximated to 
1/4 degree(15minutes). Therefore, LMT will be off from standard 
time by 2.25 degrees*4 = roughly 9minutes.  

4. Basically, 20:16 LMT and 20:25 GMT are one and the same. 
You can verify this using Jhora with and without checking "Use 
LMT instead". There is a small error, however.  

5. Its not that one is more accurate than the other. If your watch 
was set to LMT or GMT, you should enter the time accordingly in 
JHora.If you were to accurately find the LMT, it comes to 20:15:8 
and this was approximated to 20:16. Both these times have the 
same ASC. 

6. Usually people use clock time, based on a particular TZ, 
standard time. Radio time is found for the particular line that 
goes through. Radios/TVs stick to standard time. Old charts 
were calibrating it for the LMT, as far as they are concerned, 
they are at a fixed point.  

7. Tricky only when you look at old charts. Somebody may have 
converted standard to LMT or vice versa, you need to ask that 
person. You may have to take both into account(cause you can
