CHAPTER TWO 

THE ASTROLOGY OF REINCARNATION 

PART I - THE TIME LINK 

It is generally accepted in the astrological com­
munity today that the Nodes of the Moon represent 
the major key towards understanding your life as part 
of a continual thread. Many astrologers believe that the 
Nodes hold more importance than the rest of the chart. 
To a qualified expert a knowledge of the Sun , Moon and 
Nodal positions can reveal the entire life of the individ­
ual. 

At one level these Nodes reveal the track that your 
soul is running on in the current life , while the rest of 
the horoscope adds additional information as to how 
you are to make the journey. It is through the Nodes 
that Western astrology is now able to make its first 
inroads into relating this divine science to the Hindu 
concept/of reincarnation. 

The Nodes represent the cause. and effect relation­
ships by which you lead your life . They are the differ­
ence between mundane and spiritual astrology. 

Here we find our first clues as to why the rest of 
the chart is manifesting the way it is. The personality 
and life of the individual have little meaning if not seen 
within a larger c ontext. The Nodes place the individual 
on his stairway to heaven insofar as they define the 
karmic lessons he has chosen to take on for this life. 
Therefore his trials and tribulations begin to have new

CHAPTER THREE 

THE NODES IN THE SIGNS 

ARIES NORTH NODE: LIBRA SOUTH NODE 

Here the soul is learning the lessons of self-con­
sciousness on the most elemental levels . E xperiences 
in prior incarnations did not permit the Self to form as 
a singular identity. Now the individual is paying the 
price for the indecisiveness of his former lives as well 
as learning how to rise out of his confusion by develop­
ing "one-mindedness . "  

Highly susceptible t o  flattery, h e  goes far out of 
his way to do the things he believes will please others, 
but because he has not yet himself gone through ego 
identification , he becomes confused as to what course 
of action to take. Always trying to balance those around 
hi�, he finds himself to be the eternal referee between 
two or more opposing ideas , people, or conditions. 
Standing in the middle, he assumes the role of the 
buffer trying desperately to bring harmony to both 
sides at the same time. From moment to moment 
and day to day, he seesaws from one side to the other, 
hoping that he will never be required to take a definite 
stand ! 

In prior lives he judged his happiness by the suc­
cesses or failures of those close to him. Now he con­
tinues to identify his life through others. His confidence 
can easily be shattered for he hardly yet knows who

CHAPTER FIVE 

ASPECTS TO THE NODES 

The desirability of one Node over the other is not a 
constant. Until such time as the South Node has per­
formed at its highest possible level, the individual will 
find less reward in the North Node than he expects. 

Since the South Node symbolizes a culmination of 
behavioral characteristics from many lifetimes, it 
would only be by bringing such behavior through a pro­
gressive evolution that the individual would be ready 
to benefit from his North Node. 

If he puts the cart before the horse, he is too liable 
to approach his North Node in its most negative sense; 
but if he strives to overcome the ways in which his 
South Node is holding him back, then he will find Di­
vine Guidance in the surprise blessings his North Node 
yields. 

CONJUNCTIONS TO THE SOUTH NODE 

Karmic lessons, taking more than one lifetime to 
learn, show up with strong planetary conjunctions to 
the South Node. The addition of such planetary ener­
gies to the soul's remembrance of its purpose creates 
a mandatory condition wherein the South Node lessons 
are to be lived again . 

This configuration should not necessarily be deemed 
a negative condition . Individuals who have acquired a 
great deal of knowledge or talent are thusly afforded

factors within the chart are still harmoniously inte­
grated within the singular soul entity under considera­
tion. 

Complete understanding of the horoscope is much 
like the threading of a needle . The loose fibers at the 
end of the thread go in all different directions, but they 
are part of the original thread. Still the needle cannot 
be threaded until all these loose fibers are wound to­
gether. When the thread is brought to a single point, it 
fits through the eye of the needle easily. 

In like manner, the Nodes must always agree with 
the rest of the horoscope. Each planetary configura­
tion is as a brush stroke to a painting, but together 
the painting is more than just a summation of brush 
strokes. 

Through careful study of the full horoscope, it be­
comes possible to pull all the loose thread fibers and 
sundry brush strokes together so that the singular 
reason for life can emerge . 

Charts read in this way are interpreted on the soul 
level, and thus have infinitely more meaning for the 
individual, who after all is much more than his person­
ality desires ,  transitory illnesses, and emotional frus­
trations.

EDGAR CAYCE 

Here we find the Pisces-Virgo Nodes with the North 
Node in the 7th house conjunct Saturn. This conjunction 
is our first indication that the karma and the mission !3 Ci 30 

are harmonious with each other. 
The 1st house South Node indicates that in this in­ I �rr 

carnation the soul is not here for itself, but rather for 
the purpose of dedicating the life through sacrifice 
(Pisces ) to others (7th house ) .  This is confirmed further 2.J � 
by so much of the chart's weight in the western hemi­
sphere. 

Pisces is the sign of cosmic consciousness while 
Virgo is the sign of finite consciousness. The life work 
here would be to teach (Saturn conjunct Mercury) the \._...- ______� J{)= 
existence of something more (North Node in Pisces ) 
than the purely mechanical nature (South Node in 
Virgo ) through which man looks at himself (1st house ) .  

To accomplish this, four Pisces planets accompany 
the North Node, giving the chart a broader perspective 
of universal understanding. To be able to attune to the 
more subtle psychic vibrations Cayce would have to be 
a gentle man, and this is aided by the Pisces Venus.

Mercury is designated as poorly placed with an inability 1 3 111? 30 

to crystallize thought. When used on higher planes , 
however, as Cayce unquestionably did, it allows for an 
unlimited flow of ideas as well as cosmic messages. 
Saturn conjunct the Mercury shows that these ideas 
were to be put to some practical use for humanity. EDGAR CAYCE 

With three planets in Taurus, Cayce was very much 
a Venus-Neptune soul, which accounts so much for 
his willingness to throw his life on the altar of sacrifice 3- 1 8- 1877

CHRISTINE JORGENSON

In the chart of Christine Jorgenson we find the 
Cancer-Capricorn Nodes, which are always indicative Z I 'Y' 
of a shift in the hormonal balance. The Capricorn 
South Node in the 4th house would show Christine's 
early years in this life to be more influenced by trying 
to continue prior life patterns of masculine dominance. 
As Capricorn indicates the father role, there would be 
much soul memory of living up to masculine expecta­
tions. As maturity sets in , an individual tends to lean 
more to their 10th house than their 4th, and in doing 
so Christine would be confronted with the Cancer North �
Node, which is so peculiarly feminine by contrast . The 27 2

Moon-ruled Cancer allows for the free flowing of the 
female emotion, whereas the Capricorn South Node has 
a tendency to block the normal emotional flow. h 

With both Nodes in Cardinal signs,  new beginnings 2' 7riJ 
here are indicated. As Capricorn is a sign of bringing 
things to a conclusion (it rules the gates of death 
through which the soul leaves the body) ,  and as Cancer

the current incarnation is completing one way of life 
in order that it may start on a new path. Pluto forming , CHRISTINE JORGENSON

We often find some evidence of martyrdom inherent 
in the sign Leo, and with his Moon, North Node and 
Midheaven there, Gandhi was perfectly willing to at­
tempt India's unification single-handedly, using him­
self as an example to others. 

He worked long and hard on destroying all the 
lower parts of his own being, with the full understand­
ing that before one can transform a nation, one must 
conquer himself. Through the three Scorpio planets in 
the 1st house, he nearly brought about his own death

Eventually Gandhi's hunger strikes (Uranus in

mous. His method of passive resistance (Aquarius 
South Node, Libra Sun in the 12th ) was no longer folly 
but would indeed liberate the entire country as well as 
be adopted as a primary future method of political ex­
pression throughout the world .  

Gandhi's South Node in Aquarius indicates prior 
lifetimes in which he developed the concepts of humane 
understanding. Along with his Libra Sun in the 12th 
which brings much of his past karma forward, this 
would make him totally opposed to all forms of violence 
in the present incarnation . 

From a prosperous profession in his youth, Gandhi
