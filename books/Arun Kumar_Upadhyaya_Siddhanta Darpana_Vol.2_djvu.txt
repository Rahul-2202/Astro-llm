SIDDHANTA-DARPANA 


(1899 A.D.) 


English Translation with Mathematical 
Explainations and Notes 


Vol. Il 


Arun Kumar Upadhyay, IPS ° 
M.Sc., AIFC 


Present second volume 
translates all the verses in 
English. Translation is not 
literal but in mathematical 
terms, but preserving the 
technical terms in Sanskrit. 
Verses in praise of god have 
been left out, not because of 
disrespect. With all devotion 
inspired by Samanta 
Chandrashekhar, this is not 
the purpose of the second 
volume. In addition to trans- 
lation, each formula has been 
explained or derived accord- 
ing to modern mathematics 
and astronomy. The methods 
have been compared with 
other Indian astronomers and 
some times with other 
countries and with modern 
astronomy. This~ was the 
method and: purpose, of 
Samanta himself. 

Technical terms and 
their calculations cannot be 
explained in words alone. So 
a general mathematical and 
technical introduction is 
given at beginning of each 
chapter with bibliography or 


source reference for further 


study. In that light only, ‘the 
methods proved in the chap- 
ter can be understood. 
Where-ever considered use- 
ful, methods have also been 
explained with examples, 
based .on .text as well as 
modern astronomy.

INTRODUCTION 


(1) Arrangement of the book - 


Scope - Original book was written in 2,500 
Sanskrit verses in Oriya script on palm leaves. It 
was published with introduction in English by Prof. 
Jogesh Chandra Roy of Ravenshaw College, Cuttack 
by Calcutta University in 1899. Subsequently same 
edition was reproduced with approximate Oriya 
translation by Pandit Vir Hanumana Shastri, by 
Utkal University, Bhubaneswar (then at Cuttack). 
This was reprinted by Dharmagrantha Stores, 
Cuttack. Some parts have not been translated and 
explained. First volume of this book renders the 
Sanskrit verses in devanagari script with literal 
Hindi translation. It also contains the original 
introduction. 


Present second volume translates all the verses 
in English. Translation is not literal but in 
mathematical terms, but preserving the technical 
terms in Sanskrit. Verses in praise of god have 
been left out, not because of disrespect. With all 
devotion inspired by Samanta Chandrashekhar, this 
is not the purpose of the second volume. In addition 
to translation, each formula has been explained or 
derived according to modern mathematics and 
astronomy. The methods have been compared with 
other Indian astronomers and some times with 
other countries and with modern astrohomy. This 
was the method and purpose of Samanta himself. 


2 Siddhanta Darpana 


Technical terms and their calculations cannot 
be explained im words alone. So a_ general 
mathematical and technical introduction is given at 
beginning of each chapter with bibliography or 
source reference for further study. In that light 
only, the methods proved in the chapter can be 
understood. Where-ever considered useful, 
methods have also been explained with examples, 
based on text as well as modern astronomy. 


In Sanskrit verse, some number or statement 
has been continued in many verses due to poetic 
and literal explainations. They have been clubbed 
together for translation. For brevity and simplicity, 
many parts have been given in chart form. Chapter 
23 contains only verses in praise of god. Most of 
these verses have two or more meanings. It cannot 
be expressed in other language, nor it is related 
to the main topic. It is, therefore, omitted.” 


2. Numeration 


Decimal system of writing numbers originated 
in India. Arabs called them Hindu numerals. 
Europeans learrit from Arabs and termed them 
Arabic numerals, This system uses 10 symbols 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, each increasing by 
one. For writing greater numbers, successive 
positions towards left are“tsed, each place having 
ten times the value of position on its right side. 
Similarly, fractions are written towards right from 
the unit place after giving a point, called decimal. 
Each place has value of 1/10th of the value of its 
predecessor towards left. 


Modern computers use binary system with 
two symbols 0 and 1 only, each place value 


Introduction 3 


increasing two times towards left. In angular and 
time measurements of Indian astronomy, continued 
till today, multiples or divisions by 60 at each step 
is used. This was used in Sumerian mathematics 
for all numbers and is called sexa-gesimai (60) 
system. 


Aryabhata, I, has given the following order 
of place values, each ten times the preceding - 

Eka (units place), Dasa (ten place), Sata 
(hundred), Sahasra (thousand), Ayuta (ten 
thousand) Niyuta (hundred thousand or lakh), 
Prayuta (ten lakhs or a million), Koti (ten millions

etc. 


Sankara Varman in his Sadratnamala (1,5-6) 
has given the following sequence in multiples of 
10 - 

Eka (1), Daga (10), Sata (100), Sahasra (1,000), 
Ayuta (10,000), Niyuta (or lakh, 10°), Prayuta (105),

Nikharva (10"), Mahapadma (10”), Sanku (101%), 
Varidhi (10'*), Antya (10%) and Parardha (10?’) 

Lalita-vistara, a Buddhist text gives powers of 
10 beyond 100 koti (i.e. 10°), each increasing 100 
times the previous -

Aryabhata notation - Varga letters (k to m) 
should be written in varga places (unit place and 
hundred times at each step) and avarga letters (y 
to h) in the avarga places. Varga letters take the 
numerical values (1,2,3 ..... 25) from k onwards. 
Numerical value of the initial avarga letter y is ni 
plus m (i.e. 5+25), next letters are 40° to 90. In 
nine places of double zeros, nine vowels should 
be written (cne vowel for each pair of varga and 
avarga letters). 


Katapayadi notation was before Aryabhata and 
is believed to have been used in vedas in portions 
related to astronomy or mathematics. It was very 
popular in Kerala. Each digit is represented by a 
consonant letter. Vowels and half letters have no 
meaning. Digits are written from right to left to 
form a number. Numbers 1 to nine and the 0 are 
indicated by letters starting from k, t, p, or y, 
hence the system is called katapayadi.

4, A brief survey of Indian astronomy 


Astronomy has come from old French word 
‘astronomie’ which in turn was derived from Latin 
‘astronomia’ and Greek ‘astronomos’ - meaning star 
law. 


‘Jyotisa’ in Sanskrit means the same - ‘Jyoti’ 
means source of light i.e.a star in a sky; study of 
star groups and motion of Diane observed 
through them is jyotisa. 


6 Siddhanta Darpana. 


Greek astronomy had its origin in Nile river 
and Sumerian civilisation. Western astronomers try 
to establish that vedic jyotis is originated from 
Sumer and later Indian astronomy is influenced by 
Greek. But internal astronomical evidence suggests 
that text of vedanga jyotisa was written in 2976 
B.C. when summer solstice started (verse 6 tells 
that Magha month began when Sun was in mid 
ASlesa. Full moon point was 1°13’ east of mid 
magha i.e. 8° east of Regulas at present at 150°56’ 
- difference of 68°56’). However, system is much 
older, and many changes have been made from 
Taittiriya Samhita. 

Vedanga jyotisa is found in two texts - Rkveda 
has 36 verses on the topic and yajurveda has 43 
verses. Many are common, but the system is 
entirely different. Yajur jyotisa was written 624 
years after Rk jyotis according to internal evidence. 
Compiler of Rk jyotis is ‘Lagagha.’ According to 
difference in day lengths, mentioned in verse 7 
and 22, they refer to a place of 34°50’ North 
latitude. In northern borders of India, this is near 
Alma - Ata of Kyrgiz. Since it was first seat of 
learning, first school is called alma-meter is Greek. 


So far, authors have assumed that both 
versions of vedanga jyotisa denote 5 years yuga 
(or cyclic period). Accordingly text of Rk jyotisa 
had to be modified and twisted. But now Sri P.V. 
Holay of Nagpur in his Vedic Astronomy (1988) 
has proved that the original text of Rk jyotisa 
indicates a 19 year yuga - after which solar and 
lunar years start together. There are 7 extra months 
in a yuga, their adjustment is such that 5 solar 
years start within 6 days of new moon. Such 


Introduction 


approximately concurrent years are called 
Samvatsara. Other types of years are Anuvatsara, 
Parivatsara, Idvatsara and Idavatsara. Thus the 
statement that a yuga has 5 samvatsaras doesn’t 
mean that 5 years make a yuga as assumed so far. 
It means only that out of 19 years in a yuga, 5 
are samvatsaras. 19 years cycle was later on 
discovered by a Greek astronomer Meton in 432 
B.C. and is called Metonic cycle. However, this 
cycle was used by Sumerians and Chinese also in 
their calender much before the Greeks. It is certain 
that astronomy in the whole world had single 
system. Irrespective of origins, there was exchange 
and compilation of ideas, and same standard was 
adopted as in the modern sciences. Fhus houses 
of zodiac and constellations have the same names 
in all the lahguages. There is similar correspon- 
dance in medical names of Greek origin and their 
Sanskrit names in yoga or ayurveda. 


Vedanga Jyotisa was followed by Garga 
Samhita and Paitamaha Siddhanta and Jain works 
Sirya-pannati and Jyotiskarandaka with minor 
changes. This period was followed by so called 
Siddhanta period. According to traditional Indian 
belief, there were 18 such siddhantas - (1) Surya 
(2) Paitamaha (3) Vyasa (4) VaSistha (5) Atri (6) 
ParaSara (7) KaSyapa (8) Narada (9) Gargya (10) 
Marici (11) Manu (12) Angira (13) Lomaga (or 
Romaka) (14) Pauliga (15) Cyavana (16) Yavana (17) 
Bhrgu and (18) Saunaka, Five of these siddhantas 
- Saura, Paitamaha, VaSistha, Romaka and Paulisa 
~ were codified by Varahamihira in his 
Pancasiddhantika (184 B.C.) who has, emphasised 
that the Saura was most accurate of them. 


8 Siddhanta Darpana 


Saura or Surya Siddhanta has no human 
authorship. Second verse of the text states that 
when short time (or 121 years in Katapayadi) was 
remaining in end of Satyuga, Sun god taught this 
to Maya asura. Yuga system of this originates from 
Visnudharmottara purana according to Brahmagup- 
ta which is modification of old Brahma (or 
Paitamaha) siddhanta. 


In Vardhamihira’s Saura, a period of 180,000 
years has been stated which contains 66,389 inter 
calary months and 10,45,095 ommitted lunar days 
(tithis). Modern Strya Siddhanta tells about a 
mahayuga (or yuga) of 43,20,000 years divided into 
Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali ages in ratio of 4:3:2:1 
(12,000 divine years) with 1/12" period each in 
beginning and end as sandhya (twilight period). 
360 solar years are called a divine year. Paitamaha 
siddhanta is crudest and has 5 years yuga like 
yajus jyotisa. Vasistha has improvement and deals 
with true motion of 5 planets. Sidereal year has 
been stated of 365 1/4 days. 


Pauliga siddhanta is more accurate and gives 
days counts (ahargana) and sine tables. It gives 
solar year of 365.2583 days. Al-Baruni has regarded 
Pauliga as a Greek from Alexandria (Sachau I, 
p/153). 

Romaka gives a luni-solar cycle of 2850 years 
with 1,050 intercalary months and 16,547 omitted 
lunar days. Length of year is 365 days 5h 5512” 
and synodic month is 29 days 12h 44’2.2”. It deals 
with equations of centre for Sun and moon: 


_ Among present compiled texts, Aryabhatiya 
of Aryabhata I (476 A.D.) of 121 verses is the first. 


Introduction 9 


It is a brief codification of existing knowledge after 
observatory (khagol village) near Kusumpur 
(modern Patna, capital of Bihar) was destroyed in 
Hina attack. It is more an attempt to preserve the 
science in verse form, than to write a text book. 
For brevity, he has devised his own number 
system, as explained before. Subsequent 
astronomers made appropriate corrections and 
devised simpler methods of calculations in their 
texts. 

Jyotisa has three parts - (1) Ganita - cor- 
responding to modern astronomy and mathematical 
methods (2) Phalita - Astrology (3) Hora or Samhita 
- auspicious times, natural phenomena, signs in 
human beings and animals etc. Ganita’ is written 
in three styles - (1) Siddhanta is a text for 
calculation from beginning of yuga. (2) Tantra starts 
the calculation from beginning of Kaliyuga (17/18- 
2-3102 B.C. Ujjain mid-night) (3) Karana uses short 
methods for current years ephemeris with reference 
to a recent base year. Its literal meaning and use 
is same as that of a handbook or a manual.

(5) Astronomers of Orissa 


Orissa was part of the Indian tradition of 
Jyotisa from vaidic and siddhanta period. 
Astronomy and mathematics were related to Yajnas 
whose time was found with astronomy and 
construction was as per geometric diagrams. In 
Orissa, Brahmanic titles related to yajnas still. exist 
like - Hota; Udgata, Brahma, Pathi, Pati, Vagmi 
etc. It is quite probable that Taittirlya Samhita and 
Aranyaka, Aitareya and Gopatha Brahmana etc. 
the aranyaka granthas forming origin of astronomy 
flourished in places like western Orissa which were 
famous as aranya or mahakantara. Another indica- 
tion of rise of astronomy is the sea trade from 
Orissa coast to East Asia and upto Roman Empire. 
Due to popularity of Bali yatra, it is thought that 
sea trade of Orissa was only with Bali - a small 
island in Indonesia. However, the relations must 
have developed with other areas of South East 
Asia and Chinese coast and intermediate islands 
of Andamana group must have formed base for 
supply of food etc. Late Dr. N.K. Sahu in his 
history of Orissa states that silk of Sambalpur was 
known in Roman empire also. This confirms that 
ships from Orissa and other parts of India were 
going to different parts of the world. Technically, 
visit to America was also possible and traditional 
jyotisa texts mention a town 90° east of Ujjain 
(yamakoti) which should be in New Zealand 
(southern hemisphere). Hence yama is lord of south 
direction. 180° east of Ujjain in Siddhapura in 
North hemisphere. At this longitude there is a 


Introduction 13 


town near Mexico where greatest Pyramid was built 
- Valmiki Ramayana calls it a gate built by Brahma 
to indicate end of east direction i.e. 180° East of 
Ujjain at prime meridian in Indian Astronomy 
(Kishkindha kanda). To a layman this discussion 
appears irrelevant to astronomy. However, sea 
journey (and plane journey in modern times) is 
not possible without knowledge of astronomy. 
There are no landmarks in sea or sky for finding 
the way. Hence navigation requires accurate deter- 
mination of longitude, latitude and direction. These 
three are discussed in an important chapter 
Triprasnadhikara’ of Sirya siddhanta. It is note- 
worthy that Columbus could undertake his journey 
in open sea only because method of finding 
longitude was discovered in western astronomy ten 
years before that. That was from Turkish ships 
who had learnt astronomy from India. Vice versa, 
longitude determination in remote past indicates 
that India was well versed in navigation round the 
globe. 

Transport of rice from Orissa was marked by 
Salivahana Saka in 78 A.D. - it means transport of 
rice (Sali = rice, Vahana - carriage). As a product 
of Audra (Orissa), rice was called Audriya i.e. 
Oryza in greak. This has become rice in English . 
(omitting ‘0’) and Orissa as name of the state. 
Navigation history indicates traditional study of 
astronomy in Orissa. 


Surya Siddhanta has been given by sun god, 
whose worship is most common in coastal areas 
and river ports in India and elsewhere (Japan, 
Egypt, Mexico, Peru etc.). Jyotisa study might have 
suffered during Buddhist era in OrfsSsa. It again 


14 Siddhanta Darpana 


picked up after Varahamihira in orissa like other 
parts of India. Ganga period (650 to 900 A.D.) 
records of Orissa indicate that Brahmans were well 
versed in Vedanga of which jyotisa is a part. One 
person has specifically been mentioned as 
siddhanti. Satananda was most famous of old 
astronomers of Orissa. 


Satananda - He was son-of Safkara and 
Sarasvati of Purushottampura (Puri) who completed 
his famous work Bhasvati’ in 4200 yugabda (1099 
A.D.). He has made calculations with reference to 
Puri. Full name of Bhasvati was Parica siddhanta 
sara or Paficasiddhanta - Bhasvati on pattern of 
Pancasiddhantika of Varahamihira. However, he 
has followed Stirya siddhanta only which is 
considered most accurate. It is a Karana grantha 
following solar year starting from Sayana mesa 
samkranti. It was popular for its accurate calculation 
of eclipse - 7é% areal a= Commentaries on Bhasvati-

his birth time by planetary positions which is free 
of a calendar system.

Important events of his life - He did not 
have formal university education. Even though he 
was born in a royal family, he sufferred poverty 


18 Siddhanta Darpana 


and unhappy family throughout his life. He 
sufferred from chromic dyspepsia and stomach 
inflammations frequently. At the age of 22, he 
married princes Sita Devi of Afgula Raj family. 
Due to his ugly looks his father-in-law showed 
reluctance to give his daughter in marriage in lagna 
mandapa. When he showed his deep knowledge 
of Sastras and mastery over Samskrta verses, his 
marriage was solemnised (possibly on 28-2-1858). 
He had 5 sons and 6 daughters, out of which two 
sons had expired. He was banished from 
Khandapada by his ruler, being his own cousin. 
But due to his knowledge, he gained wide fame 
and his rights were restored by the then commis- 
sioner of Cuttack. He was also given a ‘Sanad’ in 
honour of his achievements. His work “Siddhanta 
Darpana” cannot be fully understood by a person 
unless he is well versed in Indian astronomy as 
well as modern mathematics. Whatever is known 
‘to common public about the book or its author is 
based on the English introduction by Prof. Jogesha 
Chandra Roy. This is based on personal interviews 
and not on a study of the book. So, many vital 
points have been left out. Samanta expired on 
11.6.1904. On the basis ofthis horoscope he had 
foreseen his death; which is expressed by his son 
Gad&dhara in an Oriya verse-meaning - ‘father 
called me near and told that moon had entered 
his maraka nakSatra, and there was no escape from 
death”. In last but one verse of Siddhanta Darpana, 
he has expressed desire that his body should fall 
at the feet of Lord Jagannatha. On his last day, 
he went for darshana of lord. At the time of bowing 
before Jagannatha, he expired. At every place in 


Introduction 19 


the book, he has shown his deep faith in lord and 
the scriptures. He has accepted his experimental 
observations only when they found support in 
some scripture. 

His works - Siddhanta Darpana is work of 
his whole life. At the end of every chapter two 
fold purpose of this book is explained - (1) 
Balabodha - i.e. a text book and (2) Ganita-Akéi 
Siddhi - i.e. tally of calculation and observation. 


For text book purpose, this is a treatise on 
Indian astronomy containing relevant positions of 
all text books from Sakalya Samhita to siddhanta 
books starting from Aryabhata. Quotation from 
Atharvaveda is unique in Indian astronomy; as it 
is only correct figure for sun’s diamater, ‘in Indian 
astronomy or in western astronomy before advent 
of telescope about 300 years ago. It is most 
voluminous book on astronomy with 2500 verses. 
Next largest are VateSwara Siddhanta with 1100 
verses or Siddhanta Siromani with 900 verses. 

Ganita-Akéi Siddhi has three fold significance. 
As every other science, purpose of astronomy is 
to tally mathematical calculations with observations. 

Books starting with Aryabhata have only 
formulated or coded the existing knowledge, they 
have not indicated source of such figures. Methods 
are often in-completely explained and only refer to 
Vedic origin which is not clear. Thus purpose of 
math is only to find calculation methods for finding 
the observed position. Siddhanta books are not 
concerned about mathematical models, theories of 
gravitation or theories of motion. We are satisfied 


20 Siddhanta Darpana 


when calculations give correct result and not 
bothered whether Sun or earth is centre of motion. 


Third aspect is that there is slight change in 
planetary motion over long periods of time as 
stated in Surya siddhanta. This happens due to 
tidal friction. But siddhanta texts after Aryabhata 
have assumed constant motion throughout yuga or 
a kalpa of 1000 yugas. Due to approximation of 
constants or errors in calculation methods there is 
some deviation in observed results. In every period 
astronomers have corrected the constants given in 
Sarya Siddhanta. according to need. These are 
called Bija corrections. 


Researches of Candrashekhara : 

(1) Moon’s Motion (a) Traditionally moon’s 
equation was of the form - 

300'49.5,” Sin (nt-2) + 2’23.25” Sin 2 (nt-c) 

2nd term is equation of apsis introduced by 
Brahmagupta. This form is correct, but constant is 
slightly wrong. 

(b) Sripati had found effect of Sun’s attraction 
on moon motion (called evection). This has been 
introduced as Tungantara correction by 
Candrasekhara given as 

-160’ cos(@ ~ a) Sin (D — @) x 

Moon's apparent daily motion 

daily mean motion 

Error is about 4’ only. 

(c) Bhaskara II had observed a fortnightly 
variation in moon’s motion giving an error of 
maximum of 6 dandas in middle of pak&a. 


Introduction 1 


Comparing with his own observation, Samanta 
gave the PakéSika equation as 

38/12” Sin 2 (D-6) 

where D’ is moon corrected by Ist and 2nd 
equation 

(d) Due to Sun’s annual motion, a digamSa 
correction also was introduced. 

+11'27.6” Sin (Sun’s distance from apogee) 

These equations almost give the modern value 
and are to be further checked after 1000 years. 

(2) AyanamSa - According to modern theory, 
earth’s axis is rotating in a conical motion complet- 
ing almost uniform circular motion in 25,726 years. 
Samanta has assumed libration theory’ that the 
motion is not circular with 360° rotation but 
pendulum like oscillations within values of 27°, 
but with uniform motion. Present value of 
Ayanami tallies with both theories. Only after 300 
years or so error may be noticed. He has corrected 
the value of Surya siddhanta slightly (6,40, 170 
revolutions in a kalpa, instead of 6 lakh revolutions 
according to Surya siddhanta). Liberation theory is 
not supported by modern astronomy but it may 
be correct according to methods of projective 
geometry used in Jain Astronomy (Thesis by Sri 
S.S. Lishk). 


(3) Mandocca gati - According to classical 
mechanics, planets move in elliptical orbit whose 
major axis is fixed in space. Partly due to act 
of other planets (mainly jupiter) and partly due to 
general theory of Relativity (1917 - Einstein), force 
of attraction reaches at speed of fight, not 


22 Siddhanta Darpana 


instantaneously - mandocca (apogee) is moving 
slowly. For mercury, it was calculated to be 1° in 
11,000 years which was tested in 1919. In 300 years 
since Tycho Brahe, it is only 1/36° of an angle. 
For other planets it is so slow that it cannot be 
measured even by modern instruments. Indian 
astronomy gives 1° in 12,000 years for mercury 
and 39 revolutions of Saturn in 1 Kalpa or 1° in 
3 lakh years. ‘Cosmology’ by Narlikara gives its 
rate of movement as 
62 GM 
L Te" 

where M = mass of Sun, T = period of planet 
Samanta has introduced a new concept of Parocca 
for Mars and Saturn which moves with constant 
‘circular motion around which mandocca oscillates. 
This is not supported by relativistic equation. But 
it may be probable due to effect of Jupiter between 
Mars and Saturn, which can be tested only by a 
computer calculation. Another doubt is that such 
a motion cannot be observed in one life time. Even 
Moon’s equation of motion is based on 1000 years 
of observation and needs same time more to test 
it. Samanta has not mentioned the basis of his 
correction. 


n= 


(4) Discussion of other theories - Prof. J.C. 
Ray had not read Siddhanta Darpana and wrote 
introduction on basis of personal discussions. But 
Samanta has treated him as student and has 
criticised his opinious about modern physics in his 
chapters on discussions (Vasanda-rahasya). 


Introduction 23 


(a) Jain theories have been criticised because 
they were based on projective geometry and 
become absurd according to spherical geometry. As 
a single-sphere of earth is drawn as two circular 
maps in projective ‘geometry, two Suns and two 
Moons were assumed in Jain theories. But dimen- 
sions of imaginary mountain ‘Meru’ have been 
quoted on the basis of Jain theories only. 


(b) In Indian astronomy, for calculation pur- 
pose, it is immaterial whether earth in fixed or it 
moves. In both views, relative motion will be same 
giving the same result. Samanta has used modern 
physics to refute the theory that Sun is not the 
centre of motion. It is mass centre of solar system, 
which is away from Sun’s surface at a distance of 
1-1/2times its radius in direction of Jupiter (effect 
of other planets can be neglected). It appears that, 
Samanta was too skeptic of European theories - 
whom he has called ‘golden theory’ as they were 
supported with hope of getting gold medal (17-160) 


(c) His other objection was that if earth moves 
on its axis; why Jupiter moves faster being the 
heaviest. This has been explained later on by 
presuming that Jupiter and Sun were twin stars. 
Due to'loss of matter, Jupiter gained in angular 
speed, to preserve the momentum. The other 
objection as to why we observe the same side of 
moon - has not been explained so far. 


(d) If stars are all like Sun and are equally 
spaced in all directions, there should be no day 
and night - every time equal light should come 
from all directions. This was called Olber’s paradox 
in modern astronomy and was explained only in 
1930 when expansion of universe was observed (It 
is mentioned in Indian scriptures also) Due to 
expansion, the farther stars have lesser effect and 


24 Siddhanta Darpana 


only the Sun causes day and night. Samanta has 
correctly refuted the argument of absorption of 
light of stars by gases etc. 


(5) Diameter of Sun : Diameter of Sun had 
been heavily under estimated to be about 10 to 14 
times the diameter of moon by all astronomers in 
India and outside. After talescope it was known 
to be. 400 times. Distance of Sun being 400 times 
that of Moon, it will cause much greater difference 
in amount of solar eclipse at two places. This might 
have prompted Samanta to correct it. But he has 
referred to Brahmavidya upanisad and Atharva 
veda (describing expansion of &) to get the value 
of 72,000 yojans (19-40,50) and (8-12). This become 
162 times diameter of Moon. 


Siddhanta Darpana has taken value of 1 yojans 
as 4.9 miles. Had. he taken it to be 11 miles 
(Aryabhata 7.5 miles, Jain theories 9.2 miles) as it 
was in vedic times, he would have got correct 
value of Sun’s diameter. This shows the absolute 
faith of Candrasekhara in ancient scriptures without 
which he never confirmed any result. To some 
extent it was justified, as seen from correct 
assessment of Sun’s size in vedas compared to all 
ancient measures. 


Some of his observations may appear biased 
or excessive, but they show a marvelous grasp of 
modern physics. Some of the points were not 
properly understood by top astronomers of his time

MADHYAMADHIKARA 


Madhyama = mean. This portion deals with 
average or mean motion of planets. Calculation of 
mean position is done from beginning of Kalpa or 
yuga for siddhanta, from Kali beginning in a tantra 
and from epoch of this book (12-4-1869 Monday - 
Ist saura Caitra 1791 Saka) as a Karana book. 
Siddhanta Darpana explains all the three methods 
and in addition last chapter gives easy method for 
-talculations of pancanga. There are 33 mathematical 
tables in the end for ease in calculations.. 

The book is in two halves. First half deals 
with the (ganita) methods of astronomy, 2nd half 
deals with explainations and discussions and special 
topics (Gola) 

First half of the book contains three parts 
called Adhikaras. First part is madhyamadhikara, 
with 4 chapters (called PrakaSa), Part 2 is 
Spastadhikara with 2 chapters. Part 3 is 
Triprasnadhikara with 9 chapters. 

Second half is called gola and has two parts. 
Part 4 is Goladhikara containing 6 chapters. Part 
5 is Kaladhikara containing 3 chapters. 


First chapter of part 1 is called kala varnana 
explained below. 


Chapter - 1 
MEASUREMENT OF TIME 


1. An Introduction to the Units of measurements 


Any natural science involves theories and 
experiments which verify each other. We test the 
theory by measuring certain quantities and see 
whether they are according to the theory. The 
deviations or errors cause refinement in the theory. 


As in physical sciences (particularly 
mechanics), the units of measurement in astronomy 
are of length, degree and time. Basic units in 
physics are of length, time and mass. Degree is a 
dimensionless quantity because it is ratio of length 
of arc to length of radius. 


Practical units of quantities are based on 
human experience. Length is similar to hand or 
feet: length, mass is mass of rice measured by 
spread of palms, time units is based on breathing 
time of human Beings. 


However, standardisation of length units is 
based on dimension of earth or comparison of some 
light wavelength. Similarly time units are fixed 
according to rotation periods of sun and moon or 
more accurately time taken by light to travel a 
particular distance. We can see that in modern 
physics as well as in ancient India “standardsation 
method was exactly the same. Units of angle also 


28 Siddhanta Darpana 


are based on the number of days (about 360) in a 
year, and hence sexagesimal (divisions by 60) 
system was more convenient. 


2. Units of length 


. In British system of units, foot was the basic 
unit equal to average length of human feet. In old 
Greece and Rome; cubit (18”= one hand) and stadia 
were also based on human measurements. For 
smaller units, angula (finger width) was the basic 
unit in India (0.75” or 1.88 cm). 

In Tiloya Pannati (Jain Text), 1 angula = 8? 


Trasarenu In Anuyogadvara Sitra (”), 1 angula = 
gid » 


In Siddhanta Jyotisa (Sripati), 1 angula = 8° 
trasarenu 

Successively smaller units of Siddhanta are 

Angula - yava - yiika - liksha - Balagra - Renu 
- Trasarenu. Balagra (hair end) is Angul+ 8* = 1/4 
x 10* cm (micron) Thus the dimensions are really 
correct has hair is 3-4 micron wide. 


According to Tiloyapannati lowest division is 
1 paramanu = 1 angula (1.88 cm) x 8 cm. = 3.5 
x, 10°? cms. 

This is of the order of nuclear diameter. 


In Lalita vistara (Buddhist text), units are 
divided by 7 at each stage. According to it, 1 
paramanu = 1 angula (1.9 cm) x 7%cm = 0.66 x 
10° cm. 

This is equal to the Bohr rodius-of Hydrogen 
atom. 


Measurement of Time 29 


Larger units are multiples of angula or a 
‘purusa’ or person (about 6 ft height). It is same 
as ‘fathom’ used to measure depth of sea or river. 

Bigger units in Tiloyapannati are - 


6 Angula - 1 pada (foot) 


2 pada = 1 vitasti (span) 

2 vitasti = 1 hasta (forearm or cubit) 
2 hasta = 1 rikku or kisku 

2 Kisku) -_ 1 danda (staff) or dhanusa 
2,000 danda= 1 Kroga 

4 Kroga 1 yojana 


Same units have been used by Paulish 
Siddhanta, Sripati and subsequent siddhanta texts. 
Lalita vistara, however makes 1 kosa = 1000 
dhanuéa only equal to 1/2 Jain or Siddhanta yojana. 

In the time of Napolean, attempt was made 
to link length unit ‘metre’ with dimensions of earth. 
So 1 metre was proposed to be 10’ of distance 
between equator and north pole. Subsequently, it 
was learnt that it was 1 crore and 486 parts of this 
distance. Still, the standard length of platinum bar 
kept at Paris is used as metre. Nautical mile is also 
based on earth’s dimension but it is not a 
decimal fraction. It is length of 1 minute of arc at 
equator (about 6080 ft. or 2 kms) 


In same way yojana has been defined to be 
an exact fraction of earth’s diameter or circum- 
ference in polar circle. 


Varahamihira - Circumference 3200 yojana 
Aryabhata - Diameter = 1050 yojana 
Sarya Siddhanta - Diameter = 1600 yojana 


30 Siddhanta Darpana 


Siddhanta Siromani - Circumference = 4,800 
yojana 


(This is followed by Siddhanta Darpana also) 


Thus, yojana is 5 miles according to Siddhanta 
Shiromani and 7.52 miles according to Aryabhata. 

Anuyogadvara Sitra (Jain) gives 

1 Atm yojana = 7,68,000 arigula = 9-1/11 miles 
estimated according to current measurements of 
earth. Dr. L.C. Jain opines that 1 Pramana yojana 
is 500 Atma yojana = 4,5 45.45 miles. M.B. Panta 
opines that 5 yojana (40 or 45.5 miles) was called 
Mahayojana used for measuring distances of stars. 

For example, ‘Triganku’ star is named on basis 
of its distance from earth. 

Tri-Safiku = 3 x 10! Mahayojana = 207 light 
years. This is actually the distance of that star now 
known as Beta-crucis in Southern cross constella- 
tion. 

Similarly, it is said that Agastya had crossed 
Varidhi (10%) or drunk ocean and had gone south. 
It is now known as ’Argo-Navis’ star at 80°5’ south 
latitude, indicating naval journey. This star is 652 


light years away ; 10 mahayojan is about 690 light 
years. 


Prof. $.S. Dey of Calcutta has observed that 
_Egyptian names of planets mercury, venus, mars, 
jupiter and saturn give their distances from Sun 
in yojana if names are interprated in Katapayadi 
system. 

At present metre is defined as 16,50,763.73 
times the wave length of radiation of Krypton-86 
isotope for transfer of electron between 2p and 
4 d states. With accurate measurement of velocity 


Measurement of Time 31 


of iight, it is proposed to link time and length 
units. In fact truti (a unit of time) was also defined 
as time taken by light to travel 1 yojana. 


3. Measurement of Time 


Principle of time measurement is to choose a 
unit which is equal to the time of a periodic event 
(which repeats itself after fixed intervals). Examples 
of such events are - vibration of quartz crystal or 
metal spring, pendulum (all used in clocks), 
rotation of earth (1 day = 24 hours), synodic 
rotation of Moon (1 month) or apparent rotation 
of Sun around earth (1 year). 

Basic unit of time in jyotisa is ‘asu’ (meaning 
mouth) or ‘prana’ (breathing) as it is approximately 
time (4 seconds) taken by a man in breathing in 
and out. Since our mental feeling of time is based 
on breathing only, units bigger than asu can be 
felt and are called ‘Murtta’ (tangible). Smaller units 
are called Amiurtta (imaginary). Astronomically, it 
is time taken by earth in its daily motion (360° in 
24 hours) to move by 1’ (=1°/60). 

‘Amurtta’ or small units - In ganita-Sara- 
Samgraha (Jaina) 1 prana has been divided into 
44466-2458/3773 Avalikas. Possible reason for such 
peculiar ratio is that a muhiurtta (1/30 of a day of 
24 hours) was equal to 3773 pranas in one system 
and 1,67,77,216 avalikas in another system. — 

A solar day is divided into 60 danda or ghatika 
(like 24 hours). Each ghati is divided into 60 pala 
(each 24 seconds) which is again divided into 60 
vipalas. 


Thus 1 asu or prana is equal to 1/6 pala or 
10 vipalas 


32 Siddhanta Darpana 


1 asu (respiration) = 5/2 kastha 

1 kastha = 4 long syllable (gurvakSara) 

1 gurvakSara or vipala = 9/2 nimesa (twinkling 
of eye) 

1 nimesa = 100 lava 


1 lava = 100 truti (1 Truti is time taken by a 
sharp needle to pierce a soft lotus petal) 


1 Truti = 3 Trasarenu 
1 Trasarenu = 3 anu 
1 Anu = 2 paramanu 
. 1 asu (4 second) 
Do ile 10 x 9 x 50 x 100 


In this time, hight will travel about 2.68 Kms 
(3 or 1/4 yojans or 1 kroga approximately). 


1 paramaru Kala = 1/8 Truti = 5 x 107 seconds 
approx. 


Larger Units - 

10 gurvakgara or Vipala = 1 prana 

6 prana = 1 pala or vighati 

60 vighati = 1 ghatika 

60 ghatika or danda = 1 day (24 hours) 


30 days = 1 month (approximate time from 
one full moon to the next) 


12 months = 1 year (approximate time of 
apparent rotation of Sun) 


360 years = 1 divya varsa (divine year) 
43,20,000 years = 1 yuga 

72 yugas = 1 manu 

14 Manu = 1 Kalpa (day of Brahma) Aryabhata 


Measurement of Time 33 


Thus in this system 1008 yugas make a kalpa. 

Siryasiddhanta gives 1000 yugas in a kalpa 
with 14 manus of 71 yugas each with 15 sandhis 
of 1 satyuga (4/10 yuga) each. 

2 kalpa = 1 ahordatra (day-night) of Brahma 

30 days of Brahma = 1 month of Brahma 

12 months of Brahma = 1 year of Brahma 

= 7,25,760 yugas (Aryabhata) 

or 7,20,000 yugas (Surya Siddhanta) 

100 years of Brahma = Life of Brahma 
(Mahakalpa or Para) 

50 years is called Pararddha = 1.5 x 10”” years 

In one mahayuga there are 0.4x10"” asus 

Hence 10’ is called para or parardha. 


Concept of yuga - ‘Yuga’ of Rkveda was of 
19 years after when mutual motion of moon and 
sun repeats itself. Later on, this period was called 
metonic cycle in Greece. Yajur jyotisa gave a yuga 
of 5 years which is a simpler system of tallying 
lunar and solar years. In vedafiga jyotisa 19x8+8 
= 160 years was next bigger yuga after which 
lunisolar calender tallies more accurately. 
Visvamitra had smaller yuga of 3339 tithis = 111 
synodic months + 9 tithis. This was half of Saros 
cycle of Chaldea (223 synodic months or 18 tropical 
years and 10.5 days) after which ellipses are 
repeated. His greater yuga was of 3339 synodic 
years or 3240 sidereal years. One third of this 
period 1080 sidereal years was used in determining 
Indian Eras. This gave rise to small chaturyuga of 
4x1080 = 4320 years. One Mahayuga is 1000 times 
this unit and 1 Kalpa is 1000 mahayuga. This is 


34 Siddhanta Darpana 


based on astronomical hymn of Visvamitra (RV Ill 
9-9) - 3339 dyus (days/ tithis/parts of sky) wor- 
shipped Agni (Sun) by revolutions in the sky. This 
concept has been used for divisions of constellation 
in vedanga jyotisa. 

Siddhanta texts have formed a Mahayuga in 
which all the seven planets Sun and Moon and 5 
faint (Tara) planets make complete revolutions. 
After a yuga they come to the same position. Thus 
a position of these planets will occur only once in 
a yuga and is most accurate method of indicating 
a time in a yuga. This is one of the purposes of 
preparing a horoscope. 


Rotation of mandocca (apogee) of planets is 
still slower and their full rotations are completed 
only after 1000 yugas or a Kalpa. Slowest is Sani 
whose mandocca makes only 39 rotations in a 
kalpa. 


It may be mentioned that a period of kalpa 
of 4 bilion years is approximately same as life of 
earth or the solar system. 2 kalpa or 1 day/night 
of Brahma is considered to be the time from when 
universe is expanding and will contract again. Life 
of Brahma 3x10” years is approximately half life 
period of proton decay, after which basic elements 
of the universe will dissolve themselves. 


4, Other examples of accurate measurements - 


Verses of Veda composed by known 
astronomers Visvamitra, Atri, Sunahéepa, 
Hiranyastipa, Kutsa, Utathya, his son 
Dirghatamas, his son KakSivat and daughter Ghosa 
- should be read according to Katapayadi system 
for their mathematical meaning. 


Measurement of Time 35 


Nasadiya and other verses of these sages 
indicate theories of creation of universe which are 
similar to modern cosmology. 

Rkveda (I-164-2) tells that the seven join the 
body in constant circular motion of earth (ratham). 
Orbit round Sun is elliptical (called Trinabhicakram) 
because elipse has 3 nabhis (1 centre and 2 focus) 

Cakram = 2 x m= 6.283, ratha = 72 

Hence in Kroga units (= 2.5 miles) 

7 x Cakra x ratha = 6.283x7x72x2.5 = 7915 
miles which is diameter of earth. 

Second line indicates Sapta (7) nama (50) 
vahati (moves in orbit). If movement is taken in 1 
lava . 

muhurta 


= 7 = 48 seconds. 


then orbital velocity of earth is 

_ 7x 50Krosa_ 7 X 50 2.5 miles 

~ 1 lava ~ 48 seconds 
miles/sec. 

Tri (3) nabhi (40) Cakra (27 = 6.283) gives 
acceleration due to gravity if length unit is taken 
as hasta 19.8” and time as lava. For small units 
both are divided by 60. . 


Vilava = 4/5 sec., 1/60 hasta = 0.33/12 ft.

Fourth line gives arc of an imaginary sphere 
on which moon moves.

36 Siddhanta Darpana 


Yatra (21), vi8va (44), Bhuvana (44) gives 
21x44x44 = 40, 656 when unit is moon’s distance 
+ radius of earth. Dirghatamas gives a theory of 
star formation in RV (I-164-8) - Mata (steller cloud 
formed by hydrogen atoms) absorbs light 
(garbharasa) and is further excited by gravilational 
contraction (pitaram). Dhiti (69) manasa (708) gives 
diameter of hydrogen atom if we take unit of length 
60x60 times smaller than 1/60 hasta (0.33 inches) 

Dhiti x manasa 


0.33 1 
= COX n . 
Sree. ee oe ee 


= 0.478 x 10° cm = radius of hydrogen atom 
when it is divided by mata pitaram (65x261), this 
gives 2.8x10 cm, the distance at which nuclear 
interaction works. Atomic radius divided by Sa (7) 
garbharasa (7243) gives 107° cm which is diameter 
of proton or electron. 

Velocity of light - SmrtiSastra tells - we salute 
with our respect to sun who traverses 2202 yojans 
in 1/2 nimisa. 

In purana - 1 nimisa = 16/75 seconds 

In Lilavati, 1 yojana = 4x8000 cubits = 9.09 
miles 

Hence velocity of light is 

9.09-x > 2202 

8/75 

Bhaskara nimisa is 8/90 seconds, Manu’s 
yojana is 4 Kroga of 4000 cubits each. Then velocity 
is 3x10° km/sec. 

5. Measurement of angles - Since apparent 
revolution of Sun around earth in a year is in 
about 360 days, a circle is divided into 360° degrees 


= 1.86 x 10° miles/sec. 


Measurement of Time 37 


(amSa) so that motion in one day is about 1°. Its 
average motion in 1 month (lunar node to node) 
is about 30° hence 30° is 1 rasi. Further sub 
divisions are always by 60 at each step because it 
is a simple factor of 360 and there were 6 days 
weak (sadaha) in vedas. 1 extra day was added to 
some weeks making it 7 days, this day was not 
regular weak day hence tradition of weekly holiday 
arose. Since moon’s node makes 12 rounds when 
Sun makes 1 round, the clock also copies that 
motion. Minute hand makes 12 rounds when hour 
hand makes 1 round. 


Angular and time measurement both are 
divided into 60 units so that they tally with sun’s 
motion. 

One rotation = 12 rasi = 360 Amsa (degree) 

1 AmSa = 60 Kala (minute) 

1 Kala = 60 vikala (second) 

Tatpara and paratpara are further divisions. 

Thus angular motion of sun corresponds to 
time units 

1 rasi = 1 month, 1° = 1 day 

1’ =‘1 danda, 1” = 1 pala 

1 tatpara = 1 vipala etc. 


This division of angle continues throughout 
the world till day. Time units are slightly different, 
but still in divisions of 60. Actually hour is derived 
from ‘Hora’ (Ahor§atra) i.e. two divisions of a raési 
(like day-night divisions of a day). Earth rotates 1 
circle i.e. 24 hours in 1 day, hence 1 hora in 1 
hour.

book. 


Translation of the text (Chapter I) 


Verses 1-9 - Mangalacarana - Prayer to Lord 
Jagannatha and other gods. 

Verses 10-11 - Pratijaa - Scope and purpose 
of the book - It deals with only ganita jyotisa. 
Purpose is to explain difficult methods of mathe- 
matics in simple language to a common man. 

Verse 12 - Mathematical methods (Patiganita) 
has already been perfectly explained by Sri 
Bhaskaracarya in his text Lilavati . Without repeat: 
ing the same, motion of planets is discussed 
straight away. 

Verse 13 - Comparison with earlier Siddhantas 
- Some special subjects have been dealt with in 
this siddhanta, not found in earlier texts, for 
satisfaction of the learned. 


Verses 14-15-Importance of jyotisa - Veda 
guides everyone in yajfa. Muhutrta (auspicious 


Measurement of Time 39 


time), for that is known through jyotisa. If veda 
is taken in human form, Jyotisa is eyes, Vyakarana 
is mouth (grammer), Nirukta (dictionary) is ears, 
kalpa (Purana) is hands, Sikéa Sastra (reading) is 

nose, chanda (prosody) is feet. Thus jyotis is the 
part of veda through which all other parts can be 
understood. 


Comments - Many portions of vedas, Samhitas 
and all the text books explain jyotisa in similar 
words which need not be repeated. 


Verses 16-19 - About Siddhanta - Without 
mathematical astronomy, the whole jyotisa is 
ussless. Siddhanta deals with time scale from Truti 
(smallest unit) to Kalpa (biggest unit used in 
jyotisa), arithmatics (including indeterminate equa- 
tions of first and second degree), algebra, evolution 
and creation of world, orbits of earth, planets and 
stars, eclipse and conjunction of planets and 
description of various instruments like jya, dhanu 
etc. and elements of mensuration. Among. all 
Sastras jyotisa is highest; in jyotisa itself, siddhanta 
is best; and in siddhanta also gola (=sphere 
including Bhugola =geography and khagola = 
astronomy) is most important. A country prospers 
due to presence of men well versed in gola. 
Otherwise, animal behaviour ‘spreads. Siddhanta 
gives all the four results (Dharma, Artha, Kama 
and MokSa). So Surya (creator of Surya siddhanta) 
has kept it a secret to be given only to good and 
pious prson. 

Verse 20 - First half of this text deals with 
time units, ahargana (count of days), bhagana 
(revolutions in sky), graha anayana (calculating 
planetary positions), jya (sine) kotijya (cosine) etc. 


40 Siddhanta Darpana 


_ Spasta Sara (actual position of planets as seen in 
the sky), triprasna (three problems about daily 
motion). 

Second half deals with different. theories, 
creation and dissolution (srsti and laya), earth 
(geography), kaksa (orbit), yantra (instruments), 
description of countries, prayers to lord Jagannatha 
and Kautuka Parijika (easy preparation of almanc). 


Verse 21 - Parabrahma was in the beginning. 
It created purusa and prakrti (2), mahattatva 
(intellect-1), ahafikara (ego-1), tanmatra (elements 
5), mahabhita (5 types of creations or beings), 5 
organs of sense, 5 organs of action, and one mind 
- a total of 25 elements. It supervises all. 


Verse 22 - Jyotisa Cakra - After creation, 
Brahma caused the sphere of akaSa to rotate from 
east to west in a daily motion (seems as a result 
of rotation of earth on its axis from west to east) 
with respect to two dhruvas (north and south poles 
on the axis). With a slower motion, the planets 
move west to east relative to stars in nica and ucca 
circles (earth is not the centre of their or bits). 


Verses 23-30 - Kala has two meanings - one 
is destroyer of world and the other is reckoning 
of time. Time units are of two types - Saksma or 
amiurtta is very small unit which cannot be felt by 
senses, but calculated or measured by instruments. 


Prana is of 4 seconds, in which a person 
breathes in and out. This is the smallest sthtila or 
miurta time unit to be felt by senses. 


Divisions of time are - 1 lava = 100 truti 
30 lava =1 nimesa = 1/135 seconds 
18 nimesa = 1 kastha 


Measurement of Time 41 


27 nimesa = Time to pronounce long vowel 
=0.2 seconds 

20 long vowels =1 prana (4 seconds) 

2 Pranas =1 Kala 

3 Kala 1 vighatika or pala (24 seconds) 

10 vighati' = 1 kSana 

6 kSana = 1 ghati or danda (24 minutes) 

2 danda 1 muhirta 

30 muhirta = 1 nakSatra dina 


Note - NakSatra dina is the time of rotation 
of earth with respect of stars (23 hours 56 minutes) 
called sidereal day and is slightly smaller than civil 
day or solar day (between sunrise to sunrise) of 
average 24 hours. 

30 nakéatra day = 1 nakéatra masa. 

From sunrise to next sunrise is called savana 
dina (or civil day) 

30 Savana dina = 1 savana masa 

30 tithis =-1 candramasa 

NB-1 Candramasa is period from moon’s node 
(amavasya - in same direction as sun, or Purnima, 
at 180° from Sun) to the same node next time. 
Tithi is 1/30th part of that period equal to the time 
in which moon gains 12° difference over sun. 

Verse 31 - Detailed description of these 
nakSatra and civil days, months etc. will be done 
m second part of the book. 

12 solar months = 1 solar year 


_ Solar (Saura) year is one day of deva or asura 
(divya or Asura varsa) 


Note - 1. Sauradina is the interval of time 
during which sun moves 1° of ecliptic. In saura 


42 Siddhanta Darpana 
masa it moves 30° or 1 rasi and in 1 year it makes 
a complete round of 360°. 


2. Krantivrtta or ecliptic is the apparent path 
of stars from east to west in plane of equator. One 
complete round is called bhagana which is divided 
into 360° am§a (degrees). Each subdivision is in 
60’s as follows - 

60 viliptas, vikalas, or seconds 

= 1 lipta, kala or minutes 

60 liptas = 1 ama, Bhaga or degree 

30 arnSa = 1 raéi or sign 

12 rasis = 1 Bhagana or revolution 

Verse 32 - When sun is moving north of 
ecliptic (for six months), it is day for devas and 
night for asuras (day in north pole and night in 
south pole). When sun is moving south of ecliptic, 
it is night for devas and day for asuras. 


360 divya or asura days = 1 divya or 
asuravarsa 


Verse 33-39 - Time scales greater than a year 


Period Divya years Solar Years 
Satya yuga 4,800 17,28,000 
Tretéa yuga 3,600 12,96,000

Kali yuga 1,200 4,32,000 
Total - yuga 12000 43,20,000 
or Mahayuga 


There is a sandhya, 1/12th of the yuga, 
included in each yuga at its beginning and the 
end. Total sandhya is 1/6 of the yuga.

1 day of Brahma is called kalpa and it consists 
of 1,000 yuga. Kalpa is divided into 14 manvantaras 
of 71 yuga each. They are separated by 15 sandhya 
periods in between and at the end, in addition to 
manu period. Each sandhya is equal to one satya 
yuga i.e. 4/10 of a yuga. 

Thus, 1 kalpa = 14 manu + 15 sandhya 
14 x 71 yuga + 15 x 4/10 yuga_ 

= 994 yuga + 6 yuga = 1000 yuga 

Note - According to Aryabhata, a kalpa has 
1008 yuga divided into 14 manus of 72 yugas each. 

Verse 40-46 - Current time - At present 50 
years of Brahma have passed. In the 5lst year (of 
2nd parardha or half life of Brahma), this is the 
first day, called Svetavaraha kalpa. In this kalpa, 
six manvantaras have passed, namely - (1) 
Svayambhuva (2) Svarocisa (3) Auttami (4) Tamasa 
(5) Raivata and (6) Caksusa 

Current manvantara is Vaivasvata in which 27 
yugas have passed. In 28th yuga, Satya yuga, Treta 


and Dvapara have gone. First fourth part of kali 
era is continuing.

27 yugas in 7th manu 27x43,20,000 = 11,66,40,000 Years 
Satya, Treta, Dvapara = 38,88,000 years 
Total = 1,97,29,44,000 years 

In kaliyuga, as in March 1996, 5098 years have 
passed. These are to be added to find the years 
passed since beginning of kalpa. 

Verse 47-52 - Motion of planets started at mid 
night at Lanka (a point of equator through which 
prime meridian through Ujjain passes). The day 
was named as Ravivara, Caitra Sukla pratipada. 
All the planets reach the same position at midnight 
of Brahma (after interval of 1 kalpa) 


At the end of Brahma’s day (kalpa) all planets 


vanish. Author doesn’t agree with Bhaskara that 
earth remains. 


Verse 53 - Bhagana is one revolution of a 
planet starting from AéSvini to Revati end as seen 
in the sky. 

Explaination - Path of revolution along Zodiac 
(apparent path of planetary movement, more 
correctly of sun - raSivrtta) covers 360° divided in 
12 ragis of 30° each. Almost the same circle is path 
of moon (inclined at 5° angle) There are 27 
nakSatras of 13°20’ each in which moon stays for 
about 1 day each. There was system of unequal 
division of nakSatras also which will be discussed 
later on. ASvini nakSatra is Ist and mesa raéi also 
start from 0° of zodiac. Last nakstra is Revati 

Verse 54 - Division of angular measurements 
according to previous acdaryas -. 

1 Bhagana 12 rasi, 1 rasi = 30 Ama 


Measurement of Time

1 Am&a = 60 kala, 1 kala = 60 vikala 
1 vikala = 60 para 1 para = 


60 vipara 
Note - Para and vipara are not used by other 
texts nor in modern mathemaiics. 


Verse 55 - Prayer of Lord Jagannatha 
Verse 56 - Sri Candrasekhara has written this 
drksiddha ganita (as observed in sky) in simple 
language, so that even children can follow it. 


Units of Time and Length -written and added later 

Units of measuremenit-A physical quantity is measured by 2 components- 

A basic unit of quantity used as standard for comparison of other quantities. 

A number which is ratio of measured quantity to standard .Basic unit should be available, reproduci- 
ble, convenient to handle and easy to compare through experiments. 

How many units are sufficient-For mechanics, 3 units are sufficient-length, mass, time. All other 
units of measurement can be derived from them. In 1901, Giorgi proved that that by adding a quan- 
tity related to electric properties, all physical quantities can be measured. To show the inter-relation 
between electricity and magnetism, or to explain the property of medium (vacuum or material), an- 
other quantity is required. Thus 5 quantities are sufficient to explain all physical quantities. These 
are called 5 7anmatras in Sankhya’ philosophy. For this 5 dimensional view of world, there are 5 x 5 
= 25 elements in Sankhya. 

5 fold division of units is described by 5 a (=to measure) chhandas- 

Ma, pra-ma, pratima, upa-ma, sa-ma@ 

For same type of quantity e.g. length- 

Ma = basic unit (e.g. meter), Pra-ma = multiples (kilometer etc.), Prati-ma = sub-multiples, Upa- 
ma = Related length units (Foot, Nautical mile, light-year etc.), Sa-ma = Link with other units (with 
time through velocity of light, or with area, volume etc.) 

Inter-relation of units of same or different kinds is called asr-vaya (upama + sama) 

Various types of inter-relations are called Vaya-chhandas. |n context of length, they are classified as 
-. Ma = Prthvi(earth) -Standard rod, earth or earth-like compact body-sun, solar system, galaxy. 
Prama- Antariksa = \ntermediate. Regions between and beyond earth(s). 

Pratima -Space,volume. 

Asrivi Directions. 

Modern units of length-(1) Foot- Based on human foot- 

(2) Meter-It was defined in 4 ways-(i) Length of pendulum with half time-period of 1 second, (ii) 107 
part of arc length from equator to north pole, (iii) 16,50,763.73 times wavelength of Kres radiation 
between energy states of 2,10 and 54,5, (iv) Distance traveled by light in 29,97 ,92,458 part of 1 sec- 
ond. 


3) Nautical mile-1 minute arc of equator. 


5 
6) Light year-Distance traveled by light in 1 year=1016 meters approx. 


(3) 

(4) Astronomical unit (AU)-Semi-major axis of earth orbit around sun. 

(5) Persec -Distance at which AU subtends an angle of 1 second. 

(6) 

1 Persec=3.26 light years, 1 AU=1.5x1011 meters. 

Seven yojanas-(1) Nara yojana =32,000 hands-used for human possessions of land. 
(2) Bhd-yojana—1000 or 1600 parts of earth diameter (sirya-siddhanta -8km-yo/ana) 


(3) Bha-Yojana—27 bhi-yojanas = 216 kms, used for sun distance and size of galaxy 


(4) Prakasa-yojana—Distance traveled by light in 1 ¢rwf/= 1/33,750 seconds 
(5) Dh&ma-yojana-KSara dhama =720 parts of equator circumference = 55.5 kms. 
Aksata dhama-Measure of space with earth as standard in exponential scale. Number of powers of 


2 is equal to akshara in chhanda. Distance d =r x 2 ©), r = radius of earth, n = unit of distance 
(6) Sun diameter as yojana for solar system in puranas. 


(7) Pramana-yojana—Starting from solar system, scale for each successive /oka in 500 times longer 


units at each step. 


Micro-units-Smaller worlds are successively 1 /akh times smaller-man (meter size), Aa/ila (cell, 1 
/akh part of meter), Jiva (atom of 101% meter size), Kundalini (nucleus of 10-5 meter size), Jagat 
particles of 3 types (10-29 meter size-not defined- Chara (lepton), sthanu (Baryon), Anupurvasah (link 


-particles or meson) 


Deva-danava (10-25 meters size)-Creation from 33 types of devas only, not from 99 types of asuras 


(danava), Created world is 1/4" part of purusa. 3/4" is field or dark matter. 
Pitar (proto-type, Parents)-10-3° meter size. 
Rsi (string-rass/in hind) 10 35 meters size. 


Micro or smallest unit called paramanu by Varahamihira = 8* parts of angula = 4.5 micron. Sripati 
calls it rasarenu equal to 60 atoms. So, atom =1.2 x 10 7 cm. 


Lalita-vistara-Paramanu-raja = Angula x 7 *° = 0.6 x 10 cm 
Tiloya pannati—Trasarenu = Angula x 8 9 = 1.4 x10 cm. 


Single object or Brahma is indicated by Angustha (Thumb).In Purusa-sikta, angu/a means 96 parts 


of human length, or earth, solar system earth, galaxy as per context. 


Measures of Solar system-Modern estimate (NASA 2002) is that Woort cloud is boundary of solar- 


system at distance of 50,000-1,00,000 AU from sun. Indian measures- 


Samvatsara is aditya (energy-field) of sun. Fields of galaxy and universe are called Varuna 
and Aryama. This is sphere of 1 light year radius with center at sun. 


1,575 crores diameter in unit of sun-diameter = 2.310 light year.(called rata of sun). Outer 
wheel diameter is 6,000 i.e. outer boundary of Kuiper-belt. Modern estimate is about 70,000 
plutonic bodies of above 100 km size. Puranas tell 60,000 balakhilyas of Angustha size i.e. 
96 parts of earth diameter =135 km approx. Sdrya-siddhanta calls it NakSatra-kaksa of sun at 
60 AU. This has been called A/oka (dark) earth of 100 crore yojanas (8km). Loka (lighted) 
earth is of 50 crore yojana (8 km) diameter. This has 7 dvipa /oceans of Priyavrata formed 
by motion of planets. Inner wheel of sun is of 3000 sun diameter i.e. up to Uranus orbit. Prac- 


tical or /ndra zone is of 1000 sun diameter (sahasraksa, akSa = sun or eye) up to Saturn orbit. 


Saturn being at the end of solar effect is called son of sun. 


Planetary distances in Bhuvar-/oka are in terms of earth diameter. Size of next Svar-/oka will be 
in 500 times bigger unit. Distance from sun to pole (DfAruva) is 14 lakh x 500 earth diameter 


which is distance of Woort cloud. 


Earth diameter x 2®° in aksara-dhama units. With three spherical zones inside earth as image of 
2 bigger earths, there are 33 zones. Energy (prana) of each is a deva. Signs of 33 devas are 


letters from k to h — its arrangement (nagara) is Indian scripts called Devanagarr 


Earth/man = Solar earth/Earth.=107,called kof (limit). This is called Maitreya-mandala or Savitri 
(224 of earth size) in which creation occurs. Dyu (sky) of solar system is 10’ times sun size. 
Earth is crore times or 24 dhamas bigger than man and is called Gayatri. Savitri x 224 = 
Sarasvatl (creative field of galaxy). Sarasvatlx 224 = Veda (creative field of universe or Veda- 


purusa,10 times bigger than universe).Creative aspect is Miyati 


Measures of Galaxy-(1) Sirya-siddhanta gives 1.87 x 1016 Bha-yojanas (216 km) = 1,23,000 light 


years (modern estimate 1 lakh LY) 


(2) Earth size x 246 is galaxy Its creative field is Kdrma (Goloka of Brahmavaivarnta purana) of 52 
dhama units i.e.24 earth size. For 49 ahargana (dhama units) there are 49 letters in Devanagari 
script from a to h. 3 extra units of Adrma is creator, conscious being is called ASefrajia in Gita chap- 
ter 13, so 3 letters are added at end-ksa, fra, fia. 


(3) Circumference is 0.5 Para (10'’) dhama yojanas (55.5 kms). Diameter comes to about 1 lakh LY. 


(4) Size of Karma in Narapati-Jayacharya is hundred thousand (105) Sanku (10*) = 1018 yojanas. As 
a purusa of Galaxy, it is 10 times bigger, so galaxy is about 10” yojanas. In space, earth is lotus of 
1000 petals, 1 petal = 1 yojana (Aryabhata) 


(5) Galaxy is 1 crore times solar earth-Saviti 
(6) This is Janah /oka of 2 crore yojana radius (1 yojana = 500 x 500 sun diameter) 


Bhuvar-loka is sphere of 15 ahargana (dhama) around earth i.e. 212 of earth size which is also called 
Varaha. Viewed from sun, it is 100 yojana ( = sun diameter ) high and 10 yojana high, up to lunar 
orbit. This covers up to 60% distance of Venus orbit. Earth’s exclusive zone extends up to 9 
ahargana i.e. 64 times earth radius. Moon is within it at 61 radius. Spiral arm of galaxy is called 
Sesa-naga. Near sun, it has 1000 sun like stars called 1000 heads of Sesa. Region of this is called 


Maharloka, whose size is given as- 
1000 times size of solar system (sahasra-sirsa purusa,1000 heads of Sesa) 
43 ahargana =earth x 24 (tristup chhanda has 44 + 2 or 43 letters in Mahesvara sutra) 


1 crore yojanas (1 yojana =500 sun diameters) 


Middle /oka between earth (b/A0) and satya /oka 1020 times bigger, so it is 101° times earth size. 
Tapah loka is given in 4 ways- 
254 times earth size for 64 letters in Brahmscript. 
8 crore yojana (1 yojana =sun diameter x 500 x 500) 
(3) 864 crore light year radius -equal to day-night of Brahma. 
(4) Earth orbit/earth = 7apah /okalgalaxy 
Satya loka (1) Galaxy x 107 (or 224) 
(2) Maharloka learth = Satya loka / Mahar 
(3) 12 crore yojana (1 yojana = sun diameter x 500°) 
Time units 
Modem unit-1 second = 86,400 parts of mean solar day. 


Due to fluctuations and slowing down of earth rotation by tidal friction, new definition was adopted 
in1967-it is 9,19,26,31,770 times the period of light radiated by transition between two ground states 
of Cesium-133 atom. 


Nine Indian Time-units- 


(1)Brahma-Time period of creation from formless (avyakta) to forms is called a day of Brahma or 
Kalpa. In same period of time, creation dissolves into avyakta ( Gita 8/17 ,18). Day of Brahma 
has been defined as of 1000 yugas in Gita, puranas, Surya-siddhanta etc. Each yuga is of 
12,000 divya-years, 1 divya-year =360 solar years. Thus, 1 day of Brahma = 432 crore 


years. 


(2) Prajaptya-Prajapati started yajfa (Gita 3/10), so prajapatya period is period of galaxy from 
where creation started. Rotation period of galaxy is called Manvantara of about 31.68 crore 
years. Present stage is 7" manvantara. This has been called 7" day in Bible. After 4, 5" days 
sun, moon, earth were created. So, day cannot mean here rotation of earth or even of sun. 
This is rotation of first creation galaxy. Modern estimate of period of sun revolution around 


center of galaxy is 20-25 crore years. 


(3)Divya year is of 360 solar years, arrived in 3 ways. This is approximate period of revolution of 
imaginary planet at 60 AU (or average rotation of about 60,000 Aa/akhilyas at same dis- 
tance), called A/oka (dark) boundary of 100 crore yojana diameter, This has been called pan- 
varta yuga in Vayu, Matsya puranas, which is cycle of historic changes. Third view is that 
north-south motion of sun is like day-night cycle. This cycle of 1 year is 1day (a/vya). Taking 


round number 360 for days in a year, d/vya year is of 360 years. 


(4) Guru scale-In period of 60 years Saturn and Jupiter complete integral revolutions-2 and 5. 
Alternatively, Angiraeffect (upward convection due to radiation pressure takes 60 years to 


complete (Aitareya Brahmana 18/3/17, Taittinya Brahmana, 2121315-6) 


(5) Pilar mana- Synodic revolution of moon in 29.5 days is called 1day of pitars. Varaha is 15 ahargana or 4,096 
times earth size-that is paganya. Intermediate level is pitar, 64 times earth size called pitar. Moon orbit is 61 
times earth size. So pitars of human beings also reside on outer region of moon. Our bright half of month is 
night of pifars and dark half is their day. 


(6) Savana manaSunrise to next sunrise is s@vana or civil (practical) day.1 month = 30 days, 1 year = 12 months. 


(7) Solar-Apparent revolution of sun around earth is yea r(sidereal). 1/12 partis 1 month (1 rasf = 30°. Movement). 


1 day is 1° movement. 


(8) Lunar-Synodic revolution of moon around earth is a lunar month.5 angas of pafichanga are defined from moon 
and sun— 7ithi = (M-S) /12°, 1tthi = 2 karana, yoga = (M+S) /13.3. Naksatra is average daily motion of moon. 


Vara (day) is cyclic naming of days. 


(9) Nakstra (sidereal)-Axial rotation of earth with respect to fixed stars is sidereal day of 23 hours 56 minutes. Month, 
year have 30 and 360 days. 


Micro units of time-Safapatha Brahmana (12/3/2/1,5) divides mean day length of 12 hours successively by 15 parts into 
units named as muhurtta (48 minutes), ksipra, etarhi, idani, prana, aktana (or, ana), nimesa, lomagartla, svedayana. \t is 
stated that stars (naksaira) in galaxy (Brahmandaa) are like its /oma-gartia (roots of skin hairs). Number of /omagartia in a 
year (Sarnvatsara) is equal to the number of stars in a galaxy, so this unit of time is called /omagartfa which is equal to 
muhuttla x 15-7 = about 80.000 parts of a second. Similarly its 15” part is sveda@yana equal to about 11, 20,000 paris of 
a second. In this time, light travels about 270 meters. Rain drops (sveda) move (ayana) about same distance without 
breaking or joining, so this time unit is called svedayana. Estimate of number of stars in galaxy was done after 1985 
which is correctly estimated in Satapatha-Brahmana fo be 10‘), Logic of division by 15 is given that ratio of earth orbit 
to earth size is same as ratio of 7apah-/oka (visible universe) and galaxy, both equal to 2 (15), 


Seven Yugas-By joining two cycles of time, a yuga is formed. Munisvara in his astronomy text Siddhanta Sarvabhauma 
has stated 5 yugas- 


5 years, 5 x 12 = 60, 12 x 60 = 720, 600 x 720 =kaliyuga, kalix 10 =1 yuga. 
Like 7 yojanas, there are 7 yugas, depending on completion of various yajrias— 


(1) Sanskara yuga—Education and other reforms projects are completed in 4 to 19 years which is a sanskara-yuga. 
(a) Gopada-yugais of 4 years like modern leap year system. Its year starts in godhuii-vela (literally cow-dust- 
time, when cows return home at sunset, dust is raised) like Hebrew or Islamic calendars. West Asia was place 
of Asuras, called Misacharas because their day started with sunset.This is described in A/fareya Brahmana 
(7/13). Suppose, 1s year starts at 6 PM on 4-1-2001.This year Ka/will end at 12 PM on 4-1-2002 when people 
will be sleeping, So, Aa/is called sleeping.2.4 year dvapara will end on 5-1-2003 at 6AM, so dvapara is called 
twilight. 34 year “re/a will end at 12 AM on 5-1-2004, when people will be standing, so “reais called standing.4 
year will end on 4-1-2005 at 6PM as there is leap year in 2004. Here year is of 365 % days. (b) 5 year yuga - 
¥ajusa jyotisa has described 5 years yuga in which lunar years match with solar year by adding 2 extra (adhika) 
months. Years are named by adding prefixes sam-, pari-, id-, ida-, anu, to the word vatsara. (c) 12 years yuga 
is revolution period of Jupiter around sun. These are named like months of lunar year-chajtra, valsakha, etc. (d) 


Rahu yugelt is called Saros cycle in Babylonian astronomy. This is relative motion of Sun and Aafu (node of 


Moon) in 18 years 10,5 days in which eclipse cycle repeats. Its half period of 3339 f#this is also approximately 
eclipse cycle stated by Visvamitra (Rk 3/9/9). (e) 19 year yuga—This is followed in Ak-/yolisa, as explained by 
Sri Prabhakara Holay, Nagpur. \n this period, lunar years match with solar year more accurately (less than 2 
hours error) by adding 7 aahika months. Years are classified into 5 types according to 5 blocks of 6 fithis in 
which a solar year starts. In 1 yuga, there are 5 years of samvaisara type. 


(2) Manusya (human) yuga -- 60 years active life of man is called Angira period in which 60 year cycle of guri+years 
occurs. In 100 years, Sapfars/ (Ursa major, ursa =/s) moves 7 naksatra, i.e.27" part of zodiac circle. In Ak- 
fyolisa calculation, moon moves 1 /aksatra ahead in 100 years. The line joining two eastern stars moves 1 nak- 
Satra back in 100 years. This year count has been called Laukika in Rajatarangini. 113" of dfvya-dina or pan- 
varta yuga of 360 years is 120 years which is human life for astrological timing of events. 


(3) Panvarla yuga-This is divya-dina of 360 years in which historical changes (panvartana) occurs. 71 such yugas 
make manu-yuga of 26,000 years (precession period of earth’s axis) in Brahmanda Purana (112/29/19) 


(4) Sahasra yuga-Bhagavata purana (1/1/4) states 1000 year satra of Saunaka in Naimisaranya. Compilation of Pu- 
raSas took about 200 years, but its effect on social norms lasted for thousand years. It could be revised only in 
time of Vikramaditya of Ujjain (82BC-19AD, era started in 57 BC) as per Bhavisya purana (3/3/1/2-4). During 
3000 years, seasons shifted back by 1 % months.720 years of Munisvara is of 2 panvarla yugas. Sahasra 
(1080) years is 3 panvarta. Even Gautama Buddha planned his religion for 1000 years. Prophet Mohammed 
predicted Islam to last for 1400 years. Saptars/ yuga is of 2700 years. It is described in two ways in Brahmanda, 
Vayu puranas. 2700 solar years are called divya years, Manusa year is 12 revolutions of moon around earth in 
327.5364 days. Saptarsi era is also stated to be of 3030 manusa years =2717 solar years. Rornaka yuga of 
Patichasiddhantika ( Varahamihira) is of 2850 years =19 year Rk-yuga x 150, 


(5) Dhruva or Krauficha yuga-This is of 9090 mdanusa years or 8100 solar years. This is exactly 3 times sapfars/ 
yuga and about 1/3” of Ayana or Manu-yuga. Position of north pole of earth makes a circle in 26000 years and 
is close to 3 stars so the period is divided into 3.0n earth regions around north pole are called Krauricha-avipa, 
so it is called Krauricha yuga also. In north India, Gurv years are calculated as per actual mean motion of gurw 
in 361.14 days (Surya-siddhanta). In 85 solar years there are 86 guru years. In south India, solar years are 
named as guru years (Paitamaha-siddhanta). In 85 x 60 = 5100 years, both cycles are completed. On 11-2- 
4433 BC when Rama was bom, the year was start of guru cycle in both systems (1st Prabhava year) as per 
Visnudharmotiara purana (82/7 8). Matsya incarnation had occurred 5100 years before that in 9533 BC. He- 
rodotus gives date of sinking of last island of Atlantis in 9564 BC. This is approximately period of last glacial 


flooding. 


(6) Ayana (Precession) yuga-Earth’s axis rotates around pole of ecliptic (earth orbit) in 26, 000 years. This has been 
called Manu yuga in Brahmanda purana (1/2/29/19).Glacial age on earth is due to two cycles-Precession in 
26000 years in reverse direction and advance of earth aphelion in 1 /akh years. Glacial region is around north 
pole. When it is inclined away from sun or earth is at aphelion it gets less heat. When both combine, it is Glacial 
ice age. Its cycle is in 21600 years—1/21600 = 1/26000 +1/100000 


Civil cycle is taken as middle of the two. By taking 24000 years cycle, there is positive error in12000 years and 
negative in other half (8rahma-sphuta-sidahanta, madhyamadhikara, 60, Siddhanta-siromani of Bhaskara-ll, 
Bhu-paridhi, 7). Each half of 12000 years is taken as yuga of 12,000 aivya years in every purana, Mahabharata, 
etc. In Mahabharata period Avasarpini (descending) period was running in which part yugas —Satya, treta, dva- 
para, kali, of 4,3,2,1,parts come in that order. Of this order, Ka/ started on17/18-2-3102 BC Ujjain mid-night. 
The other half is called Utsarpini (ascending) in which ka/to satya yugas come. 


(7) Astronomical yuga—This is 360 times ayana yuga of 43,20,000 years in which all planets up to Saturn complete 
integral number of revolutions (Bhaganopapatti in Sidahanta-Siromani of Bhaskar@|l). Two other cycles depend 
on it which is not verified so far-(i) Movement of magnetic pole and magnetic reversal, (ii) Movement of geo- 
graphical pole in north south direction (/nara-Viaya of Madhusudan Ojha) or equivalent continental-shift. 


Time has been equated to full-pot (Puma-kumbha) or volume .and parallel with 7 chhandas is shown in Kafa-sdkia of 
Atharva-veda (19/7), Brhat-sahasra (36000) days is life period of man (A/tareya Brahmana). Understanding of these 
yugas explains puranic chronology since 62,000 BC.

Chapter - 2 
REVOLUTION OF PLANETS 


Subject - This chapter deals with total 
revolutions of planets in a kalpa, adhika masa (gain 
of lunar months above 12 in a solar year), kSaya 
tithi (shortage of lunar dates from months of 30 
civil days), rotation of orbits. From that; the average 
daily motion of planets have been calculated. 


1. Explanations - All the results given in this 
chapter are assumed and no hint is given as to 
how these numbers have been found. Obviously 
they are highly accurate and have been followed 
since time immemorial. All texts from 
Suryasiddhanta to Siddhanta Darpana have fol- 
lowed the same practice. 


It is possible that the samhita and Brahmana 
texts gave the methods and observations of 
planetary motions. The teaching of science and 
mathematics was like present day text books ‘of 
college, and not in verse form which is useful for 
memorising only. This became necessary when 
educational institutes and their books were 
destroyed due to foreign invasions. Mathematics 
in modern text book form has been found in 
Bakhsali manuscripts of mediaval preiod (edited in 
3 vols by G.R. Kay - New Delhi-7) 


All ancient authorities have admitted that 
these results are not based on observations. Sirya 
siddhanta has stated that these were given by Surya 
to Mayasura in Romaka town in 21, 63, 223 B.C. 
(121 years before the end of Satya yuga). To some 
extent, it is correct. Even with most modern 


Revolution of Planets 47 


equipments, calculation of motion for billions of 
years cannot be made on observations during a 
life time only. It needs systematic observations for 
at least 500 years for studying motion in orbits, 
and at least 10,000 years and much more, if rotation 
of orbits, or change of earth’s axis is to be calculated. 
Thus the result could have been otained only from 
observations through the ages, preserved by 
generations (like Vedas, it has to be ‘Apauruseya’ 
i.e. god given or beyond a human being). 


2. Origin of complete revolution numbers in 
a kalpa - There are two assumptions by ancient 
authorities - In general, it is assumed that the 
figures have been obtained on the basis of 
observations through ages. Total motion in a kalpa 
has been calculated on basis of observed rates. 


Siddhanta Darpana has followed pattern of 
Siddhanta Siromani of Bhaskara II except for some 
new improvements. Bhaskara has assumed that 
concept of yuga and kalpa has been derived from 
the observed motion of planets. The planets repeat 
their positions after every yuga (the grand year), 
as in civil year earth comes back to the same 
position round the sun. However, if we consider 
rotation of orbits; its cycle is repeated only after 
1000 yugas or a kalpa. For example, orbit of Saturn 
rotates only 39 times in a kalpa, so its motion 
cannot be perceived within a yuga. Text books of 
Tantra and karana are not concerned with such 
slow motion. 


Another presumption is that theories of 
planetary motion and constants of orbit have been 
given in vedas. We do not know the technical 
terms and method of presentation of astronomy as 
explained in samhitaé and Brahmana_ texts. 
Varahamihira was probably last who*understood 


48 Siddhanta Darpana 


contents of all 3 parts of jyotisa from vedas. It is 
presumed that 10,000 verses of Rkveda contain 
records of astronomical observations for 10,000 
years or yugas of 5 or 19 years. Though only 
Aryabhata I has specifically mentioned two motions 
of ‘earth, it appears that many others knew about 
movement of earth. It is clear from names Jagat 
(moving), samsara etc. Methods of calculation 
followed by other astronomers also indicate that 
they were following some theories known in vedas 
or other texts but not specified in astronomy works. 
Whatever may be the nature of planetary motion, 
it contines to be observed against the background 
of same Zodiac of 12 rasis or 27 nakSatras, and 
from earth only. From scattered observation charts 
through the ages, theories of circular or elliptical 
orbits have originated. They cannot be observed 
directly. 


3. Circle and Ellipse 


Circumference 


© Centre, radius OP AB = Major axis, CD = Minor axis 
or OQ O Centre, Focus F1 and Fe 
Fig. 1A-Circle Fig. 1B-Ellipse 


Definition - Circle is path (locus) of a point 
{eircumference) which remains at fixed distance 
(radius) from a fixed point called centre. (Figure 1 
A) 


Revolution of Planets 49 


Circle is a round figure on a paper looking 
same from all directions. Ellipse is elongated form 
of circle - stretched in two opposite directions 
(called major axis) 


Definition - Ellipse is locus of a point whose 
sum of distences from two points F, and F, (called 
focus) is constant. Thus DF,+DF, = D’F,+D’F, = 
AB (major axis). Smallest width is minor axis CD. 
AB and CD are perpendicular at their middle point 
O, called centre (Figure 1B) 


Kaplar’s laws of planetary motion indicate that 
planets move in an ellipse round the Sun which 
remains at one of the focus (not at the centre). 
Newton’s law of gravitation were derived from 
Keplar’s laws and vice versa. 


In circular orbit (special type of ellipse where 
both focus are at same point), speed of planet will 
remain constant. In elliptical orbit, it will be fastest 
when the planet is closest to Sun (at A if sun is 
at F,). It will be slowest when farthest from sun 
(at B). B is called Aphelion (Apex=top, helios = 
Sun) or mandocca (slow+top) or ucca in short in 
jyotisa. 

One feature of circular orbits remain the same 
in elliptical orbit also. Though the speeds vary at 
different position, the area covered by line from 
sun to the planet in unit time remains the same. 
Thus POQ area in circle or DF,D’ area in ellipse, 
covered in unit time remain constant. 


4. Sighrocca and Mandocca - The relative 
motion of sun and earth remains the same, whether 
it is observed from sun or earth. In either case, it 
will be elliptical motion with same speed. Similarly, 


50 Siddhanta Darpana 


moon also moves in elliptical orbit round the earth. 
The position of sun or moon where its speed is 
lowest (at highest point in orbit), is called man- 
docca. 


Orbits of other planets around sun are also 
elliptical. However, when we observe from earth, 
it is a composition of two elliptical motions - one 
is relative motion of sun around earth and the 
second is motion of planet round the sun. The 
planet in smaller orbit is called sighrocca, as the 
average motion is faster in smaller orbit. The 
highest point in slower and bigger elliptical orbit 
is called mandocca. 


In bigger orbit, a planet’s motion will appear 
slow due to two reasons. At larger distance, 
gravitational attraction of Sun is small and planet 
moves at small speed to counter the attraction by 
its centrifugal force. If speed is more, it will go 
still farther and loose speed, till it settles into a 
stable orbit. Due to larger distance the angular 
speed appears still slower. 

5.‘ Pata- Orbit of sun around earth and orbit

M section of two orbits 


Fig. 2 


of moon around the earth are not in the same 
plane. They are inclined at angle of about 5° (Figure 
2). 


Revolution of Planets 51 


If sun orbit is taken as reference level, at 
point R, moon appears moving towards north or 
upwards. Moon itself is not at R, it may be at any 
point on its orbit MKM’R. R is merely an imaginary 
point of intersection and is called uttara-pata 
(ascending mode) or Rahu. 


At point K motion of the moon appears south 
wards, hence it is called dakSina-pata (descending 
node) or ketu. 


When moon is at one of the patas on purnima 
(180° away from sun) or amavasya (same direction 
as sun), eclipse occurs. Thus Rahu and Ketu are 
said to cause eclipse. Rahu and Ketu are called 
chaya graha as they are only imaginary points. 
They have nothing to do with shadow of earth or 
moon. R and K are always in opposite direction 
from earth as seen from the diagram. They are 
moving in reverse direction to the direction of 
planetary motion. Their revolution is called 
bhagana of pata (in about 19 years). 

Similarly, pata of other planets also move. But 
their motion is so slow that it is noticed only in 
a kalpa. 


Motion of Ucca - Motion of ucca of moon is 
visible in a yuga (one revolution in about 9 years). 


Motion of other planets is very slow and can be 
noticed only in a kalpa. 


6. Change in values of bhagana - Surya 
Siddhanta, first chapter states that motion of 
planets vary with time and hence its observation 
needs to be corrected after long lapse of time. 


It is known in modern astronomy éhat earth’s 
rotation on its axis is slowing down at the rate: of 


52 Siddhanta Darpana 


14 seconds per century due to tidal function. Due 
to decrease in angular momentum of earth, moon 
is moving away at the rate of 8mm every year to 
conserve the angular momentum of earth-moon 
system. Due to tidal forces of galaxy and sun and 
friction of solar atmosphere, motion of planets also 
will slow down. But its values are not known either 
in siddhanta texts or in modern astronomy. It can 
be inferred to some extent by comparison with old 
records of solar eclipse in vedas, or comparing old 
values of bhaganas with present values. 


Thus, if we calculate the average motion of 
the planets on the basis of their total motion, their 
values will differ from the real observation. Another 
reason of error will be inaccuracy and approxima- 
tion of mathematical methods and calculations. To 
correct these, various astronomers have introduced 
correction terms for their era. CandraSekhara was 
last among them. In addition, he introduced 3 
correction terms for moon’s motion, whose error 
was noticed due to its faster motion.

2. Budha, Sukra are in inner orbits around 
sun, so their revolutions are same as sun as they 
appear tied with it as seen from earth. Their 
revolution is equal to number of solar years in a 
kalpa by definition (1 year corresponds to 1 
revolution of sun) 


3. Sighrocca of Brhaspati, Sani and Mafgala 
is due to earth’s orbit round the sun. Hence it is

Verse 25-26 - Kranti vrtta in sky is the 
sudargana cakra of Jagannatha with which he 
removes fear, produces light and destroys all in 
the end. With this prayer Sri Candrasekhara Simha 
completes second chapter of Siddhanta Darpana 
describing bhagana of grahas. 


Chapter - 3 
MEAN PLANETS 


Scope - This chapter describes methods for 
calculating value of madhya graha (position calcu- 
lated from average motion). This coincides with 
sphutagraha (true position) twice in every bhagana 
(revolution). Since the planetary motions started 
from mandocca position; at mandocca, sphuta and 
madhyama positions should be same (for sun and 
moon). 

Verse 1 - Ahargana (count of days) - Ahargana 
for ista dina (desired day) is counting of days from 
beginning of kalpa (in siddhanta text). This is 
needed to know the graha on ista dina of any 
varsa, masa or tithi. 


Note - In tantra, ahargana is counted from 
beginning of mahayuga (or sometimes, from the 
beginning of kaliyuga). In karana text, ahargana is 
counted from any reference year or beginning of 
current year itself for preparation of panjika. 


Verses 2-8 - Steps in calculation of ahargana - 


1. Add the saura varsas for 6 manu, 7 manu 
sandhi (each equal to satya yuga), 27 mahayuga, 
3 padayuga and years passed in current kaliyuga. 


Note : In the present Svetavaraha kalpa, 6 
manus out of 14 have passed. In the current 7th 
vaivasvata manu, 27 yugas have passed. At 
beginning of kalpa and after each manu, a sandhi 
equal to one satya yuga exists: In current 


60 Siddhanta Darpana 


mahayuga, satya, Treta and Dwapara have passed. 
Kaliyuga started on 17/18-2-3102 B.C. Ujjain mid- 
night. 

2. Deduct 1, 70, 60, 400 years 


Note According to verse 24 of 
madhyamadhikara in Surya Siddhanta, Brahma 
took this time of 47,400 divya varsa to create stars, 
planets and living beings. The present stable 
motion of planets started after that. 


3. Multiply by 12 to make it months and add 
the number of months (masa) elapsed from Caitra 
(Candra months in current year are almost equal 
to saura masa). 

4. Keep the result (no. of completed saura 
months) at two places. 

5. At first place, multiply it by no. of adhika 
masa (1,59,33,36,000) in a kalpa and then divide it 
by sauramasa in a kalpa. Result will be adhimasa 
related to the saura varsa. 

6. Add this to the no. of masa from kalpa 
beginning obtained at step 3. 

7. Multiply Candramasa by 30 and add the 
days completed in the present month (Candra 
masa) 

8. Keep the result at two places. 

9. At one place, multiply it by kalpa tithi 
kSaya (25, 08, 22, 52, 000) and divide by number 
of kalpa tithi. Substract the result from kalpa tithi 
at the second place. Difference is number of savana 
tithis from kalpa beginning. Divide it by 7. 
Remainder will give the week day counted from 
ravivara (sunday) as 1.

Mathematical comments - 1. The methods are 
based on rule of 3 (Trairasika) or ratio and

2. Ratio between Candra and saura masa, 
tithis; Saura masa + adhimasa = Candra masa 


Within current year, they are almost equal. 
Candra masa x 30 = Candra tithi 


_ Candra tithi is almost equal to saévana dina 
in a current month 
Candra tithi - kSaya tithi = savana dina. 
Savana dina is time from sunrise till next sun rise. 
3. Kalpa had started on ravivara at midnight 
at Lanka which is at equator on 0° longitude of 
India (passing through Ujjain). 
Verses 9-13 : Errors in approximation of 
sauramasa and Candra tithis (as explained in 
mathematical notes above sl 2) 


Adhimasa - While calculating adhimasa only 
the quotient (result) is taken and remainder is left 
out. If remainder is almost equal to divisor, or if 
an adhimasa has passed recently (in past 1 year), 
then 1 is added to know correct adhimasa. 
However, if the remainder is almost zero or an 
adhimasa is to come soon, then 1 is to be 
substracted. 

KSaya tithi - Similarly, if in calculation of 
kSaya tithi, remainder is almost equal to divisor 


62 Siddhanta Darpana 


and within a week kSaya tithi has passed, then 1 
is added to the result. (If paficami comes after 
tritiya, then caturthi is kSaya tithi upto daSami, 
if remainder is more than half the divisor, 1 is to 
be added to kSaya tithi. Thus 1 will be substracted 
from ahargana. If remainder is almost zero, 1 is 
added to ahargana. Correctness of ahargana can 
be checked with week day. 

Verse 14 - Masadhipati - Divide ahargana by 
30, multiply the result by 2, add 1 and divide by 
‘7. Remainder will indicate week days counted from 
ravivara as 1. (soma 2, mangala 3, budha 4, guru 
5, Sukra 6, Sani 0) Ruler of this day will be 
masadhipati. 


Derivation - Each civil month is of 30 days 
(civil). Ruler of Ist day is masadhipati. Ahargana 
divided by 30 gives the number of civil months. 
In each month of 30 days; 4 weeks are completed 
(4x7=28 days) and 2 days remain. Hence for each 
month; 2 remainder days are taken. 1 is added 
because the first day of kalpa was ravivara, Ist. 
day. 

Verse 15 - Divide ahargana by 30. Remainder 
is the days gone (gata dina) in current month. 
Gata dina substracted from 30 gives bhogya 
(remaining days) dina of the month. 

Derivation is obvious from earlier verse. 

Verse 16 - Divide ahargana by 360, Multiply 
result by 3 and add 1. Divide the result by 7 
Remainder indicates week days starting from ravi 
as 1, which is the varsapati. The remainder left 
after division of ahargana is bhukta dina (past days) 
of current year. 


Mean Planets 63 


Comments : (1) Masdsidhipati and 
varsadhipati are used only for calculating kala bala 
in horoscopes, or in mundane astrology for 
forcasting events of the year. It has no importance 
in ganita jyotisa. 

(2) Each civil year is of 360 civil days. Hence 
the quotient after division by 360 into ahargana, 
is number of completed civil years. Remainder will 
be past days of the current year. 


(3) In 1 year of 360 days, 360+ 7 = 51 weeks 
and 3 extra days remain. Hence each completed 
year gives 3 days for count of week days, Next 
day will be first day of current year, hence 1 is 
added to find varsadhipati. 


Verse 17-20 - Lord of first day of masa (month) 
is masadhipati, and lord of first day of varsa is 
varsadhipati. 

Satananda (author of Bhasvati karana) and his 
followers have different opinion. Lord of the day 
on which mesa samkranti falls is the lord of the 
year (varsadhipati). To calculate the number of days 
in that year, the following rule has been given. 


Calculate the danda, pala etc. from time of 
entry of ravi in mesa samkranti to the time of 
beginning of next day. Multiply it by 4 and keep 
it in 3 places. Divide the number at third place by 
37 and add the result at second place. Divide at 
second place by 8 and add this result at first place. 
The result in danda etc. will indicate the number 
of days for which the varsapati will rule. For 
remaining days of the year, (360 - days of rule of 
varsapati) lord of day next to safkran# will rule. 


64 Siddhdnta Darpana 


According to this rule, no graha can rule for more 
than 271 days. 


Mathematical symbol : let T = time in danda 
etc. from entry of ravi in mesa to next sunrise.

7 ‘+R (remainder smaller than 37) 
4T4+T : 

3 = J “+R’ (remainder smaller than 8) 


4T+1” = D danda + p pala etc. 

D is the number of days for which varsapati 
will rule. Lord of the day after mesa Sankranti will 
rule for 360 - D days. 

2. This appears to be a convention by 
Satananda, hence no derivation of the rule is given. 
3. Maximum days of rule of varsapati -

Same method is used for calculation of Sighrocca,

because movement of pata is in opposite direction 
of graha. 


Note - When it is unnecessary to explain in 
more detail, the author has just referred to 
quotation from previous authorities - mainly surya 
sidhanta or siddhanta siromani. Sometimes quota-

tions have been given for comparison or contradic- 
tion on important points. 


Verses 24-25 - Calculation of guru varsa - 
calculate bhagana of guru as before and add 3 
(bhaganas) Multiply the sum by 12 and add their 
rasis lapsed and add 2 again. Divide this sum by 
60 and add 1 to the remainder which indicates 
guru varsa counted from Prabhava etc. 


Notes: (1) Secret of guru varsa Kas been 
explained in chapter 21 of this book. 


(2) Guru takes about 12 years to move around 
sun and about 1 year to cover 1 rasi. Hence guru 
varsa (time in a rasi with medium speed) is similar 
to saura varsa (time of 12 raSis or complete 
bhagana) Guru varsa is called samvatsara of 
361.02672 savana days which is smaller by 4.23203 
days from saura varsa and bigger by 1.02672 days 
from savana varsa of 360 days. 


(3) 60 years are needed to complete 5 
revolutions of guru and 2 revolutions of Sani. Thus 
a cycle of 60 years has been adopted for samvatsara 
of guru. This is the active life period of a man. 


(4) Guru varsa are listed in verses 32-46. 
Varahamihira in Vrhatsamhita has assumed the 
beginning of samvatsara*cakra from 35th samvatsara 
Prabhava, instead of the first vijaya. However, the 
calculation method given here will start guru, 
samvatsava from the 13th ‘vikrama’, for start of 
first rasi. Thus one complete round of 12 ragis in 
12 samvatsaras is considered complete at beginning 
of guru motion. This is only a convention. Same 
result could have been obtained by calculating rai

68 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verse 28 : If with sphuta gati guru crosses 
two rasis in a saura varta, then it is calied lupta 
varsa (samvatsara) (Normally guru will touch 2 raésis 
every saura varsa which is only 4 days bigger) 
unless both years start almost at sometime within 
4 days gap. However, if its true motion is faster, 
and years start almost same time, it may touch the 
third rasi also at end of saura varrna) 


Verse 29 - If in a saura varsa, guru in its 
sphuta motion goes to next rasi at higher speed 
(aticara), and does not return to the same rai, 
that year is called mahacara kala. This year is as 
bad and inauspicious as a lupta samvatsara. (In 
this year also sphuta motion is faster than 
madhyama gati, not compensated by reverse 
motion. But guru may not cross into 3rd raéi, if 
its samvatsara does not start with saura varsa). 


Verses 30-31 : 60 Barhaspatya varsa contain 
12 Barhaspatya yuga (of 5 years each). 

Divide current number of barhaspatya years

from Acyuta etc. Within the yuga, the years are 
named according to remainder as ‘sam’, pari, ida, 
‘anu’ and ‘id’ vatsaras. Their adhipatis are agni, 
surya, candra, brahma and Siva respectively. 


Comments : This classification of vatsaras was’ 
done in vedanga jyotima. In one yuga of 19 years, 
there were five types of years. The years starting 
from Ist to 6th lunar tithi was called samvatsara. 
Years starting (solar) from next block of 6 candra 
tithis were called pazi, ida, anu and id vatsaras 
respectively. In a yuga of 19 years, there were 5 
years of samvatsara type. Subsequently in yajur

Verse 47 - Sirya and Candra complete their 
full bhaganas in a mahayuga or in a padayuga. 
Hence their madhyamana can be calculated even 
from ahargana for mahayuga or for any padayuga 
also. 

Verse 48 - Another short method of finding 
ahargana is described below. It is not a fault for 
being a repetition, as great poets like Sri Harsa 
also have adopted such practice. 

Verse 49 : Multiply years since beginning of 
creation by 12 and add completed months from 
caitra Sukla pratipada. Keep it in two places. At 
one place multiply it by 1,00,00,000 and divide by 
32,53,55,104. Add the quotient to result in second 
place. Multiply the result by 30 and add complete 
days passed after amavasya. Keep it again at two 
places. At one place multiply it by 1,00,00,00,000 
and divide by 63,90,97,35,058. Deduct quotient 
from quantity in second place. Result will be 
ahargana from beginning of creation counted from 
midnight of Lanka. 

Derivation of Formula 

Saura varsa x 12 = saura masa 

Completed Candra masa from caitra pratipada 
is assumed equal to saura masa. This approximation 
does not affect the result as the remainders found 


in calculation of adhimasa or kéayatithi are not 
used, 


Total saura masa x 30 = saura dina. 


Candra tithi after amavasya are, similarly 
assumed equal to saura dina.

We keep the significant digits same, so the 


approximation is sufficient for knowing integral 
numbers of adhimasa or kaya tithi. 


Verse 50 : For calculating aharganas from kali 
beginning, the same procedure will be followed. 
However, 4 zeros from the multipliers will be 
removed and 4 last digits of divisions (5104 and 
5058) also will be taken out. Kaliyuga started on 
Sukravara; so days will be counted from friday. 


Note : Kaliyuga = 1/10 yuga 1/10,000 kalpa. 
Hence 4 less no. of digit are required for 
approximation. Thus multiphers and divisors each 
are divided by 10,000. 

Verse 51 - Kalpa bhagana is multiplied by 
1811 and divided by 4000 to get bhagana at the 
end of dvapara. If the madhyama graha calculated 
from kaliyuga first day to ista day is added, madhya 
graha from beginning of kalpa is obtained.

First day of karanabda was monday. This will

sarikranti of madhyama sitrya. 


Verse 56 - Normally madhyama sirya enters 
mesa, 3 days after entry of sphuta suirya. So this 
third day after sphuta mesa sankramana, 1 
ahargana or main day of paficafiga is taken. 
Therefore, madhyama graha is to be calculated for 
previous day of madhya mesa sankranti or on 2nd 
day of entry of sphuta strya in mesa. Then 
difference of grahagati for 1 day is to be added 
for madhyama graha of ista dina. 


‘Verse 57 - There are different practices in 
different countries. Some paficafigas take the entry 
of sphuta sirya in mesa. Many pancangas take 
caitra Sukla pratipada as Ist day. After madhyama 
saura varsa end, karanabda (4970 kali or 12-4- 1869 
A.D.) started. Author has given madhyamanas of 
dhruva (rasi at the beginning of year), ucca, pata 
etc. That day was somavara (monday) and spasta 
surya had just entered mesa at sunrise.

CALCULATION AT DIFFERENT PLACES 


Scope - In chapter 3, madhya graha etc were 
calculated for Lanka. In this chapter, calculations 
will be done for any place on earth. 


Mathematical Notes and definitions - 

(1) Trigonometrical ratios- 
Z ACB =0@, ZABC is a right angle 

Then the, following ratios 
depend only on the value of 
angle 6, and not on the lengths 
of the sides of triangle. By 
definition these ratios are - 


Calculation at Different Places ; 79 


(2) Indian Terms - To avoid decimals, a circle 
of circumferance 21,600 units, i.e. radius of 3438 
units is taken. One unit of circumference is equal 
to 1 kala, then 21,600 kala = 360° = 1 revolution. 

We draw OA and OB, two radii 

such that ZAOB = @ 

Jya of 20 is AC = R sin @ 

or sin 6 x 3438 kala 

AC is half of the chord AD which is like 
string of bow shaped arc ABD. Hence its name is 
Jyarddha or Jya in short. 

OC is kotijya =R Cos @ = 3438 x Cos 0 

-Tangent on A, meets base OB at E.. 


AE/OA = tan @ or AE = OA. tan @ = R tan 
0 


Hence this ratio is called tangent or tan in 
short. In sanskrta it is called sparSa jya. OE pierces 
like arrow, hence called chedjya. OE = OA sec 0 
= R sec @ (sec is short of secant), Complement of 
angle @ i.e. 90°-@ is called koti of the angle. Thus 
koti jya = jya of koti, 

koti sparSa jya = sparSa of koti 

and Koti chedajya = chedajya of koti 

In sanskrt another ratio is defined, called 
_utkrama jya which is CB = R (1-cos 9). 

(3) Ratio of circumference to diameter is fixed 
and is called z (a greek letter, pronounced as ‘pai’) 
in modern mathematics. It is a transcendental 
number which cannot be expressed by any exact 
number. It can be expressed as non-recurring 
non-terminating decimal number to any desired 


80 Siddhanta Darpana 


approximation. Values upto 1,00,000 decimal places 
have been published. Calculation was on computer 
by the formula 
a = 24tan™! , + 8tan} = + 4tan'? ss 
tanA is an angle @ such that 6 = tan A. It 
can be expressed as an infinite convergant series 
when A is smaller than 1. 


22/7 and 355/113 are rough practical ap- 
proximations of a correct upto 2 and 6 places of 
decimal respectively. If paridhi is expressed in kala, 
radius is 3437 3/4 kala approximately, which is same 
as 1 radian angle. (1 radian is an angle made by 
arc equal to radius) 

Madhava of Safigamagrama (kerala) in 13th 
century used infinite series to calculate value of 2 
up to 30 places and sine table upto 9 places. Value 
of x up to 30 places have been expressed in a 
verse by him (read with katapayadi notation) -

(4) Yojana - Yojana is a measure of length as 
explained in the first chapter. Siddhanta darpana 
takes yojana of 1600 hasta = 24,000 feet or 7.3152 
kms approx. (if 1 hasta is taken as 18”). It takes 
diameter of earth as 1600 yojana then it is about 
4.94 miles approximately (hand will be about 19.6”).

(5) Longtiude, Latitude and sphuta paridhi - 
Study of sides and angles on a sphere is subject 
of spherical Trigonometry. It is called gola pada in 
jyotisa. 

To know position of a point in space by 
measuring its angle or distance from fixed point 
and lines is the basis of coordinate geometry (or 
cartesian geometry in the name of Rene de-Cartes 
of France, the originator). In a plane, two systems 
are used to indicate location of a point. 


X 
Cartesian Co-ordinates Polar Co-ordinates 
Fig. 3a Fig. 3b 

In both systems, O is the fixed point called 
origin and a line through it OX is called X axis. 
In cartesian coordinates, another line OY perpen- 
dicular to OX (in counter clock wise direction) is 
called Y axis. In cartesian coordinate location of a 
point P is indicated by its distance x from @ along: 
axis (x coordinate) and distance y in direction of 
y axis (y coordinates). Distance in the direction 
OX’ and OY’ are negative. (Figure 3 a). 


In polar coordinates, location of a point P is 
indicated by its distance r (always positive) from - 
origin O and the angle @ made by OP with OX 
in counter clockwise direction. (r,6) indicate posi- 
tion of any point in space (Figure 3b) 

Conversion from one system to ofher is not 
difficult. © 


£2 Siddhanta Darpana 
r=x+y x == rT cos 6 
6 = tan -1 y/x y=rsin@ 

_ For example, if Bhubaneswar be origin, then 
location of Puri can be indicated in cartesian 
coordinates as 

40 kms south (x coordinate) 
35 kms east (y coordinate) 


In polar coordinates - 53 kms away (r) in 
direction of 40° (6) from south towards east. 


Ina plane, two quantities called coordinates 
are needed to locate a point. In space, 3 quantities 
are needed - so it is called 3 dimensional space. 
In theory of relativity, time is considered fourth 
dimension. An event in world is indicated by 3 
space and 1 time coordinates. Hence world is called 
4 - dimensional space time continum. 

For example, a hill top in Puri can be specified 
by its height from mean sea level, in addition to 
two coordinates of plane. 


- Three dimensional coordinates : 


Cartesian Space Co-ordinates Spherical polar Coordinates 
Fig. 4a Fig. 4b —_ 

Cartesian space coordinates are measured 
along mutually perpendicular X,Y,Z axis. If a right 
hand screw is rotated from X direction to Y 
direction, it will moye in Z direction. The distances 
of any point P frorh origin O along the three axis 
are called (x,y,z) coordinates. 


Calculation at Different Places 83 


In spherical polar coordinates, distance OP of 
P from origin is r coordinate. Angle @ between 
plane of z axis and OP with X axis is second 
coordinate. In the plane, elevation of OP from XY 
plane (with line OQ) is called ¢. 6 takes values 
from 0 to 2 a or 360°. ¢ takes values from - 90° 
to + 90° or can take any value. This system is 
more useful for spherical geometry and astronomy. 


Conversion formula - 
r sin ® = Z, r cos ® cos 6 = x, 
r cos ® sin 6 = y 


In astronomy, only two angle coordinates are 
-used. For places on earth, the distance from centre 
is fixed as radius of earth (r coordinate), OZ is 
line from centre to north pole. Angle @ is measured 
from prime meridian (great circle or plane passing 
through north pole and Greenwich (London)). In 
India, prime maridian was assumed through Ujjain 
as a reference. ® is the angle with equator plane 
(XY plane). In popular terms @ Coordinate is called 
longitude (- 180° to + 180° and ® coordinates is 
called latitude (- 90)° (south) to + 90° (north). 
Positive direction of longitude is called east, and 
- negative direction west). 

In astronomy, a second frame of reference is 
also used: This is fixed with refrence to stars which 
don’t move. Planet’s movement is observed with 
reference to stars. Zodiac or rai vrtta is path of 
apparent motion of stars in which coordinates 6 is 
measured from 0° to 360°. Deviation from this 
plane is called vikSapa or Sara. (-90” to +90°). 


84 } Siddhanta Darpana 


For calculation of eclipse etc, frequently we 
need to convert the figures from equatorial coor- 
dinates to zodiac coordintes. This is called drk 
Karma. 


Sphuta. paridhi of earth, at any point is 
circumference of circle on earth’s surface parallel 
to equator (latitude) circle or simply called a parallel 
. of particular degree. 


(6) Motion of a top and earth’s motion 


Spin arround Spin with steady . Spin, precession 
axis of the top precession of axis and nutation 
5a in a vertical cone 5c 
5b 
Fig.5 


A top rotating fast along its axis stands vertical 
on a rough surface due to gyroscopic stability. Its 
lower end is fixed due to friction with earth and 
it moves away from vertical position and falls due 
to gravity in the end. 


Spin (figure 5a) - Rotation of a top about its 
axis is called spin. When top is rotating very fast, 
its axis is vertical and its appears stationary. 


Precession (fig 5b) - Precession is conical 
motion of the axis of top. Upper point of the axis 
makes a circle about the vertical direction. 


Nutation .- When motion of top becomes 
slower, its axis falls further away from vertical and 
rises again atternatively. In steady precession, 
upper point of the top makes a horizontal circle 
‘on a sphere. In nutation it moves in a wave like 


Calculation at Different Places 3 95 


ath between two horizontal circles on the sphere 
as in fig. 5C. 

(7) Rotation of earth around its axis - Motion 
of earth around its axis is completed in one day 
‘and causes day and night. Due to that the sphere 
of stars in sky appears to make a daily rotation 
from east to West. This is spin motion of a top. - 


~ Axis of earth is inclined at angle of about 
23-1/2° from perpendicular to the plane of ecliptic 
(i.e. plane of earth’s orbit round the sun). Due to 
that the sun appears either north or south of the 
equator. During summer season in north hemi- 
sphere, it will be perpandicular to earth’s surface 
at noon time at some place between equator and 
_23-1/2° north (Tropic of cancer) 


When the plane containing vertical to ecliptic 
and earth’s axis contains sun, inclination of sun 
‘towards north or south is maximum. These points 
opposite to each other are called summer and 
winter solstice. In summer solstice, axis is directly 
inclined towards sun, and sun is perpendicular to 
tropic of cancer (23 1/2°) 


Autumnal 
equinox Summer 


———— 
Vemal equinox 


Fig. 6 
At two points on orbit, 90° away from place 
ae inclination, the axis of earth is inclined 
a ways and not towards sun. Then sun rays 
© Perpendicular on equator (i.e. on: plane con- 


of 


86 Siddhanta Darpana 


taining ecliptic and arth’s axis). On such points, 
day and night are equal. ‘Nakta’ means night in 
sanskrit, it is called noct in greek. Equinox means 
equal day and night. On one of equinox points, 
sun goes from south to north hemisphexe. This is 
called vernal equinox. The other point .s called 
autumnal equinox. Northward motion of sun is 
called uttara - ayana and southward motion is 
daksinayana. Both ayanas, make one hayana, a 
complete year. 


Precession of axis - At present, earth’s axis 
towards north is directed to pole star (Dhruva 
Tara). So pole star appears to be fixed. Axis is 
moving like precession of a top in conical motion 
due to two reasons - (1) Earth is not spherical, it 
has bulge at equator due to centrifugal force of 
rotation (2) Orbit of moon is inclined to earth’s 
orbit at about 5° angle which creates unequal pull 
at different ends of bulge. To some extent, 
inclination of other planetary orbits also affects the 
axis. 


Practical effect of precession of axis is that, 
points of equinoxes move slowly westwards. If 
solar year is counted by motion relative to fixed 
stars, start of seasons shifts slowly. 1° change of 
equinox, i.e. 1 day change of season occurs in 
about 72 years. One month change is in about two 
thousand years. 


In western astronomy, solar year is counted 
from equinox to equinox. Position of vernal equinox 
is taken as 0° mesa. Difference between vernal 
equinox, and static mesa 0° of Indian astronomy 
is called’ Ayanarnga. For determining day length, 
rising period of raSis etc, position of sun from 


glculation at Different Places 
inox position is taken. From that position; 


spheri 


87 


cal triangle is completed. Since equinox 


moves backward (to west), ayanarnéa is added to 
sun position. It is called sdyana sun or any other 


planet.

_ Verse 1 - I (author) will describe in short the 

various measurements of earth. In second half of; 
the book, these will be discussed in detail. 

Verse 2 - Average diameter of earth! 
(madhyavyasa) is 1600 yojanas. Multiply this by 
10,800 and divide by 3,438. You get the paridhi, 
(circumference) described in 3rd verse. | 

Verse 3-4 - Paridhi at centre (equator) is 
5,026/10 yojana. Jya of 90° is taken as 3438 kala.: 
Hence, sphuta bhi-paridhi is obtained by multi-: 
plying, madhya paridhi by lamba jya of the place. 
and dividing by 3438. Otherwise, this madhya: 
paridhi can be multiplied by 12 and divided by 
visuva karna.

Derivation - (1) NS is line joining north and 
south pole. O is centre. The circle perpendicular 
to NS line is called sphuta bhi paridhi. Largest 
circle passes through centre 0, at point A and is 
called equator. Sphuta paridhi at point P is to be 
calculated.

Verse 5 - Lanka, Rohitaka, Avanti, KurukSetra 
etc. are on the prime meridian line (Pradhana 


madhyandina ee which passes through both 
merus. * 


90 Siddhanta Darpana: 


Note (1) Rekha is a straight line in a plane, 
but it is arc of a great circle in a sphere (the circle, 
passing through ‘centre of sphere, which is‘ 
greatest). Like straight line of a plane, it is the! 
shortest distance between two points, and doesn't | 
change the direction. 


(2). This verse means same as verse 62 in. 
madhyamadhikara of Siirya-siddhénta and repre- 
sents the convention of treating the longitude 
through Ujjain as reference line (0° longitude). At 
present, the meridian passing through Greenwich 
is 0° meridian. 

(3) According to historical traditions, ‘Polan- 
narua’ (meaning Paulastya nagara) in present Sri 
Lanka was the capital of Lanka. However, for 
astronomical purpose, Lanka is the imaginary point 
of intersection of longitude through Ujjain and 
equator (i.e. middle point of that line between 
south and north pole). Lanka is nearest land mass 
near the point; hence it is called Lanka (presump- 
tion) 

(4) Location of original KurukSetra is not 
‘known. If present Rohataka (a district headquarter 
in Hariyara) is taken as Rohitaka, then it is 8 pala 
east from madhya rekha. Hence, Bhaskaracarya has 
not indicated it on madhya rekha. He says that 
this line touches regions like KurukSetra etc. 

Verses 6-9 - DeSantara is the east west distance 
between two places with same aksamSa on sphuta 
bhi paridhi (local latitude circle perpendicular on 
polar axis or parallel to equator). 

Multiply this deSantara yojana by 60 and 
divide by spasta bhiparidhi. Alternately, multiply 


Calculation at Different Places 91 


by visuva karna in liptikas and divide by 60, 314. 
You will get deSantara in danda etc. 

All days, months and years start with mid- 
night at Lafika i.e. from midnight at places on 
madhyandina rekha. If a place is east from rekha, 
add the deSantara (ghati ) to get the midnight time 
at that place, from which day, months will start 
at that place. If the place is west from rekha, 
desantara is to be deducted.

‘speed around its axis or in the direction of

(2) Visuva Karna - Palabha is length of the 
shadow of a vertical stick (cone or Sanku) at noon 
on a day when day and night are. equal. Height 
of Sanku is 12 angula. 

Viguva karna or pala-karna is the length of 
hypotenus, i.e. distance from tip of 12 angula Sanku 
to the tip of shadow. 

Palabha or pala karna gives a measure of the 
angle of latitude (akS4mSa) as sun is vertically above 
equator on visuva day (when day and night are 
equal)

Verse 13-14 - Bhaskaracarya (and his followers) 
assumes start of all (motion of planets, day etc.) 
from sunrise at Lanka. Thus the ahargana according 
to his theory is different from other theories. This 
separate ahargana (of Bhaskara) doesn’t give 
position of planets as they are actually seen, hence 
it is not followed in this book. 

Note - Bhaskara ahargana will give correct 
position of planets for sunrise at Laika only. Since 
day length is different for different latitudes, 
sunrise will be at different times on same longitude 
also. But midnight will be at same time on the 
whole longitude, hence it gives correct result.

desantara kala (in danda) of the place with dainika 
gati of graha and divide by 60. Add the result to 
the graha at Lanka at midnight if the place is west 
from Lanka. (Since earth rotates in east direction, 
midnight will be later in a place to the west and 
in the extra time, the graha will move further). 
Deduct, if the place is towards east. 


Verse 16 - Alternately, difference in grahagati 
can be obtained by multiplying dainika gati with 
degantara yojana and dividing by sphuta 
bhiparidhi. 

Note : Desantara ghati of a western place is 
the time taken by earth to reach midnight position 
for that place. Alternate method follows from 
_ methods of -findig deSantara ghati (vrse,9). 


94 Siddhanta Darpana . 


Verse 17-21 - Old method of finding longitude. 
- calculate the time of pirna (full) candra grahana 
(lunar eclipse) at madhya rekha (prime meridian. 
through Lanka or Ujjain). 

(Note - Exact time of Pirna grahana is the. 
time of unmilana (when moon starts emerging from ' 
shadow). 


By observation, see the actual time of Pirna ; 
grahana at your place. The difference in time is , 
deSantara kala. 


If the place is west from Ujjain, then the time | 
found by observation (drk-siddha or vedha) will! 
be less than calculated time (i.e. eclipse will be at 
same time, but corresponding local time will come’ 
later at western place). For places east of Ujjain,. 
observed time will be more. 

Time difference can also be calculateed on! 
basis of sparsa (when moon starts entering the | 
shadow) or mokéa (when moon is aca! a Sed, 
from shadow). 

To find deSantara yojana,° multiply it 
(deSantara kala) by sphuta paridhi and divide by 
60 (already explained in verse 9). | 

To calculate graha at ista time, multiply the 
dainika gati of graha by ista kala and divide by’ 
60. Add the result to graha at midnight at the 

_ place. 

Notes : (1) Time difference (in danda) from 
Lanka midnight is due to two components - (1) 
difference between midnight times at the place and! 
at Lanka (2) Time lapsed after midnight of the 
place at desired time. 


Calculation at Different Places 95 


Dainika gati of graha is movement in 60 danda 
(1 day). Hence movement in ista danda is 

Dainika gati x ista danda (kala) 

ee eg ee 


components of ista kala are added or sub- 
stracted as explained before. 

(2) Candra grahana is due to covering of moon 
by shadow of earth, both of which are at one 
place. Thus there is no parallax and it is seen 
similar from all positions. But Sirya grahana is by 
obstruction of.sun’s vision by moon (at 1/400 of 
the distance). Their relative directions are seen 
different. from different places, (called parallax), 
hence siirya grahana starts at different places at 
different times. Hence only candra grahana can be 
used for comparison of midnight times. 


(3) Terms of grahana

(4) Other methods of finding longitude - Now. 
very accurate watches are available and any event, 
can be observed with telescope more accurately. In 
observing candra grahana, there will be difference. 
of 2-3 minutes in observation by different persons. : 
Eclipse of satellites of jupiter occurs daily. It is 
observed through telescope and compared with 
time given in nautical almanc. This will give 
accurate longitude: 


Alternatively, two watches are to be tallied 
with local times of places, whose longitudes are to 
be compared. They can be tallied with sunrise ori 
preferably at midnight time. Then by telephone,, 
the local time of the two places can be compared. 
The time difference will be deSantara kala. Now' 
T.V. and radio announce Indian standard times 
(mean time at 82°30’ east of greenwich). Local mean 
time can be found by correcting local true time} 
with time equation (fixed for particular days of 
solar year. or sun position). From that tim 
difference, difference with 82°30’ longitude can 
known. 


(5) Time can also be known accurately by; 
movement of stars during night. This is particularl 
useful for sea journeys in a clear night. Since, 
method of finding longitude was known sincé 
remote past in India, long journey in sea wa

possible. Due to difficulty in knowing time in 
absence of watches, this method could be known 
in western astronomy only in 1480 A.D. after which 
Cobumbus could undertake his journey, in 1492 in 
pursuit of sea route to India from Spain. Finding 
latitude is easy through palabha, discussed in more 
detail in TripraSnadhikara. 

Verses 22-24 : By above corrections for 
deSantara kala, we get the graha for nirakSodaya 
kala (sunrise time at equator at same longitude). 
Due to difference in akS4m$Sa (north south distance) 
from Lanka, cara samskara is needed, because 
sunrise times are different for different places on 
same longitude due to aksamSa. 


From sphuta ravi (sun) kranti (true inclination 
of sun from vertical in north south direction i.e. 
inclination from vertical at noon), find cara danda 
(time in danda by which day-half is longer than 
normal day half of 15 danda). Multiply it with 
dainika gati of graha and divide by 60. If sun 
(sayana) is in six rasi from tula to mina, add the 
result to the position of graha. If sayana sun is in 
mesa to kanya, then deduct the result. For finding 
graha at the time of sun set, do the reverse process. 


Notes (1) This part (chapter 1 to 4) is 
madhyamadhikara, dealing with mean position of 
planets. Nothing has been so far discussed, as to 
how, true (sphuta) position of planets can be 
found. Sphuta kranti of sun can be found only at 
moon time by direct cbservation. By comparison 
with previous days kranti, it can be calculated for 
Sunrise time (3/4 of the difference of 1 day kranti 
will be added to previous noon figure, to find 
kranti at sunrise).

2. Mesa to kanya - 1st six rasis are in north 


hemisphere and other six are in south (sayana raiis , 
to be more accurate). When sun is in southern 


hemisphere, days will be smaller in north hemi- 


sphere compared to night. Hence sunrise will be’ 
later and sunset earlier than equator (where day: 


night are always equal) Thus graha will move for 
more time at sunrise compared to sunrise at 
equator, difference of motion will be added. 


3. Cara is variation of day from 30 ghatika, 
caradala is half of cara. In short ‘cara is used for 


caradala which is directly calculated. Jya of cara’ 


(angular difference in earth’s rotation) is called cara 
jya.

A planet in kranti vrtta appears to move daily 
in a vertical circle at equator in east west direction. 
Its diameter BOB’ is perpendicular to north south 
line P’O P at equator. This circle is called ahoratra 
vrtta (only diameter is seen in perpendicular*plane). 
Corresponding to point O, the planet rises in the 
east goes upto B, highest point in sky (south from 
vertical in north hemisphere) and sets in west again 
at O. Motion from O to B’ and back to O are not 
visible as these are below the horizon. Both motions 
OBO or OB’O take 12 hours each. 

CK’C’ is the diameter of ahoratra vrtta (diurnal 
circle) of a planet in south hemisphere. At equator, 
it is visible for motion K’C K’ for half the day i.e. 
12 hours. However, at place O, it rises only at 
point M’ and is not visible for period K’ to M’ (in 
12 hours) which is called cara. 

Time for K’C = 30 ghati (12 hours)

Notes: Q) Manda bhujaphala is neither ex-

in madhyamadhikara (chapters 1 to 4).

Mandaparidhi also changes slightly, because,

(2) Udaya kala of different rasis is calculated 
in chapter 6-121. Due to oblique direction of raéis 
with equator (24° or 23°27’ more accurately), the 
time taken by different raSis to rise is different. | 
As we move away from equator this inclination | 
with local horizontal plane increases. Difference in 
rising time of rasis becomes more. However, total 
time of rising of all ragis will be same as NakSatra 
dina for all places. The rising time of rasis for Ist | 
to 6th rasis is same as that of 7th to 12th rasis in 
reverse order. At equator, position of Ist to 3rd 
rasi is same’as 6th to 4th rasi (symmetric for sayane 
rasi), hence their rising times are same.- For 
difference in start of mid night at equator, only 
the rising times at equator are needed. A com- 
parison of traditional rising times based on Surya 
Siddhanta and modern values is given below-

At other places, udaydsu of ragi is lessened 
by carasu. It is added for raéi 4 to 9.

Note - In this formula, different rates of rising 
_ of raSis and difference between nakSatra dina and 
sévana dina are ignored. 


Verse 33 : After, bhujantara sarnskara, I am 

telling the method of udayantara sarnskara which 

is due to difference between madhyama ravi in 

- kranti vrtta and imaginary madhya ravi in nadivrtta 
(in plane of. equator). 

Verses 34-37 - For this purpose (for 
udayantara sarhskara) make the madhyama ravi 
Sayana (add ayanadméa). Find the bhukta asu of 
that ragi (part of udayasu of raéi in proportion to 
lapsed degrees in that raéi). Add the udayasu of 
Previous rasi starting from mesa. Then calculate 
the kala of sayana ravi and substract from Ist result. 


106. Siddhanta Darpana 


Multiply the difference by the dainika gati of graha 
(in lipta) and divide by 21,659 (as dainika gati is 
for savana dina of 21,659 asu) The result is 
udayantara phala. Substract the result from madhya 
graha, if ravi is‘'in sama or even pada (2nd or 4th 
quadrant) and add if ravi is in visama pada (Ist 
. or 3rd quadrant - 0 to 90° or 180° to 270° from 
mandocca). For correction in pata or ucca, do the 
reverse. 

Notes : (1) Madhyama ravi + AyanarhSa = 
Sayana madhyama ravi = S 

Bhukta asu for S = rising times for rasis from 
0° to S 

1 asu time = time for movement of 1 kala at 
equator 

' Hence. paunia asu of S = Its kala at equator 
= E 
Kala of S = S’ 
Correction for observation in plane of equator 
= E-S’ in kala equivelent to asu time.. 
Difference in madhyama graha = 

E-S Dainika gati 
(E- 9) x “57 659 = 5 

as 1 day is of. 21659 asu (savana dina) 

This difference is negative for Ist and 3rd 
quadrant i.e. Sayana ravi is more in kranti vrtta 
than in nadivrtta. At 90° and 270° they are equal, 
and no correction is. needed. 

(2) This is effect of transformation of coor- 
dinate axis from ecliptic to equator, because’ time 


is measured by movement along equator (asu is 1’ 
movement). 


Calculation at Different Places 107 


Verse 38-39 - The three samskara (cara, 
phujantara and udayantara) can be made to sphuta 
graha also instead of applying it to madhya graha. 
Then we will use sphuta graha instead of madhya 

aha in all places. Once the samskara has been 
done to sphuta graha, it is not to be applied again 
to madhya, mandocca and Sighrocca because these 
results are used to calculate sphuta graha. 


Note : The sanskaras are for difference in time 
measurements and not due to madhya or sphuta 
graha, hence correction to any value can be done. 
In short, correction time difference between mad- 
hya and sphuta is negligible. 

Verses 40-41 - If we take asu arising out of 
mandaphala of ravi while making bhujantara 
samskara, then udayantara karma is done from 
sayana madhyama ravi. 


When we take asu equal to kala of man- 
‘daphala of ravi then udayantara will be done from 
sayana ravi before bhujantara sanskara, both are 
to be done separately. 


Note : (1) In taking asu equal to mandaphala, 
it is already converted to value in equator plane; 
hence separate udaydntara sarnskara is not neces- 
sary. 

(2) A review of all corrections - (a) Degantara 
safiskara - It is due to different times of sunrise 
which is earlier in east. Hence time in east is more 
counted from sunrise or midnight. At present 
reference is not 0° longitude only. Every country 
has fixed reference time according to time zone 
from 0° longitude through Greenwich. Thus Indian 
Standard time is standard time for 82‘ 30’ east of 


108 . Siddhanta Darpana 


greenwich, i.e. 5-1/2 hours more. Correction for 
local standard time is done for difference in 
desantara (longitude) Since 360° rotation of earth 


24 x 60 
in 24 hours, 1° rotation is in 360. = 4 minutes. 


Hence 4 minutes time is added for each degree 
longitude towards east. 

Local standard time - Indian standard time 

= (longitude - 82°30’) in degrees x 4 minutes 
(b) Cara sanskara - Midnight or midnoon is 
same forall places in a longitude. When time is 
measured from midnight (in hour system), then 
no correction is needed. However, in India, savana 
dina is counted from sunrise which is different at 
different latitudes. Difference in day length in- 
creases as we move away from equator. In practice 
we do not correct the time, but find the time of 
sun rise. Time of sunrise depends on position of 
true (sphuta) sayana sun which is: fixed for a 
particular: day of a solar year like christian era. It 
also depends on latitude of the place. Thus date 
wise charts are prepared for sunrise time at 
different longitudes (in local mean time). at 1° or 
10° intervals. It can’ be calculated from kranti of 
that day noted from penne or calculated from 
- sayana ravi. 


‘Difference between true time and sunrise time 
_- both counted from midnight. gives ista kala in 
Indian system.. 424 7 ; 

(c) Bhujantara safiskéra - This. is due to 
difference in standard time and true time - both. 
Local standard time is calculated on the assumption 
that each day is of 24 hours. Day length is made 


Calculation at Different Places 109 


of two components. To move from 1 nakéatra to 
that naksatra again it takes 23 hours 56 minutes 
due to earth’s daily motion. Meanwhile, sun also 
moves about 1° ahead due to orbital movement of 
earth in same direction (360° in about 360 days). 
To cover that distance more earth takes about 4 
minutes more (360° is covered in about 24 hours). 
Thus nakégatra dina is 23 hours 56 minutes = 21,600 
asu and savana dina is 24 hours = 21,659 asu. 
Difference is 59 asu = about 4 minutes (= 60 asu). 


While nakéatra dina is fixed, extra 4 minute 
gomponent varies and each savana dina is not 24 
hours exact. But the watches are calculating 24 
hours for each day according to standard time. The 
. Standard or mean time and true or solar time start 
together at sayana mesa safikranti, 23 March., when 

; day and night are equal. Around 24th April when 
gun is at farthest (mandocca is at nirayana mega 
§40° or sayana 32°), sun is slowest. So days are 
xpmaller than 24 hours after 23rd March. By taking 
«@4 hours for each day clock time is slower than 

_ true time. This addition in clock time to get true 
time accummulates for about 6 months upto 14 
minutes. Then it is negative correction and again 
both times tally on 23rd March next year. 


Effect of 4 minutes shorter nakéatra dina is 
that a particular lagna (e.g. mesa) will start 4 
minutes earlier on next day. Effect of difference in 
ied time and standard time is that sun will be at 
Faee a position at true noon not at local mean 
ee hrs local standard time). This is also called 
pay Be to time difference, or velantara 
ti Paarioods 3 formula for knowing difference in 

and standard time is called time equation. 


110 Siddhanta Darpana 


This difference depends only on sun’s position 
(indicating bhujantara) or the day of solar year. 

(d) Udaydantara safiskara - This is negligible 
and is not necessary when bhujantara is measured 
in asus. In modern astronomy also, this is included 
in time equation. 

Verse 42 - Multiply aksaméa kala by 
bhiparidhi and divide by 21,600. Then we get the 
distance of place from nirakSa (equator) towards 
north or south on the yamyottara vrtta (longitude 
line). 

Note - Bhaparidhi covers 21,600 kala. AkSamSa 
kala is north south distance from equator in kalas. 
Thus the distance from equator is calculated 
because 1 kala is same on longitude line or equator. 


Verse 43-45 - To save enormous labour in 
calculating graha, I am giving ‘padaka’ of surya 
etc. like K6canacarya. (’Kocanna’ was an 
astronomer of Andhra Pradesh who had prepared 
charts for easy calculation. These charts were 
popular in south Orissa also at the time of author). 

Ahargana is given for years 1,2 ------, 10,20,---, 
100, 2000-----, thousands, lakhs, ten lakhs, crores 
and ten crores. These start from madhyama surya 
at mesa safikramana. Vara Suddhi has been done 
in this. To calculate the ahargana, add the figures 
given in table and divide by 7. If correct vara 
doesn’t come, then add or substract 1 for tally with 
vara.

Scope - This part deals with finding true 
position of planets. So far we have calculated 
methods of finding mean position, which assumes 
constant average speeds of planets, to a first 
approximation. This part contains two chapters. 
Chapter 5 discusses true motion of planets. Chapter 
6 deals with special corrections to moon’s motion 
and accurate paficafga on that basis.

From the data collected over centuries, ap- 
parent circular motion of planet with some loops 
and retroacting motion were detected, where it was 
difficult to find a pattern. But Hipparchus (100-120 
BC) and Ptolemy (85-165 AD) were able to describe 
it on the basis of epicyclic moitons. As explained 
in diagram of Ptolemy (Fig 1a) planets moved in 
circles whose centre moved on some other circle 
round the earth, centre of this circle was slightly 
different depending on changes in the velocity of 
planet. : : 

This was successful in predicting the future 
position of planets, but was unable to reveal any 
law of nature. Copernicus modified the pattern 
with similar construction; (Fig 1b) but with sun at 
rest in which patterns were easier to detect. Based 
on this construction, Kepler (1571-1642) framed 3 
laws— 


P

Fioura 2 - Kanlarian Orbit 


True Planets 115 


Line SP joining sun S to a planet P sweeps 
out equal areas in equal time intervals (rule 2). P 
moves on an ellipse with S at focus. (rule 1). OA 
ig semi major axis and ratio OS/OA is called 
eccentricity. 

Third law is that square of time period T of 
revolution of a planet is proportional to cube of 
its mean distance from sun. 


These laws led Newton to prove that all 
matters attract each other with a force proportional 
to inverse square of the distance between them. 
Together with plausible assumption that force is 
proportional to masses of attracting matter, it 
formed his theory of gravitation. 


However, the method of calculation of 
planetary position remains the same. In both the 
methods, we calculate the direction and distance 
of planet from sun (heliocentric position). Then on 
basis of earth’s distance and direction from sun, 
we calculate the direction of planet from earth 
(geocentric position.) Heliocentric position is only 
a mathematical necessity. Actual observation is 
always from earth, equal to geocentric position. 


(2) Calculation of planets in Western 
astronomy - Calculation of sun’s position is 
simplest. We calculate position of apsis (nearest 
Point on major axis -- Indian method starts with 
farthest point) mean anomaly (angle with apsis) 
and position of vernal eqinox from which lon- 
gitudes are measured. In a solar calender, sun’s 
Tevolution is almost equal to year and position, 
longitude and latitude of sun depend on date of 
calender with minor corrections. :

Moon’s orbit has perturbations due to attrac-! 
tion of sun and other planets. Movement of its 
~ node is faster (Due to its nearness to earth and| 
effect of sun, parallax etc, its accurate calculations’ 
for eclipse is needed. First, we derive the formula:

Conversion of Orbital distance to ecliptic 
distance Equation (10) gives the distance (angular) 
‘of planet in its orbit from its nicha (perihelion) or 
closest position. If the orbit of planet would have 
been in same plane as earth’s orbit (or plane of 


Figure 4 - Inclination of orbit with eeliptic 


132 Siddhanta Darpana 


ecliptic), this would have been its distance in 
ecliptic also. But every planet’s orbit is at an angle 
with ecliptic which is its parama Sara (maximum 
distance from ecliptic). This inclination is given in 
the chart above. There is no inclination for earth’s 
orbit (or sun) because it is measured from this orbit 
only. 

In fig 4, PC is orbital ellipse and CP’ is the 
ecliptic. S is centre of sun and A is perihelion 
(nica) of the planet. P is true position. PP’ is 
perpendicular on ecliptic, hence it passes through 
pole of ecliptic. Then ASP is orbital true anomaly 
(Kakéa spaSta kendra) and SP is spasta karna. AA’ 
is perpendicular on ecliptic and also passes through 
its pole. Distance A’P’ along ecliptic is the ecliptic 
true anomaly (kranti vrttiya spasta kendra). 

For theoretical calculation, it is easier to find 
out relation between CA and CA’ or CP and CP’. 
But in practice, we need to know only the minor 
correction to orbital distance to know ecliptic 
distance. 

This correction or difference between orbital 
distances from pata C (intersection point of orbit 
and ecliptic) is called parinati. 

Nica parinati = CA - CA’ 

Planet parinati = PA-P’A 

PP’ is instantaneous or istakalika Sara, PCP’ 
is parama Sara (equal to maximum angular distance 
from ecliptic), PC is distance from pata to graha 
or vipata graha. ZPP’C is right angle, hence PCP’ 
is a spherical right angle triangle. From Napier’s 
laws

Precession of equinoxes - According to New- 
comb, rate of general precession in longitude per 
tropical year of 365.2422 days is 50”. 2564+0”.02223 
(t/100) + 0”.0000026 (t/100)* 

where t is measured in tropical years from 
1900.0 AD. 


Annual rates of precession per sidereal year 
of 365.25636 days is 50”.258 35 + 0”.02223 (t/100)

In Julian year of 365.25 days, precession is 
50.”25747+0" .02223 (t/100) + 0”.0000026 (t/100)? 


In Indian system, initial point from which 
longitude is measured is a fixed point of ecliptic 
with respect to stars. In modern astronomy, it is 
the point of vernal equinox. Distance from fixed 
initial point of vernal equinox point: is called 
Ayanaméa. 

To - fix initial point accurately, star spica 
(uvirginis) has been assigned a nirayana (from fixed 
point) longitude of 180°. Since the star also has 
some small motion, its longitude of epoch time is 
taken when fixed point and vernal equinox point 
were together with sun on it. 

This epoch of 0° Ayanamsa (0° sun also) was 
on 285 AD, March 22, 17h 48m E.T. or 21h 27m 
IST. That was beginning of éaka era 207, Samvat 
€ra 342 and Kaliyuga era 3386. Julian day on March

Annual proper motion in ecliptic system is

Perturbations to Sun - 


Action of Moon - Longitude of sun (or earth 
in opposite direction) is the longitude from centre 
of mass of earth and the moon. This is called 
geometric longitude. The origin is to be transferred 
to centre of earth. 

Radius of earth is taken as unity, []’ and |] 
are horizontal parallaxes in seconds of arc of moon 
and sun respectively, 6’ are # are their latitudes.

value of mass. 

With Newcomb’s value of m= 1+ 329390 and

Translation of the text 


Verse 1 - Scope and definition - The position 
in which graha in seen from earth is to be found 
by calculation. This process is called Sphutikarana 
of graha or making is sphuta. The graha give 
results according to the position they are seen. 
Hence method for making a graha sphuta is being 
explained. 


Verses’ 2-5 - Reasons of planetary motion - 
Celestial sphere containing graha and nakSatra 
revolves around earth once in a day from east to 
west due to attraction of a wind (Pavana) named 
Pravaha rotating round earth. This is called daily 
motion. 


Graha move in opposite direction from west 
to east compared to stars (or nakSatras) with slow 
speed according to their own enregy. This is called 
natural speed of a planet (svabhavika gati). There 


True Planets 157 


are deviations from this average speed of planets 
under influence of ucca (Sighra and manda). 
(According to Sarya siddhanta) Invisible forms 
of kala like Sighrocca, mandocca and pata residing 
in celestial sphere are reasons of planetary motion. 


Notes (1) Daily moiton is due to rotation of 
earth around its axis. Earth appears fixed to us 
and stars rotate in opposite relative motion. Reason 
of earth’s rotation is due to initial conditions of its 
formation, now it continues due to inertia. That 
inertia is assumed to be ‘Pravaha’, an imaginary 
force in vacuum. This is similar to assumption of 
ether for propogation of light in vacuum. 


(2) True position of a planet is closer to 
mandocca (farthest point in elliptical orbit) com- 
pared to its mean position. Due to that reason 
attraction by: mondocca in seen. Similar is case with 
sighrocca. 


(3) Pata is point of intersection of planetary 
orbit with ecliptic due to its inclination. Hence, 
pata appears to repulse’a graha away from ecliptic. 


Verses 6-9 - Nature of motion - Mean sun 
moves around earth between nakSatra and orbit of 
grahas. Other planets like mars are in orbit round 
mean sun and along with it, they also revolve 
round earth. Hence (mean) sun is called attractor 
of all. From dainika gati of Mangala, Brhaspati and 
Sani ~ dainika gati of ravi is more and they are 
attracted by ravi. Hence ravi is called sighrocca of 
these planets. 


Compared to Budha and sukra, speed of ravi 
'S slower and it always remains between them. 
Hence Budha and Sukra are called their sighrocca. 


158 Siddhanta Darpana 


Notes (1) Outer planets are almost in same 
direction from earth as from sun. Minor correction 
is due to position of sun from earth. 

(2) Inner planets are within a small distance 
from sun which is their average position. First 
correction for their true position, is due to their 
own motion. Hence they are own Sighrocca. 

Verses 10-16 - Slow, fast and reverse motion 
- Planets in successively farther orbits from sun 
are - budha, sukra, mangala, brhaspati and Sani. 
Hence their angular speed appears progressively 
slower from -earth (if linear speed in orbit is 
assumed to be same). 

Like ravi, moon also is rotating round the 
earth, but from very close distance. Hence angular 
speed of moon is largest, though its linear speed 
(in yojanas etc) is small. 

Budha and Sukra are close to ravi, compared 
to earth. Therefore, they are seen with ravi after 
12 raéi (full rotation), as well as, after 6 rasi (half 
rotation). 


Mangala, brhaspati and Sani are farther from 
ravi - compared-to earth. Hence, they appear 
together with ravi at 12 rasi- difference and in 
opposite direection at 6 rasi difference. 


When earth is in one direction of ravi, and 
star planets (tara graha) manyala, budha, guru, 
Sukra and Sani are in opposite direction - then the 
graha appears to move in forward direction (margi 
gati) 

If a tara graha and earth are in the same 
direction of ravi, then the graha appears to move 
in reverse direction (vakri gati) due to difference 
between mean and Sighra speeds. (Figures 7, 8)

position of planet 1 on a point on ecliptic is marked } 
1. Point 1, 2 --- 8 on ecliptic are apparent directions 
of the planets seen in ecliptic after regular intervals. 
Speeds in inner orbits are faster. 


Figure 7 shows that 1,2,3 positions indicate 
forward movement of Budha. After point 3, budha ' 
comes on same side of sun as earth and moves ; 
backwards in positions 4 and 5. Between 5 and 6, 
it is almost stationary before moving forward again j 
to positions 7 and 8. 


Similarly, positions 1 to 5 in figure 8 indicate 
forward motion of mars. At 6, it moves back wards - 
when earth and mars both are on same side of , 
sun. Actually ecliptic circle is at almost infinite | 
distance and position 7 also is in backward direction § 
from 6. But due to small construction of ecliptic it | 
looks forward. From position 8, planet again moves 
forward. 


(2) Fast and slow speeds - Angular speed is-! 
arc length divided by radius in unit time. Hence | 
for same arc length in unit time, angular speed } 
will be less for large radius. Thus farther planets |! 
will look slower. In siddhanta text, this was : 
considered only reason for slow speed. But linear ‘ 
speed also becomes slower as explained by Keplar’s ; 
law (to balance lesser gravitational pull). 


Verses 17-18 - Five tara graha revole round 
the sun at constant distance in east direction. They | 
are attracted by their mandocca and Sighrocca ravi. 
They always’ remain in bha-cakra (ecliptic circle). 


Earth is in centre of bha-cakra, ravi is at the ; 
centre of five tara graha. Hence at full circle (12 :

rasi) or half circle difference, earth is in same line 
as sun and the planet. 


Verse 19-22 : At 3 rasis after cakra or 
cakrardha (90° after 360° or 180° - i.e. 90° or 270°) 
i.e. at the end of odd quadrant, difference between 
planet’s direction and sun’s direction is maximum. 
Hence Sighra paridhi is different at the end of odd 
and even quadrants (0°, 360°). 


Circle of nakéatras (bhakakéa) is 360 times 
away from its centre earth, compared to distance 
of sun’s orbit from earth. 


Division by this ratio (hara) 360 into degrees 
of 1 revolution (360°) we get 1° which is difference 
between Sighra paridhi at the end of odd and even 
quadrants. 


I (author) wil explain the difference between 
nica and ucca paridhi. This can be seen direectly 
by observation, so presumption is not necessary. 


Explainations (1) Difference in sighra paridhi 
at end of odd and even quadrants is due to elliptical 
shape of planetary orbits. The difference depends 
on eccentricity of the orbit. It will be explained 
later on while explaining motion on sighra and 
manda paridhis. 


(2) The assumption is that difference in points 
of observation causes difference in paridhis. At 90° 
or 270° Sighra kendra, difference is maximum due 
to sighra motion. Difference in heliocentric and 
geocentric position will be angle made by rads 
of sun orbit at distance of star circle. Difference of 
1° will be observed from 57.3 times the distance. 
This assumption will be correct if stars orbit is 
considered 60 times away compared to earth’s orbit. 


162 Siddhanta Darpana 


This figure has been accepted by Aryabhata, Surya 
siddhanta and all others. 360 times the distance 
will give less than 1°/6 difference. Reasoning is 
wrong in both ways - about reason of difference 
in sighraparidhi and about the angle of difference. 

(3) Siddhanta darpana has taken sun’s dis- 
tance about 11 times the figure accepted in classical 
siddhantas (based on 72,000 yojana diameter in 
Atharva veda is stead of 6,500 yojana in siddhanta). 
He has increased distance of stars further 6 times. 
Even after increase of about 66 times, it is still 
highly under estimated. Even the nearest star (4.4 
light years) is 2,80,000 times the distance of sun. 
Rohini at 14 lakh. times and svati about 87 lakh 
times the distance are other nearest stars. 


Verses 23-27 - Attraction of ucca - Planets 
starting from ravi (all) are attracted by gods named 
their mandocca by chord of air (invisible force of 
attraction to an imaginary point mandocca). Hence 
true planets (spasta graha) are always deviated 
towards mandocca from their mean position (mad- 
hyama graha). 

Planets with sloW motion of own and attracted 
by their mandocca, also move under influence of 
pravaha from east to west (due to daily motion of 
earth). 


(From Stirya siddhanta) - Planets being always 
(day and night) under attraction of their ucca, move 
in different ways - sometimes east or west. When 
‘ucca is in east semicircle of the planet, ucca pulls , 
the planet towards east. When ucca is in western ; 
semi circle, it pulls towards west. Direction of ucca 
on a circle is always same, but it is called east in 


True Planets 163 


one semi circle and. west in the other. When the 
planets move towards east under attraction of ucca, 
the deviation is positive and in west it is negative. 
(Normal motion of planets relative to stars is 
towards east hence deviation in same east direction 
is added and in opposite direction, substracted.). 


Explaination - (1) Actual orbits of ravi and 
candra are elliptical round the earth (relative motion 
of ravi). In such an orbit earth is not at centre but 
on a focus. Thus centre of planetary motion is 
deviated towards farther end of major axis called 
mandocca. It is called so because at this position 
candra is farthest and hence slowest (ucca and 
manda). To a first approximation mean planet 
moves in a circle round earth at the focus. Next 
approximation assumes motion in an eccentric circle 
with centre at centre of the elliptic orbit.All the 
points of this circle are thus deviated from 
corresponding position of madhya graha towards 
mandocca. Hence mandocca appears to attract the 
planet. More accurately, mandocca doesn’t attract 
because in such case, speed of the planet will be 
increasing in that direction. It should be maximum 
at mandocca. But it is only a deviation or 
displacement towards mandocca. This will be - 
explained _mathematically while computing the 
corrections. 

(2) If we rotate along a circle, after reaching 
mandocca, the movement will be away from it upto 
180° difference. In remaining half it will be towards 
mandocca. Since attraction is always towards 
mandocca, 0° to 180° circle after it is considered 
negative or western deviation. 


164 Siddhanta Darpana { 


Verses 28-33 - Viksepa and pata - Orbit of : 
planets starting from moon (except ravi) are at an | 
angle with the kranti vrtta (i.e. apparent orbit of | 
ravi). It meets kranti vrtta at the points, where the 
circles bisect each other (being great circles of a. 
sphere). Half of the orbit is north of kranti vrtta 
(upward direction of right hand screw rotating in- 
orbit direction). Other half is south. At pata, the ' 
planets are on kranti vrtta; Away from pata they 
are deflected towards north or south slight from 
Kranti vrtta. Hence pata is considered reason of 
north or south deflection called vikSepa (or Sara). 
Sara is distance of perpendicular from graha on 
Kranti vrtta, measured in kala or minutes of angle). 
Foot of perpendicular is manda sphuta graha. 


(From Surya siddhanta) - When planet is 
ahead of its northern pata by 0° to 180°, it is 
deflected northwards. (Hence this pata is called 
northern pata or pata, in short). Then pata is 
behind the graha and called in west. Pata in east 
(or before the graha) deflects it towards south. 


Budha and Sukra revolve with sun (being in 
inner orbit). Their Sighrocca is the planet itself. So 
pata east from Sighrocca causes south Sara. In other 
half of orbit it is north Sara. 


When pata is with graha or 180° away, graha 
is on one of the pata points and hence on the 
kranti vrtta. There is no Sara in that position. When 
difference between planet and pata is 90° or 270° 
(end of odd quadrants), Sara is maximum (parama). 

Mean parama Sara of planets is given below 
(compard with modern values given in introduc- 
tion)

(3) While figures of siddhanta darpana for 
moon and outer planets are very accurate, it looks 
wrong for budha and Sukra compared to modern

heliocentric whereas these are geocentric.

siddhanta darpana. 

Verses 34-41 - Types of planetary motion - 
Motion of planets as seen from earth’s surface is 
called sphutagati. Sphuta gati is of three types - 


True Planets 167 


forward (prak or margi)) gati, reverse (vakri) gati 
and zero motion (Sinya gati). 

Forward motion is of five types, reverse 
motion of two types and one zero speed - these 
are eight types of motions of planets starting from 
mangala (Ravi and candra have no reverse motion). 


From Surya siddhanta - Eight gatis are named 
- 1. Vakra 2. Anuvakra, 3. Vikala, 4. manda, 5. 
mandatara 6. sama, 7. Sighra and 8. Atisighra. 


Reverse motion starts reducing in later half, 
it is called vakra. At the start of reverse motion it 
is increasing. Then it is called anuvakra. 


When forward motion is less than mean speed 
and is still decreasing, it is called mandatara,.when 
it is increasing, it is called manda. 


Spasta gati equal to mean speed is called sama. 
Spasta gati more than mean speed and still 
increasing is called sighratara. When decreasing it 
is called sighra. 


Ravi and candra are affected only by mandoc- 
ca (not gighrocca). They have only five types of 
speeds - 1. manda, 2. mandatara, 3. sama, 4. Sighra 
and 5. sighratara. Their meanings are explained 
above ; 


Verse 42 - Sphuta method - (From strya 
siddhanta) Now, I tell will respect, the method of 
making a graha sphuta by calculation, where mean 
Planets arrive due to 8 types of speeds at the 
Observed place. (drk-tulyata = calculation equal to 

. observation). 


Verses 43-46 - Explaination of arc and its sine 
~ Now, I tell the method of calculating sime and 


168 . Siddhanta Darpana ; 


arc, which is used in many sciences and by . 
knowing which, Peon get the title of acarya . 
(doctorate). 


As a cloth is interspersed with threads, a pola : 
(sphere or its circles) is also mixed up with sines 
and versed sines. (sine can be found between any | 
two points of a sphere or circle and hence they ~ 
are infinite in number). 


To find the sine (jya) of a radius inclined with 
starting radius at 0°, we make a jya of same arc 
in opposite direction. Graha is on top of jyarddha 
(end of radius vector) with which calculation is 
made. It is also called jya in short. Half part of a - 
circle or full revolution (bhacakra) looks like a bow 
(capa). The bisecting line of circle passes through 
its centre and is called diameter (vydsa). 


Verses 47-54 - Method of Calculating sines - 
For 3 rasi (90°)jya, Kotijya have extreme values. 
Jya of 3 rasi passes through centre and is equal to 
radius. Then it has greatest value, Kotijya is 
distance of this jya from centre and is 0 here (for 
90°). 

96th part of a circumference is very small and 
almost a straight line. Hence it is almost equal to 
its jya. Thus 1/8 part of a rasi lipta (1800) i.e. 1/96 
of circle is 225 and is equal to first jya. 

First jya is first khandantara (difference) (i.e. 
Jya of 225’ - jya of 0’). To find the second 
Khandantara (2nd jya - Ist jya), Ist jya is divided 
by itself and result (1) is deducted from Ist jya. 


225 


(225 — 395 ~ 224). Result is 2nd khandantara. 


Add 2nd khandantara in Ist jya to get the - 
2nd jya (i.e. sine of 2x225’ arc). 2nd jya is again 


True Planets _ 169 


- divided by Ist khandantara. If remainder is more 
than half of 225 then it is ommitted. Quotient 
deducted from 2nd khandantara gives 3rd 
khandantara. 
3rd Khandantara addeed to 2nd jya, we get 
the 3rd jya. Similarly jya pinda (quantity) is divided 
by Ist jya and substracted from its khandantara to 
ive next khandantara. This way we get the jya 
of Ist to 24th jya pinda in lipta. In dividing 
6,7,12,15,17,20,21 jya pinda, reemainder is more 
than half of divider 225. But we still omit it without 
adding 1 to quotient because Brahma had told so 
to Narada. 


Notes : (1) Narada Purana also gives a 
complete summary of astronomy and astrology. In 
the chapter describing calculation of sines, no such 
explaination from Brahma has been given as stated 
here. However, the stated values have been given 
which means the same thing. There is no dialogue 
from Brahma in the chapter, but he is considered 
original source of the knowledge. 


(2) Increase in sines is proportional to its 
a} 
‘differential coefficient thus ax (sin x) = cos x is 
Proportional to Ist difference (khandantara) Change

Here jya = R sin x where R is radius equal 
to 3438 kala. ,

Aryabhata has indicated the geometrical 
method for finding sines for 12 divisions of a right

In odd quadrant (visama pada), jyaof passed

In even (sama) quadrant, remaining arc gives bhuja 
jya, and passed arc gives kotijya. (Quotation of 
Surya siddhanta ends with verse: 68). 

This means that if’ the kendra (manda or 
Sighra) is less than 3 raéi (90° ), then its jya is bhuja 
Jya. If it is between 3 to 6 raéi, then it is substraeted 
from 6 raéi, Jya of the balance arc is bhuja jya.

rasi from kendra. Jya of the balance ‘arc is bhuja_ 
_jya. If kendra is between 9 to 12 raéi, it-is deducted . 
from 12 raéi. Jya of balance arc is bhuja jya. If the 
quantity, from which deduction is to be done is: 
smaller, then 1 rotation of 12 raéi (360°) is added.

Mandocca of mangala, budha and éani and 
sighrocca) of budha move both forward and ~ 
backwards as observed by me (author). To find 
their true motion another entity (devata) called 
‘Parocca’ has. been assumed which affects these 
points (verse 76). 


Parocca of mangala (its ‘ainapeen | is at 6 raéi 
(180°) difference from madhyama sirya. Parocca of 
budha mandocca is its sighrocca. Likewise, man- 
docca of budha is parocca of budha’s Sighrocca. © 


Parocca of Sani’s mandocca lies at 18° less 
from madhyama Sani. Parocca also is an invisible 
form of Kala like mandocca. 


Similarly there are many small planets in the 
sky. Around planets, satelites move in circular 
orbits. Motion of these small planets and satellites 
can be seen only with instruments (telescope). They . 
also move from west to east. They have not been. 
described in Brahma and strya siddhanta, hence 

they are not been explained here. 


190 Siddhanta Darpana 


Substract parocca from sighrocca and mandoc- 
ca of budha and from mandocca of Sani. R sine 
of the resulting angle is multiplied by 680 for budha 
and by 300 for Sani. Product is divided by radius 
(3438). Result will be in lipta. If Para kendra 
(distance of manda or Sighra- from Parocca) is . 
between 0° to 180°, it is added in mandocca and 
for 180° to 360°, it is substracted. For sighrocca of 
budha, its opposite procedure is followed (substrac- 
tion for parakendra in 0° to 180° and addition 
other wise. 


If sighra kendra of mangala is in six rasi’s 
starting from makara (i.e. from 279° to 90°, then 
sphuta sanskara is not needed for its mandocca. 
If sighra kendra is in six rasis beginning with karka 
(i.e. 90° to 270°) then mean mandocca will be | 
corrected to find the true value. Mandocca of 
mangala for previous year (almost same for current 
year) is substracted from its parocca (mean sun: + 
180°). Result is its para-kendra. R sine of para 
kendra is multiplied by 450 and divided by 3438 
= radius. Result is multiplied by kotijya of first 
sighra kendra in kala and then divided by kala of 
3 rasi (5400). As before, result is added in Ist six 
rasis of para kendra and substracted in other raSis 

. from mandocca of mangala. 


For daily motion of mandocca - Substract 
mandocca from parocca of mangala (i.e. 180° + 
mean sun). Its kotijya is multiplied by 450 and 
divided by radius (3438). This will be kotiphala for 
correction of‘mandocca speed. If parakendra is in 
0° to 180°, kotiphala is added to Sighra kotijya and 
substracted for parakendra between 180° to 360°. 
Result is multiplied by mean daily motion of sun 


True Planets 191 


and divided by radius (3438). Result will be daily 
motion of mangala mandocca due to its parocca. 


Similarly for Sani, find kotijya of its difference 
of parocca and mandocca. Multiply it by 300 and 
divide by radius 3438. Result is kotiphala: for 
correction. Kotiphala is multiphed by mean daily 
motion of Sani and divided by radius 3438. This 
will be daily motion of Sani mandocca as corrected 
for its parocca effect. 


For budha, Kotijya of its para. kendra is 
multiplied by 680 and divided by radius 3438. 
Result will be Kotiphala for correction. . Multiply 
this Kotiphala by daily mean motion of budha 
Sighrocca and divide by radius 3438. This will be 
daily motion of true budha Sighrocca. Correction 
in mandocca speed is addition for parocca kendra 
in Ist and 4th quodrant (270°-90°) and otherwise 
deducted. Correction in sighrocca is in opposite 
manner. 


Notes - (1) Author has not given reasons for 
such correction. His mention of observation of small 
planet by telescope indicates that these correction 
are based on some modern charts like Le - verrier’s 
chart of 1850 or some nautical almanc available in 
his time.’He has clearly mentioned that these have 
not been discussed in other siddhantas which 
indicates his corrections are adopted from some 
almanc or results of telescopic observation. 


(2) It is difficult to guess as to. what correction 
was sought to be achieved by these methods. 
However, mathematical form of these formula will 
indicate the reasons of these corrections.

When S Km is between 270° to 90°, no 
correction is required. Correction to. mandocca is 
done only when S Km is between 90° to 270° i.e. 
earth is on same side of sun as mangala.

(3) Reason and assumptions of these correc4 
tions - 

(a) Sani mandocca motion - Motion of Sari 
mandocca cannot be observed in a life time or every 
in a thousand years because it rotates only 39 times$ 

‘in a kalpa. Hence it is not oscillatory motion off 
mandocca which could be observed by the author 
This appears to be correction due to effect of guru’g! 
attraction on Sani motion. At the time epoch of 
his observation after 1869 AD, guru was behind 
’ Sani for 5-6 years. Hence parocca of Sani has beert 
assumed to be slightly less (18°) than mean gani-4 
‘(b) Mangala is corrected, only when it iq 
influenced by earth when both are on same sida 
of sun. Hence this correction in mandocca is tai 
account for influence of earth. 4 
(c) Correction in gighrocca and mandocca of 

. Budha is to make correction of elliptic orbit of 
Budha éighra (i.e. _Budha itself) and its high 
'. inclination with sun’s ecliptic; 7° as seen from sung 


True Planets 195 


These are reasonable assumptions of the 
origin. It needs further research and verification. 
But obviously, these corrections tallied with obser- 
vations in author’s time. 


Verses 90-103 - Manda and Sighra Paridhi - 
For any planet, attraction by its mandocca is 
multiplied by kala of a circle (21,600) and divided 
‘by radius (3438). Result is manda paridhi. Maxi- 
mum mandaphala varies with manda paridhi. (90). 

Sighra paridhi of mangala, guru and éani is 
more in even quadrants compared to odd quadrants 
end. For budha and Sukra it is opposite. (91) 

According to Surya siddhanta - Manda paridhi 
of ravi is 14° in even quadrant and 13°40’ in odd 
end. Similarly, mandapraidhi of candra is 32° in 
even quadrant and 20’ less in odd quadrant i.e. 
31°40’. (92) 

According to Siddhanta Siromani of 
Bhaskaracaérya, mandaparidhis of ravi and candra 
are constant and are 13°40’ and 31°16’ respectively. 
(93) 

I (author) have calculated the values of manda 
paridhis of ravi and candra by observing conjunc- 
tion of moon with stars and difference in rasi of 
moon and sun (phases of moon) (94) 

In odd quadrants, mandaparidhi of sun is 
12°6’ and of candra is 31°30’ (95) 

If manda kendra is at end of 4th quadrant, 
Mandaparidhi of ravi is 11°30’. Now, method for 


oo manda paridhi at other places is being told 


196 


Multiply kotijya of ravi manda kendra by 6 
and divide by radius (3438). Result will be in kala 
etc. If manda kendra is in Ist or 4th quadrant, 
substract this result from 18’ kala. At other 
positions this will be added to 18’ kala. (97) 


Either of the results is multiplied by R cos of 
manda kendra (kotijya) and divided by radius 
(R=3438). Result in kala etc. will be substracted 
from manda paridhi at end of odd quadrant (12°6’), 
when manda kendra is in 2nd or 4th quadrant. In 
other quadrants it is added (98) 


This method is adopted for accurate calcula- 
tion. For rough work, 1/9th part of previous result 
is added. This will give accurate results only on 
parva sandhi (Pirnima or amavasyé). 

Kotijya of candra manda kendra (R cosine) is 
multiplied by 30 and divided by radius (3438). 
Result in Kala etc is added to the manda paridhi 
at end of odd quadrants (31°30), when manda 
kendra is in six rasis starting from karka. In other 
positions, it is substracted to find sphuta manda 
paridhi. 

Manda paridhis of planets are - mangala 69° 
budha 27°, guru 34°30’ Sukra 12° and Sani 39°

quadrants are -

Notes (1) Mandaparidhi is correction method 
for elliptical orbit which have been assumed circular 
for first approximation. 


(2) Sun and moon are directly in an ellipse 
around earth. But other planets take their position 
as a result of two orbits -- orbit of sun around 
earth (apparent) and orbit of planet round sun. 
Correction from mean position due to smaller of 
these orbits is done through Sighra paridhi. 


(3) The method of correction by manda and 
Sighra paridhis will be explained after calculation 
of these for tara grahas. 


Verses 104 to 112 - Sphuta manda and Sighra 
paridhis for tara grahas - Difference (of 1°) between 
sighra paridhis at the end of odd and even 
quadrants is multiplied by bhuja jya of Ssighra 
kendra and divided by radius (3438) i.e. multiplied 
by sine of sighra kendra. 


This result is added to the sighra paridhi at 
end of previous quadrant, if it is rising in current 
quadrant. Otherwise, it is substracted. 


For more accurate value of sphuta Sighra 
paridhi of mangala, we add 1/30 part of bhuja kala 
of Sighra kendra (i.e. R sine of sighra kendra is 
Minutes). 


Manda paridhi of mangala is 69° only at the 
end of quadrant. To find the intermediate values, 
we select the lesser part of manda kendra - amcng 
lapsed part and remaining part in the quadrant. R 
Sine of that angle is multiplied by 8° when manda 
kendra is in six raéis starting from karka, or by 4° 
when manda kendra is in 6 raéis starting from 
Makara. Result is divided by R sine of 1-1/2°raéi 


ee -—— Siddhanta Darpana’? 
(45°) = 2431. .Result is converted to degrees etc’! 


and added to 69°. which gives sphuta manda® 
paridhi of mangala (at any place). bs 
When manda kendra of mangala is between ‘ 
4868’ and (4868’ + 1590’) or between (15,142’) andi 
(15,142’+1590’), its mandaparidhi is taken as equal{ 
to its mandaphala of 3 raéi i.e. 11°2’47”. a 
. We find the lesser of lapsed and remaining’ 

parts in quadrant.of Budha manda kendra. Its R™ 
sine (jya) is divided by 9 and result is substracted | 
from manda paridhi (27°). We get sphuta manda” 
paridhi. o . = a 
R sine of Sukra manda kendra is multiplied’ 
by 2 and divided by radius R = 3438. Result inj

find its sphuta value. . 4

Circular orbit by distance ae in direction of major

small circle whose centre is on madhya graha. The : 
circle is called manda paridhi (epiciycle) which ; 
rotates fixed with radius vector of mean planet. ' 
However, movement of spasta graha on manda‘ 
paridhi is in opposite direction to the motion of : 
madhya graha but with equal angular speed. At | 
apogee position in Fig 14, mean graha is at U and ' 
true graha is at U; in same direction, When mean.

the constructions are equivalent.

Like correction of elliptic orbit through manda,

204 Siddhanta Darpana 


It is to be proved that Sighra kendra is same 
as heliocentric anomady and Sighra phala is 
conversion from heliocentric to geocentric position. 
This will show correctness of Sighraparidhi method. 


Figures 16 and 17 show the anomalies with 
sun as centre. First figure is for inner planets venus 
and mercury, ‘marked as V. Second figure is for 
superior planets mars, jupiter and saturn, marked

Verses 113 to 120 - Bhuja and koti phala and 
karna 

According to siirya siddhanta, sphuta manda 
paridhi multiplied by R sin of bhuja of manda 
kendra and divided by 360° gives bhuja phala. 
When this paridhi is multiplied by kotijya (R cosine) 
of bhuja and divided by 360° it gives kotiphala. 
(113) 

When arc is smaller than 225’, it is same as 
its R sine (jya). Then arc or R sine need not be 
converted to each other. (They are taken equal). 
Only when arc is more than 225’, its sine is to be 
calculated. 


According to siirya siddhanta, Sighra kotiphala 
is added to trijya (3438) when sighra kendra is in 
six ragsis beginning with makara (i.e. 270° to 90°). 
For other sighra kendras (i.e. 90° to 270°) it is 
Substracted from trijya. 


This is kotija bhujaphala, used for correction 
of radius and should not be considered an arc. 


In siirya siddhanta - Squares of bhuja and 
koti phala are added and square root of sum is 
taken. Then we get éighra karna. Bhuja phala 
multiplied by trijyd (3438) and divided by sighra 
arna gives Sighraphala in minutes of arc. Sighra 


208 Siddhanta Darpana 
phala is used for first and fourth corrections of 
five star planets starting from mangala. Sun and’ 
moon become spasta with only one correction with 
mandaphala. But in five tara grahas, sighra phala 
correction is done at first, then mandaphala 
correction is done twice. At fourth step, Sighra 
phala correction is done again. When sighra kendra 
or manda kendra is less than 6 raéi, sighra or 
manda phala is positive, hence always added for 
correction. When kendra is more than 6 raéi, pheala 
is substracted.

Verses 121 - 123 - Correction in madhya tara 
aha— Madhya graha corrected by half of sighra 
phala (addition or substraction) gives first graha 
(corrected). Manda kendra is calculated for first 
graha and half of its mandaphala correction gives 
second graha. Manda kendra is again calculated 
for second graha. Its correction by mandaphala 
(full) gives third graha. For third graha, Sighra 
kendra and sighra phala is calculated. On correction 
of third by this Sighraphala, we get fourth graha 
which is the true position of planet (spasta graha).

(3) Further explaination of variations in manda. 
and éighra paridhi. (In continuation of note 2 after,

Thus e = Ren R 2Pprox, n very small.

It is also given by e = a

Thus approximately, e = = = y 2n 


R 
or m = V2nR 
2 
m 
orn= 3p ,m= eR 


This gives method of calculating maximum 
manda pardhi and its correction term For sun, 
max. paridhi is 14° (= 2 mm) and max correction 


is 20’ (= 27n) 
e = Vm = 0,043 
R 
_m 
e = & = 0.039 


This is similar by both method. Thus correc- 
tion depends on value of max manda paridhi. 


(4) Reasons for starting correction with sighra 
phala - Mandaparidhi is measure of eccentricity of 
orbit (e=mV/R) which is very small and Jess than 
1/50. Shighra paridhi is ratio of smaller orbit to 
bigger orbit among the orbits of earth and planet 
round the sun. This varies from WU? to 3/4 
approximately. Hence at first step manda correction 
can be neglected and only Sighra correction in 
done. 


For inferior planets manda correction also is 
done in sun’s orbit, not in the orbit of planets. 
Hence alternatively, manda correction can be dong 
before gighra as stated by Aryabhata and Bhaskaral. 

We do not calculate manda or Sighra kendra 
from true planet, but from mean planet which is 
an approximation. Hence only half corrections are 
done for gighra and manda in beginning. Prob- 


212 Siddhanta | 


ability of negative or positive error will be both ‘ 
equal in half corrections and are likely to cancel } 
each other. Then manda correction in full gives . 
heliocentric anomaly of the planet - called manda ; 
spasta graha. Its last correction by sighra phala has . 4 
been explained in note (3) after verse 112. 

Since Sighra and manda corrections are com- ; 
parable, their half correction only is taken at a; 
time. After 2nd correction error is reduced and | 
after full manda correction, exact sighra phala can ; 
be determined. 7 

(5) This is a type of calculation based on { 
probabilistic value of errors which is called ‘Monte- | 
Carlo method’ in modern numerical analysis. ; 
Reduction of error at each step is similar to : 


‘iteration method’ for system of non-linear equa- 
tions. : 


O Meo: %

Method of iteration for numerical solution. j 
Solution for y = (x) is its point of intersection .

with line y = x whose slope with x axis is 1. Figure 
19 explains the approximations when slope is 
positive and figure 20 indicates negative slope of 


d® 
y = &&) Slope is ®’ (x) or de’ it is positive when 


function in increasing, negative when it is decreas- 
ing. In both cases its numerical value is less than 
1 i.e. slope of y= x. Only in such case successive 
approximations will reduce the errors at each step. 
For sighra and manda corrections also, the correc- 
tions are much smaller than 1 as explained in 
previous para. 


X» is the first approximation (like madhya 
graha). x1, X2, X3 - - - are next approximations. 
When function (sighra phala or manda phala) is 
increasing, i.e. correction is additive, all the 
approximations are on left side of, or less than 
true value x. When correction is negative, i.e. 
function is decreasing (Fig.10) x1, x2, x3 - - - 
alternate on either side of the true value. 

In both cases, diagram shows that errors 
decrease at each step, which was purpose of our 
corrections. 


(6) Reasons of half corrections in first two 
steps - By full correction we may over correct and 
May not decrease the error which is required for 
iteration. Half correction will always reduce the 
error. Full investigation can be done only, with 
Lyapunov’s conditions of stability. However taking 
half of the approx value of correction, probability 
of positive and negative error both are same and 
it wil be approaching zero in end.

side of true x", there is a point a, for which f(x) 
is — ve and on other side f(b.) is + ve. We take 
midpoint c of interval (ao, bo). If f (c) is negative, 
we make it the new point in place of a, where it 
is negative. Thus we go on dividing the interval 
for better approximations. 


Verses 124-131 - Special correction for 
mangala and budha - For mangala, 3rd and 4th 
phalas in kala are muthplied and divided by 10. . 
Result is substracted from last karna. 

Then we get result in lipta etc. This result is added 
to 4th (sphuta) graha when manda kendra is 0° 
to 180°, otherwise substracted. If 3rd kendra’ 
(manda) of mangala is from 90° to 270°, 4th phala - 
is substracted from 55, result is multiplied by 
manda koti phala of 3rd operation. This result is 
substracted from 4th karna. This is substracted from ~ 
5th graha, then we get 6th sphuta graha. If manda ; 
kendra of 3rd planet is 270° to 90° then this ; 
correction is unnecessary. (fifth graha will be true). : 

Madhyama budha is substracted from budha - 
Sighrocca, already corrected for parocca. This sighra 
kendra is used to find half of first sighra phala, : 


True Planets 215 


which is kept in Ist sie In 2nd and 3rd places, 
we keep half mandaphala obtained from madhyama 
pudha after 2nd operation coreeen with half 
manda phala). 


At 2nd place, this mandaphala is multiplied 
by half sighra phala at Ist place and divided by 
half of the 4th sighra phala. 1/3 of the result is 
substracted from mandaphala at 3rd place. 


The new manda phala is used to make 3rd 
correction of madhyama budha. From that 4th 
Sighra phala is obtained and kept in 2 places. At 
2nd place it is multiplied by 3rd kotiphala divided 
by radius (3438)). Result is added or substracted 
at Ist place (addition is done when manda kendra 
is 90° to 270°). This sighraphala is used for 4th 
correction. Then we get more correct result com- 
pared to Surya siddhanta. 


Notes : The rules are lengthy and confusing 
when stated in words. 


(1) Rules for mangala - 


Po, Pi, P2, Ps, Ps are the mean planet and the 
planets after Ist, 2nd, 3rd and 4th correction. Si, 
Sa are sighra phala for Ist and 4th corrections, 
when ésighra kendra is calculated for Po and P3. 
M2, M3 are mandaphala for 2nd and 3rd correction 
Where mandaphala is calculated from manda 
kendra of P, and P. 

Thus P; = Po + S:/2 (S & M may be + ve or 
~ ve) 

Po = Pi +32, Pas Pe + Ms, Pa Ps + Se

Verses 132-138 - True speeds of sun and 
moon. 

Now true speed of graha is considered. The 
speed changes every moment, but sphuta gati of 
a day is the difference between sphuta graha on 
two successive days. Strictly this will be average 
daily speed for that day. 

Dainika gati of mandocca, substracted from 
dainika gati of mean graha, gives danika gati of 
manda kendra. Dainika gati of manda kendra 
multiplied by manda kotiphala and divided by 
radius gives manda gatiphala for one day. This is 
added for manda kendra in 6 ragis from karka ; 
in madhya gati of graha. Other wise it is 
substracted from madhya gati. This result will be 
manda sphuta gati for one day i.e. from sunrise 
to the next sunrise. 


At sunrise, difference of true moon and true 
sun gives the balance part of current tithi. This 
(added to sunrise time) gives ending time of tithi. 
At that time true moon is again calculated and 
further correction of tithi end time is done. This 
accuracy in knowing beginning and end of tithi is 
needed only for ascertaining time of eclipse or of 
Sraddha (last rites). For normal works, the ,rue 
Position of sun and moon and their speeds al 
Sunrise will be assumed constant for the day.

Verses 143-150 - Gati phala at four stages for 
tara grahas~ When Sighra sphuta gati is more than 
daily mean motion, then madhyama gati is sub- 
stracted. When daily mean motion is more, sighra 
sphuta is substracted from it. 


When éighra sphuta gati is vakra, it is added 
in daily mean motion. The result in either of three 
cases is called first gati phala whose half is taken. 

When sphuta Sighra gati is more, it is added 
in daily mean motion. When sphuta Sighra gati is 

‘less or vakra, Ist gati phala is substracted (half 
only) from madhya gati. This is Ist corrected gati. 

First gati is forward or reverse. It is multiplied 
by manda kotiphala and divided by trijya. Half of 
the result (2nd gati phala manda) is taken. 

When manda kendra is in 6 raéis starting fom 
karka (90° to 270°), 2nd gatiphala half is added to 
Ist gati otherwise substracted from Ist gati. Result 
will be 2nd gati. 

_ Again’ 2nd gati is multiplied by manda 
kotiphala and divided by trijya (3438) and full result 


=dOmt 


= dm+ 


224 Siddhanta Darpang 


(8rd gatiphala) is used for correcting 2nd gati 
(addition or substraction). Result is 3rd gati. 
Third gati is multiplied by sighra koti phala 
and divided by Sighra karna. Result is 4th gati 
phala, which is used to correct 3rd gati. Then 4th 
gati is the true gati. If 4th gati phala is more than 
sighrocca gati then motion is reverse (vakri gati). 
This method is more correct then siirya siddhanta. 


Verses 151 to 158 - Special methods for true 
speed— When mandocca of mangala, budha or Sani 
is moving forward, its speed is substracted from 
Ist and 2nd gati. If it is vakri (in reverse motion), 
its speed is added. From these corrected, Ist and 
2nd gatis, we find 2nd and 3rd gati. New 2nd and 
3rd gati are substracted from sphuta Sighra gati for 
Ist and 4th gati. 


Fourth gati phala of budha is kept in two 
places. At one place, it is multiplied by manda 
kotiphala and divided by radius (3438). Result is 
added to 4th gati phala in second place, when 
manda kendra is in six raSis starting from karka 
(90° to 270°). Then sphuta gati of budha will be 
more correct. 

If Sighra gati half is vakra, it is added to 
negative mandagati half or difference is taken from 
positive half mandagati: Result will be vakra 
(reverse) gati. Mandagati (2nd or 3rd steps) phalas 
are added in six raSis starting from karka and 
substracted otherwise. 

Many methods of finding true planet from 
mean planet are coming to mind, but these are 


not given here (by author), as they are very 
complicated. 


True Planets . | 225 


Daily true motion is used for finding transition 
time of graha from one rasi to next or in 
conjunction (yuddha) of planets. For ravi and 
candra, method is different. 

Notes : Method for sighragati phala and 
mandagati phale has already been explained. 
Reasons of vakra gati will be explained when its 
starting or ending point are calculated. 

Verses 159-160 - According to Sirya siddhanta 
tara graha becomes vakri when its 4th sighra kendra 
has the given values - 

Mangala 163° Sukra 167° 
Budha 146° Sani 115° 
Guru 126° . 

At 4th sighra kendra obtained by substracting 
these values from 360°, the graha again becomes 
margi. 

Notes (1) Derivation of 4th sighra kendra for 
vakri gati. We assume that heliocentric orbits ‘of

(2) Some observations on sighra phala and 
Sighra gatiphala - 

We have M2 + Ep = S ........ (1) 


Where M2 = Mandasphuta graha, Ea: = Sighra 
Phala, s=sphuta graha. 


Differentiating this 
OM2 + OE, = 0S - - - - (2) 


228 Siddhanta Darpang 


i.e. Mandasphuta gati + Sighra gatiphala 
= spastagati 

(a) Let E, be maximum so that dE = 0, 

then 6M2 = 6S 


This means that when sighra phala is maxi- 
mum for sighra kendra 90° or 270° (Sin is 
maximum) manda sphuta gati is the spasta gati. : 


(b) Planets starts retrograde motion only after 
the spasta gati vanishes i.e. 6M2 + 6E2 = 0 


Taking 6M: to be almost a constant, since’ 
mandagati phala is small, the negative value of. 
6E2 must cancel 6M2. dE2 becomes negative when: 
sighra kendra is between 90° to 180° or 270° to: 
360° when value of sine decreases in value. From 
180° to 270° it is negative, hence its net value; 
increases. Thus the planet will have zero velocity’ 
at two points symmetric to 180° (S’ towards a and; 
b) 


Sypcthiclrteebaieeo, Torcit! 


Thus if retrorade motion starts at 180° - 6 it 
will stop at 180° + @ = 360° - (180°-0), where its: 
velocity becomes 0. 

Keeping earth constant, an inferior planet goes: 
anticlockwise whereas superior planet goes clock-; 
wise which is direction of sun’s motion. ‘

Thus positive velocity at S’ of the planet will 
be equal to its negative or retrograde velocity at 
c. Thus velocities direct or retrograde will always 
be less then S or c at any point between them on 
either side. 
Verse 161-164 : Udaya: (rising) and asta 
(setting) of planets is of two types - practical is 
rough (sthila) and drik siddha is siksma. (accurate) 


The planets set in west when their Sighra 
kendras cross the following values - 


respectively. 


Mangala 332° Sukra 177° 
Budha = 159° Sani 343° 
Guru 346° 
For rising in the east, last sighra kendra is 
Mangala 28° Sukra 183° 
Budha = 201° Sani 17° 
Gum 14° 


For setting in east, Sighra kendra of inferior 
Planets are, Budha 310° Sukra 336° 


230 Siddhanta Darpana 


For rising in west, Sighra kendra are 

Budha 50° and Sukra 24° 

Notes : (1) Rising of a planet means that it 
is above horizon of earth. But tara graha are visible : 


only during night time, so their rising is only seen 
at night. 


Obstruction due to sunrays makes the tara 
grahas invisible during day. When they are away | 
from sun sufficiently, they can be seen. That is 
called heliacal rising or drk siddha udaya. 

(2) Sun’s velocity is greater than superior « 
planets, so sun overtakes them so that they set in - 
west and rise in the east. When these planets are . 
situated within particular limits from the sun, they ; 
will be invisible in the rays of sun. Thus they will : 
be invisible at conjunction with sun and within ’ 
particulars limits from position of sun. The total’: 
difference from sun depneds not only on difference | 
in longitudes, but also on difference in Sara (north 
south distance.) 

The limits of invisible distance from sun, 
depends on their distance from sun and relative 
brilliance. The brilliance also depends on their ; 
phase, i.e. part of illuminated disc facing earth. ;

will be immersed in rays of sun. With increase in 
Ez, Cos Ez will decrease and lesser part of disc will 
be illuminated. Since distance also will decline, 
luminousity will not be affected. (from S’ to a). In 
path acb, planet gains in illumination and distance 
also decreases. Thus superior planets appear more 
and more brilliant when they are retrograding, 
being most brilliant at c. 


Spherical radius of jupiter, saturn and mars 
are in decreasing order, so that they will be visible 
at angular distances in increasing order. Inverse 
square law of reduction in brilliance with distance 
(karna) works but doesn’t counter the effect of 
sizes. Thus sighra kendra of these planets are 14°, 
17°, 28°. In udaydstadhikara, KalarhSa is slightly 
less, because distance will be (Sighra kendra - 
sighra phala.) 

(3) Inferior planets rise heliacally in the east 
after inferior conjunction and then they are 
retrograde. They attain gradually the maximum 
elongation in the east, then direct motion starts. 
When elongation gradually decreases and after 
going ahead of sun, they set in east. Thereafter, 
they heliacally rise in the west. There again, their 
elongation attains a maximum value, after which 
they become retrograde. After crossing sun again 
they gradually set in west and rise in east. (Figure 
18 may be seen). 


When the gighra anomaly of budha and éukra 
are 50° and 24°, their sighra phala will be 13° and 
11°, so that they are the kalaméa i.e. elongation 
from there mean sun. Then, they rise in west, 
being near superior conjunction. When their gighra 
anomalies become 159° and 177°, same sighra phala 


232 


will arise, so that they set. heliacally in the west. 
Then as Sighra kendra attains symmetrical values 
on other side of 180° i.e. (360°-159°) and (360°-177°) 
i.e. 201° and 183°, sighraphala are same, they rise 
in the east. Again, when they obtain sighra kendra 
(360°-50°) and (36°-24") i.e. 310° and 336°, they 
set in the east due to same Sighra phala or kalamSa. 

Verse 165 - Moon sets when it is 11° behind 
sun and rises again when it is 11° ahead of sun. 


Note : This is not related to rising in east or 
west. It is visibility near sun, which starts after 
11° distance from sun. 12° difference from sun 
makes 1 tithi (in 360° difference there are 30 tithis 
15 in bright half and 15 in dark half). Thus in 
amavasya, moon is not visible. It is again visible 
slightly before 2nd day of bright half (12° advance 
of sun). Thus start of ‘duja’ in muslim calender is 
counted from sighting of moon. 

Verse 166 : To find mean planet knowing the 
true. 

Assume the true planet to be the mean; 
compute the manda and Sighra phala and .apply 
them inversely. We have approximation of the 
mean planet. Treating this as mean planet, again 
obtain manda and Sighra phala and apply them 
inversely. The process is repeated, till constant 
values are obtained. 

Notes : This is method of successive ap- 
proximation 

Verses 167-187 - Use of tables for calculation 
of true planets. 

Calculation of true planets is very long and . 
difficult process and there are chances of error. 


True Planets 233 


Hence I (author), am giving correct Khandaphalas 
in a chart for easy calculation (167.) 


In appendix, there is chart of manda and 
gighra phala, for parts of 0 to 24 (24 parts of a 
quadrant of 90° are 3°45’ each). This contains 
kotiphala of all planets, gatiphala of tara grahas, 
atiphala of ravi and candra, sighra of 48 parts 
(180°), difference of khandaphala, sighra karna in 
lipta (minutes of arc), degrees for cakra entry, 
kranti, Sighra kendra for rising and setting etc 
(170). 

From the values in the chart, manda kendra 
bhujaphala in degrees, minutes, seconds etc are 
separately multiplied by 8, vikala (seconds) etc. are 
divided by 60, when they become degree, they are 
added to the degrees. Total degrees are divided 
by 30 to make rasi. This will be past (gata) phala. 
(172) 

For extra degrees, they are multiplied by 
difference for the khandaphala and divided by 60. 
Result is added to degrees obtained earlier. 
Remainder is multiplied by 2 and added to 
mandaphala khanda. This way, mandaphala of a 
graha is calculated, which is added or substracted 
according to rules earlier explained. 


Manda kendra gati multiplied by difference 
of khandaphala and divided by 225’ (3°45’), is 
manda gati phala between two khandas. (173). * 

In appendix, parocca khandaphala of mangala, 
budha, Sani also have been given. Khandaphala 
difference and ucca gati at end of khanda has also 
been written. From them parocca phala is calculated 
and is added or substracted from manda kendra 


234 Siddhdnta Darpana 


of mangala, budha, Sani or budha Sighrocca, we 
get sphuta gati corrected for parocca. (174) 


Sighra khanda table also is prepared for 48 
parts (khanda of 180° i.e. 1 part of 3°45’. Sighra 
kendra is found by substracting manda sphuta 
graha from Sighrocca. Sighra kendra in 6 raéi’s 
beginning with mesa is caled gata and in 6 raSis . 
beginning with tula it is called gamya. Rasi, degrees 
etc. of kendra are multiplied by 8 and divided by 
60 to get the khanda number (because there are 8 
parts of 3°45’ each in 1 rasi of 30°) as before. 
Khanda phala of completed parts is corrected for 
fraction parts by addition if khanda phala is 
increasing, or by substraction if it is decreasing. 
This is Sighra phala. (176) 

If sighra kendra is in first 6 rasis, khanda 
phala is added (to manda sphuta graha), or in 
other six ragis it is substracted. This way madhyama 
graha is made sphuta by Sighra phala half, half 
mandaphala, full manda phala and full Sighra 
phala. (177) 


For ravi, candra and mangala, manda paridhi 
is different for different quadrants. So their 
mandaphala also has been written for 48 parts of 
180° like sighra phala. For value between two 
khandas, we add fraction of khanda phala dif- 
ference if khanda phala is increasing. It is sub- 
stracted when khanda phala is decreasing. Manda 
phala is never retrograde. (178) 


For manda phala of mangala, there is no need 
of calculation between 22nd and 28th khandas. For 
that interval khanda phala is constant 11°2’47”. 
(174) 


True Planets 235 


Sighra kendra gati is substracted from khanda 
phala and result is divided by 225’. Half of the 
result is added to madhya gati, if Sighra phala is 
increasing. It is substracted, if sighra phala is 
decreasing. We get Ist corrected gati. (180) 

First gati is multiplied by manda _phala 
dfference between two khandas in which 2nd 
manda kendra lies and divided by 225’. Half of 
the result is added to first gati, if manda kendra 
is betwen 90° to 270°, otherwise it is substracted. 
We get second gati. (181) 

2nd gati is multiplied by manda _ phala 
difference for 2nd graha and divided by 225. Result 
is added or substracted from second gati to get 
third gati sighra. (182) 

3rd gati substracted from sighrocca gati gives 
fourth Sighra kendra gati. This is multiplied by 
khanda phala difference of 3rd graha (manda 
sphuta) and divided by 225’. Result is added to 
3rd gati, if Sighra kendra is in 90° to 270°, otherwise 
substracted. We get spasta daily gati. If it is 
negative, graha is vakri (retrograde). (183) 

For mangala, budha and Sani, vakra mandocca 
gati is added to Ist and 2nd gati and méargi 
mandocca gati is substracted to find the kendragati 
from mandocca. Mandaphala of this manda kendra 
is found for second and 3rd gati. sighra. , (184) 

If margi (forward) mandocca gati is more than 
first gati, then first gati is substracted. From 
remainder second gati will be calculated. Similar 
method is used for finding 3rd gati. Gatiphala is 
corrected in reverse manner i.e. substracted for 


236 Siddhanta Darpana 


manda kendra between 90° to 270° and added for 
other values. (185) 


This way we get second and third gati of the 
three planets mangala, budha and Sani. (186) 


If Ist gati of budha and Sani is vakra and less 
than mandocca gati, then it is substracted to get 
second gati. If vakra gati is more, mandocca gati 
is substracted from it but mandagati phala is added 
or substracted in opposite order. (187) 


Verse 188 - If in chart of khanda phala, some 
khanda phala is missing or unclear, then its khanda 
number is multiplied by 225’ and for kendra of 
that kala, we find bhuja and bhuja koti. 

Verses 189-191 - Difference from sphuta stirya 
in degrees is given at which a graha sets due to 
sun rays 

Vakri Sukra 7°, Sukra (margi) 9° 

Guru 10°, Chandra 11° 

Budha 12°, Sani 14°, Mangala 16° 


These values in degree are multiplied by 1800 
and divided by rising time of the rasi in which 
Sayana sun is situated. This will be kSetramSa. If 
it is in west, then 6 raSi is added to the result. 
Then ksetranga is substracted from (sayana sun + 
6 rasi.) 

When mangala, guru and Sani are less than 
ravi by at least the ksehansa, they rise in east 
before sunrise. When they are ahead of sun by 
kSetramsa, they set in west after sun. (Thus they 
are visible only in night). When vakri budha and 
sukra are behind ravi by this kSetranga, they set 
in east and when ahead of ravi, they rise in west. 


True Planets 237 


(Just before sun rise, since sun is coming upon 
horizon, they go down being vakri. During night, 
they are visible when sufficiently away). Similarly, 
_they rise in west just after sun set when vakri). 

Notes : (1) Rising times of raSis is explained 
in Triprasnadhikara. Briefly, rasis rise in different 
time because it is oblique with equator (23-1/2)°). 
At places farther from equator, obliquity rises and 
difference in rising time of rasis increases. This 
calculation is done for sayana surya, because strrya 
goes on equator when sayana surya is at 0° or 
180°. Roughly the planets are assumed in same 
plane as sun, as their inclinations to ecliptic are 
very small. So rising time for their difference along 
ecliptic will be same as rising time of sayana sun 
for that rasi. Since rising time is given for 1 raéi 
of 1800 kala in asu, equivalent difference on ecliptic 
is given by multiplying given degrees (kalamSa) by 
1800 and divided by rising time of raéi. 

This is almost same as kalamSa, being its 
projection on ecliptic. 

(2) When planets are behind sun, they nse 
before sun in east, if difference is more than 
kalaméa. Being behind, earth horizon in east meets 
them after wards. Vakri budha and éukra have 
already been explained. 


Verses 192-193 : Finding time of udaya or asta 


From the kalaméa given we can calculate the 
time in days since when graha has set or risen 
(heliacally). If their difference with sun is more 
than Kalaméga, the planet has already risen or set. 
If it is less than kalaméa, the time to reach kalaméa 


238 Siddhanta Darpana 


can be calculated, which will be days after which 
planet will rise or set. 


(Difference of planet and sun - kalam§a) is 
divided by difference in speeds of sun and the 
planet. The no. of days will be found since when 
planet is rising (or setting) or after which it will 
rise again. 

Verse 194 : Start and end time of rising and 
setting of planets should be written in the practical 
calender, because it is very difficult to find it by 
drk karma. 


Verse 195 : In appendix, khandaphala and 
their differences are given. Similarly differences of 
gati phala, and karna (in kala) also should be 
calculated and written. Sighrakarna, gati and 
sphuta positions etc will be found by values given 
for places just before the given position. Difference 
of phala is to be added or substracted when the 
value (phala) is increasing or decreasing. 


. Verse 196 : Frequency for finding true 
positions - Sun and moon should be made sphuta 
every day at sunrise time. At end of a pakSha, all 
graha should be made sphuta. Budha should be 
made sphuta in middle of paksa also (i.e. every 
week). When a planet becomes margi from vakri 
or vice versa, or changing from one raéi, nak§atra 
.to another, or start of rising time or setting should 
be calculated more accurately by method of 
successive approximations. 

Verse 197 - There are 200 kala (minutes of 
arc) in a quarter of a nakSatra, 800 kala in a nakSatra 
and 1800 kalas in a raési. To find the days since. 
when the graha is in a particular rasi, nakSatra or 


True Planets 239 


quarter of a nakSatra, we take the difference of 
ragi etc of graha and the rasi etc of the beginnig 
of rasi, naksatra or its quarter. The difference is 
divided by sphuta gati kala. Result will be days 
etc since when the graha had entered that raéi etc. 
When graha is less than raéi of nakSatra etc, the 
reverse difference will be divided by sphuta gati. 
Result time in days etc. will give the period after 
which graha will enter that nakéatra etc. When 
graha is vakri, opposite process will be done. 

Notes : (1) Ecliptic of 360° has been divided 
into 12 rasis and 27 nakéatra of equal interval. 
Hence 

1 rasi = 30° = 1800’ Kala 

1 nakSatra = 13°20’ = 800’ kala 

-1 nakSatra quarter (1/4 or pada) = 3°20’ = 200’ 
kala 

(2) Rasi’s starting from 0° of ecliptic are 

(1) mesa (2) vrsa (3) mithuna (4) karka (5) 
simha (6) kanya (7) tula (8) vrscika (9) dhanu (10) 
makara (11) kumbha and (12) mina 

NakSatras starting from 0° of ecliptic are 

(1) aSvini (2) bharani (3) krttika (4) rohini (5) 
mrgasira (6) ardra (7) punarvasu (8) pusya (9) aSlesa 
(10) magha (11) parva phalguni (12) uttara phalguni 
(13) hasta (14) citra (15) svati (16) visakha (17) 
anuradha (18) jyestha (19) mula (20) purva asadha

$atabhis . (25) parva bhadrapada (26) uttara 
bhadrapada (27) revati. 

(3) Within a raSi or nakSatra a graha can be 
assumed to have the same true motion hence the 
formula uses the relation— 


240 Siddhanta Darpana 3 
4 


Distance in kala = days X speed per day in 
kala. 

(4) Candra moves faster and position of candra _ 
and sun are to be known accurately for start of } 
day, tithi etc. Hence they are to be calculated each ,; 
day. Other planets are not so important so they : 
can be calculated each pakSa (fortnight). Budha~ 
moves faster, hence its calculation should be done « 
twice in a fortnight. 

(5) For change of vakri or margi gati or rising : 
or setting times, the speeds change within a day , 
also. Hence calculation needs to be made accurate { 
by method of successive approximation. 


Verse 198 : Dainika spasta gati of a graha { 
can be found roughly by taking difference of spasta i 
graha at beginning and end of the pakéa (fortnight) | 
and dividing it by number of days in it (round : 
figure of 14 or 15 when days are counted from } 
sunrise to sunrise) Difference between spasta graha ; 4 
on two successive days at sunrise is more accurate; 
dainika gati which is useful for calculation. Both 

differ very little, so very little error is made if we 

take average daily speed for a pakSa. If the two: 
are different, then method of successive approxima- { 
tion is used. 


Verse 199 - Fourth sighra kendra is calculated } 
at the end of every pakSa. As already stated, sighra} 
kendra of graha for which it becomes margi 9) 
vakri, its rising and setting has been given in, 
appendix. To find the position of Sighra kendra at? 
any time between pakSa ends, divide the difference. 
beetween values at end with days of pakéa and, 
add them proporitionately for the time passed. 


True Planets . 241 


Verse 200 : 21,600 kala divided by 30, 27, 12, 
27 and 60 gives measures of tithi, nakSatra, raéi, 
yoga and karana, i.e. 720, 800, 1800, 800 and 360 
alas. 

Notes : (1) Tithi, nakSatra, yoga, karana and 
vara are five parts of a calender - hence it is called 
paficanga. Vara is successive counting for days 
starting from sunrise, hence no calculation is- 
needed. : 

(2) Definitions - ’rasi’ is 30° part of the ecliptic 
where planets move. Rasi of a planet means its 
completed rasis from 0° of ecliptic as well as 
degrees, minutes, seconds, lapsed in the current 
rasi. Though it is not part of paficanga, it is used 
to calculate all other parts. 

NakSatra is found by dividing ecliptic into .27 
equal divisions of 13°20’ each (total 360° = 27 X 
13°20’) Each part is nakSatra. ‘NakSatra’ mentioned 
in pancanga means the nakSatra which is occupied 
by moon at a particular time. 


1 
Tithi is 30% part of a lunar synodic month, 


i.e. the time when moon goes one. circle more than 
sun. It is measured usually from the time when 
sun are moon are together, i.e. difference between 
their rasi is 0°. That is start of first tithi called — 
amavasya, i.e. when sun and moon live (vasa) | 
together (ama = amity = closeness) Month can also 
be counted from time when sun and moon are in 
Opposition (i.e. 180° away) Then full moon is seen, 
so that is end of purnima tithi. The two systems 
of lunar month are called amanta (ending with 
anavasya) or purnanta (ending with pimimé). 


242 Siddhanta Darpana 


Tithis are not counted serially from one to 30 in 
lunar month. They are counted from 1 in each half 
(Sukla = bright and krsna = dark) In Sukla pakéa 
last tithi is written 15 and in krsna pakéa it is | 
written 30 (denotin, end of month). © 

Since 360° difference between moon and sun . 
causes 30 tithis, 1 tithis is result of 12° difference. . 
Thus difference of 0° to 12° is Ist tithi in Sukla . 
pakSa after amavasya, 12° to 24°, 2nd tithi etc. . 
upto 180° the pakéa will be Sukla pakéa with 15 
tithis. Between 180° to 360° difference it will be. 
krsna paksa with 15 tithis. Thus the number of 
complted tithis 

_ Moon — sun

Fraction will. give the part elapsed in the 
current tithi which is next after completed tithi. — 

When the quotient is more than 15, than 15 - 
is substracted to know tithi of krsna pakéa. 

Karana is half part of tithi, caused by 6°. 
difference between moon and sun. Thus completed . 
karana since amavasya end 
Moon — sun 

. 6° : } 

These are not counted from 1 to 60 in a. 
month, but there is rotation of 7 karanas like 7 - 
week days, 8 times:in a month and 4 remaining . 
karanas are given separate names fixed at both : 
ends of a month. This is explained later in detail. 

Karana and tithi both indicate the phase of’ 
moon, i.e. the . fraction of its disc which is - 
iuminated. Nakéatra and rasi of moon (or any 


True. Planets 243 


other planet) can also be physically seen. But yoga 
is not a physical quantity. It is only a mathematical 
function given by sum of raéi etc of moon and 
sun (for tithi and karana, their difference had been 
taken). However, one full revolution of moon + 
sun is not divided into 30 parts like a tithi, but 
in 27 parts only like a nakéatra. Thus for each 
increase in sum of moon and sun by 13°20’ one 
yoga passes. Thus number of completed yogas 
counted from time when sun of moon + sun was 
360° or 0° is 

Moon + sun 

13° 20’ 
_ List of yoga is given later. 3 . 

(3) In a full circle there are 21,600 lipta or 
kala. Hence measure of nakéatra etc is found by 
their total number in circle by which 21,600 is 
divided. . 


Verse 201-202 - Calculation of tithi - 
Time lapsed (gata kala) and remaining time 
(gamya kala) of the current tithi is found by 
dividing difference of moon and sun in kala by 
720 kalas. Remainder is converted to vikala (on 
multiplication by 60). This will give gata kala. 
Dainika gati of ravi and candra is found by 
difference of current day and next day’s position. 
Gata or gamya tithi is divided by difference tof. 
dainika gati of moon and sun. This will give value 
in danda etc. (when gata tithi was in vikala), This 
18 rough approximation, sufficient for normal work. 
1 this we have used dainika gati for 1 savana 
dina in stead of gati in 1 tithi. If further accuracy 


244 Siddhanta Darpana 4 


is needed, we find gati of a tithi from dainika gati : 
and ravi, candra are further corrected. : 

Verse, 203 - Lapsed or remaining time in raési : 
or nakéatra —~ Sphuta kendra is converted to kalas . 
and divided by 800. Quotient will be number of : 
past (gata) nakSatras counted from aégvini. By » 
adding 1, we get the number of current nakSatra. . 
Remainder is the lapsed part (in kala) of the current 
nakSatra. Substracting this from 800’ we get. 
remaining part. It is multiplied by 60 to make vikala 
and divided by dainika gati (in kala). This will give - 
lapsed (or remaining) time of nakSatra in danda 
etc. 


Sphuta .candra converted to kala and divided 
by 1800 kala in a rasi gives number of completed 
rasis. By adding 1 to quotient we get the number 
of current rasi, counted from mesa. Remainder will 
be lapsed part (in kala) of the current rai). It is | 
substracted from 1800’ to give remaining (gamya) ~ 
part. Gata or gamya part is converted to vikala by * 
multiplying with 60 and dividing by spasta dainika 
gati of candra. We get gata or gamya kala of the 
current rasi in danda etc. 

Note - Gata or gamya part (in kala) == x = 60 x vikala. 


Dainika gati = Difference in position in 1 day = = 
Hence S12 pat__x kal x day = 60x danda 


gati Kala/day 
Hence n is converted to vikala before division by gati. 


Verse 204 — Calculation of yoga 
Add the raéi of sphuta candra and sirya. If

it is more then 12 raSi’s, substract 12 rasi from the

True Planets 245 


no. of kal4 in a yoga. Quotient will be number of 
completed yoga counted from viskumbha. Add 1 
to it, we get number of current yoga. Remainder 
gives part of yoga lapsed in kala. By substracting 
it from 800’, we get remaining part of current yoga. 
Gata or gamya kala is multiplied by 60 to make it 
vikala and divided by sum of dainika gati of sun 
and moon. We get gata (or gamya) time in danda 
etc.

Verse 205 - Calculation of karana 


Add 360 kala to spasta ravi in kala. Deduct 
the sum from sphuta candra in kala. Divide the 
difference 360 i.e. no. of kala in a karana. Quotient 
is divided by 7. Remainder is number of completed 
karana. By adding, we get the current karana. 
Karana starts from second half of sukla Ist day 
with ‘Bava’. After end of seventh karana, again 
first karana ‘bava’ starts. In 30 tithis of candramdasa, 
there are 60 karanas. 7 Karanas are repeated 8 
times. Remaining 4 karanas are fixed (sthira) wHich 
are gakuni, naga, catuspada and kinstughna. 

Note : (1) Moving karanas start after Ist half 
of Ist tithi (Sukra Ist tithi) has already passed. 
Hence 360 kala is added to ravi so that in difference 
from moon, 1 karana is deducted. 


246 


(2) Seven moving karanas (chala karana) are , 
- (1) bava, (2) balava (3) kaustubha (4) taitila (5) ” 
gara (6) vanija (7) visti or bhadra. Last karana is - 
considered inauspicious for good work. Similarly 
sunday was not supposed a day for doing work 
out of seven week days. 


(2) Sthira karanas Sakuni, naga, catuspada and 
kinstughna start from krsna 14th second half, 30th 
(15th krsna both halves) and sukla Ist tithi. 

(3) In vedanga jyotisa, 11 karana or half days 
were deducted from solar half year (equinox to 
next eqinnox in opposite direction) to make it equal 
to lunar month. 371 tithis in a solar year are 
divisible by 7, though 365 days are not divisible, 
hence fraction of weeks remain. Similarly in half 
year, karanas (half tithis equal to 371) are divisible 
by 7. Out of 11 karanas last 4 are fixed, as in a 
month also 4 remain after 7 X 8 cycles of 56 karanas. 


Verse 206 - If at time of sunrise, the total 
gata and gamiya kala of tithi (720) is more than 
the difference in dainika gati of candra and ravi 
(i.e. difference is less then 720’ per day), then tithi 
is long (tithi vrddhi) i.e. more than 60 dandas. 
Tithi vikala 720 x 60 divided by difference of 
candra and ravi gati, we get duration of tithi in 
danda etc. If it is more than 60 danda then there 
is tithi vrddhi, otherwise tithi ksaya occurs. 


Verse 207-209 - Extra and ommitted candra 
months—- When in a candra masa, there is surya 
sankranti (i.e. surya goes from one rasi to another), 
then it is called Suddha candra masa (i.e. normal 
month). When there is no strya sankranti (i.e. 
slirya remains in same ra&i), it is called extra month 


True Planets 247 


(mala or adhika masa.) Next amanta month is called 
normal candra masa. When there are two 
sankrantis of sGrya in a candra masa, it is called 
kéaya masa (lost month) - i.e. next, candra masa 
is not counted. Before and after ksSaya m4sa, within 
4 months there are one mala masa each i.e. two 
mala masa in that year. First mala masa is called 
sansarpa, kSayamasa is called arnhaspati and later 
malamiasa is called mala. Both mala and kSaya masa 
are prohibited for any auspicious work. (207) 


In veda and smrti, the works which are 
prescribed, monthly and annual sraddha can be 
done in sansarpa or amhaspati, but not in the later 
malamasa. Malamasa is counted as a month for 
annual sraddha of a dead man, when it comes 
within start and completion of a month. New work 
is not started in a malamasa, but work started 
earlier can be continued. The following works can 
be done in a malamasa— 


Bath during eclipse, charity, observing rare 
yogas (auspicious times), sudden works, promised 
work, coronation, Santi, pusti karma, functions 
related with child birth, sraddha etc. (208) 

A kSaya masa is repeated after 141, 122 or 19 
years. In current year (1869 when book was written) 
mandocca of sun was in mithuna, hence in 9 
months from phalguna, a mala masa is probable. 
3rd months after karttika may be kSaya masa 
Magha month may be kéaya or adhika. 


Notes : (1) A lunar synodic month is 
approximately 29.5 days long, where as siirya 
remains in a rasi of 30° for 30.4 days. Thus lunar 
month is completed earlier and after about 30

months extra days in solar month will amount one 
month and sun will not cross to next rasi. Example -

Thus there are approximately 7 adhika masa

(Rk veda). This was known in Romaka siddhanta 
and was called Metonic cycle in Greece. 


Next approximations also indicate possibility 
of kSaya masa in 19, 122, 141 years. 


Verse 210 - Thus the rough paficanga with 
its components like tithi and nakSatra is completed 
which may be accepted by the learned and they 
may perform every year the daily, occasional and 
conditional functions, fasting days, Sraddha, fes- 
tivals etc. according to this panicanga. This may do 
good of world as it is according to jyotisa samhita 
and well thought of. 


Verses 211-212 - For daily auspicious functions 
I am preparing this pancanga with positions of sun 
and other planets. While doing the work I pray 
to lord Jagannatha who is on nilacala shining like 
black soot (for eyes). 


Thus the fifth chapter describing true planets 
with their khanda phalas is over in siddhanta 
darpana written for education of children and 
calculation as per observation by Sri Candrasekhara 
born in a famous royal family of Orissa.

The sine ratios in radians are converted to 
1 : .. 180°

3437.75 kala or 206265 vikala. Then 


6 = m + 376/56”. 4 sin m + 12’54”. 7 sin 2m 
+ 36”. 9 sin 3 m + 2”.0 sin 4m 


Here m has been calculated from nica or

then 
6 = m - 37656.” 4 sin m + 12’54”7 sin 2m 
- 36”.9 sin 3 m + 2”. 0 sin 4m 


Here m on right side is manda kendra - i.e. 
distance of madhya graha from mandocca of moon. 
Remaining terms are mandaphala. , 

When @ = 90°, sin m = 1 and sin 2 m = 0 

Then highest mandaphala depends only on 
its first term 377’ approximately or 6°17’. But our 
astronomers have taken highest mandaphala about 
3° only (radius of mandaparidhi of 32°). However, 
on new moon or full moon day, when moon is 
90° away from mandocca, then it is 1°20’ ahead 
of its calculated position. When moon is 270° ahead 
of mandocca or 90° from nica then it is 1°20’ behind 
its calculated position. Thus in both situations 
mandaphala correction is 6°16'56”.4-1°20’ = 4°56’.4 
(correction is-ve for m = 90° and positive for'‘m = . 
270°). Thus maximum mandaphala is about,5° only 
as observed. 


However, in middle of a pakSa i.e. on 8th 
day, if this mandaphala correction for manda 
kendra 90° is taken as 5°, then observed moon is 
3° behind calculated moon or 8° behind mean 


252 Siddhanta Darpana 


moon. Thus cauculations in our siddhanta were 
true for pirnima or amavasya when eclipse is to 
be calculated. One reason for such neglect is that 
accuracy is needed only for eclipse, other reason 


is that observations were done ony on purnima or ; 
amavasya days or more accurately at time of eclipse. ; 


This is still followed by muslims and even now 
eclipses are studied for more accurate observation.

(2) Deviations in moon position due to effect - 


of sun - Effect of sun is three types 

(a) Attraction component of sun on moon in 
direction of earth moon radius, elongates the orbit 
in the direction of sun and away from it. It changes 
eccentricity of orbit and is called evection term. 
Since it changes eccentricity of orbit, called ‘cyyti’ 
it was called ‘cyuti’ sanskara by Sri Venkateéga 


Bapuji Ketakara in his Jyotirganita. Since it changes | 


angle from mandocca (or Tunga = top), it has been 
called “Tungantara’ sanskara in siddhanta darpana. 


(b) Component of sun’s attraction on moon | 
in direction of moon’s motion advances it towards ; 


sun, which is madmum in middle of a pakga and 
nil at its ends. This varied speed, hence it was 
called variation. Its frequency is in 1 pakSa, hence 


it is called pakéika sanskara in siddhanta darpana. | 


Sri Ketakara called it tithi sanskara because it 
depends on tithi of the pakéa. 


(c) Due to difference of sun’s distance from 3 


Kee 


tebe 


+ acd 


earth or moon depnding on its direction from earth, — 
its attraction force on moon varies in a period of . 
1 year. This is called digathSa sanskara as it : 


amounts to 1/10 of sun’s equation. This is also ; 


called varsika sanskara because its period of 
variation is one year.

Fig 1 (a) - Fig 1 (b) Fig 1 (c) 
Figure 1 - Effect of sun's attraction on moon’s orbit 


to sun. In positions A and B which are near to 
sun compared to earth, extra attraction on moon 
is in direction of sun. In position C and D of 
moon, away from sun, the difference in force 
compared to earth is away from sun. .Force of 
attraction G has two components, its component 
R is reducing the pull of earth on moon acting in 
Opposite direction. Thus distance of moon increases 
from earth. This increase is maximum for positions 
M; and Msg and nil for positions M2 and My. Thus 
in Fig 1 (b), when major axis is in direction of 
. Sun, the axis will become longer and its eccentricity 
will increase. | 

In fig 1 (c), the distance perpendicular to 
Major axis in sun’s direction will increease, due to 
Which moon orbit will become round. Then 
eccentricity will decrease. Thus correction in man- 


254 Siddhanta Darpana 


daphala due to eccentricity will increase for fig (1) 
(b) and decrease in position of figure (c). 

Component T is maximum for position My, 
and increases the speed in middle of krsna pak$a. 
It decreases and becomes zero at M; as the force 
of attraction is totally in direction of EMi, and 
other component is zero. It increases in value from 
Mi to M2 and again declines to zero at M3. From 
M; to Mz it is against the direction of motion. 

It is in direction of motion between M2, M3 
(decreasing) and again increasing upto M, but 
against the motion. 

(3) Correction by different authorities  - 
According to modern astronomy, principal terms 
of moon’s motion are 

6=m 

+ (377/19”.06 sin m + 12’57”.11 sin 2 m. 

- + 36”.9 sin 3 m + 2”.0 sin 4m) mandaphala

Tungantara 

+ 39’30” sin 2 (M-S) - - variation or pakSsika 

'+ 11/10” sin (manda kendra of sun) - - - 
Annual or digarnSa 

The early astronomers of India recognised 
only the mandaphala correction, (equation of 
centre), but instead of its value to be 377’ sin m, 
they took its value 301’ sin m, by including effects 
of evection. By including 76’ part of mandaphala 
with evection we get - - - 


301’ sin m + 76’ [(sin m + sin {(2 (M-S) — m}]+ 


: Corrections to Moon ; 255° 


= 301’ sin m + 152’ sin (M-S). Cos (S-2) 

Here M = mean Moon, S = True sun, @ = 
moon’s perigee from which angle m has been 
measured. Thus m - (M-S) = S - (M - m) =s-a 
in cos term above. 


- Value of Ist correction to moon was the 
following according to different authors 


Aryabhatiya 300’15” Sin m

where m is mandakendra measured from

Second correction has been given by |

(M-S) 


256 Siddhanta Darpana 


where S,M,U are true sun, true moon and 
mandocca of moon. 


For simplicity, daily motion of 790°35” of 
moon is taken as true motion, then this becomes 
8°8’ x 8°8’ x 2° 11’ cos (S-U) sin (M-S) 

= 144°26’ cos (S-U) sin (M-S) - converted to 
minutes, 2nd correction - - - (1) 


Thus Manjula’s correction is sum of two 
correction - 


(i) 76’ sin (M-U) - part of the mandaphala 

(ii) 144’26” cos (S-U) sin (M-S) - - - evection 
term which was not mentioned by previous 
astronomers. 


Plotemy had given maximum value of 2nd 
correction as 159’ but didn’t give any formula (150 
A.D.) 


Astronomer Yallaya gives credit of this dis- 
covery of these corrections to VateSvara (904 AD) 
but this has not been found in VateSvara siddhanta, 
the available book. 


This appears in exactly the same form in 
karana - kamala-martanda of DaSabala (1058). 
Subsequently it occurs in equivalent forms in 
siddhanta §Sekhara of Sripati (1039 A.D), Tantra 
Sangraha of Nila Kantha (1500 A.D.), uparaga kriya 
krama of Narayana (1563 A.D.) Karanottama of 
Acyuta (1621 AD) and lastly in siddhanta darpana 
of Candragekhara (1869). 

Equation (1) of Manjula is correct but constant 
is 8’, less. 

Sripati’s second correction amounts to the 
following correction term. 


Corrections to Moon 257 


160° cos m_ sin (mandaphala) x 
1 — cos (mandaphala) 


Mandakarna — R 
where R = radius 3438’. 


This is same as Manjula’s equation except that 
the constant is now. 8’ more, instead of 8’ less 
earlier. 


(b) Bhaskara II - Bhaskara I] wrote a separate 
work called ‘Bijopanaya’ about corrections needed 
in true planets. Stanza 8 of the work starts. with 
statement - 


I have seen maximum difference between 
calculated and observed positions to be + 112’ 


When moon is one quadrant ahead of man- 
docca and sun is half aquadrant ahead of moon, 
observed moon is 112’ behind calculated moon i.e. 
negative error. 

When moon is 3 quadrants ahead of apogee 
and sun at half a quadrant behind her, the 
maximum positive discrpancy of + 112’ is seen 

When eclipses of sun and moon take place 
and moon is at apogee and Pengee: there is no 
error or bija. 

When eclipses take place at end of odd 


quadrants from apogee, error is negative equal to 
34’ 


and sunis . 
When moon is at the apogee, and 72. is 


ahead or behind by haif a quadrant, sed al 
is 34’ 

Same discrepancy is seen, when moon is at 
Perigee and sun half quarter ahead or behind 


His first equation of mandaphala was correct

- 379'46”.8 sin m + 34’sin2 (M-S) : 
where m is manda kendra, M and S are true 4

second order of small quantities, his constant is | 
too small (1/5th of the correct value).

(5) Indian Charts - 


In India also many charts were prepared from - 
time to time. Makaranda sarani was most famous. 
Candrasekhara has referred to tables of Kochanna 
of Andhra pradesh. Then in south India, specially 
in Kerala, vakya karana are very famous. Original 
Vakya karana was written for moon--called. 
candravakyani by Vararuci, reputed to be in time. 
of king Vikramaditya at start of Vikrama eera. Then’ 
Vakya karana was prepared in 13th century. Its 
writer is not known, but Sundararaja commentary:: 
is available. These books calculated the days from 
kaliyuga beginning. The moiton was calculated for 
a convenient lump of days. For remaining number. 
of days, the true position was calculated at about 


a cabal 


Corrections to Moon 261 


200--300 positions. These were indicated by (vakya’ 
for each of position to be read in Katapayadi 
notation. This method could give correct position 
upto minute for 24 hour intervals. Madhava of 
sangamagrama in 1350 AD, prepared ‘Sphuta 
candrapti’ to calculate true moon upto seconds of 
arc at 9 periods in a day. His method was to 
calculate position of moon at equal intervals of 24 
hours from its mandocca position. Moon reaches 
from mandocca to mandocca in about 248 days, so 
248 vakyas are used. 


(6) Making of a calender - 

One of the main aims of astronomy is to find 
suitable measurement of time. A time scale to 
indicate past time since an epoch is a calender. 

Intervals of time which can be measured is 
one type of kala and its measurement is called 
‘kalana’ Thus ‘calculate’ means to count or to 
measure. In Arab, they were called ‘kalamma’ Work 
of ‘kalana’ is called chronology or calender. 

The flux of time is apparently without 
beginning or end, but it is cut up periodically by 
several natural phenomena-— 

(i) by ever recurring alteration of day light 
and night 


(ii) by the recurrance of moon’s phases 
(iii) by the recurrance of seasons 


These have been used to define natural 
divisions of time- 


Day - time of alteration of day ‘and night 


Month - Complete cycle of moon's changes 
of phase - 


262 Siddhinta Darpana } 


New moon to new moon (amanta month) or 3 
full moon to full moon (ptirnimanta) months. ! 


Year - Coming back of a season again and its . 
smaller subdivision season. 


Standards for day - Day for purpose of regular 
works was counted from sun rise to sunrise in 
India and from sunset to sunset in west asia’ 
(Babylonians and Jews). West Asia was called * 
‘Asura’ area and hence they were called niSacara / 
(moving in night) because their day started from * 
night time. Sunrise and sunset are convenient to 
see and day light only gives opportunity for doing 
works. 

Sunrise time varies according to position of: 
sun in south or north hemisphere of sun. Variation © 
of day length is more in places away from equator, 
being nil at equator. Hence for calculation purposes | 
day was counted from midnight to midnight. 

Even midnight to midnight day varies, be- . 
cause during this time earth makes one rotation : 
arounds its axis with respect to stars and has to- 
move further to catch up with movement among ° 
stars. This second component varies with distance . 
of sun which varies in an elliptical orbit. Thus- 
revolution of earth with respect to stars is taken’ 
as a better standard called sidereal day. An average ° 
of solar day (midnight to midnight) is used and 
called mean solar day.

Mean solar day = 24 h 3m 56.555s sidereal 
time Slight variation in rotation period of earth 
and sidereal day is due to obliquity of earth, 
rotation being counted in the ecliptic plane. Even 
earth’s rotation period is not constant but fluctuates 
regularly and irregularly by amounts of the order 
of 10° seconds, Regular slowing down of rotation 
period is 14 seconds per century due to tidal friction 
caused by difference of attraction force on sea water 
in different parts of earth. It is mainly by moon 
and 1/4th by sun. Irregular variation is due to-force 
exerted by wind movements or unequal rate of 
atmospheric rotation and sea currents, both of 
which are caused by heat of sun. 


Month 


Period from new moon to new moon varies 
from 29.246 to 29.817 days due to eccentricity of 
moon’s orbit and other causes like effect of sun. 
Period of mean lunation is given by 


29.5305882-0.0000002 T days 
where T = no of centuries after 1900 AD. 


It may be noted that this is not the period 
of rotation of moon round earth. This is extra one 
round ahead of sun. When moon and sun are 
together, it is amavasya (living together). Moon 
with its faster motion goes ahead in about 15 days 
by 180° when it is parnima (or full moon). After 
29.5 days it is again with sun. This rotation is with 


264 Siddhanta Darpana 


speed (moon-sun) and slower than moon’s rotation 
in 27.3 days only. 


Year and seasons - 


1 year is one rotation of sun with respect to 
stars - it is called sidereal year. Seasons change 
according to position of sun with respect to earth 
in north south direction. It is perpendicular to 
equator twice in one year, while coming from south 
to north it is called vernal equinox and in opposite 
direction it is autumnal equinox. Equinox means 
equal day and night (nakta in sanskrta = night) If 
axis of earth is fixed, tropical and solar years will 
be same. But it rotates in reverse direction in a 
conical manner, thus equinox points rotates west 
ward making a rotation in about 25000 years. Due 
to this precession of equinoxes occurs. 

Tropical year = Sidereal year - speed of 
precession per year (crossing time by sun) 

Present values are 

Tropical year == 365.24219879 - 0.614 (t- 
1900)x10’ days, where t = Gregorian year 

Thus it is 365.2421955 days = 365d 5h 48 m 
45.7 sec. 

Sideral year is 365.256362 days. 

Only tropical year corresponds to the seasons 

In addition to two equinoxes, we can take the 
points of longest day (in north hemisphere) where 
sun is northern most from equator i.e. summer 
solstice or the southern most position called winter 
solstice. 

As the day is counted from midnight ie. 
lowest position of sun in east west circle, year can 


Corrections to Moon 265 


be counted from southern most winter solstice 
(which is lowest for northern hemesphere). This is 
like a grand day hence one tropical year is called 
a ‘divya dina’ (divine day). Since the grand day 
starts with winter solstice from vedic days, the first 
day ‘christmas’ is called ‘bada (grand) dina’. 
Actually it is start of grand day. That month called 
margaSirsa has longest nights hence it is called 
Krsna masa (or black month). Thus Krsna has 
compared himself with margsirsa month in gita. 
This has become ‘Christmas’ (Krsna masa). 15 days 
before start of margaSirsa masa will be beginning 
of great usa (Twilight before sun rise), hence it is 
called ‘bada osa’ in local languages (like in Orissa) 


Problems in calender making - 

Civil calender for use in human life has 
following difficulties 

(a) Civil year and the month must have an 
integral numbers of days - perferably equal 


(b) Starting day of the year, and of the month 
should be suitably defined. The dates must 
correspond to seasons. 


(c) For the purpose of continuous dating, an 
era should be used and it should be properly 
defined. 


(d) The civil day, as distinguished from the 


astronomical day, should be defined for use in the 
calender. 


(e) If the lunar months have to be kept, there 


Should be convenient devices for luni solar adjust- 
ments. 


266 Siddhanta Darpana . 


All the problems have not been solved till 
today. The errors in calculations also had to be 
corrected. Hence new calenders were started in 
different parts of the world by the intervention of 
dictators like Julius Caesar, Pope Gregory XIII or 
a founder of religion like Mohammad, or by. 
monarchs like Melik Shah the Seljik or Akber. 


Owing to historical order of development, 
calenders have been used for double purpose. 


(i) of the adjustment of the civic and ad- 
ministrtive life of the nation. 


(ii) of the regulation of the socio religious life 
of the people. 
Divisions of day : 

Present division of day is in 24 hours. Minute’ 
divisions of 60 each called minutes and second 
division again by 60 called seconds. Thus 1 mean 
solar day = 60 X 60 = 86,400 seconds. Division of 
time and angle measures by 60 was because of 30° 
days in a month and 12 lunar months in a year 
whose lowest common multiple is 60. A day has 
365 but approximate multiple of 60 is 360. Hence 
a civil year was taken of 360 days and a circle was. 
divided into 360°. Thus sun will move about 1° 
in 1 day. In India, day was divided into divisions ; 
of 60 at each step as degree is divided. Thus 1° : 
movement is in 1 day, 1’ movement in 1 danda, 
1” movement in 1 pala and so on. 


Time was measured by length and direction 
of shadow of a pillar called gnomon. For equal 
time intervals, specially during night time, water: 
clock etc were used. Improvements were done. 
through pendulum clocks by Galileo, spring docks 


Corrections to Moon 267 


using balance wheel. Most occurate are quartz 
clocks for normal use and ammonia clocks for 
scientific use. 


For practical watches of duty or shifts of work, 
a day was divided into 6 parts (3 parts in day time 
and 3 in night). After each irmferval a bell was 
rung. In India there were 8 shifts in a day, hence 
the shift of 3 hours is called a ‘prahara’ i.e. when 
a bell is hit (prahara). A watchman remains on 
continuous duty for a prahara, hence he is called 
prahari. 


; 
60 day = 1 ghati is called so because water 


clock measured the time of its filling. Since it was 
shaped like a pitcher it is called ‘ghati’ (i.e. water 
pot). Hence watches are called ‘ghadi’ in India. 
When water clock in turned a second time it is 2 
ghati = 1 muhiartta (repeated turning of water 
clock). 

Watches observed in churches were 


(1) Martins - last watch of night. Monk got 
up 2 hours before sunrise 


(2) Prima - at sunrise 


(3) Tetra - Half way between sunrise and noon 
- time of saying mass. 


(4) Sext - at noon (hence the word siesta 
= midday rest) 


(5) Nona - Mid afternoon - Hence the word 
noon, 


(6) Vespers - An hour before ‘sunset 
(7) Compline - at sunset 


268 Siddhanta Darpana 


In India mid day is 2 praharas after sunrise 
(i.e. 6 hours after), hence it is still called ‘two 
pahars’. 


Day was divided into 12 parts in Babylone of 
30 gesh (4 minutes each). In each part approximate- 
ly 1 sign of zodiac will rise, it is like 12 divisions 
of year. In India raSi was divided into two parts 
(like day-night divisoin of day) called ‘Hora’ (short 
of ‘ahoratra’ i.e. day and night) Thus there are 24 
horas is a day night or 12 in day and 12 in night. 
This ‘hora’ has become hour. This was also used 
in Egypt and continues till today. 


Counting of days in a month : 


The ancient Iranian calender gave 30 names 
for each of the days of a month. It was not very 
popular as the list is long and difficult to remember. 
Hence a week of seven days was popular through 
out the world. Origin of week days has been 
explained by Varahamihira. Each hora (24 in a day 
is ruled by a planet. Planets are arranged in order 
of decreasing orbit or increasing speeds of rotation 
- Sani, guru, Mangala, sarya (or earth), sukra, 
budha and Candra. In first hora of the day, lord 
of the day will rule. For example, Sani will rule 
Ist hora on Sanivara. On next day ruler will be 
25th planet in the order given above. Deducting 3 
cycles of 7 planets, 4th planet strya will be ruler 
of next day i.e. Ist hora on that day. So it is called 
ravivara or sunday. Next day will be 4th from 
sirya i.e. candra or moon called somavara or 
monday. 


‘Rulers of days are fixed for astrological 
purpose, hence it has astrological origin in India

and west. Ancient Egyptions had a ten days week 
(period in which sun covers 10° or 1/3rd of a rai 
called Dreskana in astrology) Babylonians started 
a month with new moon and marked the Ist, 8th, 
15th and 22nd days of the lunar month for religious 
festivals. This was a sort of weak of 7 days with 
one holiday. In Iranian calender in which 30 days 
had different names 8th, 15th and 23rd were called 
Diniparvana for religious practices. But last week 
in this system was of 9 or 10 days. In veda, sadaha 
has been mentioned, but this doesn’t seem to 
indicate a six days week. It seems to be six extra 
days after 360 in a leap year called ‘Gavam Ayana’ 
every four years. The Jews reckon the days from 
saturday and indicate them by numbers i.e. Ist, 
2nd - - - 7th day. 


Seven days week was introduced to christian 
world by edict of Roman emperor Constantine in 
323 AD, who changed the Sabath day (saturday 
for Jewish) to the Lord’s day, sunday. In India if 
has been first mentioned in Atharva Jyotisa and 
by Aryabhata. English names of week day have

It is note worthy that functions attributed to 
planets by Chaldeans are same as in Indian 
Astrology. 

Ahargana or heap of days - 

Count of days is used all over the world from 
a standard epoch to calculate the mean posotion 
of any planet. 

Mean position at required time 

= Mean position at initial epoch + daily motion 
x ahargana 

To make a uniform standard, a French scholar, 
Joseph Scaliger introduced in 1582, a system known 
as ‘Julian days’ after his father Julius Scaliger. The 
Julian Period is 

7980 years = 19 X 28 X 15 

19 is length in years of the Metonic cycle 

15 is length in years of the cycle of inclication 

28 is length in years of the solar cycle 

It was found by calculation that, these three 
cycles started together on Jan 1, 4713 B.C. Julian 
period and days are counted from that day and 
the day is completed at noon time. This is the 
standard for astronomical calculations now.

creation after which 6 manus of 71 yuga each have 
passed, in current 7th manu 27 yuga have passed. 
In 28th yuga, Satyuga, Treta and divapara have

(7) Solar calenders in History -

the year was short by 1/4 days from 365-1/4 days,’ 
the heliacal rising of Sirius star would re-appear: 
at the beginning of year after 1460 years. This was 
called Sothic cycle as Sothis (Isis) was the goddess. 
of sirius. In 22 B.C. the year started on 29th August? 
the Pharoahs (kings) of Egypt tried to introduce; 
leap year, but this never became popular. Ptolemy : 
in 238 introduced a leap year, but old calender ; 
also continued side by side. Egyptians did not use | 
any continuous era, but counted the number of! 
years of each reign separately. For astronomical | 
purposes, Nabonassar Era was used in Babylone. ; 

This was used as a reference by all countries for : 
sumplicity : 

(b) The Iranian calendar - Around 520 B.C... 
Darius introduced a solar calender like Egyptian | 
with 365 days each. It had 12 months of 30 days | 
each and each day had a specific name. The names : 
are similar to vedic names. 5 days extra were 
attached in the end. Adjustment of 1/4 extra day ‘ 
each year was done by adding a month of 30 days 
in a cycle of 120 years. 

From 16-3-1079 A.D, Seljuc sultan Jelaluddin 
Malik Shah introduced a new calender Tarikh-e- 
Jalali, starting from 10th Ramadan of Hejira 471. ° 
It was 365 days year with 8 intercalary days in 33 
years. The year started from vernal equinox day 
or next day. Its lenght was 365.242 42 days. 

Riza Shah Pahlavi introduced a strictly solar’ 
year and restored the old Persian names of month; 
in use before Darius. The year started from 21 or 
22 march. First 6 months were of 31 days each.

Last month was of 29 days or 30 days in a leap 
year. 

Roman calendar (Christian Calendar) - The so 
called Christian calendar had nothing to do with 
christianity. It was originally the calender of semi 
savage tribes of Northern Europe, who started their 
year some time before the beginning of spring 
(March 1 to 25) and had only 10 months of 304 
days, ending about the time of winter solstice 
(December 25). The remaining 61 days formed a 
period of hybernation when no work could be done 
due to on set of winter, and were not counted at 
all. 


This calender was adopted by city state of 
Rome and some modifications were made. Second 
Roman king of legendary period Numa Pompilius 
added two months (51 days) to the year in about 
673 B.C. making a total of 355 days. January 
(named after god Janus who faced both ways) and 
February were added in beginning and March 
became the 3rd month now. Number of days 
became now 29,28,31,29,31,29,31,29,29,31,29,29. 
Adjustment of the year to the proper season was 
done by intercalation of a thirteen month of 22 or 
23 days (called Mercedonius) after two or three 
years between February and March, the extra 
month was actually 27 or 28 days but, the last 5 
days of February due to be repeated after extra 
month, were not repeated. The correction at 
alternate year could have given 45 (22+23) days in 
4 years or 11-1/4 days on average. Thus it made 
a year only one day longer than 365-1/4 days. But 
this was irregular and caused a lot of discrepancy 
from the seasons. 


274 Siddhanta Darpang | 


Julius caesar, on his conquest of Egypt in 44 
B.C. was advised by Egyptism astronmer Sosigenes 
that mean length of year should be 365-1/4 | 
days.Normal length should be 365 days and one 
extra day should be added every fourth year. Then 
the fifth month from March, Quintilis was changed | 
to July (Julius) in 44 B. C. in honour of Julius Caeser | j 
and length of months were fixed at their present : 
duration. Extra leap year was obtained by repeating .: 
the sixth day before kalends (first day) of March. ; 
In 8 B.C., sixth month after March, Sextilis .was 
changed to August in honour of Augustus, 
successor to Caesar. To correct the seasons, 90 days 
were added to 46 B.C. 23 days after February and 
67 days between November and December. This. 
year of 445 days was known as year of confusion. 

‘ Caesar wanted to start the new year on 25th. 
December, the winter solstice. day. But people - 
resisted, because new moon was due on January 
1,45 B.C. Caesar had to accept the traditional 
landmark of the year. 


Weekdays of 7 days week were introduced | 
sometimes in Ist century AD on pattern of chaldean 
astronomers. Days of crucification of christ and his 
ascending to heaven was fixed arbitrarily on Friday 
and Sunday later on. New Testament only says 
that he was crucified on a day before Passover 
festival of Hebrews which was on full moon day 
of the month of Nissan. 


The present christian era started at about 530 
AD. When era beginning was fixed from the birth _ 
year of christ, birth day of christ was fixed of 
December 25, which was winter solstice day and —

century B.C. However, a Roman inscription at 
Ankara shows that king Herod of Bible who had 
ordered massacre of children after birth of christ, 
was dead for 4 years at 1 AD. Therefore, christ 
must have been born before 4 B.C. 


The Julian year of 365.25 days was longer 
than the ‘true year of 365.2422 days by 0.00788 
days, so the winter solstice day which fell on 21 
December in 323 AD, fell back by 10 days in 1582 
AD. In 1572, Pope called a meeting to discuss the 
correction. In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII, published a 
bill instituting a revised calender. Friday, October 
5 of that year was to be counted as Friday, October 
15. The century years which were not divisible by 
4 were not to count as leap years. Thus the number 
of leap years in 400 years was reduced from 100 
to 97. length of years was 365.2425 days, the error 
being only one day in 3300 years. This was adopted 
immediately by the catholic states of Europe. But 
Britain adopted it in 1752, China in 1912, Russia 
in 1918, Greece in 1924 and Turkey in 1927. Revised 
rules for easter have not been adopted by the 
Greek Orthodox church. 


World calender : To remove the working 
defects of Gregorian calender, a world calender 
was propsoed to UNO in Geneva meetign of 
ECOSOC in 1954. In this calender week days of

days is kept after 30th December called W or world 
holiday. In leap year another world day was to be 
mtroduced after 30th June. Every year was same 
for counting of week days. Each quarters of 3 
months was of 91 days, 13 weeks. First month of 
fach quarter was 31 days and remaining of 30

Each year (each quarter also) begins on sunday, 


Each month has 26 working days, plus sundays, ;

Mean sidereal period of moon = 27.321661; 
days 

= 27d 7h 43m 11.5s. 


1 
with a variation of + 3, hours. 


12 lunations (synodic) amount to 354.36706 
days while tropical solar year is 365.24220 days. 
Length of lunar year is shorter by 10.87514 days, 
and there are 12.36827 lunar months in a solar 
year. Tropical solar year is varying very slowly and 
is becomig shorter by 8.6 seconds == .0001 days 
in 1600 years. Thus at kali beginning or in Sumerian 
times it was 365.2422 days. 


All ancient nations had almost accurate 
knowledge of the mean synodic month. However, 
no rules could be fixed for tallying the lunar year 
with solar year. Hammurabi (1800 B.C.), law giver 
king of Babylonia, has a record saying that the 
thirteenth (extra) month was proclaimed by royal 
order throughout the empire on advice of priests. 
Practically the start of first month was adjusted 
with ripening of wheat.

Later Babylonians, called Chaldeans around 
600 B.C. fixed some empirical relations in lunar 
and solar years for correction of calender in form 

m lunar months = n solar years. 

where m and n are integers 

Some convenient periods were 

Octaeteris - 8 tropical years = 2921.94 days 

99 lunar months = 2923.53 days. 

This gave 3 intercalary months in 8 years with 
error of only 1.59 days. 

In about 500 BC (383 B.C. according to father 
Kugler) 19 year or Saros cycle was used with 7 
intercalary months 

19 solar years = 6939.60 days 

235 lunar months 6939.69 days 


This gives a discrepancy of 0.09 days in 19 
years or of 1 day in 209 years. 


Their 19 years cycle was of 6940 days with 
leap years on Ist, 4th, 7th, 9th, 12th and 15th year 
in the first month and in 18th year at 7th month. 


First month started with 30 days, then other 
months were atternately 29 and 30 days. Thus a 
normal year was of 354 days, but in 5 years of 19 
year era one extra day was added to last month, 
making the year of 355 days. After adding 
intercalary year, the year was of 354, 355, 383 or 
384 days duration. Effect of this arrangement was 
that the first month Nisannu start was never more 
than 30 days away from vernal equinox. The 
Chaldeans used gnomon for ascertaining time of 2 
€quinoxes and 2 solstices which divide a solar year 
nto 4 almost equal seasons.

Hipparchus (140 BC) and Ptolemy (150 AD)‘

one king Nabu Nazir. Though they counted the ; 
astronomical era from 26 Feb. 747 B.C. in that } 
reign, they adopted Egyptian solar years of 365 ; 
days each for ease in calculation of dates. 

Macedonian Greek had their own months, but; 
after they settled in Babylon in 313 B.C, they’, 
adopted their months to Chaldean months, Ist; 
month Dios starting with 7th month of Chaldeans | i 
at autumnal equinox. 

Seleucus, a general of Alexander, a] 
Macedonian Greek founded a big empire in west 
Asia and started his own era Seleucidean era. In: 
official or Maccdonian reckoning it started from the; 
lunar month of Dios near autumnal equinox oe 
(-311 AD) or 312 B.C, with greak month names. 
In Babylonian reckoning, the months had Chaldean; 
names starting from Nisan near vernal equniox.

again became independent empire. 4

Adar. Year beginning was changed from Nisan 
month to Tisri corresponding to Mecedonian month 
of Dios. Around 4th century A.D. rules were 
formed for intercalation. In a cycle of 19 years 
3,6,8,11,14,17 and 19th years had extra month. Start 
of first months was adjusted, so that week days 
of important festivals do not change. Thus a 
common year could have 353, 354 or 355 days and 
a leap year of 383,384 or 385 days. 10 of the middle 
months had got fixed duration of 29 or 30 days. 
Extra month was of 30 days. The other two (Ist 
and 12th months) varied according to length of the

olum or Era of Creation or Freedom. 


According to mnemonic Beharad, this era’ is 
supposed to begin at the beginning of lunar cycle 
on the night between Sunday and Monday, Oct 
7, 3761 B.C., at 11 hours 11-1/3 minutes PM. (Be 
= Beth i.e. 2nd day of week), ha (he = five, i.e. 
fifth hour after sunset) and Rad (Resh) delet i.e. 
204 minims after the hour, 18 minim = 1 minute) 


In Bible, eras have been mentioned from 
flood, exodus, the earthquake in the days of king 
Uzziah, the regnal years of monarchs and 
Babylonian exile. After exile, they counted years 
from Persian kings, and then from Seleucid era. 
Days have also been counted from fall of the second 
temple.

Islamic Calendar - 


This is purely lunar calender now and has no © 
connection with solar year. The year consists of 12 | 
lunar months; beginning of each month is deter- ; 
mined by Ist observation of crescent moon in the 
evening sky. The months have 29 or 30 days and . 
the year 354 or 355 days. The new year day of 
Islamic calendar loses about 1 month in 3 years, | 
and completes the retrograde cycle of seasons in 


1 
32 > solar years. | 


Hejira (A.H.) was introduced by caliph Umar 
about 638-639 AD, stating from evening of 622 AD, 
July 15, Thursday (Since sunset Friday started in 
Islamic calender). Then crescent moon of the Ist 
month Muharram was first visible. This was the 
new year day preceding the emigration of Muham- 
mad from Mecca (about Sept 20, 622 AD.). The 
months are alternately of 30 and 29 days from Ist 
month. Last month is 29 days in normal year and 
30 days in a leap year. If Hejira year is divided 
by 30 and remainder is 2,5,7,10,13,16,18,21,24,26 
or 29 then it is a leap year. Thus 11 leap years in 
30 years, gives the cycle of 10,631 days which is 
0.012 days less than the true value. 


Dr. Hashim Amir Ali of Osmania University 
has showed that the mohamadan calender was 
originally luni-solar. Upto the last year of the life 
of Mohamad; i.e. upto AH 10 or 632 AD, a 
thirteenth month was intercalated when necessary. 
The family of astronomers, known as Qalamas 


Corrections to Moon 281 


decided at hajj in last month, whether 13th month 
will be added or not. This should have been 3 
times in 8 years or 7 times in 19 years, but use 
of discretion by eldest Qalama created confusion 
afterwards. Thus AH 11, a normal year started on 
29th March 632 AD. after vernal equinox. Thus all 
the previous years with intercalation, started after 
sighting new moon after vernal equinox. Thus the 
initial epoch of Hejira era was at the evening of 
March 19,622 AD, Friday, the day following the 
vernal equinox.

(9) Old Indian Calendars : 


_A. Vedic Calender - Vedic calender was luni 
solar. Year was named in three manners - Solar 
year, civil year and lunar year (normal and 
intercalary). 


Sama = Fixed year or constant. It is opposite 
to ‘masa’ i.e. formal of 12 masa of 30 days each. 
Thus it means a year of 360 civil days or 365 solar 
days (i.e. 365-1/4 days) 


282 Siddhanta Darpana 


Lunar years are called vatsara - which are of 
5 types— Samvatsara, anuvatsara, Parivatsara, Id- 
vatsara and Idavatsara. Anuvatsara is also called 
Iduvatsara. When these indicate a sequence of 5 
solar years of 366 days each, vatsara is a sixth year 
of 360 civil days or sama (as per yajus jyotisa). 

Names of thirteen months in Taittirilya 
Brahmana (3-10-1) are Aruna, Aruna _ rajas, 
Pundarika, Visvajita, Abhijit, Ardra, Pinvamana, 
Annavan, Rasavan, Iravan, Sarvan sadha, Sambhar 
and Mahasvan, Mahasvan appears to bé increased 
month (with extra days in a solar year). 

6 seasons of two solar months each are as 
follows - 


1. Vasanta - Madhu and Madhava 
. Grisma - Sukra and Suci 
. Varsa - Nabhas and Nabhasya 
Sarad - Isa and irja 
Hemanta - Sahas and Sahasya 

6. Sigira - Tapas and Tapasya 

Taittiriya Brahmana has given a list of 24 half 
months (1 fortnight), names of day times and night 
times in Sukla and krsna pakSas - 60 names, names 
of 15 muhirtas in Sukla pakSa day and night, 
Krsna pakSa day and night - 60 names and 15 
parts of each muhirta / called prati muhirta). 

Name of lunar months were named after the 
nakSatras entered by moon on _ purnima day. 
Rk veda (1-15-1) tells that,.Indra drinks soma juice 
with seasonal adityas on full moon day. Thus Indra 
is always at a point 180° away from sun.

Rk veda verse 10-72-4 by SunahSepa gives 
method of deciding about inclusion of intercalary 
month - 


DakéSa was born of Aditi and Aditi was DakSa’s 
child. The whole ecliptic was Aditi and its division 
were adityas - 6 for each season, 12 for each month 
or 13th for extra month. First point of Daksa 
division was the start of ecliptic zero degree. Year 
started with rise of this point on eastern horizon 
with sun. When the next rise was not before 13th 
full moon, 13th month was extra month otherwise 
it was month of next year. In Santipatha also it is 
stated -- 

aifefastay sifefast Pray, 


In Vajasaneyi samhita, two adhika masa are 
named. Sansarpa is extra month before winter 
solstice. Another is malimluca, KSayamasa (lost 
month) was called Amhaspati. (Yajur-VS, 22-30) 

In a solar year of 365-1/4 days, 5 or occasional- 
ly six days are extra after civil year of 360 days. 
These have been called atiratra (i.e. extra days after 
grand night). Taittiriya Samhita (7--1-10) says that 
4 atiratra make the year incomplete, while 6 atiratra 
give excess, so five are the best. 


Aitareya Brahmana has defined Tithi as the 
time during which Moon sets and rises again 
(32-10). Thus like civil day from sunrise to sunrise, 
tithi is a moon day from moon rise to moon rise. 


284 Siddhanta Darpana 


In sukla pakSa tithi was from moon set to 
moon set, and in other it was moon rise to moon 
rise. 


Atharva Vedanga jyotisa has defined two 
karana in each tithi - one from moon rise to moon 
set and second from moon set to moon rise. These 
tithi and karana were of unequal length. Later on 
they were made of equal length defined on basis 
of moon phase. 

B. Vedanga Jyotisa (Rk veda) : This is 
described in orly 36 verses in anustupa chanda 
including introduction and importance. This is one 
of the six parts of Rk veda. Though it is shortest, 
it gives a most comprehensive, luni solar calendar 
so far. It was written by ‘Lagagha’ whose place 
was 35° N latitude, nothern border of Kashmira, 
may be the present town of Alma-Ata of Kyrghiz. 
This place might have been first place of learning, 
hence first school is called alma-meter. 


Efforts to explain its meaning on basis of 5 
years cycle (yuga) were unsuccessful, by various 
anthors as B.G. Tilak, S. B. Diksita and T.S.K. 
Shastri, R. Shamshastri etc. ‘Pafica samvatsara 
mayam yugam’ was interprated that a yuga has 5 
years (meaning of samvatsara). But samvatsara is 
one of the 5 types of lunar years and its meaning 
should be - A yuga has 5 years of samvatsara type, 
remaining years of other 4 types. If calculations 
are made on that basis, a yuga has 19 years, with 
5 types of vatsaras, out of which 5 are sanvatsaras. 
This also gives meaning of other types of years. 
This gives correspondance of solar and lunar years 
in terms of tithis, days and nakSatras also. 


Corrections to Moon 285 


Time cycle : There are 360 tithis in a lunar 
year. Solar year is bigger by 10.89 days. With 
reasonable accuracy, 7 intercalary months 
(adhikamasa) occur in a cycle of 19 years. Thus 


228 solar months = 235 lunar months Addi- 
' tional 7 months form 7 xX 30 = 210 tithis. Thus 


210 1. ee 
there is difference of Tia 115 tithis (10.89 days) 
between a solar and a lunar year. Thus a solar 
year consists of 371 5 tithis. If we assume a leap 


year in a cycle, we have 18 years with 371 tithis 
and one year (i.e leap year) with 372 tithis. This 
cycle of 19 years is called a yuga. 


Calculation of Rtu gesa - A year has 12 months 
(lunar) each having two parts Sukla pakSa (called, ~ 
Sudi - i.e. SukSma diwas - or Suddha diwas) and 
Krsna pak&Sa (Badi i.e. bahula diwas, extra days). 
Thus 24 pakSa of a year have difference of 11 tithis 


: . . lil 
from solar year. Difference in each pakSa is m4 


1 ; 
0.458 = 2 tithi approximately 
‘Thus a lunar pakSa = 15 tithis 


Solar pakSa = 15 ; tithis 

For calculating extra tithis for each half of 
solar year, we have to add 11/2 tithis = 11 karanas. 
Thus we have to substract 1 karana after half year 
from 12 karanas got after taking 1 karana for each 
paksa approximately. One tithi is taken extra in a 
completed yuga of 19 years. When cumulative total 
of extra karana after a semester is more than 60 


286 Siddhanta Darpana 


karanas = 30 tithi = 1 month, one extra month is 
added in that semester. 


Classification of years : If one karana is not 
dropped in each semester, then RtuSesa will be 12 
tithis per year or 6 tithis per ayana (semester). 
Thus start of ayanas will be after 6 tithis each and 
after 5 ayanas (2-1/2 years) the cycle will be 
complete and one extra month will be added so 
that the month starts again with Magha sukla 1 
(Ist year of month). ‘Thus years were classified 
according to range of tithis on which Ist day of 
year fell - 

Samvatsara - Sukla 1 to 6th 

Anuvatsara - Sukla 7th to 12th 

Parivatsara - Sakla 13th to 18th (or badi 3rd) 

Idvatsara - Badi 4th’ to 9th 

Ida vatsara - Badi 10th to 15th 


When we decide adhikamasa for each lump 
of 60 karana RtuSesa, 5 years in 19 years yuga are 
of samvatsara type.‘3 years are Idavatsara, lagging 
behind most, hence the adhikamdasa occurs in Ist 
semester of those years (6th, 9th and 17th). which 
can be seen by calculation. Four years are of 
Idvatsara type lagging 18-24 tithis, hence the adhika 
masa is added in 2nd semester of (3rd, lith, 14th 
and 19th years) 


NakSatra calculation for sidereal lunar year - 
In a lunar month, moon completes its circular 
journey of 27 nakéatras and travels about 2 
nakSatras more. To be more accurate, it completes 
‘13 revolutions in 12 lunar months. Thus in 19 solar 


Corrections to Moon. 287 


years, there are 254 sidereal months and in 19 
lunar year. 19X13 = 247 sidereal months of moon. 


Thus difference in 2 cycles is 7 sidereal months 
= 7x 27 = 189 nakSatras. Thus we have 10 nakSatras 
per year for 18 years and 9 extra naksatra in one 
year 


1 solar year = 361 naksatra 
Leap year = 360 nakSatras 
1 lunar year == 351 nak$Satras ( = 13 x 27)

nakSatras. 

RtuSes in terms of nak$Satras is calculated by

i.e. 5 for each. To be more accurate it is 5- 38 


nakSatra. Thus calculation is to be started from 
Sravistha (Sravana + 38 parts of 1/38th i.e. complete 
dhanistha). Complete nakSatra divisions will be 
counted from Sravana at interval of 5 nakéatras 
each for every ayana (semester). Thus list of 
nakSatras is given at intervals of 5 nakSatras 
indicating only one letter from each nakSatra. This 
verse was deciphered brilliantly by Sri S.B. Diksita. 


According to moon nakSatra at start of year

D. Yajus Jyotisa : This is part of Yajurveda 
whose commentary by Somakara was available. It 
has 44 verses out of which 30 are common with 
Rk jyotisa Due to that reason, scholars have tried 
to combine these two into one text of 50 verses 
and interprate both on basis of 5 years yuga. 
However, Rk has 19 years yuga and yajus has 5 
years yuga. This has been ae in verse 31 of 

this text - 


(In a yuga) there are 61 sévana months, 62 
lunations and 67 sidereal months i.e.. nakSatra 
masas; 30 days make one savana month and 30-1/2 
days make one solar month. This along with verse 
4 tells that we have one adhika masa after every 
2-1/2 years - clearly ‘specify a 5 year yuga. This is 
the different meaning of this text. 


Adjustment of luni-solar years in this-system 
can be done on basis of two statements in 
contemporary texts. Mahabharata, Santi parva ch

Order of leap years is indicated by Patina: 
Brahmana (part of yajurveda) (3-10-4) which gives; 
list of years. 


(1) Sarhvatsara (2) Parivatsara (3) Iduvatsara , 
which is same as anuvatsara according to Madhava." 
(4) Idvatsara (5) Idavatsara and (6) Vatsara : 


This extra sixth vatsara is a sama or savana® 
year of 12 savana months (30 days each according . 
to verse 31) and comes after each yuga of 5 years! 
in a yuga in the above order. Thus each of the: 
five years is of 366 days and sixth year of 360 days , 
balance the extra days counted in the yuga. The } 
year after sama or vatsara may not be samvatsara, 
it will be decided according to tithi or nakéatra at ? 
beginning of year as defined in Rk jyotisa. Thus’ 
the ommitted years can be thought as dropped | 
years or kSaya years. Thus in a cycle of 5 yugas} 
of 25 years we drop six years including 3 leap | 
years whose adhikamasa also gets dropped in the | 
process. Thus we get 19 year yuga as before. But ; 
we get a simpler 5 year yuga. 


There is a difference of 4 hours 23 minutes | 
between vedanga cycle of 19 years and 19 solar 
sideral years. It we'add 8 years at the end of eight | 
19 years yugas, we get 160 years. The difference ‘ 
at that end reduces to 23 minutes only.

in mid point of aglesa started beginning of south

Assuming 1° precession in 72 years, this 
indicates Rk jyotisa in 2976 BC and yajus jyotisa 
in 2352 BC. However verse 3 of RVJ indicates that 
the theory was coming since long when these 
verses were composed. 


E. Gavam Ayana has been mentioned in 
Tattiriya samhitéa, Satapath brahmana, Gopatha 
brahmana and Baudhayana Srauta sitra. It indicates 
a 4 year yuga with 1 leap year according to Prof. 
R. Shama Sastri (1908 - gavam ayana) Accumulation 
of 1/4th day of each of previous 3 years combined 
with 4th year to make one extra day like the Julian 
calender. Thus this is a cow with 4 legs or 3 parents 
of sun. Four years of this yuga were called kali, 
dwapara, treta and krta yuga. These are also called 
Ist, 2nd, 3rd and complete (krta). Krta is also called 
Satya or Rta i.e. which really came (as a full day) 
If year or yuga starts in evening, Ist year (kali) 
will end at midnight after 365-1/4 days (sleeping 
time). 2nd year dvapara will end in morning (rising 
time) on 366th day. 3rd year Treta will end on 
366th day noon, when sun is at highest. 4th year 
krta or satya will end in evening when people are 
moving. Thus Aitareya Brahmana tells - sleeping 
is kali, rising is dvapara, standing is treta and 
moving is krta, so keep on moving (7-15). This is 
attributed to Manu. This was around 23,720 B.C. 
as Taittiriya sarnhita indicates (7-4-8) vasanta at 
Phalguna full moon. Rk veda indicates rains in 

fgasira nak§atra indicating same time.

(10) Indian Eras : 

(A) The eras started after kali era are based 
on concept of Mahayuga of 43,20,000 years or a 
kalpa of 1000 mahayuga. Yuga concept is attributed 
to Aryabhata in 499 AD and kalpa concept to 
Brahmagupta in 627 AD. However, Brahmagupta 
refers to Visnudharmottara Purana. Smrtis also 
have been referred to. Aryabhata himself has 
followed purana tradition, except to treat four parts 
of yuga as equal. The five limbs of calendar, known 
as paficafiga have already been explained in the 
previous chapter. Their brief definitions are given 
again 

(1) Vara - Runing weakday in a cycle of seven 
days. 

(2) NakSatra - NakSatra occupied by moon. 

This almost means one day and was most 
popular in mahabharata era to indicate a day (in 
Valmiki Ramayana also). 

(3) Tithi - Moon rise to moon. rise system was 
changed. Vedanga jyotisa started equal division of 
tithis depending on phases of moon. 

Moon — sun 

12° 

Quotients above 15 indicate krsna paksa and 
extra days beyond 15th are counted as tithi number. 
Hence Krsna tithi is called’ bahula divas’ (extra 
day) or ‘badi’ in short. Sukla tithi is called sudi - 
Suddha divasa. 

_ (4) Karana is half of tithi. In veda it was moon 
tise to moon set or vice versa. From vedanga jyotisa 
It is exactly half of tithi. 


Tithi = 


Moon — sun 
— @ 

Corresponding to 1 day = 2 karanas extra at j 
beginning of 19 yeear vaidika yuga, one karana at | 
each end of amavasya are omitted from running | 
cycle of seven karanas. These 4 are fixed karanas. | 
Remaining 56 karanas start from éukla Ist tithi 2nd : 
half in which seven karanas are repeated 8 times } 
in a month. 


(5) Yoga - It is only a mathematical concept. . 
It means sum of longitudes of sun and moon and . 
one cycle of 360° makes 27 yogas. Originally there : 
were only 2 yogas. Vyatipata was when kranti of ! 
sun and moon were equal but their longitude was ; 
equal and in opposite directions. When longitude . 
is same but kranti is equal and opposite, it was” 
called ‘vaidhrti’. Thus yoga was means to calculate : 
these and subsequently others were included to 
make a complete cycle of 27 yogas like 27 nakSatras. 

There is another kind of yoga which is

B. Rules for calender - 


(1) A lunar month stars from Sukla 1 (called 
ananta) or from Krsna 1 tithi called Pdarnimanta. 
Lunar month is named after the nakSatra ap- 
proximately occupied by moon on ptrnima of that 
month. Amanta is called mukhya and other gauna. 

(2) A solar month starts with entry of madhya 
surya in a nirayana raéi (i.e. fixed point of zodiac). 
The first day of month may start on same day, 


Corrections to Moon 295 


next day or 3rd day according to occurrance of 
sankranti in different parts of day or night. 

(3) In luni-solar year a lunar year tallies with 
a particular sankranti of sirya every year. In a 
lunar month when there is no sankranti the month 
is called adhika masa. The month having two 
sanknantis, is called kSaya masa, the month 
corresponding to 2nd sankranti of the month is 
dropped. KSaya masa is called amhaspati. The 
adhika masa before it is called sansarpa (or in Ist 
ayana uttarayana of the year). The adhika masa 
after kSaya masa or in 2nd ayana is called 
malimluca. 


(4) Uttarayana starts when sun starts its 
northward journey after winter solstice or sayana 
makara sarmmkranti (24th or 25th December). 
DakSsinayana starts when sun starts going south 
from summer solstice i.e. sayana mithuna sankranti 
(26 June). A year may start with start of uttarayana 
as in vedanga jyotisa or from equinox in uttarayana 
- vernal equinox which is middle point of 
uttarayana. Instead of exact equinox point of 
uttarayana, we count entry into fixed zodiac raési 
which follows 23 days later at present. 


C. Rules for sankranti 

(1) In Orissa, solar month begins on same 
day as sankranti of madhyama sirya, irrespective 
of the part of day (sun rise to sun rise) it falls in. 

(2) Tamil rule - If sankranti takes place before 
Sunset the solar month begins on same day, 
Otherwise from next day. 

(3) Malabara rule - In parahita system of 
Kerala, if sanikranti takes place before lapse of 3/5th 


296 


of duration of day (i.e. about 18 ghati or 7h / 12m jj 
after sunrise - about 1-12 p.m.), month starts on | 
the same day, otherwise from next day. 

(4) Bengal rule - When sankranti takes place 
before midnight, month starts from next day, if it | 
is after midnight, then from third day (next to next ‘ 
day). 

If sankranti is within 1 ghati of mid night, | 
i.e. 24 minutes before or after, tithi at sunrise time. 
is examined. If sankranti is before lapse of that 
tithi then month starts on next day. If it is after. 
tithi then from 3rd day. For karka and makara | 
sankranti this rule is not followed. 


D. Eras started in India - 


Eras of long period have been described in 
all old civilisations. They describe three great 
floods. After one great flood Brahma appeared and 
started the civilization. Then saptarsis were born, 
rule of Daitya, Deva and Danava followed. That 
may be called Deva yuga. 

Devayuga ended with another great flood in 
which rudiments of life were preserved by Manu. 
(or Nuh). After re-settlement human eras began. 
These were formed into a cycle of 12,000 divya 
years, 1/10th was kaliyuga, 2, 3, 4 times were 
dvapara, treta and krtayuga (or satyayuga). 

There was another era called saptarsi era 
which is equal to 2700 divya versa, assuming that 
they remain in one nakSatra for 100 such. years. 
Another count in Vayupurana mentions saptarsi 
yuga as 3030 manusa varsa. Thus divya varsa 
appears to be solar sidereal year of 365-1/4 days 
and manusa varsa is sidereal lunar year of 327.4 


Corrections to Moon 297 


days. These values give the above ratio of values 
given in Vayu purana. 

Each yuga was further divided into sub parts, 
like Vayu purana indicates 24 parts of treta yuga 
and great personalities have been named in each 
part. Each part considered equal, parts of Treta 
were of 150 years each. Dvapara had 28 parts = 
2400 solar years = 85.7 years approx. It is more 
convenient to keep 4 parts as sandhi periods after 
treta and after dvapara. Then each part is of 1 
century, i.e. 1 nakSatra of saptarsi. Some cor- 
roborating quotations for this time scale are - 


(1) Megasthenese quoted by Pliny (Indika of 
Arian ch IX) 

From the days of Father Bacchus to Alexander 
the Great, their (Indian) kings are reckoned at 154 
whose reigns extend over 6451 years and 3 months 
(Pliny} 

‘Father Bacchus was the first who invaded 
India and was the first of all who triumphed over 
the vanquished Indians. From him to Alexander 
the Great, 6451 years 3 months.....reign by 153 
kings in intermediate period (Solin) 

From the time td Dionyson (or Bacchus) to 
Sandrokottos, the Indians counted 153 kings and 
a period of 6042 years. Among these a republic 
was thrice established, another for 300 and 120 
years. 

Nete - Bacchus is mentioned in Bible, becomes 
Dionyson .in Greek. This is -derived from 
‘Danusiinu’ (son of Danu third wife of Kasyapa - 
or danava) or Vipracitti (Bacchus). Herodotus has 
Stated that Bacchus was called Orotol in old Arabic. 
This is derived from Vipracitti. 


298 Siddhanta Darpape! : 


(2) Among sons of pabyape prajapati, eldest. i 
were born from Diti called Daitya. Next were from: § 
Aditi called Aditya or deva. Daitya were earlier © 
and first to rule over world, hence they were called .' 
‘purvadeva’. Last were born from youngest wife 
Danu_ called danava.: Daitya and danava were 4 
called asura and they were anti to deva or Sura. : 
Herodotus writes on basis of Egypiian priests (part .’ 
1, p.136) - 

The twelve gods were, they affirm, produced .; 
from the eight and of these twelve Hercules is one. - 
Hercules belongs to the second class, which consists: - 
of twelve gods and Bacchus belongs to the gods : 
of the third order (P.199). “s 


Note - Hercules is derived from ‘sura kulega’ - 
i.e.. Visnu. One form of Visnu. was vamana, ‘° 
youngest of the twelve adityas, who conquered | 
Bali. 


‘Daitya Hiranya kaSipu = Zeus 

Prahlada = Epaphos = Libye 
' Virocana = Beor 

Bali = Bala = Bel = Baalim 


Bana Candrama = Cadmus 


Greek names are according to Pedigree by 
Nounos (1-377), Bible Duternomy 23-4 tells - they 
hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor 
of Mesopotamia. In Jesus 3/7 and 6/28,30, it is 
called Baalum and Baal.

(3) Floods - Encyclopaedia of Religion and 
Ethics - 

Article on ages - The cuneiform texts mention 
kings before the flood in opposition to kings after 
the flood. In times before the flood, there lived 
the heroes, who (Gilgames Epic) well in the under 
world, or like. the Babylonian Noah, are removed 
into the heavenly world. At that time, there lived, 
too, the (seven) sages. 


Berosus, priest of Marduk temple of Babylon 
under rule of Selucus writes - There were 86 kings 
after flood in first family who ruled for 34,090 
years. Then 5 more families ruled one after the 
other. 


It is note worthy that among the south 
Amercian Indians, it is generally held that the 
world has already been destroyed twice, once by 
fire and again by flood; as among the eastern 
Tupies and Aravaks of Guiana. 


Saving of civilisation from flood in a great 
boat has been described in south America also 
Tales of Cochiti Indians - Bureau of American 
Ethnology. Bulletin 98 page 2-3. 

(4) Herodotus writes on basis of Egyptian 
calculations - (part 1 page 189) 

Seventeen thousand years (from the birth of 
Hercules) passed before the reign of Amasis. And 


even from Bacchus, youngest of the three, they 
count fifteen thousand years.

E. Eras since Kali (i) King Yudhisthira 
ascended throne after Mahabharata war and the 
time since then is counted as Yudhisthira Saka. 
Varahamihira writes in Brhatsamhita that according 
to old Garga, Saptarsi were in Magha during the 
reign of Yudhisthira. 36 years after that kali era 
started with death of Krsna 


(2) Kali era - It started 36 years after 
Mahabharata war on the day Krsna died. After 
some months Yudhisthira relinquiished his throne. 
According to Alberuni (part 3 p.239), it started on 
13th tithi of Aégvina. There are thousands of 
documents mentioning this era. All text books 
count the day from kali beginning. Accordingly, it 
starts on 17/18-2-3102 B.C. Ujjain midnight on 
Friday. Its months are both Caitradi (luni solar) 
and mesadi (solar). Year expired in kali era is 
obtained by adding 3179 to Saka year. 


(3) Saptarsi era - It was also called laukika 
kala and Sastra kéla in Rajatarangini where it has 
been followed as the standard. This era began on 
Caitra Sukla Ist tithi in kali year 27. Saptarsis remain 
for 100 years in one nakSatra and after each century 
in a nakSatra the years are counted afresh. Era is 
mentioned merely by the nakSatra name in which 
saptarsi remain. Thus years are found by adding 
46 to Saka era, neglecting the centuries. 


(4) Old Saka era of Varadhamihira - Brhat- 
samhita 13/3 tells that Saka starts 2526 years after 


Corrections to Moon 301 


king Yudhisthira. This is 554 before Vikrama era. 
According to this Saka era, time of Varahamihira 
was 427, i.e. 127 years before Vikrama era. (epoch 
of Pancasiddhantika) He himself writes in kutthala 
manjari that he was in beginning of Vikrama 
samvat. Traditionally he is reputed to be one of 9 
wise men with Vikramaditya who started Vikrama 
samvat. Such a great astronomer was needed to 
start the new era since Vikrama, Sri S.B. Diksita 
also has stated in his history of Indian Astronomy 
vol II. p.2 that the siddhantas mentioned in 
pancasiddhantika belong to 5th century before Saka 
era (new). Thus his epoch of 427 old Saka is a 
convenient period about 100 years before Vikrama, 
not his time. The subject matter also is much older 
than Aryabhata during whose time the older, 
theories were extinct. 

(5) Sadraka or Sri Harsa samvat - (2644 Kali) 
Sudraka was also called Sri Harsa who was a king 
of Andhra Kula. Albiruni (chapter 49) has written 
that Sri Harsa was 400 years before Vikrama. 


Ain - Akbari (description of Ujjaini) tells that 
difference between Aditya Ponwara (Sadraka) and 
Vikramaditya of Vikrama era was 422 years. 

Yalla in his Jyotisa Darpana (Saka new 1307) 
has written amnferqreetat (2345 or 2645) qxare: Serta: 
Taking 2645 as correct version, Sadraka era started 
in kali 2645 or 399 years before Vikrama. 


This Sidraka has written ‘Mrcchakatikam’ a 
famous drama. He ruled over Malwa, Kannauja, 
KaSmira etc. After 400 years, 2nd Vikram samvat 
became more popular and this era was forgotten. 


302 


This samvat was also called Krta samvat. King | 


Samudragupta has written that (Krsna Carita) 


‘His rule was rule of law and religious, Hence 
his era was caled Krta samvat.’ 


oat MA 


This was written as Malava samvat because ;: 


of its start in Malava. 


Jain Acarya Hemacandra also has mentioned 
that rule of Sidraka was famous for righteousness 
(KavyanuSasana - Bombay edition p.464). 

(6) Parad samvat - This is Indian name of 
Parthian era or Arsacid era starting in 246 B.C. in 
Iran. This was in use in West India. 


(7) Vikrama Samvat (kali 3044) - This was also 
called Sahasanka year. All Gupta kings used 
Vikram name, so this is connected with one of 
them. In old geneology, Samudragupta is con- 
sidered 93 years after Vikramaditya of Avanti (or 
Ujjain). In north India, it is Caitradi with 
purnimanta months. In Gujarat it is kartikadi and 
months are amanta. Jain inscriptions have called it 
Gupta era also. 

(8) Christian era started with British rule in 
India. 

(9) Salivahana Saka (78 A:D. - Alberuni has 
written (part-3) - One Saka king ruled in areas 
around Sindha river and through his tyranny he 
tried to destroy the Hindu culture. He was either 
a Sudra of north west border or from a western 
foreign country. In the end, one king from east 
came and expelled him. After killing Saka king he 
was called Vikramaditya and another era started 
with him. 


303 


This Vikramaditya might have been Skan- 
dagupta according to purana chronology. 

This is most popular, among astronomers. 
Amaraja Brahmagupta, Bhaskara II, have written 
that, 3179 years of kali had passed at the end of 
Saka king. 

Alberuni tells that Gupta - Ballabha samvat 
started 241 years after Saka. Gupta empire lasted 
for 242 years. Thus Gupta empire and Saka kala 
started together. 

Mesadi solar years are followed in Tamil and 
Bengal and caitradi lunar year is followed else- 
where. Lunar months are purnimanta in north 
India and Améanta in south India. 

(10) Kalchuri era or Cedi era : Kings of Bhoja 
kula ruled in Cedi (present Bundelkhanda) 

Yallaya in Jyotisa darpana has written that 

Bhojaraja samvat = Saka year + 50 

According to this, it started in 28 AD or 85 
years after Vikrama era. 

Keelhorn assumes it to start in 255 AD. 
considering Narasinha deo of Kalinga and of Dahal 
(M.P.) as same person. This year started from 
‘Asvina Sukla 1. 

(11) Valabhi era - One Vallabha ended the 
rule of last Gupta king who was a tyrant and 
Started ths era in Saka 242. (This has already been 
mentioned in statement of Alberuni under para 9 
above), 

Vallabhi king Siladitya had dispute with a 
Merchant Ranka of his town. Ranka invited Hindu 

ing Hammira of Gajani (Afganistan). In a night

as Kollam (western) Andu (year). This is used in: 
Kerala and in Tirunelveli district. This is sidereal' 
solar year starting from solar month of Kanyéa in, 
north Mahabar and simha month in south. This. 
year runs in cycle of 1,000 years and present cycle 
is said to be fourth. It’s 4th cycle started in Saka 
747 or 824 A.D. According to Mahabharata, 
Parasuram was in sandhi of treta and dvapara (i.e. 
24th part). Thus ParasSurama must have been above 
5000 years before 824 AD, may be 6000 completed’ 
years. 


(14) Nevara year started in 878 AD, with 
Karttikadi amanta months. It was used in Nepal 
upto 1768 AD. 

(15) Calukya Era - Calukya king Tribhuvana 
Malla started this era in 997 AD. 

(16) Simha Samvat - It was started in Gujrat 
in 1170 AD. Months are amanta and start with 
Asadha. 

(17) Bangali Fasali etc - 

Bangali san started in 593 AD. It is solar year 
and ist month starting from mesa samkranti is 
called Vaisakha (it is called caitra elsewhere). All 
month names are lunar. 

Vilayati san started previous year with Kanya 
sankranti i.e. 7 months before Bangali san. The 
year is solar with lunar month names. This was 


305 


used in Orissa. Difference in rules of sankranti has 
already been explained. Amli Era also was used in 
Orissa with luni solar months. This year started 
from Bhadra sgukla 12th (the month of kanya 
sankranti), which is supposed to be birthday of 
kings Indradyumna of Orissa, in purana era. 


Fasali san was started by Akbar. This started 
with same year number as Hizri era but it was 
solar calender to tally with harvesting time. In 
north India, it started in 1556 AD with Hijri year 
963. In south India it started in 1636 AD when 
Hijri year had become 1046. Thus years in South 
India are 2 more. In north India, Fasali year started 
from Aégvina Krsna 1 pirnimanta. Then it was luni- 
solar. In Madras, it started with karka sarkranti. 
The initial date was fixed by British on 13th July 
in 1800 AD and from Ist July in 1855 A.D. 


(18) LakSmanasena Era - It is current in Mithila 
region of north Bihar. This is Karttikadi, amanta 
and started in 1118 A.D. 


(19), Raja Saka - It started on Jyestha gukla 
13th in Saka 1596 with coronation of Sivaji. 


(20) llahi Era - This was started by Akbar and 
also called Akbar san. It started on 14-2 - 1956 
A.D. with his coronation. Its years and months 
are solar. Month names were Persian starting with 
Farvardin and each day of month had a separate 
name as in Persia. 


(11) Festivals and Yogas in India 


A. Rules Festivals are generally based on tithis 
except sankranti days. As a tithi generally covers 
a period of two days, a tithi may be counted on 
day when it is current on sunrise. But for religious 
purposes it may have to be celebrated on the 
previous day when it begins. Tithi for feast or fast 


306 


is observed on the day in which it covers the: 
prescribed part. 


For such purposes, a day is divided into 5| 
parts between sun rise and sun set - 


(a) Pratah Kala - 6 ghatika from sunrise. 3 
(b) Satnjava - 6 to 12 ghatika from sunrise. 
(c) Madhyahna - 12 to 18 ghatika from sunrise. 
(d) Aparahna - 18 to 24 ghatika from sunrise. ; 
(e) Sayahna - 24 to 30 ghatikas from sunrise. ' 
Relevant parts of night are - 


swindled 


(a) 4 ghatikas before sunrise are called 
arunodaya or usakala 


(b) 6 ghatika after sunset are called pradosa . 


(c) 2 ghatika in middle of the night are called , 
nisitha - midnight 


A tithi is parva viddha when it commences 
more than 4 ghatikas before sunset of one day and. 
ends before sun set of the following day. A festival. 
on such a tithi is calebrated on the first day of; 
the tithi and not on the second. 


Tithi dvayam - when 2 tithis meet between’ 
18 and 24 ghatikas after sunrise, but a similar: 
meeting does not take place on next day. 


B. Festivals Connected with nakSatras as well 
as Tithis 


In southern India, nakSatras are often linked 
with solar months to observe a festival. Sravistha., 
with Lunar Sravana ‘makes upakarma. Tithi festivals: 
are also connected with solar months. When a 
Sukla pakSsa tithi falls twice in a solar month, the 
first is called a Sanya tithi and only the second is: 
celebrated.

Translation of Text (Chapter 6) 


Verses 1-3 - Scope - Now I (author) write 
accurate panjika for getting quick results in 
marriage, sacred thread ceremony, house construc- 
tion, yajfia and birth caremonies etc. With help of 
this, accurate position of sun and moon are known 
and kranti, Sara, lunar and solar eclipse, conjunc- 
tion of planet and nakSatra, rising and setting, 
mahapata, tithi, nakSatra, yoga and karana etc can 
be calculated. 


Old astronomers assumed maximum increase 
of 5 danda and decrease of 6 danda in a normal 
tithi of 6 danda. Due to this their pamjika was 
inaccurate, because actual increase or decrease limit 
of a tithi is much more. After describing rough 
panjika according to old school in last chapter, 
now I an explaining the method for accurate 
panjika. Calculation as per these rules will give 
correct time for auspicious works and the tithis etc 
can be actually seen. When direct observation 
proves the accuracy, no further logic is necessary 
in support of these rules. 


Mean sun and moon corrected only by 
mandaphala give correct position at amavasya and 
purnima. This has been described in previous 
chapter. 


Verses 4-6 - Need for further corrections 

Panjika has five limbs - vara, tithi, nakSatra, 
yoga and karana - so it is called pancanga. Except 
the first part vara, all others depends on sun and 
moon. Hence these will be accurate if sun and 
moon are accurate. Manda paridhi of moon and 
Sun is taken same for rough and accurate methods 


320 Siddhanta Darpana 


both. Hence sun and moon corrected by man-. 
daphala is called Ist (corrected) planet. 


From this Ist graha and Ist ravi sphuta 
gati, we calculate diameter of planet, time upto 
parva sandhi (i.e. pirnima or amavasy4a), bhuja, 
mandakarna and lambana correction of.sun. 

Motion of moon is very complicated. After’ 
long period of observation, I have thought it 
necessary to have 3 more correction in addition to 
mandaphala. These four corrections are - Manda, 
Tungantara, Paksika and digamSa. 
Verses 7-9 - Tungdantara correction 

Tungantara kendra = Candra Mandocca 

- (sphuta ravi + 3 rasi) - in SuklapakSa 

or = Candra mandocca - (sphuta ravi - 3 rasi) ' 

- in Krsna pakSa 

Find out bhuja jya of tungantara kendra. 

Tungantara bhujaphala (its bhuja jya) is; 
multiplied by 16 and divided by radius (3438). Then; 
it is multiplied by bhuja jya of difference of sphutal 
ravi and sphuta candra and again divided by, 
radius. . 

Result in kala etc. is multiplied by Ist candra 
sphuta gati and divided by madhya candra gati' 
(790'35”). Result in kala etc will be tungantara’ 
phala. When tungantara kendra is 0° to 180°, this; 
is added to Ist sphuta candra otherwise substracted.} 
We get second sphuta candra. , 
Verses 10-12 - Paksika phala 


Paksika Kendra = 2nd sphuta candra - sphuta} 
ravi. Lapsed and remaining parts of the kendra in 
its quadrant are found. Lesser of the two is 


Corrections to Moon 321 


converted to kala and multiplied by 2. Jya of the 
resulting angle is divided by the hara, to be 
calculated as below, gives pakSika phala in kala 
etc. When candra (2nd) is in Ist half of pakSa, 
paksika phala is added to 2nd candra, otherwise 
it is deducted. 

Paksika hara is found by substracting Ist 
sphuta sun separately from mandocca of surya and 
candra. Bhujajya of the two remainders is calculated 
and multiplied together. Product is divided by 180 
and to the quotient we add 90. Result is the hara 
for paksika phala. 


a 


Verse 13. DigamSa phala 


Mandaphala calculated from sphuta sun is, 
divided by 10; multiplied by sphuta candragati, 
and divided by madhya candra gati. Result is 
digamSa phala. The mandaphala being positive or 
negative, digamSa phala is added or substracted 
from 3rd sphuta candra. We get 4th sphuta candra 
which will be accurate position. 


Verses 14-15 : Reasons for correction - 


In plane surface snake moves in a wave like 
motion, but at the time of entering a hole, its 
motion becomes straight. Similarly, moon deviates 
from the mandocca resultant motion normally, but 
on purnima and amavasya, these deviations vanish 
and only mandocca effect remains. 


When snake enters a hole, its wavy motion 
ceases under pressure from narrow sides, but its 
Natural forward motion also is affected. Similarly 
On parvasandhi, moon is not affected by tungantara 
and paksika sanskara, but digamSa phala is still 
effective (in addition to mandaphala). 


322 Siddhanta Darpana 


Comments : Fortnightly veriations in orbit due . 
to sun effect are not evident on parvasandhi | 
(pirnima or amavasya) because sun, moon and . 
earth are in a straight line. Howevere, total . 
attraction of sun, varies according to its own: 
variation in distance, causing minor corrections of . 
digamsa phala. Parvasandhis are like a hole for. 
snake, hence the simili. 


Verse 16 - Rough and accurate correction for 
sun - For correcting accurate sphuta of ravi, 
accurate chart should be used and for rough 
sphuta, rough chart is used. Use in reverse order 
will create errors. 


Verses 17-21 - Accurate sphuta gati of candra - 


Accurate tungantara phala is multiplied by 
radius (3438) and divided by Jya of difference 
between Ist sphuta candra and accurate sphuta 
ravi. Result is multiplied. by kotijya of difference 
of (Ist sphuta ravi - candra) and divided by radius: 
(3438). Result added to Ist sphuta candra gati phala' 
gives 2nd gati phala. This is added when manda: 
kendra is 90° to 270°, otherwise substracted. 

Paksika phala in kala etc. is squared and; 
deducted from the square of maximum pak$ika: 
phala. Square root of remainder is multiplied by: 
difference of 2nd candragati and sphuta siitya gati' 
and divided by half radius (1719). Result is added: 
to 2nd gati when candra is in Ist half of éukla’ 
pakéa or 2nd half of krsna pakga. Otherwise, it is, 
deducted. This is third sphuta gati of moon. This 
‘third gati will be accurate. Difference of sphuta 
candra on two successive days also gives sufficiertt- 


Corrections to Moon 323 


ly accurate gati for calculation of tithi and auspi- 
cious works. 


Comments : Corrections have already been 
explained in the introduction of this chapter. This 
explains the change of speed due to two paksika 
variations due to sun’s attraction. Last correction 
is due to change in distance of sun which is 
negligible within a day and correction is not needed 
for ralready small effect. 


Tungantara phala = - 160’ cos (@—a) Sin (D-0) 
where D = moon corrected for mandaphala, 
0= . Longitude of sun, 


@ = mandocca of moon. 


For a short period, only D is variable which 
is position of moon. 


Hence speed due to this correction is PY

Thus we get the formula 

PakSika phala = 38'12” Sin 2 (D-9), 38’12” =

it is good for daily use. But adverse moments like #

Verse 23 : Phases of moon 


Sun deducted from moon gives the kendra, . 
when this kendra is in ist 6 raéi i.e. 0° to 180°, it~ 
is Sukla pakgSa. When moon is ahead of ravi by ~ 
180° to 360° it is krsna pakSa.First 3 rasis are Ist-: 
half of Suklapaksa, then upto 6 raéis it is 2nd half © 
of Sukla pakSa. Similarly in krsna pakéa, Ist half : 
is from 6 to 9 ragis and 2nd half is from 9 to 12:3 
rasis. One fourth of every pakSa (i.e. 45° difference) 
is called pakSa pada (quarter). 


Verses 24-26 - More.correct motion of moon - 


. Now I am telling more accurate motion of: 
moon which needs to be calculated for eclipse. For : 
this gati, we find gata and gamya kala (lapsed and , 
remaining) times of parvanta (purnima or | 
amavasya). From that, true moon is found out. 
From this sphuta gati, sparsa, mokéa, sthiti etc. 
periods of eclipse are accurately known. i 


First gatiphala is kept in. two places. At one? 
place it is multiplied by parama tungantara phala ‘ : 
(160) and divided by parama mandaphala (300’50”), : 
At second place it is multiplied by Ist sphuta gati: 
and divided by madhyagati (790’35”). Result of: 
both places are added. The sum is added to. 
madhyama gati of candra when manda kendra is: 


Corrections to Moon 325 


in 6 raSis starting from karka (90°-270°), otherwise 
it is deducted. This is true mean speed of moon. 


This is again kept at two places. At one place, 
sphuta surya gati is substracted and divided by 
half of hara. Here Hara = bhuja of (candra 
mandocca - saukSma sirya) x Bhuja of (ravi man- 
docca - sikSma ravi+ 180° + 90°. Quotient is added 
to the true mean motion of moon at second place. 
Sum is true motion of moon.

Gatiphala of Tungantara is

Remaining terms are second order corrections

Second step of correction amounts to paksika 
correction as stated earlier after verse 21. 


326 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verse 27 - Accurate panjika - Use of one 
rough panjika for normal works and another 
accurate panjika for important works will not be 
appreciated by anybody. Hence only accurate 
panjika should be used, even though it involves 
- hard labour. It alway deserves more respect. 


Verse 28 - Definition’ of true planet - We are 
on the surface of earth. The point of sky where 
line from earth’s interior centre to our location 
point on surface meets is called ‘svastika’ (vertically 
upward point). When the planet is seen on the 
great circle from kadamba (pole of ecliptic) through 
svastika and calculated position of graha on ecliptic, 
graha is called spasta. 


Note - This will be explained fully in chapter 
7 and lambana sarskara for solar eclipse. (Chapter 
9) 


Verse 29-31 : Need for calculating true planet - 


According to old teachers, all auspicious works 
are done only according to this true graha. For 
this purpose bhagana and bija corrections are done 
to the planet. 


For daily and- special works of vaidika and 
smartta type, true position of ali planets are 
needed. But correction to moon is needed more,’ 
because pancanga is based on moon’s position. 
Hence, accurate corrections like tungantara, pakSika 
and digaméa etc. have been thought of. 


Even after these three sanskaras, there is 
difference of 2-3 palas (upto 1 minute) in the 
calculated and observed position of moon. But it 
is preferable to error of upto 14 ghati (about 6 
hours) which will occur without these corrections. 


Corrections to Moon 327 


Only Brahma can know how to eliminate this small 
error. 

Note : Though these corrections are great 
improvement, some error will always remain. Error 
withhin 1 minute is sufficient for day to clay work. 
More accurate position is needed for scientific 
works. Every formula will give some error, though 
it is about 1/10 seconds or less in modern methods. 


Verse 32-33 : Lambana and Sara 


A planet will be seen in different position, 
when seen from earth’s centre (which is calculated) 
and when seen from surface (where we are 
located). ” 


The angular difference between two position 
is called lambana. (In vertical position, it is already 
in line from earth centre to surface, hence lambana 
will be nil). 

Distance of the planet from kranti vrtta along 
great circle from pole of ecliptic (kadamba) to centre 
of planetary disc (also passing through svastika - 
vertical up point) is called Sara or vikSepa. 

Calculation of lambana and Sara is called 
drk-karma (change of axis). This is needed only 
for lunar and solar eclipse and conjunction of 
planets. In that context only, it will be calculated. 
It is not needed for calculation of tithi and nakSatra 
etc, 


Verses 34-39 : Authorities on need of true 
planets - Vrhatsarnhita (Varahamihira) has stated - 
If grahana occurs before calculated time, then 
damage to foetus or child in womb, or war with 
weapons occurs. If it occurs after calculated time, 


328 Siddhanta Darpana 


then damage to crops, loss of flowers and fruits 
and fear for people occurs. 


Garga samhita states - The result of having 
eclipse before or after calculated time has already 
been stated. Persons knowing true planets, never 
have error in timing. If every (astronomical) event 
occurs according to calculated time, then enemies 
of kings are destroyed and troubles cease. People 
become happy, being free from fear and disease. 


Vasistha states (not known in which text) - 
Tithi etc. should be decided according to that 
theory only which gives true position of planets. 


Sakalya samhita states - Corrections to calcu- 
lated position of planets should be done after 
observing them through instruments like nalika 
(tube or telescope) gola (mirrors or sphere), turiya 
(Fourth - compound telescope). Correction of 
observed error is called bija sanskara. After that 
correction only, all rules will be correct. Result of 
direct observation (pratyakSa) cannot be ignored. 


What is use of the gold ornament which cuts 
the ears ? Similarly what is the use of that Sastra 
whose results are not actually seen ? 


Verses 40-42 : No need of lambana for tithi cal- 
culation 


The people who talk of lambana for calculation 
of tithi etc, do not know its meaning. Explaining 
them is like talking to a deaf. 


Spasta graha is known from the point of 
intersection of line from earth centre to the planet, 
when the graha is seen at that place, it is called 
spasta (or true) planet. 


329 


If graha is seen from earth’s surface, tithi will 
be different for different places due to separate 
Jambana corrections. hence tithi needs to be 
calculated from earth centre, so that it is same all 
ove the world. 


Verses 43-46 : Bija sanak4ra - 


When graha is. not same as per ganita 
(calculation) and drk (observatoin), it cannot be 
used for auspicious works. So I describe the bija 
karma, i.e. corrections to calculated position to tally 
it with observed position. 

Bhaskracarya (in Bijopanayana) has stated - 
After daily observations of moon, I have observed 
that moon is seen 112’ lipta east or west from its 
calculated position. These are the minimum or 
maximum values of Bija. 


In Sarya siddhanta -. Sun himself has stated 
in the end that he was explaining bija for good of 
the world even though it was a secret; after praying 
to gods and vedas. 

In Brahma-sphuta siddhanta - Graha ganita 
(calculation from planetary theory) as told by 
Brahma himself was lost (became erroneous) after 
lapse of long time. So Brahma gupta, son of Jisnu, 
seeks to correct it with bija-sanskara. 


Verse 47-52 : Origin of Tungadntara correction - 


The error in calculated position of moon upto 
112’ lipta (stated by Bhaskara) is probably due to 
distance of moon from ecliptic, so it should be 
Telated to the maximum vikéepa (281’ lipta). 
Because, after adding 3 raSis of sayana moon, Jya 
Of its kranti is 1370’. This multiplied by maximum 


330 . Siddhanta Darpana 


viksepa and divided by radius (3438) gives 112 
kala. This is the same amount which is found by 
calculating difference between calculated planet and 
observed planet. 


Bhaskarcayra has called it Ayana drk--karma, 
there are different types of Ayana karma in other 
siddhantas. So it should be called a bija sanskara. 
I have called it parama tungantara phala. 


It appears from drk-karma of Bhaskaracarya 
that maximum value of tungantara sanskara is 
continuing since long ago. According to ancient 
teachers, it fluctuates, so they have advised to 
correct moon with bija sanskara. 


To know the change in maximum value of 
tungantara phala, moon will be corrected after one 
thousand years. The error from true moon will 
give the value of change. 


Notes : Candrasekhara has not understood 
the theory or reasons behind this tungantara 
correction, But from the nature of variations, he 
has correctly assumed the position of maximum 
deviation and hence has got the correct formula. 


Verses 53-57 - Variations in duration of tithi - 


A tithi which includes aparahna of two 
consecutive days has beeen called sukséma tithi in 
smrtis. Thus such a tithi has more than 66 dandas 
(as aparahna period is 6 danda and a day is of 60 
dandas). 

According to smrti, if tithi just touches one 
evening and is over before first half of day, then 
the sraddha of that day should be done on next 
day. It should be over by ‘kutupa’ of next day. 


Corrections to Moon 331 


(Here ‘Kutupa’ means 8th muhiartta of the day 
time out of 15 muhiartta = 30 dandas between 
sunrise to sunset). Thus tithi = saéyahna 6 danda 
+ night 30 danda + half day time 15 danda = 51 
danda. 

Gautama smrti has stated - If in sayahna 
(evening) of caturdasi (Krsna pak§Sa), amavasya 
starts and is over before midday, then Sraddha 
should begin in kutupa muhirtta (14 to 16 dandas 
from sunrise) and should be over by rohana 
muhurtta (12-14 danda after sunrise) on next day. 
This is called amavasya $§raddha. 


In Sukla and krsna pakéa, on 7th, 8th and 
Sth - the three middle tithis, maximum difference 
in tithi duration is less than 6 danda. So these 
tithis have only 5 types of classifications - the 6th 
category of above six danda difference from 60 
danda doesn’t exist. Other 12 tithis in both pakSa 
have 6 types of class. If smrtis are interpreted in 
this manner, there is no error in drk siddha (true) 
calculations. 


Ancient teachers, didn’t observe the daily 
location of moon in constellations. With rough 
calculation, there is variations in middle tithis also 
upto 14 dandas (i.e. I 7 danda from average). But 
they had strived for accuracy, only at the end of 
a pakSa when wrong eclipse time will cause insult 
to the astronomer. 


Notes - Traditional view about variation of 
tithi is ‘Bana vrddhi, rasakSayah’ i.e. increase upto 
> dandas and decrease upto 6 danda. This gives 
tithi limit from 54 to 65 dandas. But Candrasekhara 


332 


has found corroboration from smrtis that it is # 


actually from 51 to over 66 dandas. 


Verses 58-67 : Sikéma nakéatra of unequal 
divisions - Now I explain the method to calculate 


sukSma nakSatra (unqeual divisions) for use in :: 


journey, marriage and sacred thread ceremoney etc 
as decided by sages like Garga, VaSistha. 

Mean motion of moon in a day (790’35”) is 
the extent of suk$ma nakSatra. One and half times 
this value is the extent of these six nakSatras equal 
to (1185’52”18”’) - (4) Rohini (7) Punarvasu (16) 
Anuradha and three Uttara nakSatras (12) Uttara 
phalguni (21) Uttarasadha (26) Uttara Bhadrapada. 

Half extent (395'17”26”’) is of the six nakéatras 
(9) Aglesa (15) Svati (18) Jyestha and (24) Satabhisa 

Remaining 15 nakSatras have unit extent 
(790’'35”). Deducting the total of these 27 nakSatras 
(21345’41”5”’) from kalas of full circle (21,600), 
remainder (254’18”35”’) is the extent of Abhijita 
which comes between (21) Uttarasadha and (22) 
Sravana. 


We substract the kala of as many nakSatras 


from sphuta graha as it is possible. It is the number ' 


of completed nakSatras. Remainder (gata) kala of 
the graha is the lapsed part of current nakSatra. 
This part deducted from full extent of current 
nakSatra gives remaining part (gamya or bhogya 
kala). Gata and bhogya kala, separately multiplied 
by 60 and divided by sphuta ‘gati of graha, give 
the lapsed or remaining time of the graha in current 
nakSatra. 


Each of the 28 nakSatras of unit, half, one 
half length or Abhijit being divided by 4 gives its 
one pada (quarter). 


Corrections to Moon 3353 


As per rough rule, rasi of 1800 kala contains 
9 nakSatra pada (27 nakSatras excluding Abhijit 
have 27 X 4 = 108 pada = 12 rasi X 9). Thus 108 
pada in 12 ra$is are according to mean equal values 
of nakSatras. With siksma rule, 1 rasi doesn’t have 
complete number of nakSatra padas. 


For example, at the end of 4 rasis 4 X 9 = 
36 nakSatra pada or 36 + 4 = 9 nakSatra till Aslesa 
will be completed and 5th rasi sirhha should start 
with 10th nakSatra. But according to sukséma 
calculation magha nakSatra starts 8° before simha 
rasi itself. 


Notes : (1) There are three measures of a 
pancanga for approximately one civil day. Week 
days are for fixing current routine of work and a 
day more than seven days ago or in future is not 
referred by the week day. Thus in modern 
university history books, even for modern eras, 
week days do not figure. This doesn’t mean that 
use of week days is not common in modern days. 
Due to temporary nature of weekdays, and use for 
astrology only, they have not mentioned in 
histories of Ramayana and Mahabharata and in 
vedas. This should not mean that week days were 
not known in ancient India, as it is concluded by 
so called modern scholars. Another weakness of a 
week day is that it starts from local sunrise time 
in Indian system (local midnight in Gregorian or 
christian calender, local evening in Jewish and 
Islamic calender). Thus in all systems, it starts at 
different time at different places. Thus it cannot 
be made a world rference. 


(2) Technically, tithi starts on same time all 
over the world. But for civil purposes, only. the 
tithi current at sunrise is counted, hence it may 


334 


be useful for religious functions, but civil tithi will 
be different in different places. Another defect is! 4 
that it is a mathematical calculation, even when’ 
_moon has risen, only the approximate tithi can be‘ 
known from its phase by rough eye estimate.. 
However, nakSatra can be measured more accurate-: 
ly even with seeing moon’s position among stars} 
by naked eye. Even for calculation purpose, it# 
doesn’t suffer the errors in finding true position s 
of moon, as it can be seen by direct observation.: 

This is the reason that all the important events in’ 
Mahabharata, Ramayana and Purana are indicated ' 

by nakSatra of moon (instead of tithi) in addition , 
of the lunar month. This is evident to the whole* 
public and easily identifiable time in distant future. | 


(3) When nakéatra extent is made exactly equal; 
to the mean motion of moon in one day, some: 
part of the full circle will be left out as the moon: 
takes more than 27 days for a siderial revolitions. } 
Thus 27 nakSatra equivalent to 27 days motion of} 
moon, doesn’t cover the circle completely and a! 
small 28th nakSatra abhijit is introduced equivalent ; 
to extra time beyond 27 days taken in moon’s; 
sidereal revolution. 


Reason of unequal division is that, along the! 
path of moon in sky, inclined at 5° angle with; 
path of ecliptic, sufficient bright stars are not! 
available for all nakgatra divisions. The three vacant! 
places were identified with their preceding star’ 
groups causing division of 3 nakSatras in parva; 
and uttara parts - Phalguni, as4dha and bhadrapada | 
(or prostha pada - old name). These three vacant! 
places and 3 other star groups having lesser gapS' 
- were given 1-1/2 times the length. Correspond- | 


Corrections to Moon 335 


ingly, the length of 6 nakSatras was reduce to half 
to compenisate the excess. 


(4) Visvamitra made equal divisions for each 
of 27 nakSatras and further divided them into 124 
parts each for accurate calculations of solar and 
lunar nakSatras at the end of day, pakéa or half 
year. Thus he created a different nakSatra system 
- which is proverbial creation of stars by him. This 
has been explained in introduction, while explain- 
ing vedanga jyotisa. Corresponding to 24 original 
nakSatras, there are 24 letters in a Gayatri chanda. 
But with 3 extra nakSatras by division of 3 into 
purva uttara parts, 3 extra letters (vyahrtis) were 
added to Gayatri mantra whose sage is ViSvamitra, 
making 27 letters in it. This corroborates the view 
that number of verses in Rk veda and number of 
letter in its chandas are based on astronomical 
measurements at regular intervals. This unequal 
division will be more clear when longitudes of 
identifying stars are discussed. 


Verses 68 - 71 - Sankranti i.e. crossing from 1 
division to another 

Exact point of sankranti of a rasi is when 
centre point of a planet’s disc reaches the last point 
of the rasi. This sukSma sankramana is known by 
name of rasi which is to be entered, not the past 
rasi. Complete sankranti period is the time taken 
by complete disc of graha from touching the border 
point to its complete crossing. To find the 
Sankramana kala, drameter of graha bithba (disc) 
in vikala is divided by graha gati in kala. 
Sankramana kala is obtained in danda etc. Within 


336 


sankranti period, surya gives very favourable: 
results. 

Planets give mixed results of both rasis during 
sankranti period. Similarly while crossing over from: 
one nakSatra to the next, as long as the border’ 
point is covered by bimba (disc) of the planet, it: 
gives results of both the nakSatras. 

Candra bimba (disc) in Vikala, separately: 
being divided by (1) difference of ravi and candra. 
gati (2) candragati, (3) sum of candra and ravi gati, 
gives respectively the sandhi time of (i) tithi or 
karana (2) nakSatra and (3) yoga. 


Verses 72-74 - Different circles - Due to effects: 
of ucca, kranti and pata, many circular orbits are 
formed. 


Orbit due to attraction of sighra and manda 
ucca is called pratimandala (eccentric circle - 
explained in previous chapter). Path of kranti is’ 
called apamandala (to be explained in 
Triprasnadhikara). 

Due to deviation of graha from kranti vrtta 
due to pata, another circle vimandala is formed 
which is path of pata (apamandala and vimandala 
are great circles perpendicular to ecliptic and will 
be explaiend in next chapter. 


Verses 75-91 : Precession of ecliptic and 
Ayanamsa 

Point of intersection of kranti vrtta (ecliptic 
plane of sun’s orbit) and visuva vrtta is.called pata 
which moves in the opposite direction to the 
normal motion of planets. Completed revolutions 
(bhagana) of pata in a kalpa are (6,40,170) as 
observed by the author. 


Corrections to Moon 337 


This pata is above all planets and circle of 
nakSatras (slowest rotation indicates farthest dis- 
tance). This moves the nakSatra vrtta from east to 
west in plane of kranti vrtta. 

When this pata is in six rasis beginning with 
mesa (0° to 180°), it takes the nakSatra and planets 
etc 27° towards east. When it is in six raSis starting 
from tila (180° to 360°), it takes the nakéatras etc 
27° towards west. 


Due to this pata, planets like ravi and 
nakSatras starting with Aésvini are seen towards 
north or south from ecliptic even on the position 
of 0° kranti. 

To find out kranti pata for desired day, kalpa 
revolutions of kranti pata are multiplied” by 
ahargana and divided by savana dinas in a kalpa 
(i.e. 15,77, 91, 78, 28, 000). We get the complete 
revolution numbers and from remainder raéi etc. 
of kranti pata. 

The result in rasi etc is substracted from 12 
raSi and remainder is converted to bhuja according 
to quadrant and then to kala. Bhuja kala divided 
by 200 is called calanga. This is also called 
ayanaméa. 

Raminder after division by 200, is multiplied 
by 60 and divided by 200. We get kala of ayanaméa. 
Motion of ayanamSa in one day is 9/28 para etc. 
At the beginning of karanaba (1869 AD, mesa 
sankranti at Lanka), ayanarnSa was 22°1'51”45”’42”” 
etc, 

When krantipata is in six rasis beginning with 
tula, then ayanamSa is negative and, when in six 
tasis beginning with mesa it is positive.

sankranti (sayana karka sankranti in uttarayana and . 
makara sankranti in dakSina ayana). 


Saptarsi, Agastya and Yama and the stars | 
close to them have no motion due to kranti pata 
(They are near north or south pole and very far ~ 
from ecliptic). Their motion in nakSatra mandala ~ 
towards east indicates that nakSatra circle has 
moved west wards. Seeing west ward motion of . 
Saptarsi etc means that nakSatra circle has moved . 
eastwards. With this concept, astronomers calculate :

Position of sun calculated from shadow 
(chaya) is different from mathematical position of 
true sun. This difference is ayanaméa. This 
ayanaméa is also moving eastwards. If calculated —

then ayanamSa is moving west wards.

Rates of Steady precession : Various quota- 
tions from puranas, brahmanas indicate different 
position of equinoxes. 


Regveda tells rains from Mrga naksatra (J-161- 
13). Taittiriya sarnhita (17-4-8) indicates vasanta at 
phalguna full moon. Both indicate a period of 
. 23,720 B.C. when equinox was 352° behind present 
position. . 

Valmiki Ramayana indicates demon dynasty 
with Mula nakSatra at vernal equinox. This should 
occur at 17000 B.C. which tallies with Egyptian 
countings mentioned by Herodotus. It also tells 
beginning of Iksvaku dynasty with vernal eqninox 
at visakha at about 15080 B.C. This was the time 
of great deluge which is correct as per geology 
and sumerian records. _ 


Mahabharata indicates fall of pole star vega 
(Abhijit). At about 12,400 B.C. this was the pole 
star. Hence, around this star, a small extra nakSatra 
had been assumed. 

Taittiriya Brahmana (I-5-2,6,) states krttika to 
visakha are Deva naksatras which turn Sun from 
south. Anuradha to Apabharani are yama nakSatra 
which turn sun from north. This position of winter 
and summer solstice was in 8357 B.C. Varah- 
‘amihira tells that winter solistice was at Dhanistha 
beginning at time of Vedanga jyotisa and at Makara 
beginning in his own time (about 100 B.C.). He 
has concluded backward motion of ayana. 


Satapatha Brahmana tells Krttika at equator, 
Present position being 36°9’ east and vikSepa 4°2’. 
This was about 67°56’ east of present position of 
vernal equinox. This was 2942 B.C.

Manjula (932 AD) has indicated backer! 
precession of vernal equinox 1,99,669 cycles in a | 
kalpa i.e. 59”.86 per year. Bhaskara II has also" 
accepted his authority. He has stated that ayana 
was non existant at time of Aryabhata and. 
negligible at time of Brahmagupta and so they have 
not. discussed. Even Bhaskara has mentioned it 
only in the context of constructing gola bandha 
(armillary sphere) Curiously Jagannatha Samrata in 
his Siddhanta Sarnrata has indicated 278 Saka as 
year of zero Ayanaméa and rate of precession per 
year as 51”. This value is accepted as per modern 
calculations Prthudaka (928 A.D.) has given 56.”82 
per year. 


Even Munjala value is very accurate. In 932 
A.D. yearly rate of precession was 50.2453- 
0.0002225 t (years from 1850 AD) = 50.041”. 
According to Indian practice, excess precession for 
tropical year is 9.76”, then correct precession should 
be 59.8” per year which is very close to his value 
of 59”.86. 


Liberation theory : A suspect passage occurs 
in Surya siddhanta, TriprasSnadhikara, (9-10) which 
states 

In a yuga, nakSatra cycle falls back eastward 
thirty scores (fq Fer 30 X 20). Number of days 
(ahargana) is multiplied by this 600 and divided 
by number of days in a yuga to give the no. of 
revolutions and fraction raSis etc. Its bhuja is 
multiplied by 3 and divided by 10, which will give 
ayana in am&a or ayanaméa. 


This gives an oscillatory motion of 27° east 
and west from equinox point. 


Corrections to Moon 345 


This appears a defective and interpolated 
passage because- 


(i) It occurs in Triprasnadhikara and out of 
context just after discussing directions and shadow 
lengths. 


(ii) No where else in this text krtya = 20 units 
has been used. 30 scores should have been written 
6 hundreds or each digit should have been 
indicated separately through words as per general 
practice. 


(iii) The verse indicates oscillation of nakSatra 
cycle around equinox. If it starts with east ward 
motion; in 5097 years since kali, it should be 
towards west from equinox. But the 0° of ecliptic 
is towards east from equinox point, as it has been 
clearly mentioned in next verse also. Thus the text 
should have stated oscillations of equinox point 
around 0° of ecliptic. Due to 600 speed, round 
number (540) had been calculated at the beginning 
of Kaliyaga. 

(iv) Oscillations of equinox within 27° is not 
mentioned anywhere in ancient texts. They have 
mentioned the difference of upto 35° and values 
at different points of time indicates only backward 
motion. 


(v) Bhadskara II has quoted Surya siddhanta 
differently. According to him, surya siddhdanta tells 
3 lakh backward rotations of Ayanadm§a in a kalpa. 
This means 300 backward rotation in a yuga. This 
can mean 3 backward + 300 forward = 600 
Oscillations in a yuga. But this interpratation has 
not been mentioned in own commentary or any 
other commentary. Thus he must have mentioned 


346 


some version of surya siddhanta prevalent in his { 
time. This was lost due to the interpretation » 
presently found. 


(vi) Reasons of accepting this wrong version . 
is that 0° position is same in both systems around 
285 AD. and both indicate backward motion till ' 
2298 AD. Due to approximately equal angular speed 
in both system, we get the same position of 
Ayanam$a. So no body has thought it necessary 
to refute this theory. 


Reasons for oscillation theory and its value of 
constants- 


(i) Bhaskara and Varahamihira have com- 
mented that Ayanam&Sa was zero at the time of 
Aryabhata 3600 years exactly after Kaliyuga. Now, 
it has been assumed that all the planetary positions 
were zero at beginnig of Kaliyuga and they started 
moving east wards since then. The same assump- 
tion was made for krantipata which was found 
west from 0° at the time of Aryabhata. This means 
that, pata started moving east wards with uniform 
speed like all madhya grahas, at mid point till time 
of Aryabhata it started moving backward and 
reached zero position again. Thus half oscillation 
was completed within 3600 years. Remaining half 
oscillation will mean backward motion for 1800 
years from Aryabhata and again forward motion 
for 1800 years, so that it comes to zero position 
in east ward motion, as in Kali beginning. Thus 1 
cycle is 7200 years, giving 600 cycles in a.yuga. At 
about 600 years after Aryabhata, if Ayanaméa was. 
9° west, then maximum oscillation in 1800 years 
will be 27° on either side. Such measurement only 
can be basis of this limit. 


Corrections to Moon 347 


In comparison, Hipparchus (100 BC) had 
found precession but did not give the value. 
Ptolemy had estimated it to be 36” per year. 
Albatani of Arab in about 880 AD, found the speed 
as 55”.5 Then Nasiruddin of ran calculated in 1250 
AD as 51” per year which was very accurate. 


Siddanta Darpana has assumed sirya 
siddhanta theory of oscillation, but has slightly 
corrected the value to 6,40,170 oscillations in a 
kalpa instead of 6 lakhs for a kalpa according to 
.Surya siddhanta. 


These corrections are based on the following- 


(i) Assumption of true 0° position which is 
with 1/2° error in eye estimates— This is according 
to position of identifying stars as given in Surya 
siddhanta. This will indicate the current value of 
ayananasa as to how much vernal equinox has 
shifted west from this 0°. 


(ii) Assumption about the time of 0° 
ayanam$a- it is clear that strya siddhanta value is 
based on 0° ayanaméa at the time of Aryabhata in 
3600 kali in which half oscillation was complete. 
Figure of 6,40,170 oscillations in a year by siddhanta 
darpana indicates 0°’ ayanamSa in 284 AD. At 
present it is assumed to be on mesa sankranti of 
285 AD. So reasons of Candragekhara must have 
been same as current reasons for accepting this 
figure. 

‘It may be noted that both theories give same 
figure at present because, their speeds are almost 
same. 27°X4 = 108° oscillation in 7200 years means 
1° in 66.6 years. Siddhanta Darpana gives 1° in 
61.4 years. Modern figure is 72.24 years per degree 
for 0 AD and 71.63 years at 1900 AD. Munjula 


348° “ Siddhanta Darpana § 


figure also is 1° in 61 years. This was accepted by | 
Bhaskara and this figure only has been accepted. * 
by CandraSekhar though under Gueteren theory.

Verses 92-99 - Calculation of Kranti 


Planetary orbits (ecliptic) and’ equator circle, © 
both are in east west direction. Due to inclination, © 
they cut each other which results in kranti (north ° 
south deviation). Thus, deviation of the planet, 
north or south from equator is measured. along . 
great circles passing through north-pole and south - 
pole (of earth projected in sky). This is also called « 
‘apama’ or ‘apakrama’. 
_ Note : Kranti (apama or apakrama) is north 
south deviation from equator a‘ seen from earth. 


Corrections to Moon 349 


Sara or vikSepa is north south deviation from 
ecliptic as seen from sun. 


Both are measured along great circle perpen- 
dicular to reference circle (equator or ecliptic). 


In celestial sphere, an imaginary circle of 
rotation of sun is called kranti vrtta or marga 
(ecliptic circle of path.) It is divided into 12 rdaéis. 
Ayana correction is done in Ist and 7th ragis (0° 
and 180° position). The corrected positions of these 
rasis give the positions of intersection of ecliptic 
with equator circle. These points are called pata. 
Since day and night are equal, they are called 
sampata. Thus there will be two sampata, vasanta 
and hemanta (vernal or autumnal equinox). At 3 
rasis from sampata, kranti will be maximum (23°30’) 
in north or south directions. 

Jya of maximum kranti .(23°30’) is (1370’). 
Graha position corrected by ayanaméa only is used 
for calculation of bhujaphala and jya. 


Ayanaméa is added to spasta graha, sum 
(sayana graha) is multiplied by Jya of parama kranti 
(1370) and divided by radius (3438). This is 
equivalent to multiplication by 100 and division by 
251. This will be kranti jya of the spasta graha. 
This value converted to arc will give kranti in kala. 


Square of kranti jya substracted from square 
of radius (1,18,19,844) and taking square root gives 
‘dyujya’ which is half diameter of ahoratra vrtta 
(diurnal circle) - explained in Triprasnadhikara. 

Kotijya of sphuta graha (corrected with 
ayanam§éa) multiplied by 100 and divided by 251 
and multiplied by daily motion of graha gives daily 
motion of kranti.

which is point of observation at centre of celestial

angle B’OB which is about 23-1/2° 

Position of planet is at P on ecliptic whose 
distance from point A is the sayana graha = AP. 
PE is arc of great circle perpendicular to equator, 
hence passing through pole of earth or equator. 
Thus length PE is the kranti, which can be 
determined from relations of right angled triangle 
APE on the sphere. Hence sayana graha AP needs 
to be calculated to complete this triangle. 


According to Napier’s law for right angled 
spehrical triangles, sine of middle part = product 
of cosines of opposite parts . 


For middle part taken as PE, opposite parts 
are : 
5% ~—PA and > - ZPAE 
Hence sin (PE) = sin (PA) X Sin (PAE)

Here PA = sayana graha, ZPAE = parama

Thus the position of highest kranti B’ is at

Notes (1) These topics have been discussed 
in Triprasnadhikara, but to understand the mean- 
ing of these formulas, it is necessary to explain 
the technical terms. 


On equinox day, sun is perpendicular on 
equator, hence at local noon on an equator place 
it will be directly above, i.e. perpendicular to 
horizontal plane. Hence, a_ perpendicular to 
horizontal plane at other place with latitude ¢, will 
be at an angle @ with sun’s highest position at 
noon. Thus the length of a vertical pilllar’s shadow 
at noon time on equinox day will give latitude of 
the plac.

Due to daily rotation of earth, planets appear

circles projected on vertical plane are P,P;’, P2P2’ 
and P3P3’ all parallel to equator P,P2’. Sun on

When north kranti of a planet is arc P2 Py’ 
then its diurnal circle is P,;P;’. When south kranti 
is P2 P3, then the circle is P3; P3’. (diameter only 
is shown in projection). At equator, the horizontal 
line DOD’ cuts all the diurnal diameters in two 
equal parts. As long as the planet is above horizon 
or on V side of DOD’, it is seen or rising. Below 
it; it is set. Thus at equator, day and night are

Verse 105 : Correction due to Sara in day time 


From surya siddhanta when kranti and Sara 
are in one direction they are added to find spasta - 
kranti of a planet (true declination from equator). ' 
When they are in opposite direction, their dif- 
ference is taken for spasta kranti. 


Notes : Kranti is inclination of planet from 
ecliptic. It is caused by two angles - Angle of 


Corrections to Moon 357 


ecliptic with equator whch is called kranti (mean 
value). However, a planet deviates from ecliptic, 
whose angle is known as Sara. Hence total 
inclination with equator is sum of these angles. 
This inclination only, decides their day and nights. 


Verses 106-112 : Easy calculation of cara - 
Now a rough practical method is described to find 
out cara in pala. 


(i) Find out the cara kalas at the end of 1,2 
and 3 ragis (corresponding to their krantis) 


(2) 3rd cara khanda = 3rd ra$i cara -cara of 
2nd raégi 

2nd cara khanda = cara of 2nd raéi - cara of 
Ist rasi 

Ist cara khanda = cara of Ist raéi itself 


These are the cara of mesa, vrsa and mithuna 
rasis in reverse order. 


(3) Bhuja of sayana planets is taken, its rasi 
and degrees etc. are kept separately. If it is less 
than 1 raési, then degree and minute (kala) are kept 
separately. 

(4) Degree and kala are multiplied separately 
by cara. Result at kala place is divided by 60, 
quotient in degree added to degree place, 
remainder to be kept as kala. Total degrees are 
divided by 30, remainder is kept there and quotient 
is added with raéi. 

If bhuja is more than 1 ra$i; but less than 2 
Tasi, position is multiplied by Ist cara for mesa 
rasi, kala and degrees are multiplied by cara khanda 
of 2nd ragi. As before, excess kala and degrees are 
added in higher places of degrees and raéi. 


358 


If bhuja is more than 2 rai (it will be always’: 
less than 3 ra$i). then Ist and 2nd carakhandas are*! i 
added at Ist place of rasi. Degrees and minutes: 
are multiplied by 3rd cara khanda. These are? 
converted to rasi, degree, kala as before. Alterna- : 
tively, cara of each rasi of ravi is taken and | 
accordingly, their fraction for each degree is~ 
calculated. 


Notes : Rationale of method is obvious. It is 
linear interpolation which assumes that variation 
rate of cara within a rasi (30° interval) is constant. 
This gives some error which can be ignored for - 
practical purposes. 


Verses 113-117 : Udaydantara pala from sayana 
stirya - Now method to find udayantara sanskara 
is being explained. This is difference in pala 
between true sunrise time and madhyama sunrise 
time at Lanka. This is called time equation, arising 
out of inclination of ecliptic with equator. This rises 
steadily in first 3 half raSis (i.e. 3 X 1/2 X 30° 
= 45°) and decreases till next 3 half raSis. 

From the first sampata point, udayantara (in 
pala) rises by, 12, 9, 4 pala for first 3 half rasis, 
From 4th half rasi to end of quadrant it declines 
by same amounts 4, 9, 12. 


We find out the udayantara palas for com- 
pleted half raégis.. Fractional portion of lapsed 
degrees is multiplied by pala of that 15° part and 
is added to the result for completed half ragis (if 
udayantara pala is rising). It is substracted if 
udayantara is declining. 


Corrections to Moon 359 


When bhujanga of surya is 45° (3 X 15° or 
3rd half rasi), its udayantara pala is maximum 25 
palas (12 + 9 + 4 pala). After that it starts declining. 
On equinox day or at 4th rasis from that (0°,90°, 
180° or 270°) udayantara pala is zero. 

Udayantara pala is multiplied by daily motion 
of graha and divided by no. of pala in a day (3600). 
Result is added to madhyana graha, if bhuja of 
sun is in even quadrant, otherewise it is sub- 
stracted. Result will be the graha for sunrise time 
of Lanka. 

Notes : This is approximate udayantara palas 
at the end of each half rdagis.. Its complete 
explaination will be given in Triprasnadhikara. 
(p/447) 


Verses 118-120 : Rising time of planets - 


We add ayanamé&a to graha, and from sayana 
graha its udaya time in asu (prana = 4 seconds) 
is found. Udaya asu is multiplied by daily motion 
of the planet and divided by no. of kalas in a raéi 
(1800) Result is added to kalas in a circle (21,600), 
if the graha is margi (moving forward). If vakri 
(retrograde), it is substracted from 21,600. The 
result will be day of the graha in asus i.e. after 1 
rise, it will rise after that time again. 


Savana dina for sun is roughly 60 danda. 59 
lipta less from that is a naksatra dina. Method for 
finding savana dina of a planet has been told. 


_ Notes : Udaya asu of a graha is its rising 
time, as its speed is seen from an inclined plane 
which will be less than its speed in the ecliptic. 
This will be less than its normal rising time. The 
corresponding apparant speed is found by dividing 


360 


the rising lime of that rasi by 1800 kala and, 
multiplying it by gati of graha, this is movement: 
in one day as seen from a latitude. If graha ig: 
moving ahead, this will be extra time taken by, 
earth to reach its next rising place. Hence this time’ 
is added to 21,600 asu. 


Verses 121-126 : Rising time of rasis 


The rasi which rises (on eastern horizon) at 
a time is called lagna. At sunrise time, raéi, ara ° 
etc of surya itself is lagna. Savana day night: 
(ahoratra) is found from daily motion of ravi as: 
explained above. From true ravi at desired time, | 
current rising rasi (lagna is found). 

In 1/12th part of kranti vrtta (raSi), there are! 
1800 kala. Near equator, their inclination to equator ; 
is more. At the end of ayana (south or north), i.e. ; 
90° east or west from equinox, kranti vrtta (ecliptic) | 
is paralled to equator. Hence, in diurnal circle‘ 
(parallel to equator), different parts of ecliptic rise 
in unequal times. 

To find out the rising times of raSis at equator, 
the jyas of 1,2 and 3 raSis and their kranti jyas 
are squared separately. For each raéi, kranti jya 
square is deducted from jya square, and square 
root of the difference is taken. These are multiplied | 
by trijya and divided separately by jya of 1,2,3: 
rasis. Arc of the three results is calculated. 

Rising time in asu for third rasi is found by. 
substracting arc of 2nd from 3rd raéi. For rising of . 
2nd rasi, arc of Ist is substracted from 2nd raéi. ' 
Arc of Ist rasi is its own rising time. 

Thus we get rising times in asu (udayasu) of | 
(1) mega (2) vrsa and (3) mithuna rasis. Udayasu .

N is also direction of north pole of earth. 
Daily rotation of earth is along circle WOE, the 
time in which OE part of equator rises, is the time 
of rise of OK part of ecliptic also. But rising time 
of the whole equator circle 360° is 1 nakSatra dina 
(sidereal day) which is equal to 21,600 asus by 
definition. Hence rise of 1 kala on equator will 
take 1 asu. Hence length of OE in kala will give 
the rising time in asu which is rising time of OK 
part of ecliptic also. 

OEK is a spherical triangle in which LOEK ' 
is right angle, ZEOK is angle between equator and 
ecliptic-which is maximum value of sun’s kranti. 
EK is kranti of point K, arc OK is sayana raéi of 
point K measured from equinox point O. OE is its 
length measured on equator (visuvan§a). 

Hence as per Napier’s rule - 

Cos KOE = tan OE xX cot OK

This is the formula described in this verse. 

(3) To prove that rising times of 4th to 6th 
rasis are equal to those of 3rd to Ist rasis in reverse 
order - 

Equation (3) above tells

OE = rising time or length on equator in kala. 

OK = sdyana rasi of K, KE = Kranti of K. -

Hence Sin (180° - OE) 

_ Sin (180° — OK) xX Cos (parama kranti) 

cos KE. 

Rising times of 90° at equator or ecliptic are 
same i.e. when OK = 90°, OE == 90°. 

For rising time of mithuna (60°-90°), we 
substract the rising time of 60° from 90° time (6 
hours = 15 danda = 5400 asu). 

Rising time of 180° also is equal on both circles 
as it is equal for every 90°. Hence, rising time for 
karka (90° to 120°) is found by substracting the 
time of rising time of 3 rasis from 120° time. 

Now, when OK = 60°, OE is rising time 
(slightly less than OE) 

_ When OK = 120° = 180°-60°, its rising time 
180° - OE ~ s 
Hence rising time-of Karka = (180°-OE) - 90° 

- OE = rising tithe of mithuna. 

Similarly we can prove that rising times of 
Simha, vrsa and kanya, mesa are equal.

The rising times of rasis from mesa to kanya 
are equal to tulad to mina in reverse order for all 
palces, not only on equator. So this result will be 
proved when rising time at other places is 
calculated. This is evident because both the ecliptic 
and equator circles bisect each other, hence other 
half 180° to 360° is similar to 180° to 0°. 


Verses 127-128 : Alternative method for rising 
times at equator 

Dyujya of 3 raSis (3153) is multiplied separate- 
ly by jya of 3,2, 1 raSis (3438/2978/1719). Results 
(10,840,014), (93,89,634), (54,20,007) are divided by 
dyujya of the raSis (3153, 3227, 3369). Arc of the 
resulting ratios treated as jya is found (5400, 3471 
and 1675), which are rising times of 3, 2 and 1 
rasis. 

Rising time of 2 rasi is substracted from 3 to 
give time of 3rd rasi. Time of 2nd raégi is time of 
Ist rasi deducted from rising of 2 raSsis. Rising time 
of Ist rasis is already known. 

Notes : This method has already been proved 
in previous verse. 


Verses 129-130 : Rising times at different parts 
of sky. 

Rising times of six raSis in asu or prana have 
already been stated as (1) 1675 (2) 1796 (3) 1929 
(4) 1929 (5) 1796 and (6) 1675. (These have been 
calculated for rising on east horizon on equator). 
The rising time of rasis for other points (on the 
east west vertical circle) are also the same. These 
points are udaya (east horizon), Asta (seetting point 
in west horizon), DaSama (Tenth house or vertically ,

wards). 

Note : This is because all quadrants are same 
on both circles. 


Veerses 131-142 : Lagna at any place - 


To find out rising times of rasis at other 
places, we find out the cara khanda of first three 
rasis as per formula described for that place. These 
cara khandas are deducted from first and last 3 
rasis in that order and are added to the three raéi 
from karka and in reverse order to three rasis from 
tula. Addition and deductions of carakhandas is to 
the risirig times of rasis at Lanka (both in asu or 
prana). These give the rising time at other place. 
for which carkhanda had been calculated. 


According to rough calculation, whatever raéi 
is rising in east horizon, its seventh rasi (180° 
away) is setting in the west. 


Rising times for each hora (1/2 rasi = 15°), or 
dreskana (1/3 rasi = 10°) can also be calculated in 
same manner. For that kranti and dyujya is 
calculated for each half or 1/3rd rai, hence it will 
be more accurate, than rising time for raéis. 


Ayanaméa is added to sun at sunrise time 
Position. Lapsed and remaining parts in the 
incomplete rasi of sayana sun is calculated. Remain- 
ing degrees of the rasi are multiplied by rising 
time of full rasi and divided by 30. This gives 
tising time of remaining part of that incomplete 
tasi. This is substracted from desired time interval 
after sunrise (called ista kala). From the remainder, 
rising times of next rasis in sucessive order are 
deducted. Last remainder from which rising time

of next rasi cannot be deducted - is multiplied by F 
30 and divided by rising time of the next rasi. This: 
result in degrees etc. is added to the completed:; 
rasi which has risen. This gives sayana lagna. : 
Ayanaméa is deducted from this to give the lagna i. 


for required time at desired place. 


When fractional rising time of remaining raéi 


of sayana sun is more than ista kala, the same 


sayana lagna will continue to rise at ista kala. This. 


remaining rising time is multiplied by 30. and 
divided by rising time of sayana sphuta ravi (or 
roughly by rising time of that rasi). Result in 
-degrees etc is added to sayana sphuta sun and 
ayanaméa is deducted to find sphuta lagna. 


To find the moment when a particular lagna 
will rise, ayanaméa is added to it. Its lapsed part 
in incomplete rasi is multiplied by rising time of 
that rasi and divided by 30. This is lapsed rising 
time of the fractional rasi. To this, we add the 
rising time of remaining fraction rasi of sayana sun 
at sun rise time, and the rising times of next 
completed rasis upto the completed rasi of sdyana 
lagna. The grand total will be ista kala after sunrise, 
when the desired lagna will rise.

Note : (1) Rising times for a place of latitude 
@ NESW is the horizontal circle at desired place 
of latitude ¢° north. (fig. 9) 

P is the north pole in sky : 


O is vernal equinox point. WOE is equator 
circle, KOK’ is ecliptic circle. EC = Cara of K which 
is below horizon. 


When point O is rising on east horizon, 
sayana 0° of both ecliptic and equator are rising. 
When K point of ecliptic rises on horizon, E point 
on equator also rises. 

Hence, rising time of OK in asu is same as 
that of OE: The polar circle PK passing through 
K meets OE extended at C which is below horizon. 
Thus OEC arc is the rising time at equator for 
point K. Hence rising time at 0° North is found 
by deducting EC from rising at equator. EC is the 
cara-kala for point K. 

Thus rising time = Equator rising time - 
carakala. 

Cara jya = R tan ¢ xX tan @ 

where @ is kranti of K. It has already been 
proved after verse 103 

For mesa rasi, OK = 30° 

Kranti of K is KC 

Carajya = R. tan KC X tan ¢=EC 


Rising time OE = OC - EC 

This holds good for mesa to mithuna i.e. 0° 
to 90°. For karka rasi, OK = 120°. Then kranti of 
K is same as of vrsa rasi i.e. KC is same. Hence 
EC is also same as for 60° (vrsa). 


Hence rising time of karka = OE = OC - CE

at sunrise time and OF’ is its position at ista kala 
after sunrise. Ai, A2, A3 - - - A7 are successive 
positions of starting of rasis. (fig. 11) 

At sun rise time, point E is on east horizon 
and lagna, and sun also is rising at E. Hence, at 
sunrise, rasi of sun and lagna is same. The rising 
time of E’ is the sum of rising times of EA2 
(remaining part of fractional ragi A1A2) then rising» 
of complete ragis A2 A3, A3 Aa, A5 Ag and then 
lapsed part of fraction rasi Ag E’.

Since the rising times are not proportional to 
rasi length (mesa rising is much faster than vrsg 
for example) this calculation will be more accurate: 
if rising times of smaller parts like hora = 1/2 raé 
or dreskana = 1/3 ra$i are calculated.

rising time to get the rising time of nirayana raéi. 
If previous rasi time is more, it is added. 

Notes : Method is obvious. Since ayana is 
moving east wards, sayana rasi is more. Hence, 
rising time of nirayana rasis will be found by 
comparison with the next rasi. Assuming ayanaméa 
of 23°, nirayana mesa 0° = sayana mesa 23°, 
nirayana mesa 30° = sayana mesa 53°. Hence we 
have to find the rising times at 23° and 53° at 
sayana value, and their difference is rising time 
for mesa. 

Verse 153 - When ayana (ecliptic) is moving 
west wards (from point of equinox) then rising

When ayana (ecliptic) is moving east from 
equinox point, then dvisvabhava raéis (3, 6, 9, 12th)

book, kranti pata always moves in reverse direction, 
making complete circles of 360°. But ayanaméa is 
3/10 of its bhuja calculated according to quadrant 
of the kranti. 


Kranti at kali hesiatine can be calculated by 
multiplying kalpa bhaganas by. 1811 and dividing 
by 4000. (chapter 3, verse 51). Thus bhagana at 
kali beginning . 

= 640170 x a = 2,898,36. 9675 revolutions 

This is 0.0325 revolutions less than complete 

revolutions. 


Since pata in moving in backwards direction, 
it is 0.0325 east of 0°. Thus Kali position is 0.0325 
revolutions = 0.0325 X 360° X 60 lipta = 702 liptas. 


One revolution is in 432 crore years of kalpa 
divided by 640170 revolutions i.e. 6748.207507

219/19 years are deducted because, in that kali 
year kranti pata and ayanaméa were zero. As the 
ayanamSa had become zero after 1/2 revolution of 
kranti 27°X2 = 54° movement of ayanamf&a in 2

Chapter -7 | 
THREE PROBLEMS OF DAILY MOTION. 
(Triprasnadhikara) . 
1. Scope - There are three problems regarding 


daily motion of earth, or rather it is used to find 
their answers - 


(1) Place - Longitude or Latitude can be 
determined from daily motion. Both are needed to 
find the location. of a place, specially in sea journey, 

-when there is no other land mark for identification. 


(2) Direction - North south direction can be 
measured roughly by a magnetic compass also, 
which gives other directions also. But this causes 
a lot of errors, because magnetic north pole is 
different from geographical north pole, which is 
on the axis of earth’s rotation. In addition, there 
are local and general magnetic disturbances. Ac- 
curate method of finding the directions is only by 
astronomy, whether on land or on sea. 


(3) Time - Measurment of time intervals are 
most accurate now with quartz watches for common 
use and most accurate laser and atomic watches 
for scientific use. However, that gives average 
standard time. True or apparent time can be found 
only by inclination of sun from vertical position. 
This is related to measurement of longitude also, 
as simultaneous measuring of time through sun at 
two places will be different, the difference depend- 
ing on longitude. Thus time difference or lon- 


Three Problems of Daily Motion 381 


gitudinal difference can be calculated from each 
other. 


Siddhanta Darpana has treated this chapter 
in briefest manner and one of the vital use i.e. 
measurement of longitude has been left out. It has 
been explained roughly for purpose of making 
desantara correction in madhya graha in chapter 
4. One reason of such neglect is that use of 
astronomy for navigation had ceased for Indians, 
who had lost the traditional excellence. This doesn’t 
mean that astronomy is not needed for this purpose 
now. Even in modern astronomy, exactly the same 
methods are used for finding directions, place and 
time. With use of telescopes, their accuracy has 
increased, but formula is same. 

Another reason for leaving some topics has 
been stated by the author that many more methods 
have been explained in detail by Bhaskaracarya, 
whose book is most popular. Hence they need not 
be repeated. Before explaining individual methods, 
it will be useful to give a general idea of various 
right angled triangles used for calculations. 


(2) Latitude triangles 


For calculation of 3 problems, some convenient 
right angled triangles are formed, whose one of 
the angles is latitude or akSamSa . Hence they are 
all called latitude triangles or ‘aksakSetra’ in Indian 
astronomy. The other angles of such triangle are 
obviously 90° - ¢, and 90° as it is right angled 
triangle. 90° — @ is called colatitude or lambamé&a. 
The side facing angle @ is called base (bhuja or 
bahu), side. Facing 90° — @ is upright (koti) and 
the side facing right angle is hypotenus (karna).

Translation of the text 


Verse 1 - Scope - For happiness and benefit 
of the people, I begin this chapter named ‘triprasna’ 
which will give knowledge of dig (direction), desa 
(location) and kala (time) in simple language. 


Verses 2-5 : Finding the cardinal direction 


To determine the directions, a place is made 
plain like a surface of water. It is cleaned and a 


circle of semidiameter 24 angulas is drawn. At : 


centre a Sanku of 12 angula height is kept. 


Shadow of Sanku will touch the circle twice ; 
(when its length is 24 angulas). Both points on ‘ 


circumference are joined by a line and with each 


point as centre, circles of 25 angula radius is drawn. ° 


Both the circles will intersect at two points 
and common parts of circles between them will 
form a fish shape. The points are like mouth and 
tail of the fish. The line joining them will be north 


Sateen aunnebeatalehs Bote 


south line which will be perpendicular on the line : 


joining shadow position between first and second 
chaya. Kranti movement is negligible and is 
ignored. 

North south line will cut the circumference 
on two points called north and south points. A 
perpenducular on that line at the centre will cut 
the circle in east and west points. For finding 


Three Problems of Daily Motion 385 


angular directions, arcs between east, north, west 
and south are bisected. 

Notes (1) Types of Sanku - Bhaskara I in his 
commentary on Aryabhatiya has described the 
following views 


Some astronomers prescribed a gnomon 
(ganku), whose one third in bottom is in shape of 
a prism on square base (caturasra), one third in 
middle in shape of cow’s tail and one third in the 
top in shape of spear head. 

Some other have prescribed a square pris- 
moidal gnomon. 


The followers of Aryabhata I, used a broad 
(prthu), massive (guru) and large (dirgha) cylinderi- 
cal gnomon, made of excellent timber and free from 
any hole, scar or knot in the body. 


For getting the shadow ends easily and 
correctly, the cylinderical gnomon was surmounted 
by a fine cylinderical iron or. wooden nail fixed 
vertically at the centre of the wpper end. The nail 
was taken to be longer thanj,the radius-,,of the 
gnomon, so that its shadow was always seen on 
the ground. 


(a) Height of gnomon - 


Gnomon could be of any length, but its height 
was divided into 12 units by convention. Smallest 
was gnomon of 12 angula length, because it was 
Portable and easy to handle. (about 9.8” = 24 cm). 

hatever may be length, it was called 12 angula 
marked by 12 equal division which will be clearly 
Seen in the shadow. Angula also was divided into 
60 pratyangula for accurate measurement. It may 
€ mentioned that accurate measurements . were

that purpose. 


(b) Testing the level of ground 


Test prescribed by Bhaskara I, Govinda vim 
and Nilakantha is - ‘ 


a continuos flow. Where the water falling on th 4 
ground spreads in a circle, there the ground is inj 
perfect level. Where water accumulates, it is lowig 
It doesn’t reach at high level. ‘a 


The same principle of ‘water level’ is used for’ 
modern levelling instrument. A long hollow glasgq 


in it, when the cylindrical rod, in kept on leve i 
ground, along the length touching the surface; 
bubble is at centre. The other side of length to § 
kept on ground is made flat so that it doesn’t roll} 
(c) Preparing the ground - f: 

Ground should be plastered - so that it is nokg 
destroyed by pressure of walking, wind or rains. 
A prominently distinct circle was drawn with centr 44 
as centre of base of sanku. This line also had 
permanent or indelible marks by groove or per 
manent marks. Sankaranarayana (869 AD) tells that; 
lines were drawn with sandal paste. This may bes 
because sandal was available in his area. 3 


Three Problems of Daily Motion 387 


Verticality of Sanku was tested by means of 
plumb lines (lambaka) on 4 sides. 


It seems that fixed length compasses were 
used for drawing circles. This will be conventient 
for bigger circles. and length of radius will not 
change in process of drawing. Hence, the radius 
has always been indicated as fixed. This is not 
necessary for finding perpendicular bisector. 


(2) Cardinal directions : 


Let ENWS (figure 2) be the circle drawn on 
the ground where gnomon is set. Let Wi be the 
point where the shadow enters the circle (in the 
forenoon), and E; the point where the shadow 
passes out of the circle (in the afternoon). Join E; 
and W,. Line E,W, is aeecs from east to west. 


Figure 2 - Cardinal directions 

Its perpendicular bisector is found by drawing 
two arcs of equal radius greater than 1/2 E,W). 
This can be any length greater than this, 25 angula © 
radius prescribed here meets the condition. A fish 
figure is formed with N, and S; like mouth and 
tail point of the fish. Since E; Wi was east west, 
its perpendicular bisector NiSi will be in north 
south direction. NS: being bisector of chord E:Wj, 
it will pass through the centre O and meet the 


a ; —_ Siddhanta Darpang 


circle at points at N and S indicating north and. 
south. Line EW parallel to E:W; through centre QO: 
will mark east and west points E and W on the 
circle. 


Angle points A;, Az, A3 and Ag beieeen 
cardinal directions can be found by PIsectnie arcs: 
EN, NW, WS and SE. : 


As the sun moves along the sugee4 its 
declination (kranti) changes. By the time shadow 
moves from OW; to OF, the sun traverses some 
distance of the ecliptic, and its declination changes 
(though very small.) Hence, EW is not he true 
position of east west line. This minute correction: 
was described first by Brahmagupta (628 AD), 
Bhaskara II (1150), Sripati (1039 AD) etc. As the 
correction is very small, this method is good for 
practical purposes. 


Figure 3 
(3) Correction for Kranti change - 


From the east west line ew found as above, 
we make a circle with ew as diameter (Fig 3) Let 
d = correction in ew for change in kranti. 


Three Problems of Daily Motion 389 


® = latitude of the place 


6= declination of sun when shadow tip enters 
the circle in forenoon at W 


0 = Sun’s declination when shadow as leaves 
the circle in afternoon at point e. 

K = chaya karna . 
K (sind = sin dy 

cos ~ 

To apply this correction, a circle with radius 
d is drawn with e as centre which cuts ew circle 
at e’ towards north when sun’s ayana is towards 
north (as shown in the figure). e’ is south from e. 
if sun’s ayana is towards south. Now e’w is the 
correct east west line. 


This figure is for situation when sun is having 
south kranti with respect to the place, so that 
shadow end is in north part. The south kranti will 
decline in north ward motion of north ayana, hence 
will be at lesser distance in north direction 
compared to w. Thus e’ is north from e. 


Then d = 


Derivation of formula : 


Assuming constant declination, w and e points 
have equal shadow lengths, hence their directions 
Ow and Oe are inclined at equal angles from ON 
direction. 


It will be proved that K Sin 0/Cos@ is the agra 
or the distance of shadow from the east west line 
passing through mid day equinox shadow end. 
Hence the change in north south position will be 
difference in the agras at places e and w. 


Hence this was named agrantara correction 
by Caturvedacarya and then accepted by Sripati.

not possible without use of spherical caeiononete

Three Problems of Daily Motion 393 


This is same as the above method. 


(b) When the sun enters the circle called prime 
vertical, shadow of a Sanku is exactly in north-south — 
direction, i.e. smallest shadow. It will be zero, 
when kranti of sun is same as akSamSa of the 
place, and not useful. 


(c) Bhuja and koti of a shadow (its distance 
from east west or north south line) is calculated. 
Two bamboo strips equal to bhuja and koti are 
taken. Koti strip is laid from centre towards west 
and bhuja strip is laid from shadow and towards 
south, so that their other ends meet. Then koti 
will be in east west direction and bhuja in north 
south. . 


(d) Any heavenly body with zero declination, 
rises exactly in east and sets exactly in west. 

(e) The point where star Revati (€ Piscium) 
or Sravana (Altair or a@ - Aquilae) rises is the east 
direction. Or it is that point which is midway 
between the points of rising of citra and svati. 

Only those stars will rise in east which have 
zero kranti Observing citra and svati was used by 
people living in north of 30°N. Sudhakara Dvivedi | 
has written in Digmimamsa, that Sravana, whose 
celestial latitude is about 30° N cannot rise in the 
east, as it will nevere have 0°. kranti (minimum 30 
. 235 = 65 North Kranti). 

(e) The junction of two threads which pass 
through the two fish figures that are constructed 
with the extremities of three shadows (taken two 
at a time) as centre is in the south or north relative 


594 Siddhanta Darpang 


to the foot of the gnomon, according as the sun 
is in the northern or southern hemisphere. 


With the junction of the two threads as centre,. 
draw a circle passing through extremities of the 
three shadows. The tip of shadow of a gnomon 
does not leave this circle in the same way as a 
lady born in a noble family does not discard the 
customs and traditons of the family. 


Same views had beeen expressed by Lalla, 
Sripati and Bhaskara I (629 AD.) But this has been 
rightly criticised by Bhaskara II (1150 AD). As the 
sun is moving on a circle, locus of the line from 
sun to Sanku top will be a cone with sanku top 
as apex. Its intersection by horizon plane will be 
always a conic section. The horizon plane is. 
inclined at angle (6 + ¢ ) with sun’s direction which 
is not 90°, hence it cannot be a circle. As the 
shadows at sunrise and sunset time are of infinite 
length, they will be in general a hyperbola 
extending upto infinity. When (6 + ¢) = 90° which 
is possible only within polar circle, its locus will 
be circle. 


Siddhanta Darpana has mentioned this view 
in verse 85 of this chapter and has criticised it 
there and in goladhyaya. However, this method 
will be approximately correct if the central position 
of hyperbola i.e. positions near mid day are taken: 

Verse 6 : Relations be- 
tween Sanku and Chaya - Add 
the squares of Sanku and chaya 
and take the square root of

and square root of the dif-

Three Problems of Daily Motion 395 


ference is chaya which is base or pada. Square root 
of difference of squares of karna and chaya is bhuja 
(ganku = 12) Line joining ends of bhuja (Sanku) 
and koti (chaya or pada) is called karna. 
Note : Relation are obvious from figure 5. 
OV = Sanku = 12 length = Bhuja for the angle 
z of Sun’s direction from vertical (ZSVO = Z) 
OS = chaya = Koti or pada for angle z. 


VS = Line from sanku tip to shadow tip - 
Karna of chaya. 


OS is in horizontal plane, OV is vertical, hence 
ZVOS = 90°. 

Thus VS? = OS? + OV?

Verse 8 : Square root of sexagesimal numbers : 


Some numbers are expressed in successive 
divisions of sixty like danda, kala, vikala which 
are called avayava or components. To find the 
square root of such numbers, steps are as follows- 

(1) From the first component i.e. greatest 
division like danda, we substract the greatest 
square number. This gives first part of square root 
in danda (whose square has beeen deducted). 

(2) If the remainder is less than the square 
root danda, then it is multiplied by 3. Then it is 
converted to next lower component (viz kala) and 
number at that position in kala is added. The sum 
is divided by square root in danda multiplied by 
6 and added with 1. Result will be second i.e. kala 
component of square root. 


(3) If Ist remainder is equal or greater than 
danda root then it is multiplied by 2 and 1 is 
added. This is converted to 2nd component kala 
(by multiplying with 60) and number at 2nd 
component is added. Total remaining kalas are 
divided by danda root X 4 + 3. Result will be kala 
component of the square root.

Verse 9 : When in astrology, we calculate

402 Siddhanta Darpang: 


smaller component is shifted 1 more place towar 
right. Thus total is in 5 places. First place from, 
left is unit (rupa), 2nd place is lipta (1/60 part,’ 
3rd is vilipta (1/60 lipta) and so on. Only 3 places: a

Notes : This method is called go-mitrika in’ 
Indian arithmetic. Like urination by cows at:

Only A°*B ’C” is kept which is sufficient for

Vikala = Kala X Kala (e’xb’ = eb” vikala as

Hence square root of vikala will be in kala. 


Verses 11-12 : Setting of Sanku

Shape of Sanku may be any type, but 1/12th part

For finding out time, our own body also can 
be considered a Sanku and the distance of shadow

Convenient Sanku is of eye level height made

of circle. Radius of base is measured already. 
Distance of shadow end is measured from base of 
ganku and radius of base is added to give shadow 
length. 


Verse 13 - The. shadow meant here is

The great circle (straight line for a spherical 
surface) passing through east west points and 
zenith (khasvastika) is called east west circle 
(purvapara vrtta). 

Earth’s equator extended into sky is called 
celestial equator (Akaga visuva). Its akéaméa is 
considered zero. Great circle passing through poles 
and east, west points is called samamandala. 


Ahoratra vrtta becomes successively smaller 
as we procced from equator to meru (pole) 


A sphere of bamboo or wood should be 
formed to show celestial equator, ecliptic, eccentric 
circle of planets and other circles. 


On any day, if the midday shadow of Sanku 
is north from §anku, then its difference from 
equinox midday shadow is called agra (more 
correctly karna vrttagra). 

If shadow is south from gnomon (Sanku) base, 
then sum of equinox shadow (north for north 
latitude only) and this shadow is called karna 
vrttagra. 

On equinox day sun makes day and night 
equal while on equator (perpendicular to equator 
on that day). Thus the distance of sun on this day 
from svastika of a place is akSaméa or palaméa 
(angular distance from equator) of the place. 


Palarnsa is the nati (angular distance from 
zenith or svastika) on equinox midday. Its angular 
height from horizon is unnatamhéa equal to 
lambaméa (complementary to akgaméa - distance 
from north pole).

PCP at L (bisected there) and kSitija at O. Let EM 
be perpendicular to AB. 

Then EZ is aksamSa and CM is its sine or

triangle with lambajyd, akSajya and trijya as its 
sides. It is called W. 

CL is distance between nadi mandala and 
ahoratra vrtta - and is equal to krantijya. L is point 
of intersection of ahoratra vrtta and unmandala 
and LO is perpendicular on line of intersection of 
ahoratra vrtta and KSitija (this line is perpendicular 
to the plane of paper i.e. diagram). This LO is 
kujya. 

CO lying on ksitija is the distance between

another latitude triangle with sides as krantijya, 
kujya and agra - called X.

Verses 28-32 : Sun from shadow - 


Now I tell the method of finding sun’s 
position from shadow. If nataméa and aksaméa are 
in same direction (i.e. shadow on equinox midday 
and desired mid day is in same direction from 
ganku base), then we take the difference of these. 


When they are in different directions, then 
we take the sum. This will give kranti of sun (in 
case of difference, it is in direction of greater 
quantity, for sum, it is direction of either. 

Kranti jya is multiplied by trijya (3438) and 
divided by jya of paramakranti (1370). This will 
give bhuja jya of sun. Its arc is found in kala. If 
sdyana sun is in first quadrant, this arc itself is 
position of sayana sun. If it is in 2nd quadrant, it 
is substracted from 6 raSis, in third quadrant added 
to 6 rasis. If sayana sun is in last quadrant, arc is 
subtracted from 12 rdasis. 


Ayanaméga is deducted from this value to get 
true sun as measured from mesa O°. Sphuta or 
true sun is substracted from its mandocca and 
mandaphala correction is done in reverse manner 
for madhyama surya. By repeated procedures, 
madhyama strya will be more accurate. 


Notes : Calculation of sayana sun involves 


two steps (i) Finding kranti of sun as described in 
verse 27. 


(ii) From kranti of sun to its sayana position, 
which has been described in chapter 6 verse 96. 
There the formula has ben used for the reverse 
process, 1.e. to find sun’s kranti from position of 
sayana sun.

Kranti jya x Trijya

This formula has been proved there.

Now sayana sun is reduced to true sun by 
reverse process of finding sayana. Earlier ayanamSa 
had bene added (it may be substracted for periods 
before 493 AD or after 2200 AD according to book 
- which is not correct).. Hence, it will be substracted 
now. 

Madhyama graha from true graha is again a 
reverse procedure of finding true graha. It has 
been explained in verse 166 of chapter 5. For sun, 
only manda correction is done. 

Verses 33-34 : Shadow from sun’s position 
of midday 

Sun’s position will give its kranti as explained 
above. Aksaméa of a place is known. If both are 
in different direction, they are added, to give 
natam$ga of sun (inclination from vertical). 

If both are in same direction, their difference 
is taken. 


(Here direction of aksaméa is opposite to 
direction of equinox shadow i.e. direction of 
equator from the place). Thus in north hemisphere, 
akSamSa is south).

is formed when sun (or a planet) enters unmandala. 
Then perpendicular from it to east west line is 
unmandal sanku. When sun is in north kranti, it

place. 


(2) Yasti is a stick with length equal to trijya 
= 3438 used to measure vertical height of sun from 
horizon, as ratio of trijya - hence it gives sine 
values. Thus, the height measured from _ the 
‘position of equator sunrise is ista yasti. In north 
kranti, at equator rise time, it is below horizon, 
so its vertical height at equator sunset time can be 
measured, which will be almost equal and opposite. 
For north kranti it can be measured directly. Hence, 
the name yasti has been given. 


Yasti and all Sanku measurements are in the 
direction of local vertical i.e. line passing from

From saydna sun bhuja obtained above, we 
can find true and madhya sun as before. Now 
methods for konasanku are explained, which is 
calculated through agra etc. Four points midway 
between east-north, north-west, west-south and 
south-east are called kona (angle directions). There 
are two great circles perpendicular to horizon and 
passing through kona points (one through NE and 
SW points and other through rest two points). But 
they are considered 4, one for each kona point.

_ From this formula, when bhujajya of sayana 
sun is 2431 (R sin 45° = 2431) on equinox day, 
then sun rises and sets on kona circles. When sun 
is on equator, it is parallel to east west line at all 
places, hence natamSa of kona circle in forenoon 
is equal to natamSa of kona circle in afternoon. 
(This can happen at 45° north latitude).

Natakala - Natakala is the time in which sun 
or any other star or planet comes to yamyottara 
(north south vertical circle) in forenoon. In after- 
noon, it is time lapsed since it had come on 
yamyottara. These are called purva and pascima 
nata - incline to east or west. 


Unnata kala is opposite to natakala i.e. time 
taken to rise from horizon in forenoon or the time 
after which the planet will set in west sphere. 


Unnata kala = 1/2 day time - natakdla 


432 Siddhanta Darpang’ 


When polar circles to equator are drawn 
through position of sun, the arcs on diurnal circle 
of the planet are proportional to arcs of equator 
which are proportional to rising time in asu when 
arc is in kala or minute. Rotation of earth is along 
equator with fixed speed and time for 1’ rotation 
= 1 asu,. 


Thus in figure 11, natakala at Ri, R2, R3 is 
the time for planet to reach point R of yamyottara. 
Natakala corresponding to points Ri, R2, R3 all east 
from yamyottara are angles ZPRi, ZPR2, ZPR; 
which are proportional to arcs QKi, QK2, QK3 on 
equator. 


Time from E to Q is half day and angle is

in 1/2 day QK is increased from QR (6 hours) by

RK = extra length of half day or advance sun rise

The corresponding lengths on equator circle 
are propositional to time (arc in kala = time in

kala. OC = carajya. Distance of position X from 
mid day position Q is called nata kala. Correspond- 
ing nata kala on equator is measured by arc EX’. 
EX’ = vers N as measured from diameter end E.. 
Length from centre is OX’ = Cos N. 

EC. = Antya = distance along meridian 
diameter from corresponding positions of sunrise

Ista antya for position X of sun is its distance

When nata asu is more than 5400 asu, we 
deduct 5400 asu and find jya of remaining arc. 
This added to trijya is nata utkramajya.

AB, the distance of A from east west line EW,

MO = Zm, = R sine of sun’s zenith distance

solar day is substracted. Remainder is the lapsed 
time in ghati etc of night. Half day added to the

Similarly, remaining part of 10th lagna raéi, 
lapsed part of sayana sun rasi and complete rasis 
from 10th lagna to sun (rising times) - all added 
and half day of sun deducted gives the remaining 
part of night.

Verses 93-94 - Conclusion - 


Bhaskaracarya II has described many types of 
quantities from bhuja, koti and karna, etc. in 
Triprasnadhikara chapter of his siddhanta Siromani 
and has clarified many doubts by questions and 
answers. This already exists in siddhanta Siromani 
with his own commentary vasana bhasya. hence I 
am not repeating all due to fear of big size of 
book. 


I have described only those topics in detail, 
which I have verified personally and have separate 
views. This subject can be understood only through 
a good grasp of gola (spherical trigonometry) and 
ganita (mathematical methods). Then derivation of 
formula will not be difficult. Hence I have not 
enlarged the bulk of book by writing proofs. 


Verses 94-95 : Prayer and end - 

May lord Jagannatha fulfil my ambitions who 
is rejoicing with Laksmi of unsteady eyes and is 
residing at Nilacala (Puri) at 276-1/2 yojana north 
from equator i.e. 19°48’ N latitude and 200 yojana 
east from Indian prime meridian (passing through 
Ujjain). 

Thus ends the seventh chapter explaining 
three questions (Triprasna) along with views of 
sages; in Siddhanta Darpana written for correspon- 
dance in calculation and observation, and education 
of students, by Sri Candra Sekhara, born in famous 
royal family of Orissa. 


Three Problems of Daily Motion 443 


Appendix to Tripasna dhikara 


(1) (a) Local time, Standard time and true 
time : These three are basis of corrections to planet 
positions, in chapter 2. True time is time cor- 
responding to nata kala; position of sun. Local 
mean time is average time of a locality, assuming 
24 hours in each day. Standard time is local mean 
time of a position taken as standard for a country 
or a time zone. This time differs from Greenwich 
mean time by exact multiples of half hours. Like 
standard time of India is local mean time of place 
82°30’ east of Green-wich i.e. 5-1/2 hours more 
than G.M.T. 


(b) Definitions - Sidereal time - Point of 
equinox from which sayana position of sun is 
measured on kranti vrtta (ecliptic) is moving 
backwards on ecliptic. Position of sun from this 
point along ecliptic is rasi of sayana sun or 
longitude. Position of sun along equator is right 
ascensian. If measured relative to- local horizon of 
earth, position of sun along equator is nata kala 
or sidereal time, measured from zenith position of 
sun i.e. 12 hrs noon. Hence right ascension, also 
is written in hours. (It may be called visuva arnéa 
or hour angle). 


When motion of equinox is assumed uniform, 
time measured from it, is uniform sidereal time. 
From the true position of equinox, it is called true 
sidreal time. The differnce beetwen them is less 
than 1/10 seconds and normally ignored. 


Sidereal time is west wards, because equinox 
point is moving west wards like sun due to 
eastward daily motion of earth. It is the time in 


444 | Siddhanta Darpana : 


hours after the instant equinox point has crossed ° 
the meridian (north south vretical circle of a place). - 
Its circle is completed in 24 hours by definition, 
hence 1 hour movement = 15° (=360°+24) Position 
of planet in hours of right asencion is 15° per hour 
counted from equinox position along ecliptic.

(c) Mean time - 

Mean sun M is a fictitious point which moves - 
along equator with average angular velocity n of 
actual sun. i 

Since sun completes one rotation in a sidereal 
year both along ecliptic and along equator, its mean 
speeds are same in both the circles. Mean sun on 
ecliptic is Mi and _ true sun S. - both coincide at 
perigee or apogee (mandocca). Y is point of 
intersection of ecliptic and equator. . 

Y M = right ascension of mean sun 

Y Mi = mean longitude of sun 

Y S = true longitude of sun 

Y M = Y Mi = nt after time t. 


Mean time at any place is called local mean 
time (LMT) Since it will continuously vary at every 
place, local mean time of Greenwich is considered 
standard for the world called Greenwich mean time 
(G MT)

l is same in both formulas because hour angle 
and mean sun both increase 360° in 24 hours. 

To avoid inconvenience due to differences in 
the local times of various places-in a country, the 
local time of a chosen meridian is regarded as 
standard time. All the places in that country keep 
this time and not the local time. Thus the standard 
time of India is exactly 5-1/2 hours ahead of GMT 
i.e. time of a place 82°30’ east of Greenwich. In 
very large countris like Russia or USA, the country 
is divided into zones, each having a differnt 
standard time. For further convenience, the stand- 
ard times of these time zones differ from GMT by 
an integral number of hours or half hours. 

Hour angle measured at Greenwich from 12 
hours noon time is called Greeenwich mean 
astronomical time. (GMAT) and measured from 0 
to 24 hours.. Meantime reckoned’ from mean mid 


446 Siddhanta Darpana 


night at Greenwich is called Greenwich civil time 
(GCT), GMT or universal time (UT). This also is 
measured from 0 to 24 hours. 

GMT = GMAT + 12 


Same is for other places also. 


1. (d) Mean and Sidereal conversion 

In one solar year (tropical), sun crosses 
Y again after one circle. 

It takes K = 365.2422 mean solar days, i.e. K 
revolutions of earth with respect to sun. Hence 
there are K + 1 revolutions of earth with respect 
to Y or any star. Thus 

K+1 sidereal days = K mean solar days 

K+1 sidreal hours = K mean solar hours etc. 


1 Sidereal days = 1 + mean solar day 


1 
K+1 
= 23" 56™ 4.1 S mean solar units. 

Mean solar day = 1 sidereal days = 24°3™ 
56.5s sidereal hour etc. 

1 (e} Years : Sidereal year is time taken by 
sun for one complete revolution with respect to 
stars on ecliptic which are fixed. 

Tropical year is average interval between two 
successive returns of sun to the first point of Aries 
(Y). As Y moves backwards in about 26,000 years, 
tropical year is slightly shorter. 

(a) Tropical year = 365.2422 mean solar days 

(a) Sidereal year = 365.2564 mean solar days

(2) (a) Equation of time 
; From the watches we get 
mean solar time only and 
we can get the local mean ecliptic 
time after longitude correc- 
tion from standard time. To 
know the true solar time or 
apparent time we have to 
add some correction (+ ve 
or - ve) called equation of 
time. Let 


E = Equation of time. 


Equator 


Figure 16 


a = Right ascension of sun (distance from 
Y along quator = Y D) 


6 = true longitude of sun = YS along ecliptic. 

1 = mean longitude of sun. 

Then, by definition, 

E = West hour angle of sun - West hour angle 
of the mean sum 

= (S-a) - (S - RA. of mean sun) 

= (S-a) - (S-l) = la 

This can be written as 

_ E = - (a-€) - (6-1) 
Here - (a-@) is called the equation of time due 


to obliquity, because if equator is not oblique a = 
6 measured along any circle and this term a-0 = 0 


Similarly, - (@-l) is called the equation of time 
due to eccentricity.

which is the required value of — (a-@). Often 
a-@ is called the reduction to the equator, because 
a-0 added to ecliptic co-ordinate @ reduces it to’ 
equatorial coordinate. 


Again @ = v+D 
where D is position of perigee and v is true 


amomaly, true position of sun measured from 
perigee.

So, 6-1 = v-m = 2 e sin m, nearly.

If we draw sine curves for y == 9™. 9 Sin 21 
and y =7.7™ sin (1 + 78°) and substract one ordinate 
from the other, we get the graph of E, From graph 
is can be seen that it vanishes four times around 
23 march, 22 June, 22 September, 22 December. 


Sin 2 | attains max numerical values of 1 four 
times in a year and is alternately positive and 
negative at three times. Hence first term twice has 
value + 9.9 minutes and twice - 9.9 minutes 
atternately negative and positive. Thus E is 
alternately positve and negative, because second 
term is smaller numerically. Hence E is zero four 
times a year from theory of equations. 


(3) (a) Parallax : At any instant, the moon 
has slightly different directions as seen from 
different places on the earth. Sun’s direction 
changes much less with the change in position of 
the observer, because sun is more distant. In case 
of stars, which are far more distant, the difference 
in their directions as seen from different places of 
the earth is too small to be measured. But seen 
from different places in the earth’s orbit, (i.e. at 
different times of the year), the change in the 
direction of the comparatively nearer stars is 
measurable. 

The change in the direction of a celestial body 
as seen from different positions is called parallax. 

For calculation of sun, moon and planets, we 


choose earth’s centre as the standard position 
(origin of coordinate axis) from which distances are 


Three Problems of Daily Motion 451 


calculated. Due to observation from surface of 
earth, there is parallax error, called geocentric 
parallax. 


For calculation of star position, sun’s centre 
is the standard position and difference in direction 
due to measurement from different positions of 
earth’s orbit, is called stellar parallax. 


As geocentric parallax depends upon the 
distance of the observer from earth’s ceentre, we 
begin by considering the shape of the earth. 


3 (b) Shape of the earth - Surface of earth 
deteremined by ocean level is called the geoid, 
heights of places above mean sea level being . 
negligible. It is an oblate spheroid i.e. rotation of 
ellipse along its minor axis coinciding with polar 
axis of the earth. Semi major axis a of the 
generating ellipse (equatorial radius) is 3963.95. 
miles and the semi minor axis bis 3950.01 miles. 
The fraction (a-b)/a is called the compression; 
Eccentricity of this ellipse e = 0.082., compression 
= 1/297. 

Let C be the centre of 
the earth, O the observer 
at any place on its surface, 
OZ the normal at O to the 
surface and OZ’ the direc- 
tion which produced back- 
wards passes through C. 
Then OZ is the direction of 
the astronomical Zenith, OZ’ that of the geocentric 
zenith. Angle between these directions ZOZ’ is 
called the angle of the vertical indicated by V. 


If @ and ®’ are the angles made by normals 
NOZ and line COZ’ from centre with major axis- 


@ = geographical latitude of O

Geocentric parallax 


3 (c) Geocentric parallax in zenith distancee 

In figure 18, let C be centre of earth, O is 
observer and M the centre of moon (or sun or 
planet), Let CO = p, CM =r 

If Z’ is a point on CO produced, apparent 
zenith distance z’ of M is 2Z’OM and true (i.e. 
geocentric) zenith distance zo of Mis ZZ’cM. 

Hence z’ — zo = parallax in zenith distance 

= ZOMC = p . 

_From plane triangle OCM 

Sin p = (Pr) Sinz’ wee (1) 

Maximum value of parallax p is when z’ = 90°, 
it is called horizontal parallax pn of M at O. 

Sin pn = pir 

If O is at equator, then the parallax is biggest 
as p has highest value a, equatorial radius. The 
horizontal parallax at equator Po is

When moon (or the sun) is at its mean:

For parallax, earth can be considered almost | 
a sphere then, astronomical and geocentric zeniths - 
coincide, z’=z, p = constant = a. We take r = ry 
approx, then approximate value of parallax is 

p=Psinz-- - (2) 

Since z’ > zo, moon, sun or planet is. 
distanced away from zenith by distance P sin z 
approx due to geocentric parallax. This is also called 
diurnal parallax as it goes through a complete cycle 
of change through a day. Parallax is maximum 
when moon or sun rise on horizon, reduce to zero, 
when on zenith and again become maximum when > 
they set in west horizon.

Sin p2 = (p2/r) Sin Z'2 ose (3) 

Eliminating pi: and p2 from the three equa- 
tions, we can know moon’s distance r = OM 


It is more convenient to find value of pz firs! 
and then calculate r. From (1) and (2) 

Sin @ cos p2 - Cos @ Sin p2 = (f1/r) Sin 21’ 

or Sin @ cos p2 2 sin z’2 cos 0 + Sin 2’. 

Eliminating r between this and equation (3), 
we get 

f _ f2 Sin z’2 Sin @

This gives p2 and then (3) gives r.

In figure 20, let moon’s observed angular 
semi-diameter be S and let its linear radius be R 
miles. If the distancee of moon is r miles as: 
determined above, Sin S = R/r from which R can 
be determined. 


In India, parallax in zenith distance is called 
‘nati’ and parallax in longitude is called ‘lambana’, 
Lambana can be measured along equator or along 
ecliptic. Parallax calculation of moon and sun is 
necessary for calculation of solar eclipse. 


3 (e) Lunar parallax along equator and kranti- 
Mean equatorial horizontal parallax of moon is 57’ 
and for sun it is 8”.80 i.e. 1/388.6 of moon’s . 
parallax. Hence, accuracy is needed only in 
calculation of moon’s parallax.

A 6 = - pfr (cos 6 sin ®’- sin 6 cos ®’ cos H) - (2) 

Regarding earth as a sphere of radius a, we 
can write p and ©’ instead of a and ¢. 

Similarly parallax in longitude (along ecliptic) 
and latitude (Sara) can be calculated by considering 
P as pole of the ecliptic. Then great circle through 
P and Z’ will cut the ecliptic at T called ‘tribhona’ 
lagna as it is 90° less than the rising point of 


458 Siddhanta Darpana 


ecliptic on horizon or lagna. Hence T = Lagna -90°. 
If t is distance between Z and ecliptic (at T), then 
it is sara of z or declination of T (tribhona). PZ’ 
= 90° -t then. In stead of nata kala H we take 
distance of moon from tribhona i.e. v and f is 
latitude in stead of kranti .

the true direction of the star, viz its direction as 
seen from the sun and EX’ is the apparent

observer on the earth. The difference between these 
directions is the angle X’EX which is equal to the 
angle SX’E.

The parallax is used to measure stellar 
distances. Star is seen from the two positions of 
earth six months away (i.e. 180° away in its orbit). 
Direction of a star is seen with respect to a far i.e. 
faint star. Nearest star has parallax of only 0”.76 
corresponding to a distance of 


93,000,000 = ——w:76 * miles = 2.55 
ue 660 xX «60 X 180 ee 
X 10% miles 


This is used to define steller distance in units 
of parsec which is the distance for which stellar 
parallax will be 1”. Another unit is light: year, 
which is the distance travelled by light in 1 year 
at speed of 1,86,000 miles/sec 

1 par sec = 19 X 10” miles. 

1 light year = 6 X 10” 

Stellar parallax is not used in siddhanta texts, 
but have been indicated only to show the other 
kind of. parallax. Only in goladhyaya it has been 
mentioned (also in discussion of sighra paridhi in 
chapter 51 that stars are 360 times the distance of 
sun. This distance is much more and its parallax 
is no way connected to change of sighra paridhis 
in different quadrants. 

(4) (a) Refraction : The apparent direction of 
any planet or star changes due to bending of rays 
coming from that on earth due to refraction in its 


462 Siddhanta Darpana 


atmosphere. This is called ‘Valana’ in siddhanta 
astronomy and is calculated empirically. 


Effect of parallax (nati in kranti or lambana 
in longitude) is to shift the planet away from 
zenith. But due to refraction (valana), the planet 
appears higher i.e. closer to zenith. Both are 
maximum at horizon and zero for zenith. 


It is difficult to make exact calculation on the 
basis of refraction rules, even according to modern 
theories of physics. We obtain some formula after 
some simplifying assumptions about variations in 
density and refractive index of different layers of 
atmosphere. In siddhanta books, calculations are 
based on practical observations and the correction 
is assumed to vary according to natajya as in 
parallax. 


According to modern electromagentic theory, 
refraction of light is due to its reduction of speed, 
when it enters a material medium from vacuum. 
Since it is an electromagnetic wave, its speed is 
reduced due to dielectric properties of the medium, 
which has effect like resistance. The reduction in 
speed is more in denser medium. Ratios of speeds 
is called refractive index.

Since speed of light is maximum in vacuum,

lighter medium to material of higher deensity, then 
also its speed is reduced

Therefore, ZX; = (90°- ¢ ) - (90°-6) = 6-@ 

ZX2 = 90° — d+ 90° - 6 = 180° - g-—4 

Hence ZX, + ZX, = 180° — 2¢...... (1)

For values of ¢ greater than 75°, special tables 
are used based on observations. The refraction 
when a body is in the horizon is called the 
horizontal refraction, and its value is about 35’.

Let H + AH be the nataém&a of true sun 
when the apparent sun is rising. At this instant, 
the true sun is really 35’ below the horizon, its 
true zenith distance being 90° 35’. Hence, from the

At sun rise time, z = 90°, cos z = 0 

Thus apparent day length is increased and if 
sun rise at parama kranti time is measured, it gives 
a higher value of parama kranti. This may be one 
of the reasons for assuming its value as 24° instead 
of 23°27. 

4. (g) Shape of sun’s disc at sunrise or sunset 
- Lower limb of the sun is at a greater zenith 
distance than the upper. Hence due to refraction, 
the lower limb is raised more than the upper. Thus 
the sun appears flattened. This effect is maximum 
when sun is near the horizon. 


Let S be sun’s centre, a its radius and P any 
point on sun’s limb. (figure 30) 

Let ZS = z and let PQ be the perpendicular 
from P on ZS, 

On account of refraction, let P be displaced 
to P’ and let P’Q’ be the perpendicular from P’ 


474 Siddhanta Darpana 


on ZS. Then, since QP is small, the zenith distances 
of Pand Q are the same. So PQ will be displaced 
to P’Q’. 

Now take SZ as the X axis and perpendicular 
to it through S as the y axis. Then if the coordinate 
of P’ are (x,y), we have 
= SQ’ = a cos V + QQ’

LUNAR ECLIPSE 


Candragrahana Varnana 


Verse 1: According to views of smartta, vedic, 
purana knowers, there are unlimited good results 
from auspicious works at the time of grahana 
(eclipse) like bath, homa, charities etc. People 
repose faith on tithi calculations after seeing eclipse 
as predicted. Due to this importance, eclipse (solar 
and lunar) is described now. 


Notes : (1) This chapter describes the general 
methods applicable both to solar and lunar eclipse. 
Calculation of solar eclipse needs some special 
methods, which will be discussed in next chapter, 
named surya grahana. 


(2) Auspicious effects of grahana are subject 
of 3rd part of Jyotisa called sarnhita and need not 
be discussed here. However, calculation of grahana 
is a very complicated process. If such a rare event 
occurs as predicted by calculations, it is an excellant 
proof of correctness of theories and formulas. 


Verses 2-6 : Possibility of eclipse. 


Lunar eclipse - At the ending time of Purnima 
(when moon-sun = 180° exactly), difference of 
moon with rahu and ketu is calculated. When this 
differncee is less than 13°, then lunar eclipse is 
possible. 


Lunar Eclipse 477 


Solar eclipse - Similarly, at the end of 
amavasya (when moon - sun = 0°), moon and its 
pata (rahu or ketu) are calculated. Difference of 
moon from any of the pata being less than 18°, 
solar eclipse is probable. 


We calculate amanta time (when sun=moon), 
from earth’s centre. Pascima nata of candra X 1/3 
is substracted from this time and we again correct 
the true moon at this corrected amanta time. 


Again we calculate, vitribha (tenth lagna) for 
this time. 1/60 of its natajya is added to second 
true moon of this time, when moon and nata are 
in same direction. We substract, when they are in 
different directions. If this is less than 34 then, 
solar eclipse is probable. 


Sometimes, when south nati (in meridian 
circle) is less than 1°30’ then solar eclipse is 
probable. When drgvrtta is kranti vrtta, then 
difference of candra and its pata being less than 
7°, solar eclipse is possible. : 


Notes : (1) Reason of eclipse - When moon 
passes into the earth’s shadow, it fails to receive 
light from sun. This causes an ‘eclipse of moon. 
This can happen only when the sun and moon 
are on opposite sides of earth, i.e. on full moon 
time (Pirnima when moon-sun = 180’.) 


Figure 1 - Lumar eclipse 


478 Siddhanta Darpana 


‘Let S be the centre of the sun, E of earth. 
The cone touching sun and earth has its vertex at 
V. Then the portion of cone from earth upto V is 
the shadow cone of earth called umbra (bhtbha). 
This is completely dark as no light from sun reaches 
in that portion. 

Another cone is formed by tangents in 
transverse direction with vertex in opposite direc- 
tion between earth and sun. The portion of this 
cone after earth and beyond umbra (shadow) is 
partly dark and called penumbra (avatamasa). 

Mi, M4, are points on moon orbit at boundary 
of penumbra, M2, M3 on boundary of umbra. 
Between Mi M2 or M3 M4 portion, brilliance of 
moon is reduced, which are described as colour of 
eclipse but no eclipse is formed. In portion of orbit 
M2 M3 completely within the shadow cone of earth 
(bhibha), there is an eclipse. 


At point 1, moon’s disc just starts contact 
with, shadow, this is called first contact or ‘spar$a’ 
(touch) kala. At point 2 moon’s disc just enters 
completely in the shadow called second contact or 
‘nimilana’ or ‘sammilana’ (closing the eyes). When 
complete eclipse is about to end i.e. moon’s disc 
starts coming out of shadow at point 3, it is called 
third contact or ‘Unmilana’ (opening the eyes.) 

At point 4, moon completely comes out of 


shadow. It is called fourth contact or mokéa kala 
(freedom time.) 


When the moon is not completely eclipsed, 
the times of maximum eclipsed portion correspond 
to 2nd and 3rd contacts. 


Lunar Eclipse 479 


Figure 2 - Solar Eclipre 

(2) Reasons of solar eclipse : An eclipse of 
sun is caused by moon coming in between the 
observer and the sun. If the whole of sun is hidden 
behind the moon, we have a total eclipse. If moon 
covers only part of suns disc, we have a partial 
eclipse. When apparent diameter of moon is smaller 
than sun in a total eclipse, the eclipsed part of 
sun is surrounded by visible circle of sun, it is 
called annular eclipse. These are called ‘sarvagrasa, . 
and, ‘khanda grasa’ or kankana grahana respec- 
tively. This can happen only on amavasya, when 
sun and moon are in same direction. 


In figure 2, if observer is anywhere inside the 
shadow cone of moon AVE, the whole of sun is 
hidden from his view. If he is in the extended. 
cone FVG, only the central part of sun is hidden 
by the moon. If the observer is within penumbra 
CAV or VAD (except FVG portion), he will see a 
partial eclipse of sun. It can be seen that at point 
O in extended shadow cone only the inner portion 
BB’ of sun is obstructed. In this case, moon is 
smaller, so its shadow cone doesn’t reach earth’s 
surface. 


In this eclipse also, sparSa or first contact is 
time when eclipse starts. ‘Nimilana’ is time when 
maximum eclipse starts (or total eclipse) i.e. 2nd 
contact’. Unmilana or 3rd contact is when maximum 


480 Siddhanta Darpana 


or total eclipse is about to reduce. ‘MokSa’, or 4th 
contact is time when sun is completely visible. 


(3) Why eclipse doesn’t occur on every 
purnima or amavasya?- 

The inclina- 
tion of moon’s 
orbit to the ecliptic, 
is about 5°. Hence 
the maximum dis- 
tance of moon’s 
centre from the ecliptic is 5°. Now the axis of the 
earth’s shadow lies in the plane of the ecliptic. 
Moon’s diamater is about 1/2° and diameter of 
earth’s shadow at distance of moon is about 1-1/2°. 
So moon will touch the shadow, when its centre 
is at a distance from centre of shadow by less than 
1/2 (1/2° + 1-1/2°) = 1° approx. Thus, for most of 
the time, moon passes clear out of the shadow. 


Eclipse is possible only when moon is near 
N, the point of intersection of its orbit with ecliptic. 
The northern point of intersection, from where 
orbit goes north of ecliptic is called rahu and other 
southern pata is caled ketu. Hence, rahu and ketu 
are said to cause eclipse. 


For solar eclipse also, sun and moon should 
be in the plane of ecliptic, so that moon’s shadow 
touches the earth. Thus on every amavasya, when 
moon and sun are in same direction from earth, 
solar eclipse doesn’t occur. Shadow of moon is 
almost a point when its shadow cone touches the 
earth or it may not touch at all. Thus its radius 
may be taken as zero, at distance of earth (from 
moon). Earth’s radius makes an angle of about 1° 


. doit

“noon 


Figure 3 - Lunar eclipse not occurring 


Lunar Eclipse , 481 


at moon. Hence as distance between shadow centre 

and earth centre less than 1°, solar eclipse is 
. possible. Thus within similar distance of moon from 
‘its node, solar eclipse happens. 


In solar eclipse, sun is not covered, it is only 
locally obstructed, like obstruction of a cloud. Away 
from shadow cone at a short distance, sun is visible 
because parallax shift of moon is 57’ compared to 
8”.8 of sun, which is not obstructed there.

Let moon: touch the umbral cone at N and

approximately as AE is almost perpendicular to

This gives the theoretical value of s, but it is 
found that actual observations give the value 2%. 
larger, because earth’s atmosphere absorbs light. 

Angular radius of the penumbra at the

Approximate value of radius of shadow is 
about 42’ after adding 2% for atmosphere. It varies. 
with change in distance of sun and moon from 
earth. 


As moon moves 360° in 29-1/2 days with 
respect to sun, i.e. with respect to shadow, it will 
be fully in shadow till it covers (diameter of shadow 
- diameter of moon) = 2X42’ — 30’ = 54’ approx.

This is the maximum duration of a total lunar 
eclipse.

ecliptic. M is centre of moon. Moon’s orbit meets 
ecliptic at N which is its node. Angle betwen the 
orbits is i. 

In the diagram 
moon is just touching 
shadow. If C was Ci ™ 
when M was at N, 
then NC; is called the 
lunar ecliptic limit. If 
shadow is nearer then 
moon will definitely pass through the shadow. If 
C is away, moon cannot touch it and there will 
be no eclipse. Since M moves about 13 times faster, 
only moon’s motion is being discussed. 


As sun is diametrically opposite to C; and 
other node of moon’s orbit is opposite to N; lunar 
ecliptic limit is also the distance of sun’s centre 
from nearer node of moon’s orbit at the instant, 
moon is crossing the ecliptic. 


Figure 5 - Ecliptic Limit of moon 


Let NC = x when moon is crossing the 
ecliptic. Let n, m be the angular velocities of the 
sun and the moon (radian per hour) in planes of 
their orbits. Let the time counted’ from moon’s 
centre passing through node be t hours. Then at 
time t, 


NC = x + nt, NM = nuit 

Taking NCM as a plane triangle, 

CM? = (x+nt)* + (ni7t*) - 2mit (x+nt) cos i- (1) 
CM is a minimum when t is given by 

2 (xtnt) n + 2nj’t - 2n; x cos i - 4 nint cosii 


by differentiating equation (1) with respect to t.

Substituting the value of t given by this in 

(1) and simplifying, minimum value of CM is

When moon just grazes the earth’s shadow 
in its course along its orbit, the minimum value 
of CM - must be equal to the sum of the radii of 
shadow and moon. Hence (2) is equated with

=p P+ Pr) + Ss 


where S and S; are angular semi diameters of 
sun and moon, P and P; are equatorial horizontal 
parallax of sun and moon. 

As all the quantities P, P;, S and S; are 
variable, the lunar ecliptic limit also varies. Its 
greatest value, called the superior ecliptic limit is 
12°.1 and the least value, called the inferior ecliptic 
limit is 9°.5 These limits are for a partial eclipse. 

By equating (2) to the difference of radii of 
the shadow and the moon, we can find limits for 
a total lunar eclipse.

Figure 7 - solar ecliptic limit 


Solar Eclipstic Limits - The solar ecliptic limit 
is the distance of the sun from the nearer node 
of the moon’s orbit, at the moment of new moon, 
if a solar eclipse is just possible on this occasion. 

Let MN be moon’s orbit and SN the ecliptic, 
so that N is a node of the moon’s orbit and let 


the inclination of the moon’s orbit to the ecliptic 
be i. = ZMNS. 


486 . Siddhanta Darpana 


Let M and S be centres of moon and sun at 
the instant of a new moon occuring when the sun 
is near N. By the definition of a new moon 
(amavasya), longitudes (rasi) of M and S are the 
same. Let 8 be the latitude of moon when at M. 


Let M’, S’ be the positions of the moon and 
the sun t hours later, and MSN is taken as a plane 
triangle. 


Let MM’ = x 
Then change in moon’s longitude in t hours 
is x COS i. 


Then change in the sun’s longitude in t hours, 
i.e. SS’ is m x cos i, where

If M’S’ = D, we have 
D* = © cot i-mx cos i)? + (8 cosec i -x)? 
— 2 cos i (6 cos i - mx cos i) (6 cosec i-x) - (1) 
Only variable in this is x. Differentiating it 
with respect to x, minimum value of D is given 
by

— cos i (- cot i - m # cos i cosec i+2 mx cosi) 
2h . 
B sini 


or X =

Substitution in (1) shows that the smallest 
value of D is 


Lunar Eclipse 487 


(1 — m) f cosi 

(1 — 2m cos? i + m? cos? i)” 

.When numerical values of m and i are 
substituted, it is seen that the value of this 
expression is very nearly f cosi, i.e. the value after 
supposing m = 0 (i.e. very small speed of sun). 
Putting, therefore, 


B cosi = S +S; + Py - P 

We have the condition that the sun just misses 
being eclipsed. This gives 

B = (S + Si + Pi - P) Seci 

as critical value of 8 within which f should 
be for an eclipse to be seen in some part of earth. 

Solar ecliptic limit is the corresponding value 
of 

SN = (S+Si+Pi-P) cosec i 

Its greatest value is 18°.5 i.e. the superior 
solar ecliptic limit; its least value is 15°.4 which is 
the inferior ecliptic limit of sun. 


Thus the text mentions only the superior 
ecliptic limits of sun and moon as 18° and 13°. If 
distance of sun from the node is more than this; 
eclipse is impossible, if it is less than the lower 
ecliptic limit 15°.4 or 9°.5 eclipse is certain at new 
moon or purnima. If distance of sun is within 
inferior and superior ecliptic limits on new or full 
moon, solar or lunar eclipse may or may not 
happen. Further checking should be done at the 
ending times of purnima or amavasya by lambana 
(parallax) of sun and moon and their true diameters 
and speed. 


488 ; Siddhanta Darpana 


(7) The other condition of solar eclipse is for 
a local place. The solar eclipse may happen, but 
it will be visible for only a small belt on earth’s 
surface through which moon’s shadow cone passes. 


When sun and moon are in same direction 
from earth’s centre, the eclipse will be visible from 
a place where difference in parallax of moon and 
sun is less than the sum of their semi diameters 
(= 34’) approx. 


Figure 8 - parallax in amavasya time 

Figure 8 shows the position of true 
amavasya, when moon M and Sun § are in same 
direction from earth’s centre E. When observer is 
at O in this line, i.e. when moon and sun are on 
zenith, then the same position remains. When 
observer is at O’, moon is ahead of sun towards 
east by p = Z O’SE of parallax. Thus moon will 
be in same direction with sun slightly before true 
position, at true time it goes ahead. Thus for east 
nata amavasya time is before true time and in west 
nata it will be after true amavasya time. 


Surya siddhanta has assumed horizontal paral- 
lax as 1/15th of the daily motion of a planet, on 
assumption that the (speed X distance) for the 
planet is constant. Linear speed of every planet is 


Lunar Eclipse , 489 


assumed to be same and it comes ot to be (15 X 
radius of earth) as explained in 2nd part of this 
book. For moon this gives correct parallax but gives 
great error for other planets, due to wrong 
assumption of distances. Maximum parallax are 
compared below in vikala.

. Siddhanta darpana has corrected the values 
for sun and moon (through still assuming same 
linear speeds) 

Horizontal parallax for moon = 3388”,22 


Horizontal parallax for Sun 31.63 


Change in sun’s parallax is an improvement 
caused due to taking higher value of sun’s diameter 
as mentioned in Atharva veda. But still it is about 
3.6 times the true value. 


Changed formula for parallax are 


Daily speed 
Sun max parallax = 164 
Dail d 
Moon max parallax = =a = 


Thus the parallax of moon is the distance 
travelled by it in 4 ghati (60 ghati in a day/15) 


490 Siddhanta Darpana 


according to strya siddhanta and in 4/17 ghati 
according to this book. 


For rough calculation, appendix 3(e) after 
chapter 7 gives the formula (3) as 


Al = - © cos t sin v 


pir = max. parallax, v is distance from 
‘Tribhona’ lagna, which is taken as zenith as first 
step. 

Then the correction in ghati is 

4.28 X cos t. X Sin H 

where H = nata kala 


For 45° nata (middle position between 
meridian and west horizon), sin H = 1/ v2, H = 
15/2 = 7.5 ghati. 


This positive correction for pascima nata will 
be 2.5 ghati or 1/3 of nata kala if t = taken 30° 
(nata of tribhona) 

Parallax in Sara = p/r sin t. 


Parama nati = 1°/60 approximately, hence 1/60 
of natajya of vitribha or tribhona lagna is added 
for calculating Sara difference of moon. Assuming 
nil Sara at eclipse time, this can be maximum of 
34’ for an eclipse to be possible at that place. 


(8) Other condition for solar eclipse - When 
sun is moving on east west vertical line, its kranti 
being equal to latitude of the place, its difference 
with moon when apparent longitudes are equal is 
the north south difference i.e. nati (parallax in Sara 
or latitude). When it is less than 1/2 (sum of 
diameters of sun and moon) or 1°30’ then only 
solar eclipse can happen. 


Lunar Eclipse 491 


When Difference of moon and its pata is less 
then 7° then also solar eclipse can happen. This 
is same as 1°30’ difference from ecliptic. 


(9) Greatest and least number of eclipses in a 
year - 
Ecliptic limits are as follows - 
Superior _ Inferior 
Lunar ecliptic limits 12°.1 79°65 
Solar ecliptic limits 18°.5 15°.4 
1 Lunar month = 29.5 days 


So, time from full moon to next new moon 
= 14.75 days. 

Node of moon moves backwards, making one ° 
revolution in about 19 years. Hence sun makes one 
complete revolution with respect to node in 346.6 
days. Thus, with respect to node, sun moves 
360° x 14.75 


346.6 or about 15°.3 in half a lunar month.

Figure 9 - No of eclipse 
(A) Least number of eclipses - 

Figure 9 shows the ecliptic and N, N’ are 
nodes of moon’s orbit. Let NS; = NS2 = N’S; = 
N’S,. 

= inferior solar ecliptic limit i.e 15°.4. 


492 Siddhanta Darpana 


Let NM, = NMz2 = N’M3 = N’M,y 
= inferior lunar ecliptic limit i.e. 9°.4 


Inferior limits have been chosen to find the 
most infavourable cases in which no eclipse occurs 
beyond these limits. 


Movement of sun is in direction of arrow. 
Si S2 = 2X15°.4 i.e. 30°8 but sun moves with respect 
to N by 2X15°.3 between two consecutive new 
moons. Thus in travel from S; to Sz at least one 
solar eclipse is bound to occur, because there will 
be a definite new moon in 30.6 days and sun will 
be within limit of eclipse. 


Suppose now that the eclipse occurs when 
sun is near N, then the sun will be outside NM, 
and NMz at previous and next full moons (i.e. 
15°.3 away) while NMi = NM, = 9.5 only. Hence, 
there will be no lunar eclipse in previous or coming 
full moons. Thus there will be only one eclipse 
(solar) while sun crosses N. 


Sun will be at N’ after about 1/2 X 346.6 = 
173..3 days after it has crossed N. Now 6 lunar 
months occupy 6X29.5 = 177 days. Therefore, about 
4 days after the sun at N’,, there will be a new 
moon. Then sun is only 3.7 X 360°/346.6 =3.84 
from N’ i.e. will within ecliptic limit of N’S,. Thus 
there will be a solar eclipse. The preceding and 
succeding full moon occur out side M3 Mg, as sun 
moves about 1° in a day. NiM3 = 9°.5 but N’S 
= 14.75 - 3.84 = 10.91 on previous full moon. In 
next full moon N’S = 14.75 + 3.84 = 18.59. Thus 
there are no lunar eclipses then. 


If the year began shortly after the sun had 
crossed S., the year will end 365.25-346.6 days after 


Lunar Eclipse 493 


the same point relative to nodes, so the year will 
have ended much before sun comes near N again. 


Hence in such circumstances, there will be 
only two eclipses in the year, both solar.. 


(B) Greatest number of eclipses in an year - 

Now in figure 9, let NMi = NM2 = N’M;3 - 
N’Mg = 12°.1 i.e superior lunar ecliptic limit. 

NS: = NS2 = N’S3 = N’Sq = 18°.5, the superior 
solar ecliptic limit. 

Suppose further that there is a new moon as 
soon as the sun enters S,;N. There will be a solar 
eclipse then. Time counted from the eclipse is 
indicated by H = half lunar month.. Then we have 
to examine solar eclipses at new moons at time 0, 
2H, 4H, 6H - - - Similarly lunar eclipses are 
examined on full moons at times H, 3H, 5H - - - 

(i) There is already a solar eclipse at t = 0 

(ii) At t = H, Sun is at 15°.3 from S; and 
within M,N at full moon, so there will be a lunar 
eclipse then. 

(iii) At t = 2H, sun has advanced 2X15°.3 
from S,; so it is within NS2 and there will be a 
solar eclipse. 

At t = 3H, 4H, - - - 11H, the sun will be 
within S2 and S3 i.e. outside all the ecliptic limits, 
and there will be no eclipses. 

(iv) At t = 12 H, sun will have advanced 
12X15°.3 i.e. about 184° from S; i.e. 4° from $3. 
So the sun is within S3N’ and there will be a solar 
eclipse. 


494 Siddhanta Darpana 


(v) At t = 13H, sun will have advanced 4° + 
15°.3 from $3, so it is 19°.3-18°.5 = 0°.8 from N’ 
in N’M, and there will be a lunar eclipse. 

(vi) At t = 14 H, - - - sun will be 0.8 + 15°.3 
= 16°.1 from N’ i.e. will within N’S, = 18°.5. So 
there will be a solar eclipse. 

At t = 15 H, 16 H, 23 H, the sun will be 
between Sq and Sj, i.e. outside all ecliptic limits, 
and there will be no eclipses. 

(vii) At t = 24H, sun will have advanced 2X4° 
= 8° from Sy, so it is within SiN and there will 
be a solar eclipse. 

(viii) At t = 25 H, the sun will have advanced 
8°+15°.3 from Si, so it is within NMz2, and there 
will be a lunar eclipse. 


But this eighth eclipse occurs 14.75 X 25 days 
i.e. 368.75 days after the first eclipse, i.e. about a 
year and 3-1/2 days after the first. So out of 
8 eclipses, Ist solar or 8 th lunar eclipse has to be 
ommitted in a year. Thus in a year there can be 
maximum of 5 solar+2 lunar or 4 solar + 3 lunar 
eclipses depending upon when the year began. 

(10) Eclipse cycle : In Chaldea, before 400 BC, 
(may be in time of Sargon in 2350 BC approx,) a 
cycle was discovered after which eclipses were 
repeated. This was called Saros cycle of 18 years 
10.5 days or 223 synodic lunar months. 


223 synodic months = 6585.321 days 
242 dracontic months = 6585.357 days 
=19 X 346.62005 days (Dracontic year) 


Draconitic year is revolution of sun with 
respect to lunar node and draconitic month is 


Lunar Eclipse 495 


revolution of sun with respect to its node. Nodes 
of moon were called Dragons. 

Visvamitra had mentioned half cycle in 
Rkveda of 3339 tithis = 111 synodic months + 9 
tithis. 

Example of the cycle for least no. of eclipses 
in given below - (No lunar eclipse + 2 solar eclipses)

Actual determination of eclipse, is by calculat- 
ing the extent of eclipse according to true speeds 
and gara as explained later. 

Verse 6 : This book has used different 
methods for lambana correction for sphuta amanta 
(new moon day), true positions of sun and moon, 
dimensions of sun, moon and shadow, grasa 
(covered) amount of moon, sthiti (total eclipse time) 


496 Siddhanta Darpana 


vimarda (total time of complete or maximum 
eclipse), real true lambana, sphuta nati, digvalana 
and_ parilekha etc. This will be useful, so learned 
men should not think it to be incorrect. 


Notes : Many of the methods have not been 
approved by earlier siddhanta works, but these 
methods give more correct results. Hence this 
needs to be accepted more eagerly, instead of 
rejecting it. 

His methods for different methods of moon’s 
motion has already been mentioned in chapter 6. 
Correction of moon’s and sun’s motion is also due 
to his revised values of manda paridhis which 
change continuously in quadrants. For moon, only 
one maximum value has been indicated and its 
ratio with least value should be increased. Earlier, 
either the manda paridhi was fixed or a fixed 
difference of 40’ was kept at the end of odd and 
even quadrants. 


Lambana and nati formula have been cor- 
rected due to changed formula of maximum nati. 
For moon this is taken as 1/14th of daily motion 
instead of general formula of 1/15th of daily motion 
for all planets. For sun it is entirely changed to 
1/164 of daily motion, which has no parallel in 
earlier texts. The correct variation of nati and 
lambana has been calculated instead of rough linear 
method. 


Value of sun’s diameter and consequently its 
distance from earth has been increased about 11 
times the traditional value of 6,500 yojanas to 72,000 
yojanas as mentioned in Atharvaveda. This has led 
to other changes in constants and methods. These 
corrections have been in right direction and more 
-accurate. 


Lunar Eclipse 497 


Verses 7-8 - Correct time of parvanta - 

On amanta or purnanta day (moon-sun = 0° 
or 180°), sun and moon will be made sphuta (at 
sunrise or midnight time. For parva ending, only 
mandaphala - correction is needed in moon. On 
amavasya day, difference of moon and sun is taken, 
on ptrnima, it is moon - (Sin + 180°). Difference 
ragi etc is converted to para (1/60 vikala) and is 
divided by difference of sphuta gati of moon and 
sun in kala. Result will be in vighati (pala). 


This time in pala etc is added to parvanta 
time i.e. to sunrise time for which calculations had 
been done, if moon is less than sun (or sun+180° 
on purnima). If moon is more, it will be sub- 
stracted. Then we get the correct time (after or 
before sunrise for ending time of parva (parnima 
or amavasya). For this time, we again calculate 
sphuta moon and sun and from these values, 
correct parvanta time is calculated. After repeated 
applications of the method we get correct parvanta 
(for centre of earth). After that, other corrections 
for eclipse are made (like lambana or nati) for 
observation from surface of earth. 


Notes : As first approximation speed at 
parvanta is assumed to be same as at sunrise time 
and accordingly correct time is calculated. Our aim 
is to find the time when moon-sun or moon- 
(sun+180°) is zero. If moon is less than this value, 
it will cover up the distance due to higher speed. 
The difference is in para (1/60 vikala), speed diff. 
is in kala/day.

After finding approximate parvanta time, we. 
get better approximation of sun and moon position 
(their difference and their speeds. Then we get 
more correct value of parvanta.

Vrses 9-11 - Samaparva Kala - When for sun, 
the mandaphala, gati phala and udaydantara phala 
- all three are positive or negative, we further 
correct the samaparva kala i.e. middle point of 
eclipse is slightly different from true parvanta 
above. Steps are as follows -

tara phala all are positive,

When the three above are negative 

Samaparvakala = Parvakala + L 

(6) For this difference of time we further 
correct the positions of sun and moon at parvants.

Notes : (1) Before analysing the formula we 
should analyse the reasons as to why closest contact 
will not be at amanta or purnimanta time. 


E is shadow of earth centre moving on ecliptic 
for lunar eclipse. For solar eclipse it is disc of sun. 
M is centre of moon moving on its orbit in direction 
MPN. 

At point EM, when EM is perp. to NE, 
ecliptic, longitudes of E and Mare same which is 
ending time of amavasya or ptrnima as calculated 
earlier. However, closest approach is at P when 
EP is perpendicular at P. Thus the real mid. point 
of eclipse will be after purnimanta time. When RM 
is after crossing N, then it is before parvanta time. 
This difference is due to inclination of moon’s orbit 
with ecliptic and difference PM is given by 
udayantara phala of moon in latitude along ME 
. direction and bhujantara phala in EN direction. 


Another reason of difference is due to. 
different speeds at points of contact before P and 
after P. Due to that the mid point will be shifted 
from P in ratio of speed difference given by 
mandaphala of moon. 


Udayantara and bhujantara phala of moon are 
almost for same time difference as sun, aS moon 


500 Siddhanta Darpana 


and sun or earth’s shadow are in same position 
almost. The result for shadow at 180° from sun is 
same. If speed of moon is increasing, the time in 
covering contact distance towards N after P will 
be less and mid point will be towards opposite 
direction i.e. deducted. 

Similarly for other results positive, the time 
is to be deducted. If mandaphala is + ve, gati 
phala of sun is negative, hence relative motion of 
moon will be positive and it is to be added. 

Thus the difference due to latitude difference 
is (udayantara + bhujantara) of moon + gatiphala 
of sun. This will be increased in the ratio of 
mandaphala of moon. For outer contact, moon will 
cross its (own diameter + shadow portion). For 
inner contact (maximum) it will cover (shadow - its 
own diameter). Hence the product is to be divided 
by angular diameter of moon. In solar eclipse, it 
is almost equal to diameter of sun. 


There appears some error in text. All the 
quantities are in angular measure, which cannot 
be divided by yojanas, it should be angular 
diameter. 


When all the three factors causing error are 
of one sign, correction is proposed, otherwise they 
almost cancel each other. 


Qualiative discussion will be done at the time 
of calculating duration of eclipse. 

Verses 12-15 : Diameters and distances of sun 
and moon- 


In Atharvaveda, while explaining the meaning 
of ‘Aum’, diameter of solar disc has been stated 
to be 72,000 yojanas. Based on this statement, I 


Lunar Eclipse . * | 501 


have corrected the disc sizes of planets, their orbits 
etc. through observation and calculation. 

Diameter of moon and earth are 1/162 parts 
and 1/45 parts -of sun’s diameter. Earlier 
astronomers also have.stated the diameter of earth 
as 1600 yojana (value obtained. here). The values 
in yojana and angle are stated as follows - 


Diameter in yojana Angular diameter mean

Moon 444 7 31/20 kala

Mean moon diameter = — 35 


Mean distance of sun from earth = 76,08,294 
yojana . 
moon = 48,705 yojana. 


Mean sun diameter 


From this true distance, manda spasta karna 
also can be calculated. 

As in case of moon’s angular diameter, earth’s 
shadow’s angular diameter also can: be known in 
moon’s orbit (approx ‘by multiplying with 6/85).

Diameter of earth is a measure of yojana as 
its astronomical definition. Hence; it is seen that 
diameter and distance of moon are almost accurate 
in surya siddhanta or others, but sun’s diameter 
is taken only 4 times the earth or 14 times moon 
by Aryabhata (13.37 times by Bhaskara II or saya 
siddhanta). Its real value is 109.18 times earth’s 
diameter or 402 times moon’s diameter. 


However angular diameters were almost cor- 


rect.

Sun ~ 32/31/33: 32/20 32/32/6 32/4 


Angular diameters and their ratios are almost 
correct. Moon’s angular diameter can be directly 
observed, but it is difficult to see sun directly. Still 
it can be seen through reflection etc. and due to 
frequent annular eclipses its mean diameter has 
been taken slightly more than moon. 


Linear diameter is calculated by formula 
(angular diameter x distance), when angle is in 
radians. This rato is almost 1/108 , this 108 is an 
important number for no. of beads in a prayer 
garland, no. of salutes to guru, astottari system of 
dasa in astrology etc. Moon’s distance could be 
correctly estimated with direct parallax, but direct 
measurement of sun’s distance cannot be done. 


The accurate looking figures of distances of 
sun and moon are derived from round figures of 


Lunar Eclipse 503 


their circumference of their orbits after division by 
In = 2 X 355/113 almost. On moon’s orbit 1’ has 
been assumeed eequal to 15 yojana by Surya 
siddhasnta and 10 yojanas by Aryabhata. Linear 
velocity of planet = (angular velocity X distance) 
has been assumed constant. Actually areal velocity 
= angular velocity X (distance)* is constant accord- 
ing to Kepler’s laws for elliptical orbits. Thus all 
planets are assumed to cover equal distance in 
equal time and total distance covered by them in 
a kalpa is equal to orbit or circumference of sky. 


Accordingly, orbit of stars has been assumed 
60 times orbit of sun. CandraSekhara must have 
seen distances of farther planets like pluto 40. times 
sun’s orbit. Hence he increased it to another round 
figure 360 and explained difference of 1° sighra 
paridhi difference according to this, which is not 
correct. 

Similarly, he must have come across much 
larger figure of sun’s distance and verified it 
according to parallax in solar eclipse. But he could 
increase it only 150 times moon’s distnace instead 
of 400 times as he got diameters of 72,000 yojana 
from Atharva-veda. Earlier astronomers also must 
have obsereved it, but they didn’t try to change 
it drastically, as the angular measure is sufficient 
for prediction of eclipse. Traditional value of strya 
siddhanta appears to be obstruction. 


Siddhanta darpana has assumed value of 
yojana in Atharvaveda as his own yojana which is 
incorrect as Aryabhata etc. had assumed yojana of 
about 8 miles; compared to 5 miles yojana of surya 
siddhanta. Of course, he has compared 1600 yojana 


504 Siddhanta Darpana 


diameter with strya siddhanta, though no such 
measure has been found in vedas. 


However M.B. Panta (Vedavati, Pune, 1981) 
has opined that for steller measures; maha yojana 
= 5 X Aryabhata yojana = 40 miles was used. 
Accordingly, Triganku means 3 X 10%; in 
mahayojana units it is 3X10'°X40 miles = 207 light 
years which is really the distance of Triganku star 
(Beta Crucis). Similarly Agastya or Argo navis has 
crossed Jaladhi or 104 distance; which is 10'*X40 
miles = 690 light years in maha yojana units (correct 
distance is 652 light years). Mandala means 
revolution or circumference, diameter is indicated 
by width or viskambha in jyotisa. Hence 72000 
yojana mandala means it is circumference. In 
mahayojana units this value means diameter of 9.1 
lakh miles which is slightly more than 8.66 lakh 
miles, the modern value. This may be correct if 
we include the corona of sun. 

Another indication of yojana measure is given 
in Rkveda (1-123-8) 

Agwita AseMifee al ate aad aeeT aT | 

araenhand ascent ad uftata ae: 11 


Sayana has interpreted it that dawn goes 
ahead of sun by 30 yojanas and along with it 
moves round. 


Similar verse is in RK 6-59-6 which, dawn 
goes ahead 30 steps i.e. units of length. In modern 
astronomy, dawn is taken 18° ahead, Tilaka in his 
Arctic home in vedes, page 85, has taken it 16’, 
probably for central India at 24°N. However, in 
sandhya of each yuga, its value has been taken as 
1/12th of yuga value. Thus dawn of day time of 
12 hours is 1 hour, i.e. 1/24 of a day. This is 15° 
(360°/24) in angles. Thus circumference of earth is 


Lunar Eclipse 505 


30X24=720 yojanas and sun’s circumfereence is 
72,000 yogana i.e. 100 times in round figures. In 
round numbers 108 japa is counted as 100 hence 
it gives almost correct dimensions of sun. 


Ratio of moon’s diameter with earth’s diameter 
has been slightly increased and it is more correct 
according to modern values. Increase of parallax 
from 1/15 of earth radius to 1/14th is also more 
correct and might have been confirmed by obser- 
vation. 


(2) Diameter of earth’s shadow in moon’s orbit 
- 85 yojanas in moon’s orbit have been taken as 6 
kala i.e. kala = 14.2 yojana. Hence linear diameter 
of earth’s shadow multiplied by 6/85 gives its 
angular diameter; because it is in moon’s orbit. 


Verses 16-21 - True values of diameter and 
distance— If manda kendra (of sun and moon) is 
in 6 rasis beginning with makara, manda kotiphala 
is added to trijya and substracted from trijya if 
manda kendra is in other six ragis (karka to dhanu). 
Result is substracted from double of trijya, by 
remainder we divide the square of trijya (118, 844). 
Result will be sphuta manda karna of sun and 
moon. If this method is used for star planets like 
mangala, it will give their radial distance from sun 
as centre. 


This sphuta karna in kala is multiplied by 
madhya yojana karna and divided by trijya to give 
sphuta manda karna in yojanas. Madhya bimba 
kala divided by sphuta yojana and multiplied by 
madhya yojana gives sphuta birhba kala. 

(Quoted from Siddhanta Siromani) - Manda 
karna is found like sighra karna. It is substracted 
from 2 X trijya and by remainder, we divide square 
of trijya. Result in kala is manda karna of sun and 
moon which is the distance from centre of earth. 


poe oe Siddhanta Darpana 


Manda karna kala multiplied by madhya yojana 
karna and divided by trijya gives sphuta yojana 
karna. Diameter of sun is 6522 yojana and of moon 
is 480 yojana (values of Bhaskara, not of this book 
- Quotation ends). 

Method of Bhaskaracarya also gives accurate 
value, still I have calculated sphuta karna from koti 
phala (instead of mandaphala because, for 3 ra$i 
difference between sphuta graha and mandocca, 
manda sphuta karna is equal to koti. 

Note : (1) True

(3) Siddhanta Darpana formula has two 
unncessary steps for manda kendra 270° to 90°, 
we first add manda koti phala to trijya, then 
substract the sum from 2 X trijya. This is equivalent 
to substracting mandakotiphala from trijya

Vereses 28-30 : Meaning of rahu 


Lunar eclipse is caused when moon enters 
earth’s shadow, and solar eclipse is caused by 
covering of sun by moon. This is possible only 
when sun, moon and shadow of earth are near 
node (pata) of candra whose names have been 
given rahu and ketu (half part of rahu itself). Hence 
it is said that rahu devours sun or moon in eclipse. 


In siddhanta Siromani - If eclipse is caused 
by same rahu, why there are different direction 
(of beginning of) eclipse, different times (short or 
long periods) and different coverings (total or 
partial eclipse). So persons assuming eclipse by 
rahu have false pride of their knowledge of sphere, 
actually they are fools and against (true meaning 
of) Veda, purdna and samhita. 

Rahu is shadow planet (a fictitous point), 
which covers moon by entering earth shadow 
(being near it); and covers sun by entering moon. 
For such ability, sun has given boon to him. This 
type of interpratation is not against scriptures. 


Veerse 31-32 : Reasons of eclipse 


Lunar eclipse - Shadow of earth is in opposite 
direction of sun and moves east wards in ecliptic 
like sun. At the end of full moon, when moon is 
in opposite direction of sun, its speed is more than 
shadow speed, so it enters the shadow and crosses 
it. After entring shadow, its light (from sun) is 
lost. Thus lunar eclipse is seen. 


Solar eclipse : At the end of amavasya, when 
moon and sun are in same direction (same ra&i), 
then moon moving east covers sun and with faster 
speed crosses out in east direction. Sun being very 


Lunar Eclipse 515 


juminous cannot bee seen. While covering it, on: 
jightless moon is seen. 


Verse 33 : DigamSa correction of rahu 


As we add or substract fourth phala (Sighra 
correction) in pata of star planets like mangala, 
similarly digarnsa phala of rahu is calculated as of 
moon and it is added or substracted. 


Note : DigamSa phala = 1/10 of mandaphala 
of sun. This is correction in moon’s orbit due to 
variation in annual attraction of sun, which changes 
the direction of moon’s orbit. Hence it changes 
direction of rahu also. This correction has been 
described in chapter 6. 


Verses 34-35 - Sara of moon 


Sphuta pala is deducted from sphuta moon’ 
at corrected parvanta time. Bhuja jya of this arc is 
calculated. This is jya of vikSepa kendra. We add 
1/38 part. of it. From half of result, arc is found. 
This arc divided by 6 gives Sara of moon. 

When moon - pata (or vipata candra) is in 
six rasis beginning with mesa, Sara is in north 
direction, otherwise in south direction.

which is almost same as (2). as may be

of moon’s orbit is reduced by about 18’ to 290’ 
approx. Hence the value of parama Sara was taken 
as less than the true value, in earlier texts. 


Verse 36: Method for Sara gati 


Instead of finding arc, we multiply the 
kotiphala of moon and it is multiplied by pata and 
motion of moon and divided by trijya. Result is 
current speed of Sara. By adding or substracting 
kranti gati, we get sphuta Sara from equator. 

Notes: (1) There are three confusing words in 
the verse--Whose kotiphala is to be taken is not 
specified----I have interprated it to be kotiphala of 
Moon's movement along ecliptic i.e. its raéi etc 
from pata. 


Whether motion of pata and moon both are 
Meant--- 


pata has very small motion and when motion 
of sun is being neglected, much smaller motion of 


518 Siddhanta Darpana 


pata cannot be taken. Hence it is pata or Sara from 
ecliptic and motion of moon. 


Result of this multiplication and correction 
with kranti both are called sphuta Sara. First sphuta 
Sara is distance of moon from kranti vrtta. Second 
sphuta Sara is distance from equator= distance 
frojm kranti vrtta(Sara)+ distance of spasta moon 
on kranti vrtta from equator (i.e. kranti of moon). 

Translation has been made according to these 
clarifications. :

subtracted and divided by11. (i.e. moon-pata). For 
greater values, this will be incorrect 


Notes : Kala of bhuja is almost equal to jya 
for small angles. 


It is to be multiplied by

Substraction of 1/16 part is to convert the 
bhuja approximately to its jya: 
Verse 39: Extent of eclipse (grasa) 

The planet which is to be eclipsed is called 
grahya or chadya and the planet or shadow which 
covers it, is called grahaka or chadaka. Half the 
sum of their angular diameters is ‘manardha’ or 
‘manaikyardha’. If gara is more, there cannot be 
eclipse. Differance of manardha and Sara is the 
grasa (covering). If grasa is more than grahya, then 
eclipse is total. Remaining part of grasa is in sky. 


Note : Except for the terms, the cause of 
eclipse has already been explained. 


520 Sitddhanta Darpana 


Figure 14 (a) Figure 14 (b) 

P is centre of planet to be eclipsed and XM 
is diameter. Its distance from centre of coverer O 
is Sara-OP. Either the coverer (chadaka) earth 
shadow or covered (chadya) sun is on ecliptic 

In figure 14(a) covered portion 

XY = PX - PY 

= ry —- (OP — rm) =1m+1r — OP 

Where ri and 12 are radii of the bimba. 

When XY > 2r then eclipse is total as in fig 
14(b) 


Verse 40 : Direction and stages-- 


Lunar eclipse has contact in east and end in 
west often (as explained in verses 31-32) Calculation 
is done as per this rule only. But solar eclipse 
often stgaxsts in west and ends in east direction, 
tiowever, sometimes south west direction is calcu- 
lated instead of east west direction 


When grahaka just completely covers the 
grahya, it is called ‘nimilana’ time. When it is about. 
to start emerging, it is called unmilana. Time from 
nimilana to unmilana is called ‘marda kala’ or 
‘vimarda kala’ (period of total or maximum eclipse). 
Total time of eclipse from sparsa to mok§a is called 
grahana kala or ‘sthityardha’ kala. 


Lunar Eclipse 521 


verses 41-43 : Total time and time of complete 
eclipse- 

Parvanta time. When moon and sun have 
same rasi etc. (in solar eclipse) or their difference 
is exactly six raSis; it is the time of eclipse. This 
time (after minor correction of verse 11) is called 
sama parva kala and is middle point of eclipse. 


Square of manardha (half sum of diameters 
of grahya and grahaka) is substracted from square 
of sphuta Sara and of remainder, square root is 
taken. This is multiplied by 60 and divided by 
difference of moon gati and sun gati. Result is half 
time of eclipse (sthityardha kala). Its double is total 
time of eclipse. 


Similarly, square of half the difference of 
diameters of grahya and grahaka is substracted 
from square of sphuta Sara. Square root of 
remainder is multiplied by 60 and divided by 
differance of gati of moon and sun. Result is 
‘marda- ardha’ kala in ghati etc. Its double is 
‘marda’ kala or time of complete eclipse. 


From samaparva kala (mid point of eclipse), 
substraction of sthiti ardha and marda-ardha give 
sparsa and nimilana times. When sthiti ardha and 
marda-ardha are added, it gives unmilana and 
moksa times: 


For more correct times, we calculate sphuta 
candra and Sara at time of sparsa, unmilan etc and - 
from them again these times are calculated. In solar 
eclipse, repeated larnbana corrections are made. 


Notes : (1) This is an approximate formula in 
which Sara of moon is considered to be same, 
hence there is need for successive approximation. 
First, we derive the approximate formula, assuming 


522 , Siddhanta Darpana 


the Sara to be minimum distance of moon from 
mid point of eclipse. 


M4 Mi 


Figure 15 - Period of aclipse 

In figure 15, O is centre of earth shadow and 
ON is ecliptic. Shadow is considered fixed and 
moon is moving in direction M; N with relative 
speed (moon-sun). This direction is slightly more 
inclined 5°33’ compared to 5°9’ angle of moon’s 
orbit with ecliptic. as explained in verse 35. M1, 
M2, M3, M4 are positions of moon at 1st contact 
(sparsa), 2nd (nimilana), 3rd (unmilana) and 4th: 
contact (mokSa) 


OP is perpendicular on M; N and is almost 
equal to Sara. This value of Sara is assumed for all 
the four positon. Right angled triangle OPM; is 
almost a plane figure. 

Hence 


MiP = VM, O? — OP? 


= V I(moon bimba + shadow bimba)* — Sara? 
2 
Moon moves along M;P with relative speed 
of m-s where m and s are daily motions of moon 
and sun(or shadow) in 60 danda. 


60 x Mi P 
Hence it will cover MiP in —— danda 


This is same as M,P distance (as M; O=M, 
O). 


Lunar Eclipse 523 


Similarly, OM2 or OMs3 = radius of shadow- 
radius of moon. 


P M2 or PM3 = VOm3 = OPp2 


= V I(shadow diam — moon diam.)* — Sara?

Hence half time of total eclipse 
eee FRR TER CI RES 
= WS manantara* — Sara 


(2) Let T be time of conjunction, when moon 
and earth shadow have same longitude, and p the 
latitude (Sara) of moon, North latitude is considered 
positive, p’ is hourly increase in latitude nercARe 
towards north is positive) 


m’‘= excess of hourly increase in longitude of 
moon over that of sun. 


M= angular radius of Moon, S= angular radius 
of shadow at the moon. 


Then at any time t hours after time of 
conjunction, T, the distance between shadow and 
moon in longitude is m’t and the latitude of moon 
is ptp’t. 

Thus distance between centres of shadow and 
moon 

=(m't? + (p + p’ ty? 

The eclipse begins or ends when the moon’s 
rim just touches the rim of the shadow in entering 
it or leaving it. Distance between such time is 
S+ME=D say (fig 15) then { m? ? + (p + p’ t)? }! 
= D gives the time of beginning of eclipse. Pains 
this for t, we get 


524 Siddhanta Darpana 


, 6) 
= p> p? a Dp — p? 


t = —"*— + 
m* +p? (m’* + py m” + p? 


The + sign gives the end and --sign (earlier 
time) gives the beginning. 


Total phase of the eclipse begins or ends when 
the rims touch the moon being inside shadow (Mz, 
M3 position of fig. 15) i.e. D= S- M, Putting this 
value of D in above soulution, we get the times 
of beginning or end of total phase of eclipse. 


Discussion of results: 
(1) The eclipse begins at

7. - pp? D? - p 
2 (m 


(2) Eclipse ends at 


For full eclipse time D=S+M. For total eclipse 
D=S-M. 


(3) Middle of the eclipse falls at 


PP’ 
= m? + p@ hours 

(a) If p and p’ are both positive or both 
negative, middle of the eclipse is before the time 
of conjunction. . 

(If one is positive and other negative, middle 
is after conjunction) 

(b) Only when the latitude at conjunction p=o, 
the middle falls at T, the time of conjunction, 
because p’ cannot be zero near a node. 


Lunar Eclipse 525 


In verse 11-- p latitude is positive then 
udayantara is positive, p’ i.e. speed of latitude is 
positive when bhujantara is positive (verse 36). 
Thus when both are positive or negative time is 
corrected 

(4) If D=p, (1) and (2) reduce to .

(a) Eclipse begins or ends at the conjunction 


(b) Duration of eclipse is —z _3pP =z which may 
p’ 


amount to about 22 minutes 


(5) The duration is zero, when the expression 
between the goule brackets is zero, i.e. p is greater 
than D by re ; (neglecting fourth powers 
of p'/m’), which may amount to about 14” in the | 
mean. 


(6) If t is not real, there is no eclipse, or total 
eclipse, according as D is taken to be S+M or S-M. 
Then p-D is more than about 14” calculated above 


(3) Conditions of eclipse in equator coordinates 


Instant at middle of eclipse is chosen as origin 
of time in figure 16. 


Equator

Equatorial coordinates of centre C of shadow 
at time t hours is a, 6 and of centre M of moon 
be ai, 61. Then, if P is the pole and M D the 
perpendicular from M on P C (on celestial sphere), 
CD= 6:6 and DM= (ar1-a) cos 61, nearly. So 
CM? = (6; ~ 6)* + (a1 — a cos’. 6; - - (1) 

If, hourly rates of increase of a, a1, 6, 61 at 
t =o are (a) 0, (a1)o (6)o (61)o0 respectively, we can 
write (1) as 

CM? = [f{ (61)o + 641 t } - {(6)0 + 0’ HP 

+ [ (al)o + a’ t } - £ (alo + (a’ t)} F cos? 4,.....(2) 

approximately, neglecting the changes in cos 
6; due to changes in 61, because cos” 6; in the 
above equation is multiplied by a factor which is 
small. Equation (2) is of the form 

CM?=a t?+ bt +c - - - -(3) 


Where a, b, c are known quantities.

If we put CM= 2 (P + Pi — S) + S2 the two 


values ti and t2 given by (3) are the times of Ist 
and fourth contacts (sparsa and moksa). For the 
second and third contacts (i.e. beginning and end

verses 44-45 --Single. time calculation 


Method above uses successive approximation. 
Now method of single time calculation is described. 
Sara of samaparva kala is calculated. Its half is

divided by difference of gati of moon and sun; 
Result in danda etc is substracted from samaparva 
kala Sara, if Sara is increasing, otherwise it is added. 
For this parvakala, new values of moon and its 
Sara are found. Diffenence of this Sara and 
samaparva kala Sara in vilipta is squared and its 
half is taken. Its square root substracted from 
samaparva kala Sara is sphuta Sara. Sthiti kala 
calculated from this is correct. Now more accurate 
value of shadow is stated (in verses 78-84)

verses 46-50 : Grasa from time. 

Now method is described to calculate grasa . 
from time and vice versa. If time is before mid — 
eclipse, it is substracted from sparga sthiti ardha 
time. Remainder in danda etc. is multiplied by hara 
=(moon gati-sun gati) corrected for lambana for : 
solar eclipse, next chapter verse 46-47) and divided 
by 60. This will be koti kala of lunar eclipse. 


In solar eclipse, it is again multiplied by 
madhya sthiti ardha and divided by sphuta sthiti 
ardha, to get sphuta koti kala. 

For given time, squares of koti kala and bhuja 
kala are added,. square root of sum is karna. This 
karna substracted from half the sum of bimba kalas 
gives grasa. 

If the given time is after mid eclipse time, it 
is deducted from mokSa sthiti ardha. Difference is 
multiplied by gati antara of sun, and moon (hara) 
and divided by 60. We get koti. Then Sara of given 


Lunar Eclipse 529 


time is found, from which spasta koti kala of solar 
eclipse can be found. Again karna is found by 
adding the squares of bhuja and kotikala and taking 
square root. Karna substracted from half sum of 
bimba, gives grasa. 

From grasa value, remaining free portion of 
eclipsed planet can be found. 


Notes | (1) Gradsa = covered part (literal. 
meaning devoured portion) 


Amount of grasa is the length of diameter 
along the line joining centres of covered and 
covering discs, which has been eclipsed. 


Magnitude of eclipse (in modern astronomy) 
is grasa expressed as fraction of diameter. Thus 
grasa =radius of shadow + radius of moon 


-distance between centres of shadow and 
moon 


Magnitude = grasa/diameter of moon. 


For solar eclipse, instead of shadow, we take 
moon’s disc and covered disc is of sun. 


(2) Formula of grasa has already been estab- 
lished while calculating sthiti or marda times. To 
revise, refer to figure 15. If M is any position of 
moon's centre, MP is distance covered from central 
point P. If it is before P, then it is at M; (contact 
point or sparsa). Then in the given tirhe after 
sparsa, moon moves from M; to M. The remaining 
portion is MP till mid time at P. 


Thus in time (sthiti ardha-given time) =t 


-. 1 tx 
planet covers MP which is a. where m’ 1s 


difference of daily speeds of moon and sun. 


fe 


530 Siddhanta Darpana 
m/60 is speed in one danda. MP is koti kala 


OM = Vop? 4 mp = vemis + (Saray? = Karma 


1 
When OM ‘s 5 difference of diameters, com- 


plete portion of moon is covered. For OM bigger 
than this value 1/2(sum of diameters)--OM is 
amount of grasa. Similar calculation is done for 
period after midtime. 


(3) In solar eclipse there is fast change in Sara 
and valana, hence true kotikala is found. 


spasta koti kala madhya sthiti ardha 
Madhya koti kala _—spasta sthiti ardha 
Because, if sthiti ardha increases, the dif- 


ference with given time decreases and koti kala 
decreases. Thus, they are inversely proportional. 


Verses 51-53 : Time from grasa 

When grasa is between sparsa and mid time, 
then it is substracted from half sum of covered 
and covering discs. This gives difference karna 
between centres of two discs. From square of this 
karna, we substract square of spasta Sara at that 
time. Square root of difference will be koti kala. 

For solar eclipse this kotikala is multiplied by 
lambana corrected sthiti ardha and divided by 
madhya sthiti ardha. This gives spasta koti kala. 
This is multiplied by 60 and divided by difference 
of daily speeds of moon and sun. Result in danda 


etc. is the time after sparéa. 


Lunar Eclipse 531 


For position in second half of eclipse, the 
result is substracted from sthiti ardha time, The 
remainder will be time remaining till mokéa. 


Notes’: This is reverse process of the previous 
method and uses the same formula. 


Verses 54--Method for solar eclipse-For solar 
eclipse, the sthiti ardha for sparsa and mokéa is 
called mean sthiti ardha, because special paral- 
lax(lambana) correction is done in this. Hence, all 
processes are done with mean Sara (this doesn’t 
change in short period of eclipse). Repeated 
parallax correction will give correct time. 


Verses 55-59 :Direction of eclipse from parallax-- 


Now I describe valana(parallax) correction in 
kalas for correction of moon and sun in their 
eclipses, which arise due to ayana and aksamé&a. 
Due to these effects, direction of sparga, mid-point 
and mokéa of an eclipse is known in east or west 
portions (kapala) of sky. 

In case of lunar eclipse, sayana candra, and 
in case of solar eclipse, sayana sun is found. Its 
kotijya (in kala) is multiplied by parama kranti 
(1410) and divided by 3 rasis (5400kala). Result is 
ayana valana. This is in same direction (east or 
west part of sky) in which eclipse takes place. 

In solar eclipse, rasi of sun and moon is same, 
hence ayana valana can be found only from moon. 

We calculate the nata kala in pala from moon 
midday in lunar eclipse and from solar midday in 
Solar eclipse This multiplied by 90° and divided 


532 Siddhanta Darpana 


by its half day time gives nata in east or west 
direction in degrees 


This nata is multiplied by akSamSa of the place 
and divided by 90. Result will be akSa valana in 
north direction for east nata direction or valana in 
south direction for west nata. 


AkSa and ayana valana are added when in 
same direction and difference is taken for different 
directions. Result will be dik-valana in degrees of 
moon in lunar eclipse and of sun in solar eclipse. 
This is true valana from which sparsa and mokSa 
directions can be known. Its measure in angula 
has been stated while describing parilekha 
(degrees). 

Notes (1) Sphuta valana is the angle between 
east or west point of disc of eclipsed planet with 
kranti vrtta (ecliptic). This is made of two com- 
ponents. Due to aksam$a of the place (distance 
from equator), kranti vrtta cuts the horizon in 
eastern half of sky in north direction from east 
point. So ecliptic is towards north of east point of 
disc in east half of sky (and towards south in west 
half). This is called akSa valana. 


Due to angle between ecliptic and equator 
(causing ayana), ecliptic is inclined further towards 
north when sayana makara is on meridian (north 
south vertical circle). When sayana makara is on 
meridian (+90°), it is shifted southwards in east 
half of sky. For west half, the directions are 
opposite. This component is called ayana valana.

Rule for finding nataméa-- 


This is as per Bhaskaracarya. In half day or 
half night time, a planet rises 90° from horizon, 
hence nata kala multiplied by 90 and divided by 
half day (or night in lunar eclipse) time gives 
natamsa in degrees. This is not the angle from 
vertical Z point, but the angle between meridian 


Lunar Eclipse 535 


and samaprota vrtta, corresponding to nata kala.

Its relation with natamSa from Z is z = ZC. 
This can be found from spherical triangle NZC, 
cot Z C x sin ZN

But ZN = 90° hence sin ZN =1, cos ZN = 0

Hence tan ZNC = cos (agra) x tan z 


or, cot ZNC = 


Rule for akéa valana : 


Surya siddhanta and Bhaskara II both have 
given the formula (1) i.e. Jya of natakala is 
multiplied by Jya of aksamSa and divided by dyujya 
or semi diameter of diurnal circle. 

In this text, R sin NCV and R sin @ both 
have been approximated to the angles NCV and 
g@ and dyujya is equated to 90°. When 6 is small, 
- Ros 6 = R sin 90°. nearly. Thus all the 4 jya are 
slightly increased to the arcs and the errors almost 
cancel each other as a rough rule.

Verse 60-65 : Period of lunar daytime: 


Solar day time has already been described. 
The period from moon rise to moon set is its day. 
At sunset time, sphuta sayana sun and moon are 
calculated. For sun, rising time (in asu) is calculated 
for remaining part of rasi and for moon, it is for 
lapsed part of rasi. These two udaya asu are added 
with rising times (udaya asu) of the rasis from sun 
to moon. We add 56 asu to the total and divide 
by 360 to make them ghati. This time after sun 
rise moon will rise. 


For finding moon-set time, sayana sun and 


moon for next sun rise time is calculated. Rising 
time of rasis between sun and (6rasi + moon) is 


Lunar Eclipse 537 


calculated and 56 asu lambana time is substracted. 
This time after sun rise, moon will set. 


Sara of moon is very little (within 5°9’ and 
almost zero at eclipse time). Hence time between 
rising and setting of sun will be its day time, which 
has been calculated for diurnal circle of sun. 


Sara in kala (minutes of angle) at rising time 
or setting time is multiplied by palabha and divided 
by 12. Result will be added to rising time if Sara 
is south and substracted if Sara is north. Reverse 
is done for correcting moon-set time. Thus we get 
sphuta time of moon rise and moon set. 


Alternatively, sphuta gati of moon at midnight 
is divided by 19 and result in pala is added to 
night time'of sun. This gives day time of moon. 


Notes : (1) Difference between rising times of 
sun and moon is the difference between rising 
times of their raSis, since sun and moon move in 
almost same ahoratra vrtta. Sara at eclipse time is 
almost zero. 


Since, at pirnima time, moon-sun is less than 
180° (it is 180° at end of parnima), when sun has 
risen, moon will be slightly above west horizon. 
Thus difference of moon from sun +180" or (moon 
+180°-sun)distance is to be covered by moon for 
setting after sunrise. 


Due to parallax, angle of moon at horizon 
seen from surface is 56’ lower than the angle 
calculated from earth’s centre. Thus moon will rise 
©n horizon after covering 56’ more. Hence moon 
rise time will be later than the rising time of 
moon-sun by further rising time of 56’. 


538 . Siddhanta Darpana ? 


Similarly setting of moon will be earlier by 


corresponding rising time of 56’ extra arc. 


(2) Alternative formula --- Solar day in asu is . 
more than nakSatra day in asu (21, 600) by the : 


daily motion of sun (59.8”), extra time taken by 


earth to cover this distance covered by sun in mean | 


time. 


Similarly, lunar day is more than nakéatra day ; 
by its daily motion in asu i.e. 790/35’ It is more : 
than solar day by 790 (1-1/13.37) asu For true speed, | 
it is more than solar day by moon gati (1-1/13.4) | 
asu, relative speeds of sun and moon assumed | 


almost content

Verses 66-69 : Explaination of valana correction. 


On great circle from north pole to south pole 
in the sky, pole of ecliptic called ‘Kadamba’ is } 
situated 23°30’ south from north pole. This is | 


surface centre of ecliptic in north part of celestial . 
sphere.

Lunar Eclipse 539 


The south surface centre of ecliptic (kranti 
vrtta) is called ‘kalamba’ which is north from south 
pole by same 23°30’ angle on ayana prota vrtta 
(between two ‘dhruva’) ‘Sara’ is calculated along 
kadamba prota vrtta which is distance from ecliptic. 


Moon disc moves fastest of all the planets. 
Hence only its difference along two circles ayana 
prota and kadamba prota is calculated. 


Distance of moon from ‘dhruva’ on dhruva 
prota vrtta and from ‘kadamba’ along great circle 
through kadamba is taken. Their difference (an- 
gular) is multiplied by 360 and divided by 
circumference of moon disc (angular). This gives 
ayana valana. When moon is in north ayana, it is 
north valana and it is south valana in’ south 
hemisphere from equator. 

For akéa valana, Lalla and Sripati have 
calculated versine of nata. But it has been done 
from R sine of nata by Brahmagupta and Bhaskara 
Il. For ayana valana also two methods exist. One 
is from kotijya of madhya graha and the other 
from versine of bhuja of sayana graha. But in my 
method, no jya is needed because nati is according 
to equator and ecliptic arcs. Hence koti degree and 
nata degrees only should be used for Ayana and 
akSa valana. 


Note : Correct method and meaning of terms 
has already been explained. 


Verses 70-77 : Diagram of eclipse-- 

For making a parilekha (diagram), place is 
made plane like water level and a circle of 18 
angula semi diameter is drawn. East and west 
points are marked as explained earlier (in Triprasna 


540 Siddhanta Darpana 


dhikara) From these two points on circumference 
also two circles touching each other are drawn, 
each of 18 angula semi-diameter. In these two 
circles also, 4 points for cardinal directions and 4 
middle angles are marked. 


An east west line is drawn through centre of 
the two circles. A point is marked 1 angula north 
of north point of eastern circle and another point 
1 angula south of south point of western circle. 
When planet is in west kapala (west half of sky), 
a circle of 16/10 angula semi-diameter is drawn 
from southern point. When planet is in east kapala, 
same size circle is drawn from northern point. 


These arcs in the respective circles indicate 
kranti vrtta (ecliptic) 

Both arcs in the respective circles indicate 
kranti vrtta. In that signs of 12 rasis from mesa 
are given from west to east after making 12 equal 
parts. Centre of moon is kept in its correct rasi of 
kranti vrtta and around it, a partly eclipsed moon 
circle is formed. 

A line joining its two horns is drawn. The. 
line joining horns is equal to diameter of moon. 
With this diameter, circles are drawn at both 
external points of kranti vrtta. From this diagram 
moon will appear to be moving on kranti circle. 

In eastern circle, kranti vrtta is 328 yojana 


1 
north (23 7 ak§am$a of karka rekha) from equator 


which is line between east and west points of the 
circle. Kranti vrtta is actually a straight line, but 
appears curved due to drawing in a plane figure. 


Lunar Eclipse 541 


Hence jya Or kotijya are not needed in akéa or 
ayana valana. 

The curved shape kranti vrtta (and equator 
also) is perpendicular on all yamyottara (meridian) 
lines between two poles. Hence, on this kranti 
vrtta, distance from prime meridian (Ujjain or 
Greenwich) is deSantara jya. Similarly, akSa jya is 
distance on north south line. 

Notes : This is like representation of earth in 
two touching circles in which karka rekha and 
makara rekha are north and south of equator. 


Figure 19 

In figure -19 central circle is only for finding 
east west direction. East, west circles are of 18 
angula semi diameter in which all directions have 
been marked. P’ is 1 angula north of N}, P* is 1 
angula south of S. Kranti vrtta. Q1 Q2, Q3, Q4 are 
drawn from these with 16/10 angula radius. This 
1S only for explaination and not to the scale. 
Owever, this is a copy of school atlas map and 
reasonings about akéa valana and ayana valana on 

that basis are not correct.

Verses 78-79 : Effective shadow of earth. 


In moon’s orbit, there is 5 kala less dark 
shadow (avatamasa or penumbra). On adding this, 
earth’s shadow diameter increases by 10 kala. This 
semi dark shadow covers moon at other times also, 
then there is no eclipse but light of moon is 
dimmed. 

1/3 part of this semi shadow (penumbra) is 
very dark hence it almost merges with main 
shadow. Hence 1/3 of avatamasa or 10/3 kala is 
added to the earth’s shadow to find the effective 
diameter of shadow. 

Notes: 

(1) Mz M3 penumbra in moon’s orbit is formed

Lunar Eclipse 543

85° 76,08,294 

Thus the extent of lesser dark shadow is 
arbitrary. However, in penumbra, moon’s light will 
be definitely lesser. 

As explained earlier, the effective increase of 
earth’s shadow is by 2% or about 1 kala due to 
absorption by atmosphere. 

Verse 80-81 : Size of earth’s shadow- It 
‘changes both due to sun distance and due to 
moon’s distance, where its size is calculated. 


= 32.5 kala 


When .sun is near mandocca, it is farthest 
from earth, hence shadow is bigger when gati is 
small and at 90° from nica, it reduces. Hence 1/28 
of ravigati phala is added to shadow or substracted 
from middle value. 


Moon’s diameter is multiplied by 35 and 
divided by 13. In this, gati phala is substracted 
when positive. This gives true value of earth 
shadow. Method to find moon’s diameter has 
already been stated. 


Note : True dimensions of shadow hds already 
been stated based on true motions of sun and 
moon both in verse 27. This correction is based 
on arbitrary assumption of avatamasa’ i.e. darker 
Part of penumbra. 


Verses 82-83 : Calculation of true earth 
Shadow-Due to relative rotation of sun around 
earth, earth shadow also rotates in same directon 
with same speed, but always remains opposite. It 
Overs moon according to its value in moon’s orbit. 
There is difference of 1/20 parts due to variation 
Mm distance from sun. Due to varying distance of 


544 


moon also its value changes. But this is very small 
compared to variation due to sun, hence it is 
neglected. 


Now method to calculate effective earth 
shadow is explained. From sun’s diameter (72,000 - 
yojanas), its 1/10th (7,200yojana) and earth diameter 
(1600yojana) are substracted. Remainder (63,200) is 
multiplied by mean moon distance (48,705 yojana) . 
to get (3,07,81,56,000). This product is divided by . 
true distance of sun. The result substracted from 
earth diameter is the diameter of shadow in moon’s 
orbit. This diameter multiplied by trijya (3438) and 
divided by true distance of moon gives angular 
diameter. 


Note : ‘Avatamasa’ (dark part of penumbra) 
is 10/3 kala which is 1/12 of earth shadow (about 
40’) Hence (sun diameter-earth diameter) is reduced 
by 1/10 of sun diameter. Rest of the process is: 
already explained in verse 26, whose diagram will. 
make it clear. 


Verses 84-86 : Colour of eclipse 


From the shadow of earth, 40 kala deducted ' 
gives the value of andhatamasa (dark penumbra). ! 
(shadow is as calculated above). When Sara of moon; 
is small, moon enters this dark penumbra and; 
looks very dark. 


When lunar eclipse is very little, sky turns: 
blue. In half eclipse, sky appears black. In more’ 
then half eclipse, it looks red black. In total eclipse, | 
moon becomes pale yellow due to its entry in 
earth’s shadow. In solar eclipse, there is no change 
in colours; we seen only moon which is relatively 
dark. 


Lunar Eclipse 545 


Moon is always smaller than sun, even in 
angular diameter. Hence horns of sun are sharp 
in solar eclipse. But moon is cut by bigger circle 
of earth’s shadow, so its horns are rounder in 
eclipse. 

Note : This is subjective description, hence 
no comments 


Verses 87-88 : Close 


Being dark in colour, shadow of earth is like 
rahu, in which moon enters at eclipse time and 
. gives mantra siddhi to vaisnava and tantrikas. They 
may do good to us. 


Thus ends the eighth chapter describing lunar 
eclipse in detail in siddhanta darpana written for 
education of children and correspondance between 
theory and observation by Sri Candrasekhara born 
in famous royal family of Origsa. 


Eighth chapter ends. 


Chapter - 9 
SOLAR ECLIPSE 


Solar Eclipse 


Verse 1 - In last chapter, eclipse of moon and 
sun both have been discussed in a general way. 
For solar eclipse, in addition, it is necessary to 
calculate larnbana and nati and bimba of moon 
(angular diameter) also is different for the purpose 
of solar eclipse. These three will be specially 
discussed in this chapter. 


Verse 2 : Reason of lambana and nati 


At the end of amavasya, rasi etc of moon and 
sun are same, even then they are seen in same 
direction only at the time of mid-day. On other 
times, they are not in the line passing through 
centre and surface point of observation. Why this 
happens for times other than mid day, will be 
described in this chapter. When sun and moon are 
in mid point of sky, their direction from centre 
and surface of earth is same. 


Verses 3-6 - Meaning of lambana and nati 


Sphuta ending time of amavasya calculated 
from sphuta. moon and sun is called Samaparva 
Kala’. This time after lambana correction is the 
middle time of grasa (eclipse) in solar eclipse. This 
is sphuta amanta time for the place. 

At amanta time calculated from earth’s centre, 
the difference between directions of sun and moon 


Solar Eclipse 547 


is called lambana. This difference arising due to 
observation from earth’s surface, and in east west 
direction is called lambana’. Its component in north 
south direction is called ‘nati’ or ‘avanati’. When 
sun and moon are in mid sky, the line from earth 
centre to their centres passes through the surface 
point, hence there is no lambana or nati. 


When moon and vitribha lagna (lagna-90° on 
ecliptic) is same, there is no sphuta lambana, only 
nati is possible. When north kranti of vitribha lagna 
is same as (north) aksamSa of the place, then it 
has no nati also. 


When vitribha lagna’s north kranti is more 
than aksaméa of the place, moon (at vitribha lagna) 
has north nati. If north kranti of vitribha is less 
than north kranti of the place, or kranti is south, 
then moon has south nati. 


In amavasya (corrected with lambana), moon 
and sun have same raSi etc, hence nati in north 
south direction is easy to calculate. 


Verses 7-15 : Sphuta lambana by successive 
approximation - Instantaneous position of sun is 
found by method explained in sphutadhikara and 
from that, lagna of samaparva kala is calculated. 
By deducting 3 raSis (vitribha), again kranti is found 
for that. This kranti and aksaméa (direction of 
enone: being in different direction, difference is- 
taken. They are added if they are in same direction. 

Result will be nataméa of vitribha lagna; On 
Substracting this from 90°, it gives unnataméa. Jya 
of this unnataméa is called sphuta drg-gati. 

_ Earth half diameter (800 yojana) assumed to 
€ Mm sun or moon orbit, its angular diameter is 


548 Siddhanta Darpana 


found in kala. (For sun’s orbit, it is divided by 
2213 and for moon’s orbit multiplied by 6/85 
according to verse 15 of previous chapter). Result — 
is called ‘Kuchanna Kala’. This is equal to the 
parama nati of sun and moon. Difference of these 
two is the parama (maximum) nati in solar eclipse. 
Daily motion of sun 

164 
Daily motion of moon 

14 

Difference of parama nati of moon and sun 
in vikala is divided by difference of daily motions 
of moon and sun in kala. Result in danda etc. will | 
be parama lambana time. 


Parama lambana time in danda etc. is multi- 
plied by vitribha Sanku of desired time and divided 
by trijya (3438). Result is antya of lambana. Jya of - 
antya (in asu) is called para. 

Alternatively; sphuta drg gati (vitribha Sanku) : 
is multiplied by 100 and divided by 216. That will ’ 
give the same para. 


Now jya of difference of vitribha lagna and: 
sun is multiplied by para and divided by trijya. 
Result is larbana jya. Its arc in asu is sphuta; 
lambana. If sun is west from vitribha lagna, this’ 
lambana time in asu is added to samaparva kala, ' 
otehrwise it is substracted. Result is sphuta 
samaparva kala. 


Parama nati of sun = 


Parama nati of moon = 


For this sphuta samaparva kala, we again: 
calculate sphuta sun and vitribha lagna and: 
lamnbana is calculated from their difference again. 
After repeated corrections, when there is no. 


Solar Eclipse 549 


difference between two samaparva kala, that is the 
correct lambana. 

Notes - (1) Approximate use of this method 
has already been made in verse 4 of previous 
chapter to find possibility of solar eclipse. 

First we derive the equation of parama nati 
(already explained in appendix to tripraSnadhikara).

Figure 1 - Parallax of moon 

C is centre of earth and M is moon. From a

Thus Sin p = (e/r) sin z.

This is angular radius of earth if it is kept in 
moon’s orbit, hence it is called ‘Kuchanna’ .ex-

(2) Explaination of the terms : 


In figure 2, LNE is horizon and Z is zenith 
in celestial sphere. 


MVS is ecliptic and K its pole. 


Solar Eclipse 551 


M is meridian point of ecliptic and V is 
vitribha lagna, i.e., shortest distance from Z. Since 
ZV is perpendicular, it bisects the ecliptic above 
horizon, hence V is at 90° from horizon point L 
called lagna. Thus it is called vitribha or 3 raéi less 
(than lagna). 


Figure 2 - Explaination of drgjya etc 

ZA is perpendicular to MK, so sin Z A is drg 
_ gati of madhya lagna M (or smaller drggati). 

ZB is perpendicular to SK - so that R sin ZB 
is drggati of sun S (or larger drggati). 

ZS is zenith distance of 5; R sin z is drg jya. 

ZM is zenith distance of M, R sin ZM is 
madhya jya. | 

Distance from Z in direciton of ecliptic is thus 
drg gati. Distance from Z in direction perpendicular 
to: ecliptic is drkkSepa. Thus drkkSepa of M, V and 
S are AM, ZV, SB. Total distance from z is drgjya.

is Z * 


Figure 3 - Lambana of solar eclipse 
Portion ZVSB of figure.z is repeated here as. 
ZVMA. M is the common geocentric position of 
moon or sun at end of amavasya. 


S’ and M’ are apparent positions of sun and 
moon due to parallax, when viewed from surface. 
Thus MM’ = p, MS’ = p’ : 

VM is ecliptic and K its pole. V is vitribha 
lagna, Z is zenith. 

M’D. and S’D’ are perpendicular on ecliptic. 

M’B and S’B’ are perpendicular on KM 
produced . 

Arc MD or M’B is lambana i..e parallax of 
moon along ecliptic. 


Similarly arc MD’ or S’B’ is lambana of Sun. 
Arc D'D is lambana of solar eclipse or difference 
of lambanas of moon and sun. 


ZA is perpendicular to KM. Then from similar 
triangles MBM’ and ZAM we have 


R sin ZA x Rsin MM’ 
R sin ZM 

But BM’ = MD = R sin BM’ approx

For local place on surface, moon will be in 
same direction as sun before geocentric amanta 
when sun is in east. Because both move in east 
direction and in east half of sky moon appears 
further east due to parallax. In west sky, moon 
will be towards west, and it will reach sun’s 
apparent positon towards east after lambana time. 

Lambana will change at new position, hence 
the procedure is repeated for further accuracy. © 


Verse 16-22 : Accurate lambana in a single step. 


Now I tell the method to find accurate 
lambana., in a single step. 

At samaparva kala, kotijya and bhuja jya of 
difference between sun and lagna is found. Square 
of (difference of para stated. above and bhuja jya) 
and square of koti jya are added. Square root of 
sum is karna. Koti jya multiplied by para. and 
divided by karna gives mean lambana time in asu. 
From this mean lambana, samaparva kala is 
corrected and drggati of that time is multiplied by 
madhyama lambana and divided by initial drggati 
(Here drggati means drg gati of tribhona lagna i.e. 
vitribha Sanku). This is madhyama sphuta lambana, 
as stated by Bhaskara II. ; 

If this is more than madhyama lambana, their 
difference in asu is squared, multiplied by madhya 
lambana. Result is added to madhya sphuta 
lambana. We take any of these - Ist sphuta lambana 
of Bhaskara or second sphuta lambana - multiply 


556 Siddhanta Darpana 


it by mean gati difference of sun and moon and 
divide by (first sphuta gati of moon - sphuta sun 
gati.) By this Bhaskariya lambana becomes more 
sphuta. With this value of sphuta lambana in ghati, 
parva kala is corrected as before. 

Alternatively, at sphuta parva kala, kotijya of 
difference of sphuta sun and lagna is multiplied 
by 276 x drggati and divided by trijya. This gives 
Jarnbana in pala. 

This is multiplied by difference of mean gati 
of sun and moon and divided by difference of 
sphuta gati. This will give difference of sphuta and 
samaparva kala. 


Notes (1) Bhaskara formula - 


Figure 4 - Bhaskara sphuta lambana 


E is earth, circle with centre E is sun orbit, 
circle with centre O is moon’s orbit, deflected due 
to parallax. 


Vitribha lagna V and V’ of the orbits are in 
same direction from E, so that when sun is at V 
and moon at V’, there is no lambana. 

Maximum lambana for this position of ecliptic 
is when distance from vitribha of sun and moon 
is 90°. This is OE. Directions OM and ES of sun 


Solar Eclipse 557 


from their vitribha is same, hence these lines are 
parallel and equal. In parallelogram ESMO, SM 
also is parallel and equal to OE. Thus SM is equal 
to parama lambana or ‘para’ in short. - 

SM // VE, hence is perpendicular to horizontal 
lines at G and A.

where pata = R - - (b) 


We get maximum lambana when drkksepa 
§anku = R i.e. vitribha coincides with zenith and 
ecliptic is vertical. Then it is 1/14 of daily movement 
of moon which is 360° in angles. Thus max. 
lambana = 360°/14 = 25-5/7°. 
Putting values of (a) and (b) in (1) we get 

the formula. 

(2) Further corrections : Vitribha lagna is 90° 
from lagna by definition, hence V-L = 90°, L = 
lagna. 

Then Sin (s ~ V) = Sin [(V-L) - (S-L)] = cos 
(S-L) and cos (S ~ V) = Sin (S~L) | 

_ Further correction is based on sphuta gati 
difference of sun and moon as we had assumed 


558 Siddhanta Darpana 


average gati in formula (b) above. Larnbana angle 
= madhya lambana x madhya gati diff. 


= sphuta lambana time X sphuta gati diff. 
This ratio is basis for further correction. 


Verses 23-39 : Nati correction in Sara 


After finding mid point of eclipse by methods 
described above, we have to find sphuta sthiti 
ardha in which Sara of moon is to be corrected by 
nati. 


For this; last sphuta gati of moon is found 
for eclipse purpose as explained in chapter 6. That 
will be multiplied by sphuta lambana in ghati and 
divided by 60. Quotient will be added or sub- 
stracted in sphuta sun of samaparva kala as 
lambana correction. Pata of moon (rahu or ketu) 
is corrected with digamSa phala (1/10 of sun 
-mandaphala - chanpter 6) and is substracted from 
sphuta moon. From this difference (candra-rahu), 
§ara is calculated. 


Then from sphuta sun (sayana) of that time, 
lagna and vitribha lagna of sphuta parva kala is 
found and their kranti is calculated. 


South Sara is added to aksamSa (where 
equator is towards south) and north Sara sub- 
stracted to get SarakSa. 


Sarakéa and vitribha kranti are added, if in 
same direction or substracted for different direc- 
tions. Result is nata (north south distance of moon 
from zenith). Jya of this arc is natajya. This is also 
called versine of madhya lagna or udayajya. 

Madhya jya is multiplied by udaya jya and 
divided by dyujya. Square of quotient and square 


Solar Eclipse 559 


of madhya jya are added. Square root of sum is 
drkksepa. 

Alternatively, vitribha lagna is assumed sun, 
and for that position kranti and cara are calculated. 


15 ghati + cara = dinardha and its difference 
with vibribha lagna is natasu. From this vitribha 
natésu; drkjya is found through utkrama jya, 
cheda, ista hrti, and vibribha Sanku as explained 
in seventh chapter. (verses 45-51) 

Arc of this drgjya is vitribha natamsa. When 
vitribha kranti is north of local aksaméa, then 
nataméa is north, otherwise it is’ south. This 
natam$a and fara of moon will be added, if in 
same direction, otherwise difference taken. Jya of 
the resulting arc is drkksepa. 


Thus there are two types of drkkSepa. Both 
are separately multiplied by moon gati in kala and 
divided by trijya. Results are added when manda 
kendra of moon is in six raéis starting from karka 
(90° to 270°) or substracted for. other six rasis. By 
this, drkkSepa becomes sphuta. 

When grasa is less than 1 kala or more than 
28 kala, then the second drkksepa is-used which 
is corrected with vitribha natamSa. For grasa 
between 1 to 28 kala first drkksepa is used which 
1s corrected with SarakSa vitribha kranti (1/60 of 
total eclipse is one kala - when moon has Sara, 
eclipse will be less than half and hence Sara is 
used for correction). 


Difference of sun (21/38) and moon parma 
Nati (56/28/13) i.e. (56/6/33) multiplied by drkksepa 
and divided by trijya gives éphuta nati. 


560 Siddhanta Darpana 
Dr. 
| Dikisepa ee 
: 225 
Also sphuta nati = aa ae 
' This is in direction of drkksepa. 
Sara of moon and sphuta nati are added if ‘ 
in same direction and difference is taken for ; 
opposite direction. Resulting direction will be 
direction of greater value of Sara or nati. From 
that, grasa and sthiti ardha are calculated according 
to method stated in last chapter for lunar eclipse. . 


When north sara of moon is more than the 
aksaméa of the place, akSamSa will be substracted % 
from it. Difference will be north Saraksa. When % 
north kranti of vitribha is less than this Sarakéa-; 
but more than aksaméa, then akéaméa is sub- |! 
stracted from vitribha north kranti and result atided 
to SarakSa gives north nata. 


Vitribha north kranti if less, is deducted from“ 
akS4méa and from remainder; SarakSa is substracted.:’ 
to ‘get south nata. If SarakSa is more than’ ‘ 
remainder, their difference will be north nata. 4 

| 


Sum of vitribha south kranti:and akéaméa if 4 
less than éarak§a, their difference is north nata. j 
These corrections are necessary for all places re 


more than 1° aksamé&a.

_. Thus in almost all places except equator « F 
region, nataméa is calculated from vitribha kranti = 
corrected with Sarakga; and drkkSepa,, madhya’ iva, 
nata in north south direction are calculated. ; 

Notes : (1) Moon’s latitude from ecliptic a 
depends upon its distance from pata (rahu or ketu).- 
Its effective latitude for solar eclipse is latitude 
corrected for nati. 


Solar Eclipse 561 


Now nati itself depdnds upon moon’s distance 

from zenith towards south - consisting of two 
components - 

Distance of vitribha from zenith (it is only in 
north south direction - it is sum of akSsaméa and 
kranti. 

Distance of moon ftom ecliptic - i.e. Sara, 
Thus total distance in north south direction is 
algebraic sum of.

(3) Complete procedure for sthitiardha - 

(a) First of all, calculate the time of geocentric 
conjunction (ganitagata or karanagata darsanta or 
amanta). Then calculate the lambana for that time 
and treating it as lambana for the time of apparent 
conjunction, obtain the time of apparent conjunc- 
tion by the formula - 


Time of apparent conjunction = Time of 
geocentric conjunction +Lambana for the time of 
apparent conjunction - - - - (1) 


+ or - sign being taken according as the, 
conjunction occurs to the west or east of the central 
ecliptic point. Next, calculate the lambana for the 
time of apparent conjunction obtained and then 
again apparent conjunction is calculated from 
formula (1). 


For the time of this second apparent conjunc- 
tion, lambana is calculated and again aparent 
conjunction is calculated (third) by formula (1). 


This process is repeated till lambana for the 
time of apparent conjunction is fixed. Applying 
this lambana in formula (1) we get the correct time 
of apparent conjunction. This: is the time of spasta 
darsanta or spasta amanta, and also the time of 
middle of the eclipse. . 

(b) Sparsika and maukSika sthiti ardhas - 
Calculate the semi diameters of the sun and moon 
and also moon’s true latitude corrected for nati as 
explained in notes (1) and (2), for the time of 
apparent conjunction. This is almost equal to

moon’s latitude at first contact time (1. If S and - 
M are semi diameters of Sun and moon, d is ; 
difference between true daily motion of moon and ! 
sun in degrees -

In practice, one uses the semi diameters of 
the sun and moon for the time of apparent

there is negligible change.

Next, calculate the moon’s true latitude for |

Then calculate the moon’s true latitude for ;

contact takes place to the west or east of the central 
ecliptic point. 

For the time of apparent first contact, thus 
obtained, calculate the lambana afresh and applying 
it in formula (4), obtain the time of first contact 
again. 

Repeat this process until the lambana for the 
time of apparent first contact is fixed. 

Similarly, find the lambanas for the times of 
apparent separation, immersion and emersion 

(d) Sparsika and mauksika sthityardhas, cor- 
rected for larnbana — 

The madhyama sparsika and madhyama 
maukSika sthityardhas corrected for lambana, are 
called true (sphuta) sparsika and sphuta maukéika 
sthityardhas. They are obtained by the formula. 

True sparsika sthityardha = time of apparent 
conjunction - time of apparent first contact 


True maukSika sthityardha = Time of apparent 
separation - time of apparent conjunction. 


Similarly, 
True sparsika vimardardha = Time of apparent 
conjunction - time of apparent immersion 
True maukéika vimardardha = Time of ap- 
Parent emersion - time of apparent conjunction 


Verses 40-42 : More accurate value of moon

566 Siddhanta Darpana 


sun and moon is calculated according to method 
given in previous chapter on candra grahana. Now 
method is being given to make it more accurate, 
This has not been told by any earlier scholar 
(acarya). 

If manda kendra ‘of moon is in six raéis 
starting with karka, its koti phala is substracted 
from trijya, otherwise they are added. Square of 
the result is added to square of manda bhujaphala. 
Square root of sum is substracted from twice the 
trijya. By remainder, square of trijya is divided. 
Result will be manda karna in lipta (i.e. kala or 
minute of arc). Mean birmnba kala of candra (31/20) 
is multiplied by trijya (3438) and product (107724) 
is divided by manda karna. It will give sphuta 
birnbamana of moon. 


Notes (1) If R and r are radius of main circle 
and manda paridhi, then 


Koti of karna = R + r cos 0 

when @ is manda Kendra 

Bhuja of karna = r Sin @ 

Hence, karna K is given by 

K? = (R + r cos 0)? + (r sin 0? - - - (1) 
This is the correct formula. However, in place 


of bhuja phala or koti phala we take the lower 
value 


Bhujaphala = r sin @ xX RK 

Similarly, kotiphala, r cos @ also in reduced 
in same ratio.

Verses 43-45 : Methods for calculating 
tamomana - 


(1) At the time of sphuta amanta time, we 
find Sanku and drgjya from spasta sun. Parama 
lambana (56/28) is substracted from Sanku. Squares 
of remainder and drgjya are added and of the 
sum, square root is taken. This will be tama 
karna (chayaé karna). Sphuta candra birmba is 
multiplied by trijya and divided by tama-karna 


568 


This gives tamo-mana or grahaka (eclipser) value 
in solar eclipse. 


(2) Alternatively, 1/60 of sphuta candra bimba 
is multiplied by Sanku of sphuta parva time and 
divided by trijya. Quotient is added to sphuta 
candra bimba to get tamomana. 

(3) Due to hard labour involved in calculating 
tamo bimba through Sanku etc., I have found an 
easy method also for this. Unnata kala in ghati at 
the time of sphuta parva kala is multiplied by 2, 
the product in vikala is added to sphuta candra 
bimba in kala etc. 


Notes : (1) In previous verses sphuta candra 
bimba has been calculated for its variation in 
distance from earth’s centre. However, due to 
parallax in observing moon from surface, its angle 
from vertical is increased, but distance is decreased. 
Though we correct the angle difference, the 
distance difference still remains. Since moon is seen 
at a nearer distance due to parallax, its effective 
angular diameter will appear increased. We have 
to calculate the increased bimba mana. Here ; 
tamo-mana is not the value of shadow, because 
shadow is not the cause of solar eclipse. Moon 
disc itself appears dark compared to sun and is 
called tama. 


(2) Derivation of formula - Figure 4 after verse 
22 may be referred to For clarity, a smaller figure 
is made here (figure 5.) OZ is vertical and ZSH 
the great circle from Z through S, centre of sun 
and Moon. OH is horizon line. Sun and moon are 
at same place on samaparva kala, but figure at 
amanta time is shown when M is separate due to 


Solar Eclipse 569 


parallax, so that distance difference is shown. 
LSOZ = Z is distance from vertical. SP is Sanku 
= Rcos Z, and SN = R sin Z is drgijya.

Figure 5a - Tamomana increase in bimiba due to parallax 

Due to parallax, moon is lowered to M’ where 
SM’ is equal ‘to parama lambana of moon (as in 
figure 5a). : 

SM’ = P. On celestial sphere moon is seen at 
M in that direction. SM is small and this arc and 
straight line are almost same. 

In right angled triangle SMM’, 2 SMM’ = 90°, 
2 SM’M = z’ when ZOM = z’. At sphuta samaparva 
kala z = z’. 

Thus lambana SM = SM’ sin z’ = P Sin 2’ 
which is according to the formula for lambana. It 
comfirms that apparent height of moon is lowered 
’ by distance SM’ = parama lambana. 

Apparent distance from surface is OM’ =

Sphuta bimba of moon has been calculated 
for the distance of radius OM from earth’s centre. 


570 Siddhanta Darpana 
Apparent bimba at M’ is bigger, which is 
tamomana. 
Hence, linear diameter being same 
linear diameter = tamomana X OM’

approximately, when moon is at Z.

Thus for each ghati unnata kala, sphuta birhba 
increases by about 2 vikala. ; 
Verses 46-47 : Hara of solar eclipse. 


Sphuta candra gati is. multiplied by 1/60 of 
sphuta Samku of sun and divided by trijya. In 


Solar Eclipse 571 


uotient, final sphuta gati of moon is added. Sum 
substracted from sun gati will be hara at the time 
of eclipse (mid time). 

Unnata kala in ghati is reduced by its 1/8, 
remaining is assumed as kala and added to final 
sphuta gati of moon and sphuta gati of sun is 
substracted. Result is hara of sparsa and mokéa 
time. 

Notes : (1) Hara means multiplier; here the — 
purpose of this multiplier is not mentioned. 
However, in verses 46-50 of previous chapter on 
lunar eclipse, hara is used for calculating amount 
of grasa (magnitude of eclipse) at desired time. 
Hara in that context is difference of moon’s speed 
and sun’s speed. For solar eclipse this ‘needs . 
accurate calculation and correction for lambana. 

Hara = Candragati - siirya gati - - - (1) 

In this, variation due to parallax is only in 
candragati as the parallax of sun is negligible.

Birnba = ———___—___

Thus birhba and gati of moon both increase 
in same proportion due to apparent decrease in 
distance due to lambana or parallax. 

Thus according to first alternative formula in 
note (3) of previous verse, equation (4) is 

Proportional increase in candragati

(2) Hara for sparSa or mokSa time - 

At 15 ghati unnata kala the increase in 
candragati from (2) is 1/60 part of its gati,.when 
moon is at Z approximately. ; 

This increase is 790’35/60 = 13-1/6 kala ap- 
proximately. Hence, proportionate increase of each 
ghati in moon gati is

Thus ghati is reduced by its 1/8 and remaining 
part taken as kala is the increase in daily motion 
, of moon due to parallax. For this, unnata ghati of 
sparsa or mokSa time is taken. 


Verses 48-49 : Difference in solar eclipse at 
each place. 


In lunar eclipse, shadow of earth and moon 
- both are at same place (in moon’s orbit), hence 
grasa is same at all places, because there is no 
parallax. But in solar eclipse, chadya sun and 
chadaka moon are very far from each other. Only 
at a particular place, they may be in one line, but 
at other place they will be seen in different direction 
due to lambana (or parallax). Thus solar eclipse 
has different magnitudes for different places). Even 
due to a small difference in east west or north 
south direction, there will be difference in total 
eclipse, annular or partial eclipse. Hence, they are 
to be calculated separately for each place. 


Notes : Location of the point of observation 
is only reason for solar eclipse, other wise they 


Solar Eclipse 573 


are vastly far from each other. This has been 
explained in beginning of previous chapter and 
while calculation of solar eclipse also. 


Solar eclipse is seen in a very small circle cut 
in moon’s shadow cone by earth’s surface. In north 
south direction from that circle, eclipse will become 
partial and then non existant. 


Due to relative motion of moon towards east 
the shadow circle on earth’s surface moves from 
west to east and finally leaves. Thus the eclipse is 
earlier in west and later in eastern places on the 
strip of earth surface. Thus due to east west 
difference of places, eclipse times and grasa times 
will be different (according to standard time also). 


When tip of shadow cone is about to leave 
earth surface, before and after the strip, when circle 
on surface is of zero radius, extended shadow cone 
touches the surface. Then annular eclipse is seen 
at those places. 


Verses 50-53 : Madhya sphuta sthiti kala 


According to rules explained in candra 
grahana chapter, we calculate the sphuta Sara, half 
sum of bimba. From hara of grahana time we 
calculate the sthiti ardha and marda ardha in ghati. 
By adding or substracting this from samaparva kala, 
we get times of sparsa, mokSa, sammilana and 
unmilana. 


Then current lagna and vitribha lagna is found 
and lambana in east west direction is calculated. 
Spargsa and mokéa times are corrected with this 
lambana. For these sparsSa times etc, we calculate 
the lambana again and second value of sthitiardha 
and sparga kala is found. For second values of 


574 


sparsa and mokSa times, lambana is again calcu- 
lated and from that we get third value of sparga 
or mokSa. After repeated process, when there is 
no difference in successive values, we get the true 
values. 


Verses 54-56 : Sphuta sthiti kala by Sara 
correction From difference of sphuta parva kala 
and these times of sparga etc., we get the values 
of both sthiti ardha and marda ardha in ghati etc. 
Alternatively, we find the sphuta Sara by single 
step method (verse 45 of previous chapter), and 
new values are found. From their ratio, Sara for 
sparsa and moka time is found. One difference 
is + ve and other is negative. Both changed by 
half the sum give the Sara of sparsa, mokSa time. 


From this Sara, second value of second sthiti 
ardha is found. From that we find Sara for sparga, 
mokga and middle time Sara. Then we find the 
difference of middle Sara with the Sara of sparésa 
and mok&a times. By proportionate difference we 
again find sphuta Sara ardha. After repeated 
process sthiti ardha becomes spasta. 


Notes : (1) Correction of sthti ardha for 
lambana by repeated process has already been 


explained after verse 53 and in notes after verse 
39. 


(2) Suppose the Sara at middle time be L and 
_sparsa time Sara is l;. By single step method, the 
spasta Sara is L’. Thus difference of Sara is L’-l, in 
single step method and L-l in repeated method. 
Thus the difference of single step method is to be 
changed by (L-h)/(Li-h) for correct difference. Thus 
we get accurate Sara by one step method. If sparéa 


Solar Eclipse 575 


time Sara is less than middle time Sara, moka time 
gara will be more. 


Verse 57 : Method for small sthiti ardha We 
take the difference of sthiti ardha after Ist lambana 
correction and the sthiti ardha before that correction 
(initial value). Square of difference in pala is 
divided by initial sthiti ardha. Result is added to 
sthti ardha obtained initially. 


This process is done only for sthiti ardha less 
than 1 danda. From new values we get correct 
sparsa time etc. 


Note : Let the sparga times counted from 
middle eclipse time be to, ti and t, before Sara 
correction and after first and second Sara correc- 
tions. For small sthiti ardha, second corrected time 
t. will be almost correct time. Change in sthiti 
ardha after Ist correction is 


ti- to = t |/—- 1 
: : to 


It is assumed that sthiti ardha will change in- 


t 
same proportion a — 1} in next step also.

to-to = to fi ma | 2. (ti = to)” 
t, : to 
Thus the correction is obtained by dividing 
Square of difference of initial and first corrected 
sthiti ardha by initial sthiti ardha. 
Same process can be used for mokéa time 


also. Proportional decrease or increase can be 
assumed only for small sthiti times. 


576 Siddhanta Darpana : 


Verses 58-60 - Single step method for sphuta 
sthiti time. We obtain sphuta Sara for sparSa or 
mokSa times after adding or substracting madhya 
sthiti ardha from lambana corrected amanta. If this 
§ara is more than sum of semi diameter of the 
birnba; or equal to it, then madhya sthiti ardha is 
multiplied by grasa kala and made half. It is divided 
by difference of parva kala Sara and Sara at sparéa 
or mokSa time (expressed in kala). By this, moksa 
and sthiti ardha are found in a single step only. 
From sthiti ardha times obtained, the corrected 
middle time gives sphuta lambana in one step only. 
Then sphuta Sara will be found for lambana 
corrected sparsa and mokéa times in one step only. 


Note (1) Grasa kala is amount of grasa | 


expressed as ratio of diameter of eclipsed planet, 
out of total kala of 60. Thus 
2 _ sum of semi diameters — Sara 
grasa kala = Di ectipsed graha x 60 
When Sara is more than semi diameter sum, 
then the planet will not be eclipsed and eclipse 
time will be shortened. 


Average value of Sara between madhya kala 
and sparsa time is taken. When grasa is small, its 
value nearer to middle time is taken, as the real 
sthiti ardha itself is shortened. 


Verses 61-62 : Annular eclipse 


In solar eclipse when bimba of sun is more 
than tamo-bimba (apparent bimba of moon in- 
creased for parallax, then eclipse will be annular 
(valaya grasa). Then, from sum of semi diameters, 
diameter of moon is substracted. From square of 


pyrcuemers 


Solar Eclipse 577 


the differenge, square of sphuta Sara is substracted. 
From square root of this difference, we find sthiti 
ardha etc. in pala as per method described in lunar 
eclipse chapter. This sthiti ardha pala is corrected 
for larnbana and on adding or substracting from 
samaparva kala, we get beginning and end times 
of valaya grasa. 

Notes : This method is same as that of total 
eclipse time in which difference of semi diameter 
is taken. In this case, we get valaya grasa instead 
of total eclipse, because moon bimba is smaller. 


Verses 63-64 - Reason for extra methods 

Brahmagupta (son of Jisnugupta) had ob- 
served errors in the calculation of eclipse durations, 
hence in his Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta, stated at 
the end of tithi chapter, corrections for nadi (Ayana 
drk karma), bhuja of nata, its jya etc. 

_ The method described by Bhaskaracarya in his 
Siddhanta Siromani also doesn’t give correct eclipse 
duration. Hence, on the difficult topic of solar 
eclipse, I have stated many more things. 

Notes : Already many new improvements 
have been described to get more correct values of 
moon birhba etc. Now entirely new methods are 
being described for correct duration of eclipse. After 
that, modern methods will be described, as 
comments. 


Verses 65-72 : Eclipse duration through yasti 
~ After calculating sirya grahana by above rule, 
we multiply the sphuta Sara at the time of sparéa, 
middle and mokéa, separately by the lagna kranti 


578 Siddhanta Darpana 


jya of their respective times to give yasti for the ' 
three times. 

The three yastis are converted to para (1/60 
vikala) and divided by hara (candra gati - siya: 
gati) for the time of sparga etc. When lagna kranti _ 
and sphuta Sara are in different direction, this 
result in pala etc is added to time of sparSa etc 
otherwise substracted. Then true sparsa, madhya 
and moka times are obtained. 


If this time is more than previous time (i.e. | 
yasti + hara is added for different directions of 
lagna kranti), then it is the true time for sparésa 
etc. If new time is less then previous, it is- 
multiplied by its lambana jya and divided by ‘para’ 
(stated arlier). Result is added to sparSa time etc., 
when sun is west from vitribha lagna, otherwise, 
it is substracted. This will give true times of sparfa, . 
madhya and mokéa. Madhya time will again be , 
corrected with sphuta lambana to get correct value. ; 


Then squares of mid time Sara and yasti are! 
added and square root of the sum is sphuta; 
madhya kala éara. Then from the éara, sthiti ardha: 
for sparsa and moka are found. They are: 
separately multiplied by sphuta lagna dyujya for, 
madhya kala and divided by trijya. i 


When Sara of sparsa and mok$a is in same} 
direction, first result is substracted from sparéa! 
time and second result is added to mok§Sa time.: 
When the two Sara are in different direction,’ 
reverse is done. 


The sparsa and mokéa times are corrected for 
their lambanas to get true values. But sthityardha 


Solar Eclipse 579 


is multiplied by dyujya of madhya kala and divided 
by trijya. | 

Lambana for parvanta is found from true sun 
of that time. At the time of spargSa and mokéa, 
lambana is calculated from position of moon at that 
time. 


Figure 6 - Sara correction through yasti 


Notes : To explain yasti, figure 10 after 
Triprasnadhikara verse 37 is reproduced here. 
NZSZ’ is yamyottara vrtta, NS is horizontal line, 
ECE’ is diameter of equator. 


QQ’ is diameter of diurnal circle of sun and 
LL’ is diurnal circle of moon further removed from 
equator as kranti and Sara are in opposite direction. 
These three circles are bisected by perpendicular 
PP’ through poles - which is diameter of 
unmandala. a 

BQ = Dyujya = semidiameter of diurnal circle

Now B is the position of sun when it has’ 
risen on equator. BD = height of sun at mat time 
i.e. unmandala sanku. 

Height of planet above B is called yasti. 

Now A’ is the joint position of sun and moon 
on ecliptic, A its position on equator corresponding 
to arc CA in asu. Let CA = K. 


Height of A = CA cos ® , where ® is latitude)

Height of .A’ eee B i..e a of A’ is

Its rate of increase with respect to angular 
distance from equator is

Hence for change in distance corresponding, 
to Sara s of moon, 


Increase in yasti = sk cos ® Sin dé

Proportionate increase = ——~—_——— _ -

Spain Sears Veoe ers Case 
This yasti is the proportionate increase in time 
units of yasti and not the ista yasti meant in chapter 
ga < 


= R tan 6 tang 


Thus increase in yasti is equivalent to decrease 
_in lambana, hence moon will reach the sparga time 
‘after corresponding interval. Thus increase in 
‘sparSa time = yasti/hara or para where hara is 


581 


yelative speed of moon. When yasti is in vikala/60 
and hara is in kala/day, the result is in day X 60 
-X 60 = in palas. Similar addition is to be made for 
‘the times of madhya and mokéa also. When Sara 
‘ig in same direction as kranti, substraction is to be 
“made. 

When times are to be deducted they are 
changed in ratio (lambana jya / sama mandala 
‘ganku), because lambana jya is in time units. 

: Yasti is correction in Sara of all times, hence 
javerage mid time Sara is obtained by 
p(éara?+yasti? ye 


Verses 73-82 : Miscellancous corrections 


ita 


E" If among sparsika and maukSika Saras, one is 
“equal to middle time Sara and other bigger, then 
‘there is a special method. 


Ecliptic times are found by above methods 
=and the sphuta Sara of sparsa, madhya and mokéa 
time are multiplied by the kranti jya of lagna of 
‘their times and divided by trijya. When ara of 
> Sparsa and mokSa time are in same direction, these 
“results are substracted from their Sara, added if in 
‘different directions. Result is multiplied by dif- 
-ference of Sara and divided by 36. We get yasti in 
pta. 

». This is multiplied by jya of distance between 
ysun and vitribha lagna and divided by trijya (3438), 
:.to get the third yasti. This third yasti in para is 
divided by sthiti ardha for sparga etc and the result 
gn pala etc is added to the times of sparSa etc. 

hen kranti and gara are in different directions, 
otherwise substracted. Thus we get the true times 
foe sparsa, madhya and mokéa. Madhya kala is 


582 Siddhanta Darpana 


again corrected with sphuta lambana to get correct 
value. 

Then madhya kala Sara and madhya yasti - 
both are squared, added and of the sum, square 
root is taken. With this sphuta madhya kala Sara, 
we calculate the sthiti ardha for mokSa and sparsa 
limes. 

These are separately multiplied by dyujya of 
madhya kala lagna and divided by trijya. First 
result is substracted from sthiti ardha of sparsa 
and second is added to mokia sthiti ardha. Then 
both are corrected for their lambanas. 


When difference between spasta Sara of 
madhya kala, and sum of semi diameters of birhba 
is more than 3 kala and kranti of sun is more than 
lagna kranti then sitrya grahana is calculated 
according to this method. 


If madhya Sara is less than both the Saras at 
sparsa and mokéa time, more than both or equal 
to both, then first method should be used. 


Notes : (1) Kranti of sun is between the kranti 
of lagna and kranti of vitribha lagna, hence it is 
aproximated by either of them, which are at 90° 
from each other. No earlier astronomer had used 
kranti of lagna from whiich eclipse time can be 
calculated through yasti difference. Yasti differernce 
is same as difference of Sanku. Both methods give 
same errors. In calculation with yasti one time 
method has been used for calculating sthiti ardhas 
with sphuta Sara corrected for yasti. 

(2) This method of yasti and previous methods 
are almost same. When grasa is 3 kala or more, 


Solar Eclipse 583 


(difference of Sara and sum of semi diameters), 
ithen the approximate distance between sparsSa and 
mokéa places will be (sun bimba + 3 kala) = 36 
kala aproximately. Hence Sara difference is divided 
by 36 and resulting yasti is added to middle time 
gara. Approximately same will be added to other 
éaras also. 

Verses 83-85 Only that grahana (eclipse) is 
meaningful, which is seen from local place. No 
auspicious functions are needed for the grahana 
Mot seen at a place. Thus lunar eclipse in day time 
.or solar eclipse in night time are not considered 
s grahana for that place. 


But even at the time of part solar eclipse in 
»day time or part lunar eclipse in night should be 
“observed according to smrtis. Bath, charities etc 
‘should be done; cooking sleeping etc are 
. prohibited. 

As in lunar eclipse, in solar eclipse also grasa 
‘from time and time from grasa is calculated. Simlar 
_ method is used for 4kSa and 4yana valana. 

Note (1) Amount of grasa and time in solar 
. eclipse. 


Let T be the Indian standard time of conjunc- 
tion in longitude, p is latitude of the moon, P-the 
ourly change in latitude (north latitude and 
motion towards the north being considered posi- 
ive), .M is excess of hourly motion of moon in 
longitude over that of sun. 

L is angular radius of moon, S angular radius 


af Sun. Then at anytime t hours after conjunction, 
Athe distance between the sun and moon’s longitude

is Mt and the moor’s latitude is (p + Pt). So the 
distance between their centres is [M*t?+ (p + Pt)?}}2 


The eclipse begins or ends, when their rims 
appear to touch. This can happen, even if ‘the 
distance between them is greater than L+5, for the 
moon’s parallax may push it towards the sun. The 
maximum of this effect is II-Il’ (= I); II being the - 
equatorial horizontal parallax of the moon, Il’ of 
sun which is negligible. 


Thus the rims can appear to touch when the 
distance between the centres is IJ + L+S (=d) at 
the most. Then [M?t? + (p+Pt)? ] = d? gives the 
times of the beginning and end of the general 
eclipse. Solving for t, we get 


V2 
= a5 P 2 p2 d? — p? 
M+ p? *)M?+P2 ” M+ P 


In this, the upper sign (-) is taken for the 
beginning, and lower for the end. T+t is the IST 
of the beginning or the end. 


At any given place, the eclipse begins or ends 
when the rims appear to touch at that place, i.e. 
when the apparent distance between centres is L+S. 
Now at any time T near the times of conjunction 
in longitude, let the apparent distance in longitude 
between the centres be m, the apparent excess of 
moon’s hourly motion in longitude over the sun 
be M, apparent difference in latitude p, apparent 
excess of moon’s hourly motion in latitude over 
that of sun be P, the sum of angular radii of sun 
and moon be d, and its variation per hour D. By 
apparent is meant here ’(as affected by parallax)’.

M? + P? . 

The total eclipse begins or ends, when the 
rims apparently touch, the sun being within the 
moon. The distance between them at such time is 
(L-S), so by substituting for d in the above formula 
another d equal to (L-S), we can find the times of 
the beginning and end of the total phase. 


S may be greater than L, so that moon may 
be immersed in the sun, leaving a circle of light 
all around. This is called annular eclipse. Beginning 
or end of the annular eclipse is got by making D 
= S-L. 

(2) Bessel’s method - for calculating solar 
eclipses - Bessel’s method for calculating the 
circumstances of a solar eclipse as seen from a 
given place on the surface of earth consists in 
choosing a suitable system of axes, finding coor- 
dinates of the observer with respect to these axes 
and putting down in terms of these coordinates, 
the condition that the observer lies on the boundary 
of the penumbral cone at the beginning or end of 
the eclipse. All variable quantities in this condition 
are written in the form x,+x’t, where x, is the 
value of the variable quantity at t = o and x! is 
the rate of change of the variable quantity. The 
origin of time is chosen near the middle of the 
.eclipse so that t is small. The condition now 


T+ 


eclipse occus at T + 


Solar Eclipse 587 


becomes a quadratic equation in t, solving which 
we know the beginning and the end of the eclipse. 


Besselian elements - Through the centre E of 
the earth draw a line paralled to the line joining 
-the centres S, M of the sun and moon. Call this 
Z axis, its positive direction being on the side on 
which sun and moon are situated. 


Choose the y axis to lie in the plane 
determined by the z-axis and the axis EN of the 
earth, the positive direction of y axis making an 
acute angle with EN. Finally choose the x-axis to’ 
be perpendicular to the axis of y and z, its positive 
. direction being towards the point of equator, which 
the earth’s rotation is carrying from the positive 
side to the negative side. 


Figure7 - Bessalian elements for solar eclipoe 
The plane z = O is called the fandanerte 
plane. 


. These axes are not fixed with with respect to 

the surface of the earth. Therefore, the coordinates 
of a point on the surface of earth keep changing. 
Certain quantities need to be calculated first 
, which are required in the equations. These are 
called the Besselian elements. 


588 - - Siddhanta Darpana 


(i) The elements d, x and y - Let the axes of 
x, y, Z chosen as above meet the geocentric 
celestial sphere in X, Y, Z respectively. Let the 
right ascencion and declination of Z be (a,d) 

Then, as is evident from the figure, equatorial 
coordinates of X and Y are, (90° + a, 0) and 
(180°+a, 90°-d). 

To: find a and d, we note that x and y 
coordinates of the sun and the moon are same (for 
Z axis is parallel to SM) 

Let (d, ?, be the R.A. and declination of the 
sun and (di, 61) those of moon. If A is the sun’s 
position on the celestial sphere, the values of 
Cos X A, Cos YA and Cos ZA can be easily 
written down. Thus, if (x, y, z) are the coordinates 
of the sun’s centre S, and r is its distance from 
E, we have 

x = r cos XA =r cos 6 sin (a -a) 

y = r cos YA =r [Sin 6 cos d - cos o sin d. 
cos (a-a)] © - 

z= rcos ZA = r[sino sind + cos 6 
cos d cos (a-a)] 

Similarly, coordinates Ga, yi, Z1) of hie: moon 
are 

X1 = 1% cos 6 1 sin ( a -a) 

yi = 11 [Sin 6, cos d - cos 6; Sin d cos (a1-a] 

zi = ™ [sin di sin d + cos 6 cos d cos (a1-a] 

where r; is distance of moon’s centre from E. 
Solving the equations obtained by putting x = x1 
and y = yi, we get a and d, the later being one 
of the Besselian elements. Substitution of these 


_ Solar Eclipse 589 


-values in the expressions for x and y will give us 
x and y, the other two elements. 

Values of x and y are calculated at the interval 
_of 10 minutes for the whole duration of the eclipse. 
‘Therefore, x’ and y’, the variations in x and y per 
minute can also be easily determined. 

The elements x and y are obviously the 
' coordinates of the centre of the shadow on the 
_ fundamental plane. 

(ii) The element yw - Let w be the hour angle 
of Z from the meridian of Greenwich at the instant. 
“The Greenwich sidereal time is g. Since the R.A. 
"of Z is a, the value of u is G-a. After u has been 
‘ tabulated at intervals of 10 minutes, yu’ (the 
variation of u per minute) can also be easily 
tabulated: 


(iii) The elements fi, f2 - The semi settical 
“angles of the penumbral and umbral cones are 
-denoted by fi and f2 respectively. Now the radii 
. of the sun and moon are R and b, and the distance 
between their centres is approximately r-r1; so fi 
and f2 are given by = 
R+tb — R-b 
sin f; = , sin f, =‘ 
i ia! ee | ia | 
(iv) The elements l1, ly - The radii of the 
circles in which the penumbral and umbral cones 
intersect the fundamental plane are denoted by li 
and.-i2 respectively. These also” can be found by 
simple geometry. 
l, = b sec f; + z) tan f; 
~ and lk =.b sec fp - z1 tan fy 


590 Siddhanta Darpana 


where z; is the distance of the moon’s centre 
from the fundamental plane and has been found 
in paragraph (i) above. 

In the Nautical Almanc, the quantities x, y, 
sin d, cos d, wu, 1 and |, are tabulated at the 
intervals of 10 minutes for every solar eclipse. It 
is to be noted that these quantities relate to the whole 
of earth and not to any particular place on it. 


Circumstances of solar eclipse at a given place - 


Let p and ©’ be the geocentric distance and 
latitude of the place and x its longitude west of 
Greenwich . The hour angle of Z from the meridian 
of the place is ~—A since the hour angle of Z from 
Greenwich is u. So if (&,7,¢) are the coordinates 
of the place at any instant, we have 

& = p cos ¢ sin (u-A) 
n = p [Sin ¢’ cos d - cos ¢’ sin d cos (u—A)] 
€=p [sin ¢’ sind + cos ¢’ cosd cos (u —A)] 

The values of (&y,€) can be computed for 
any instant. Also, since u is the only variable in 
these expressions, formulae for (&’,7’,¢’) (the 
rates of changes of &,7, and,€ per minute,) can 
be found by differentiation and the numerical 


values of (&’,7’,€’) can be determined for the time 
of eclipse.

Consider now the sections of the penumbral 
and umbral cones by the plane z = ¢, i.e. the plane 
through the observer parallel to the fundamental 
plane. The sections will be circles; and if their radii 
are L, (for the penumbra) and L2 (for the umbra), 
we have from the figure 


Li = l - & tan f; 
L2 lL + ¢ tan fz 
from which L,; and L2 can be determined. 


Consider now the beginning or the end of a 
partial eclipse at the given place. At these two 
instants, the point (&7,¢) must be at the distance 
Li from the axis of the shadow, which cuts the 
fundamental plane in the point (x1,yi,0) and 
therefore cuts the plane z = € in the point x,y,¢. 
The condition for this is

Replacing x, y, € and 7 by xo+x’It and similar 
expressions, (1) becomes a quadratic in t. Solving 
it, we have the times for beginning and end of 
the partial eclipse. It we write L2 for Li in (1), we 
can similarly determine the beginning and end of 
the total eclipse. In (1) it is sufficient to take the 
value of L; or (Lz) at an estimated time close to 
the time of occurrence of the eclipse, for Li and 
Lz change very slowly. 


To determine the point on sun’s disc where 
the eclipse begins - Figure 9 represents the 
penumbra section by the fundamental plane. C is

PARILEKHA 


(Parilekha Varnana) 


Verse 1: Scope - To show the direction of 
sparsa, madhya and moka in stirya and candra 
grahana clearly through diagrams, I explain the 
methods now. 


Verse 2-3 : Valana - An oblique ray of light 
bends in water but doesn’t bend in_ vertical 
direction. Due to that reason, the size of sun and* 
moon and sara of moon, remaining same, it looks- 
smaller in middle sky and bigger. at horizon. Hence, 
earlier astronomers, changed the values of moon, 
sun earth’s shadow in meridian depending on hara 
at that time. This is being explained now. 


Notes : Valana means bending. Light rays 
bend due to refraction, hence it is now called 
refraction effect. In appendix to Tripra$Snadhikara 
(chapter 7) this has been explained. If angle of 
incidence of light to a denser medium be i and 
angle of poleruon be r then 

Sin 


w= “= a constant for the medium (1) 
sin r. 


Hence the. bending (i-r) increase with increase 
in angle of incidence. This angle is measured from 
perpendicular to the surface, hence in vertical 
direction there is no. bending. As we move towards 
horizon, the bending is more. Thus, at sunrise (or 


Parilekha 601 


setting time) its lower end is at horizon having 
90° natéamSa and upper end has slightly less 
(90°-32") natamSa. Thus the lower end will be raised 
more compared to upper and it will be flattened 
and look more elliptical. 


The angle of bending or valana, R is 

R = K tan z’ - - - (2) 

where K = u-1 and z’ is apparent zenith 
distance 

Difference z-z’ is proportional to K sec? z. dz 
= 32’ (K sec’ z) for sun. 

Hence apparent angular diameter is difference 
between apparent nataméSa z and z’ of upper and 
lower. 

Maximum refraction at horizon is about 35’. 


Its variation is very fast near horizon due to very 
high value of sec z near z = 90°. 


NatamSa Refraction

b Thus apparent reduction in vertical angular 


i diameter at horizon is about 5’. 


602 Siddhanta Darpana 


If D is the average of two perpendicular 
angular diameters observed at vertical distance z, 
then the real diameter is 


D [1 + 1/2 K (1 + sec’ z] - - - (4) 


which is bigger than the observed. This means 
that observed diameter will decrease as Z increases 
and is minimum at horizon. 


Verses 4-5 : Value of angular measure for 
bimba. 

Unnata kala Sanku of moon (for lunar eclipse) 
or sun (for solar eclipse) is calculated for middle 
time of eclipse. We add 10314 and divide the sum 
by trijya (3438) to get the hara or value of 1 angula 
in kala. On dividing the bimba of planets or 
shadow or Sara of moon by this hara, we get their 
diameters is angula units. 

Atternatively, half day is multiplied by 3 and 
added to unnata, kala of moon (or sun) and divided 
by half day to get the same hara. Value of bimmba 
and Sara in angula units is obtained by dividing 
their values in kala by this hdara. 

Alternatively, for rough calculation, bimba 
Kala is divided by 3 to get its value in angula. 


Notes : (1) Surya siddhanta assumes (Candra 
grahana verse 26) that the proportional angular 
diameter of a graha is 3 units at horizon, then it 
becomes 4 unit at vertical position i.e. increase in 
the ratio of 4/3. Bhaskaradcarya and Lalla have 
assumed 2-1/2 : 3-1/2 increase i.e., in ratio of 7/5. 
Actual increase as we have seen after verse 3 is 
from (32’-5’) to 32’ in sun’s bimba i.e. in ratio of 
32/27 = 1.2 approx. Thus the ratios 1.33 of sirya 


. Parilekha 603 


_ siddhanta and 1.4 of Bhaskara II are much higher 
- than ‘the true ratio. 

_Another approximation is that the increase 
has been assumed proportional to the angular rise 
- above horizon upto value of 90° rise to top 
- position, where it is maximum. Angle of rise 0° = 
 90°-z. Putting it in equation (4) above, apparent 
diameter is 


T 
er a a 
1 +5Ka + cosec? @) 
For 0. = 0, lower term cosec © = which is 


. not correct approximation. However, the increase 
is in proportion to value of cosec 6 and not 
proportional to @ as assumed. This is increase of 
average diameter. Vertical diameter will increase at 
_ double rate. 


(2) 1 angula = 3 Kala at horizon 

and = 4 Kala at vertical position 

Height is proportional to unnata sanku, as 
‘assumed. 

. For height of R (Trijya = 3438’) increase is 1 

kala. Hence, for unnata ganku U, 


u 
increase is R Kala 


Thus 1 angula = 3 + : Kala 


3R+U.. 3 x 3438+U 
. R Kala = —~3438 
-U + 10314

604 Siddhanta Darpana 


This is the first formula 


Roughly half day is of 15 ghati when sun 
reaches at top. Actually it is still slightly away from 
zenith but that distance is ignored. Unnata kala is 
in proportion to half day taken as 90° or 15 ghati.

almost same, and 1 angula = 3 kala is uniformly 
assumed.

Verses 6-14 : Diagram for direction of eclipse 


On a ground, plane like water level, a circle 
of 57/18 angula semi-diameter is drawn with a 
compass. This is known as khagola vrtta having 
two valanas. 


From this centre only, another circle with 
radius of sum of semi diameters is also drawn 
which is called samasa vrtta. 

From same centre a third circle is drawn with 
radius equal to the grahya bimba (which is eclipsed) 

Now according to method explained in 
Triprasnadhikara north south line and east west 
lines are drawn in khagola vrtta. In lunar eclipse; 


Parilekha 605 


sparSa is from east and mokéa is in west direction. 
But in solar eclipse sparsa (beginning) is from west 
and mokéa is in east direction. 


In khagola vrtta we mark a point at a distance 
from east point for lunar eclipse equal to jya of 
sphuta valana and in same direction as valana. A 
line from centre to that point is drawn. Similarly, 
at a distance from west point equal to and in 
direction of mokSa time valana, another point is 
chosen and a line from centre is drawn. In solar 
eclipse, the order of valana lines is reverse i.e. 
sparsa in west and moka in east direction. These 
lines are called valanagra rekhd. Valanagra rekha 
cuts samasa vrtta on valana points. From these 
points, we mark the distance equal to sphuta Sara 
jya of moon at the time of spar$a or moksa. These 
are called Saragra vindu (in east for sparsa and 
nimilana and west for unmilana and moka in lunar 
eclipse, opposite direction in solar eclipse). 


The line from centre to Saragra point cuts 
grahya and mokéa. Here Sara and valana are given 
according to their current values. 


Sara is in north south direction, some times 
in angle direction like agni kona (north east). 


Notes : (1) Radius of khagola vrtta is 57/18 
angula because 57°18’ = 3438’ = length of radius. 
Hence 1/60 angula on radius or circumference is 
equal to 1 minute or kala. The method is same as 
in sirya siddhanta, but there the radius is 49 
angula where 1 angula was 70’. 


Radius of samasa vrtta or grahya vrtta will be 
calculated according to value of angula in kala 


606 Siddhanta Darpana 


calculated in verses 45. Roughly 1 angula = 3 kala. 
Similarly length of Sara also is calculated in angula. 

However, valana is measured on khagola vrtta 
where 1 pratyangula (1/60 angula) is equal to 1 
kala or 1 angula = 1°. With this unit we measure 
the lengths. — 

(2) Method of drawing is best explained by 
actual diagram.

Parilekha 607 


Verse 15-30 : Further details for periods 
within sparsa and mokséa. Now, I describe the 
details of eclipse between the end points of sparSa 
and moka. 


In lunar eclipse, when moon is near rahu or 
ketu, spasta valana in khavrtta is given in own 
direction from east or west point in north or south 
direction. From these valana end points, we give 
two points at distance of 5 angula, in north 
direction from east valana, and south direction from 
west valana point. We draw a line through these 
points which also passes through centre of the 
circle. 

‘In solar eclipse, we mark a point from eastern 
valana point at a distance equal to lagna kranti in 
the direction of kranti. This point is joined with 
centre and extended to make it diameter. Sara of 
moon is put in perpendicular direction on its line 
according to direction of the Sara. (Sara will be at, 
central point for middle position of the eclipse or 
any other point according to time of eclipse). From 
end point of Sara a circle is drawn with radius of 
grahaka bimba (eclipser) (This circle is drawn in 
lunar eclipse on 5° difference line). 

The portion cut by grahaka birmnba will be the 
extent of eclipse visible to people. 


Sara of sparsa, madhya and moka periods 
are put at their positions. From the three end 
points of Sara, we draw three circles with radius 
equal to 1/3 of the distance between sparéa and 
_mok&a. From intersection of adjacent triangles two 
fish like figures are formed. The head tail lines of 
these fish figures join at a point which is centre 


608 Siddhanta Darpana 


of circle passing through these points. With this 
centre an arc is drawn through Sara ends of sparSa, 
madhya and mokSsa which is the grahaka marga 
(path of the eclipsing planet or shadow). 


From centre of this grahaka marga, we draw 
a line in the direction of sparSa (eastern direction 
in lunar eclipse and west in solar eclipse), at the 
distance of grahaka diameter from sparsa point, 
there will be nimilana point on the grahya circle. 
Similarly, unmilana point on grahya circle will be 
on the mokéa side of the grahaka marga. 

To find the amount of grasa at desired time 
we assume two parts of grahaka marga - from mid 
point to sparga, it will be sparsa khanda and the 
other side will be moksa khanda. Their length is 
measured in angulas. The angula measure is 
multiplied by required time (after spar$a or before 
mok$Sa) and divided by its sthiti ardha time. We 
give.a point at a distance equal to angula measure 
of required time from sparéa or mok§a point. From 
that point, we draw a circle with radius of grahaka 
circle. The portion cut by this circle in the grahya 
bimnba will be the required amount of grasa at 
desired time. 


Sum of semi diameters of grahya and grahaka 
is substracted from the required grasa in angula. 
A pointer equal to remaining length in angula is 
taken. With this, we find two points on grahaka 
marga at distance of grasa from centre of grahya 
circle. One point is in sparsa khanda and the other 
in mokéa khanda. From these points we draw circle 
with radius of grahaka birnba. The portion covered 
by this circle will be the portion eclipsed. 


Parilekha 609 


At the distance of difference of semi-diameters 
of grahya and grahaka from centre of grahya bithba, 
we get two points on grahaka marga - one on 
mokséa khanda and the other on sparsa -khanda. 
These are the points of nimilens (on sparsa khanda) 
and unmilana.

For solar eclipse Vil; = V2L2 = kranti of lagna. 

On its intersection with samasa circle and at 
centre, Sara lengths at sparsa, madhya and mok&a 
points are drawn. perpendicular to it. It will be 
least at the centre and in direction of Sara at all 
places. Their ends are 5,, S2, 53: The three circles 
through these points from two fish figures which 
intersect at point C. From C as centre with radius 
CS; = CS. = CS3 we draw a circle. S; S2 $3 arc is 
the grahaka marga on which eclipser planet or

For lunar eclipse S2 S3 is sparsa khanda and 
Si S2 is moksa khanda. For solar eclipse 5S; S2 is 
sparsa khanda and S; $3 is mokSa khanda. 

Nimilana point P for lunar eclipse (or un- 
milana point for solar eclipse) is on grahaka marga 
such that $3 P = diameter of grahaka birhba. 

Length on grahaka marga is proportional to 
time. 

Hence for any point P 

Length Desired time 

S2 $3 Sthiti ardha 

This formula is used to calculate grasa at 
desired time. 


Verse 30-35 : Another method of diagram - 


At Saragra point on one side of valanagara 
rekha (Sara is madhya Sara), another line parallel 
to valana rekha is drawn. From its end points on 
khagola circle, a point is given towards north for 
lunar eclipse (south for solar eclipse) at a distance 
of 1/60 of Jya of local aksarnSa. 


Parilekha 611 


From these two points and the point of 
madhya Sara point (i.e. mid point of parallel line 
to valana rekha) we draw a circle as explained in 
above verse. 

Portion of this circle within samasa circle will 
be grahaka marga. On this path, we can find 
nimilana and unmilana points from centre of grahya 
circle at distance of difference of semi-diameters of 
grahya-grahaka,. as before. In this diagram sparSa 
and nimilana of solar eclipse can be seen in west 
direction and, for lunar eclipse in opposite direction 
very easily. This method doesn’t need éara or 
valana time at time of spar§a, etc. 


ut,. for diagram of solar eclipse, 1/3 of Sara 
- of moon (i.e. angula value) is kept at two places. 
At one place it is multiplied by sun Sanku of that 
time and divided by 4400. Quotient is added at 
first place. 


On a single board both solar and lunar 
eclipses can be shown. Only difference will be that 
the direction of sparsa, moka etc will be opposite 
for the two types of eclipses. 


Note : This is almost same procedure. In stead 
of marking sara at sparsa, mokSa and mid points, 
we mark the middle Sara only. In stead of other 
Sara, we mark the kranti of lagna on khagola at 
distance from middle Sara. Reason is that the 
diurnal circle of moon will be parallel to ecliptic 
and at same angular distance from lagna point of 
ecliptic as on middle point of eclipse. 


For solar eclipse Sara is corrected for parallax. 
The correction is slightly less, which appears to 


612 Siddhanta Darpana 


compensate effective increase of tamo-mana of 
moon as explained in chapter 9 verses 43-45. 


Figure 1 and 2 show, that both the diagrams 
for solar and lunar eclipse can be combined, which 
has been prescribed here. 


Verses 37-38 : Prayer and conclusion 


I pray to lord Jagannatha, who smiles with 
beautiful lips, beauty of whose round eyes defeats 
the beauty of morning sun of spring time and full 
moon of winter night, who gives freedom from 
fear to people flocking to Nilacala from different 
regions, and whose sight can emancipate the world.

Chapter - 11 
CONJUNCTION OF PLANETS 
GRAHA YUTI VARNANA 


(Conjunction of planets) 


Verses 1-2-Scope - While the planets are 
moving in their own orbits, their position is seen 
same from earth. This is called graha yuti (con- 
junction of planets). Graha yuti and its good or 
bad results are described in this chapter. 


According to Surya siddhanta, when tara 
graha (mangala etc.) are seen joint, then their 
(apparent) coming together is called graha yuti or 
yuddha. When any tara graha comes together with 
moon, it is called samagama. When tara graha is 
with sun, it is not visible due to bright rays of 
sun, and it is called ‘asta mita’ (heliacal setting of 
planets). 


Notes (1) Planets do not really come together. 
_They are in their own orbit which are far from 
_each other. But due to parallax, they are seen 
together, as in solar eclipse, sun and moon are 
. Seen in same direction. However, the parallax is 
‘Same for all positions from earth due to large 
‘ distances of star like planets (tara graha). Compared 
' to eclipse of sun, the diameters of tara graha are 
“Much smaller and their orbits are farther and 
é ‘Slower, hence their conjunctions are rare. However, 


e 
= 
Be 


614 Siddhanta Darpana 


their number is more causing different combina- 
tions of yuti and their Sara also is small compared 
to moon’s orbit, so we are able to see the yuti 
some times. 


(2) Moon is considered the king of stars and 
the nakSatras as its wives. It lives with one nakSatra 
each day like a husband and wife - ‘naksate’ means 
lives together. Thus conjunction of moon with any 
nakSatra or tara graha is called Samagama or happy © 
union. Conjunction between tara graha is called 
‘yuddha, as it is not considered friendly. In this 
‘yuddha ’ or war, the planet which is behind is 
like a chaser and takes away half the strength of 
the other planet which is considered defeated. This 
strength is considered in astrology for considering 
their power in giving good or bad results. The 
reduction or increase of strength is according to 
their mutual covering and depends on their angular 
diameters. At present, we follow the method of 
Sripati for calculating the reduction or increase in 
strength due to planetary war. 


Due to nearness with sun, the planets are 
invisible and called set due to sun. This has already 
been mentioned in chapter 6 and will be discussed 
in an independent chapter on it. 


(3) Varahamihira in his Brhat samhita, ex- 
plained in detail the various results of graha yuti. 
According to the degree of their seeming approach- 
ment, there are four kinds of wars (among planets) 
as stated by Pardéara and other sages - Bheda 
(occulation- or cleaving), Ullekha (grazing), 
Amsu mardana (clashing of rays) and Apasavya 
(passing south ward).

“conjunction of Planets 615 


iverses 3-5 : Principles of computation 


We find rasi, amSa and kala of two planets 
‘in conjunction. When they are equal in ecliptic 
(kadamba prota vrtta), their values on equator are 
found (dhruva prota vrtta). From this, their sara 
and lambana are found. Then bimba (angular 
diameter) is calculated. 


In sirya siddhanta - When faster of the two 
i planets has greater longitude (i.e. it is towards 
: east), then conjunction has already occurred. If it 
igs less (i.e. in west), then the conjunction is yet 
“to occur. If both are vakri (retrograde) then reverse 
-will happen, i.e. planet in east indicates, conjunc- 
tion is to occur, in west means conjunction has 
already passed. If one body alone is retrograde 
and its longitude is greater in east), then the 
“conjunction is to come, if less, it has passed. 
7 _ Notes : (1) Conjunction is calculated first in 
; longitude measured along ecliptic, when their 
» POsitions. are same. However, their difference in 
I perpendicular direction (Sara) and apparent devia- 
‘ tion due to observing from earth will depend on 
‘position with respect to equator. Size of the bimba 


of planets will panes at what distance they will . 
© meet, 


(2) Finding Sonfunctony time, whether gone 
it OF ‘yet to come is very easy to find, from diagram.

Figure ‘1 - Conjunction of planets . 


616 Siddhanta Darpana 


In figure 1, M is position on ecliptic, which 
is mesa 0° from which position of planet is 
measured. When arrow direction indicates rotation 
in east direction, the rasi amSa etc (longitude) of 
two points A and B are MA and MB. When 
longitude of B is more, it is east from A as seen 
from figure. 

When B is faster, it will move further east 
from A, and at some earlier time it was with A 
i.e. in conjunction. If A or western planet is faster 
it will meet B in time needed to cover AB with 
relative speed. If B is retrograde in east position 
A and B, both approach each other with their 
speeds, hence it will approach with speed equal 
to sum of speeds. When both are moving in 
western direction, obviously the reverse of direct 
motion will happen. 


Verses 6-9 : Finding the time and place of 
conjunction - At required time we find the 
bhogarhSa (longitude) of the two graha and convert 
their difference into kala. This is_ separately 
multiplied by daily speeds of graha in kala. Each 
product is divided by difference of speeds if both 
have direct or both retrograde motion. But if one 
graha is margi and the other, vakri, the products 
are divided by sum of speeds in kala. If both 
planets have already joined and both are margi, 
then each quotient is deducted from the bhogaméa 
of its planet by whose speed it had been multiplied. 
If conjunction is yet to happen, then the quotients 
are added. If both are retrograde (vakri), reverse 
is done. If one is vakri and the other margi, then 
addition and substraction are done as per rules 
explained earlier. By this, we get the bhogamSa of 


:  Conpenchon of Planets 617 


: : Kranti vrtta (position on ecliptic) where conjunction 
y has happened. If the kala of planets doesn’t become 
equal in a single operation, this process is repeated 
* again. 

: Notes : In figure 1, 

longitude of A is MA, B is MB 

Differnece in longitudes is MB-MA = AB 
Speed of A is a and B is b kala per day 


Difference in speeds is a-b 
z if a> b, then A will catch up with B in time 
, AB / (a-b) 
: if a,< b then B has gone ahead this ditterence 
= AB in time AB// (b-a) 
Thus in first case the longitude of conjunction 


: for A will increase tb X a, increase in B will 
te 
a — 


x b. This increase in A will be “ (a-b) 


b 
‘more i.e. AB more and they will catch up. 
If a « b, then the conjunction time is earlier 
and longitude of A and B will be reduced by 
‘. distances travelled by them. 


é For retrograde planets obviously situation will 
’ be reversed. If B is faster, it will catch up distance 
«. BA in time t = BA / (b-a) in which the longitude 
Of B and A will be reduced by t b and t a. 


i Suppose A is retrograde and B is forward 
i Motion. There relative speed is at atb and their 
distance is increasing. Then they are together at 
e time AB / ‘(atb) = t before the present time. In 
this time longitude of A was more by ta because 


618 Siddhanta Darpana 


it is retrograde and B was tb less, in earlier time 
of conjunction. 

If A is direct and B is retrograde, then the 
plenets are approaching each other with velocity 
a+b and they will cover the distance AB in time 
AB / (a+b) = t when they will be together. After 
that time position of A will be ta more and of B 
will be tb less because it is moving in reverse 
direction. 


(2) We are assuming uniform motion of 
planets in the interval AB. Within this the speeds 
will change, forward motion may become 
retrograde and vice verse. Thus after getting the 
conjunction time approximately on basis of present 
speeds, we again calculate the position difference 
at this approximate conjunction time. Then we 
calculate more accurately as to when conjunction 
had occurred or would occur. 


Verses 10-11 : Sara of planets 

(From Surya siddhanta - Spastadhikara verse 
56-57). 

In pata of mangala, Sani and guru, correction 
for second sighraphala is made in same manner, 
in which it is done for the planet (i.e. positive 
result is added and negative substracted). This will 
give the true postions of pata of these three planets. 
But in pata of budha and Sukra, correction is made 
with second mandaphala (used in third step of 
correction) in reverse manner - i.e. positive result 
is substracted and negative added. By this, true 
pata of budha and sukra will be known. 


Conjunction of Planets 619 


From true postions of mangala, Sani and guru, 
true positions of their pata are deducted to get 
vikSepa kendra. VikSepa kendra of budha and 
gukra are found by substracting their true pata 
from their Sighrocca positions. 


Jya of vikSepa kendra is multiplied by madhya 
vikSepa and divided by fourth sighra karna to get 
the sphuta Sara. 

Notes : (1) Mean inclinations (vikSepa) of 
planetary orbits - This has been explained by 
Bhaskaracérya II. in his chapter on 
-grahacchayadhikara (siddhanta siromani). Reasons 
‘of the method have also been explained. 

The values of madhya vikSepa are given in 
chapter 5 - spastadhikara verses 28-33, reproduced 
here

The values of superior planets are almost same 
as modern values. Bhaskara says that these values 
are for that time when Sighra anomaly is equal to 
90° + 1/2 R sin 7 a, where a is R sine of the 
maximum sighra phala. This is quite correct, 


620 Siddhanta Darpana 
: v2 Pp 


E 
Figure 4 Figure 5 
‘ because when the 

Sighra anomaly has this value, the true planet is 
at point of intersection (P) of the deferent and 
eccentric circle. Then the planet is equidistant from 
Ei and E2 (figure 2) For superior planets, E; is 
taken as earth’s centre and E,2 is sun, the mean 
latitude of the planet observed will be same, 
whether observed from earth or sun. Hence, 
maximum latitudes of the superior planets are same 
for geocentric and heliocentric observations. These 
are the mean values. 


For inferior planets, mean planet in this case 
is taken to be sun, the linear values of the latitude 
observed from E and S, the centres of Earth and 
‘sun will be in ratio SP/ES (figure 3) For mercury 


Conjunction of Planets 621 


’ this ratio is 4/10 and for venus it is 7/10. Hence

‘the modern values are reduced to ——~——~ and

KF 
a i.e. 168 and 142 which are approximately 


equal with the values given in siddhanta. 


(2) Pata is calculated for orbit round sun and 
converted to geocentric position - 


Figure 4 shows an inferior planet indicated 

. es P and Figure 5 an superior planet J. Position 

“of earth and sun are E and S., position of mesa 

0° from sun and earth are A and A’. Position of 
f node from sun and earth is N and N’.

ea Sara as seen from sun is pee 


where B is maximum éara (latitude).

Substracting sighraphala EJS = JEJ’ from this 
we get ZASJ = heliocentric longitude. 

Then retrograde longitude of N ie. ZASN 
is added. 

We get ZASN + 2 ASJ = ZNSJ . From this 
heliocentric Sara (latitude) is first calculated as in 
above case by multipliying with #/R and then 
geocentric valkue is obtained by R/K. 

ZNSP or ZNSJ has been called” viksepa 
kendra i.e. heliocentric distance between pata and 
planet in both cases. 


which is the formula. 


Verses 12-26 : Further correction for Sara - 


The above Sara has been written according to 
old siddhanta which is inaccurate according to 
author. Now accurate Sara of mangala etc as 
actually seen in explained. 


Sun and moon are to be corrected for parallax, 
when away from midday-sun (i.e. zenith), due to 
difference of observation from earth’s centre and 
surface. Similarly, correction in Sara is to make it 
sphuta (from heliocentric to geocentric position). 

Mean positions of mangala, guru and Sani are 
-substracted from their sphuta mandocca to get the 
. manda kendra. Jya of manda kendra is mandaphala 


Conjunction of Planets 623 


approximately. By adding or substracting this from 
mean position we get manda sphuta graha. 

Sighrocca of budha and Sukra is substracted 
from their mandocca sphuta. For budha, its 
gighrocca is corrected by its parocca kandraphala. 
Result is Sighra kendra for vikSepa purpose. 

For viksepa kendra of other three planets, 
manda spasta graha is substracted from its pata. 


These are Sara kendra of all 5 planets. From 
its bhuja jya, Sara is found by multiplying with 
parama éara and dividing with trijya - heliocentric 
value. Sara is in north or. south direction as 
explained in case of moon. 


Difference of third mandakarna and trijya is 
. multiplied by difference of fourth sighra karna and 
trijya and divided by trijya. We get ksepa 
karnantara. 

Sara Karna - (1) When fourth Sighra karna is 
more than trijya - (a) when third manda karna also 
is bigger than trijya - Karnantara is substracted 
from trijyd (b) when third manda karna is less 
than trijya - kSepa karnantara is added to trijya. 

(2) When fourth sighra karna is less than 
trijya- (a) manda karna is more - then karnantara 
is added to trijya (b) when mandakarna is less - 
then karnantara is substracted from trijya. 


For budha and ésukra, karnantara is added or 
substracted from mandakarna instead of trijya. 


Thus we get Sara karna of all the five planets 
«. for all situations. 


624 Siddhanta Darpana 


Sphuta Sara : As in previous method, pata is 
substracted from graha. Jya of this vikSepa kendra 
is multiplied by madhyama Sara and divided by 
Sara karna. Quotient is multiplied by trijya and 
divided by fourth sighra karna to obtain sphuta 
$ara of planets in kala. Its difference with sthula 
(rough) Sara also can be used. 


Notes : (1) First we calculate the heliocentric 
position by mandasphuta graha as explained in 
spastadhikara. 

(2) Sara karna is real distance of planet from 
sun due to Sara in its Sighra gati. Difference of 
manda karna and trijya is proportional change of 
distance due to mandaphala. It is multiplied by 
proportional change due to Sighra phala_ by 
multiplying with (sighra karna trijya) and dividing 
by trijya. 

When mandakarna or Sighra karna is greater 
than trijya, Sara karna i.e. true position of planet 
with Sara, is less because Sara will look smaller 
from larger distance. Hence Sara karnantara is 
substracted from trijya, average distance. 

For budha and sukra average distance is their 
manda karna i.e. distance of sun from earth. 

(3) Madhyama Sara is value of Sara seen from 
sun, it is multiplied by Sara karna to get its true 
value as seen from sun. For proportionate reduction 
for geocentric value; it is multiplied by R/K. as 
explained in notes after pervious verse. 


Verses 27-31 : Ayana drk-karma : 


Sayana graha is added with 3 raéi (90°) 
which is satribha sayana sphuta graha. Its krant 


Conjunction of Planets 625 


jya is multiplied by sphuta Sara and divided by 
dyujya of satribha sayana graha. The result will be 
in lipta etc. and is called ayana drkkarma kala. 


When ayana and Sara of graha are in different 
direction, ayana is added to graha; and substracted 
if they are in same direction. Then graha postition 
or equator will be found, i.e. kadambaprota graha 
will become dhruva prota. This is called ayana 

_drkkarma. 


After doing ayana drkkarma, again the dif- 
ference of planets involved in war (conjunction) is 
found. As before; the time is calculated when their 
rasi, kala etc. are equal. This will give lapsed or 
remaining days of conjunction. At the time of this 
‘conjunction, the planets are equal upto kalas. Then 
again sara is found; ayana drkkarma for new 
position will be done. By repeating the process, 
we get accurate time of equatorial conjunction when 
kala of the two planets are equal.

of Sara are added. Square root of sum is the sukéma 
Sara. When Stksma Sara and kranti are in same 
direction they are added; otherwise difference is 
taken for sphuta kranti of the planet. This will be 
distance from planet to the equator on polar circle. 
Sun is always on kranti vrtta so its madhya kranti 
and sphuta kranti are same. 


-- (2). 


AB = 


By the method explained in TripraSnadhikara, 
for both the planets (in conjunction), from sphuta

multiplied by 5400 and divided by their half day 

ive jya of nata and unnata kala respectively. 
Difference of cara asu of graha for madhyama and 
sphuta kranti is taken as kala and multiplied by 
nata jya and divided by trijya. The result in kala 
js substracted from graha in forenoon (east half of 
sky) and added to graha in west half, if Sara is 
north. For south Sara, reverse process will be done. 
Then the graha will be corrected with akSa 
‘drkkarma. 


After that, difference of both graha is found 
‘and the time since conjunction or remaining till 
that is found. For conjunction time; again akSa 
drkkarma is done. After repeated procedure, both 
-graha will be in same samaprota vrtta. Then, their 
north south difference in found on that circle. 


Notes : (1) Sphuta sara : Sara (or madhyama 
Sara) is GB in figure 6 which is distance of the 
planet from ecliptic along the circle through 
- kadamba K. Along this circle the distance of planet 
from equator is GB’. But distance from equator is 
- calculated along. great circle through dhruva P. 
Hence the total kranti i.e. distance from equator 


_is 


_GA’ = GA + AA’. We take as spasta graha, 
© not real planet G but its projection B on ecliptic. 
“Hence, kranti of B is the real kranti. 


x First we have to calculate GA, which is given 
“by GA = VGB2 + AB? as ZGBA is 90° and 
» AGBA is small and considered a plane triangle. 


7 AA’ is almost equal to BB’ which is kranti of 
,. the sphuta planet i..e madhya kranti. 


628 Siddhanta Darpana 


Calculation of GA is really not necessary by 
the above formula, as we have already assumed 
GA = GB in derivation. 


(2) Bhaskaracarya has explained the drkkarma 
with difference in rising time on horizon due to 
Sara of the planet. When the ecliptic position of 
' the planet is rising on horizon, then due to Sara, 
the real planet is above the horizon for north Sara 
(down for south Sara) and rises earlier (or later for 
south Sara). The difference in rising time is known 
by drkkarma. One component of drkkarma 
depends upon 4yana valana (i.e. inclination be- 
tween equator and ecliptic) and the other com- 
‘ponent depends on 4akSavalana (i.e. local akSaméa 
- inclination of local horizon or vertical with horizon 
or vertical of equator). These components are called 
ayana drkkarma and akéa drkarma. 


Figure 7 - Akéa drkkarma 
In figure 7, NZSZ’ is yamyottata vrtta of a 
place and NES is diameter of horizon in its plane. 
QQ’ and AA’ are diameters of equator and ahoratra 
vrtta. PP’ is diameter of unmandala. EM is kranti 
jya; AM | is dyujya = R cos¢, where gis aksaméa. 


. Conjunction of Planets 629 


Due to kranti, the planet rises earlier at 
position N, MN = kujya = R sin 6 tan@ where 6 
is kranti. Its value on equator is ET where 1 kala 
= 1 asu in time. ET = carajya = R tand tan ¢ 

Due to Sara, the planet at M on ecliptic is 

seen at K’ in direction K, which is kadamba or 

ole of the ecliptic. (Sara is shown north, when K 
is north from P). ZKMP = vy = ayana valana. Thus 
due to Sara, the longitude of planet is shifted by 
K’M’ on diurnal circle, K’M’ = s sin v where s is 
the Sara. This is equivalent to shift of 

s Sin v / cos ¢ on equator, which is ayana 
- drkkarma in asu. If we put R cosp = Dyujya and 

_ R sin v = satribha kranti jya (approx), we get the 
formula for ayana drkkarma given earlier. 


_ Another component of éara MK’ is MM’ 
= s cos v, which is the Sara in perpendicular 
‘direction to equator. Hence, sphuta Sara is EM’ = 
_EM + MM’ = R sin 6 + s cos v. Thus effectively 
‘the diurnal circle of ecliptic planet of M will be 
shifted to LM’L’ parallel circle to equator passing 
through M’. Then the planet, will rise at position 
_R’ (corresponding to R on diurnal circle and T’ on 
equator). Thus the rising time will be earlier by 
TT’ = ET’ - ET = difference of carajya. This 
-is the simplest and most accurate formula given in 
. any siddhanta text. 
(3) Difference in carajya is difference at 
horizon, corresponding to half day length (dyujya 
;Or radius of equator). At other times it is 
, Proportional to natajya i.e. distance from 


. yamyottara position A or L of the planet. Thus 
he Akéa valana at ista kala | Akéa drkkarma at rising 


Jya of nata kala - Half day ~ 


630 Siddhanta Darpana 


Formula for 4ksa drkkarma at any other time 
has not been given by any other author. It is seen 
that akSa drkkarma is deducted from planet in east 
sky as it rises earlier for north Sara. Since it will 
set later in west, half proportionate addition will 
be done. 


Verses 38-40 : Bimba of planets 


Five tara grahas like mangala have five types 
of birnba - madhya vrtta birnba, madhya bhasvara 
bimba, sphuta vrtta bimba, sphuta bhasvara birnba 
and drktulya birhba. 

Bimba of sun is very bright. Planets like moon 
take light from that and reflect it like water surface. 


Tara graha also have horns, due to the angle 
between direction of the graha and sun. But due 
to their distance from sun being large compared 
to moon, their horns are not seen. They are seen 
-aS point only. 

Notes : (1) Birnba of tara grahas have been 
discussed in detail in birnbadhikara of siddhanta 
tattwa viveka, but this terminology has not been 
used any where. They are lighted by reflected light 
of sun, and bimba of Sukra and budha are seen 
less than half when they are between earth and 
sun, due to their dark phase like moon. It has 
also discussed hole is sun due to Sukra (like eclipse 
by moon). Due to smallness of taragrahas (small 
angular diameters) they are seen only as a point 
and their horns are not seen due to dark phase 
like moon. 

(2) From the context, the classification of 
bimba depends on their distance from earth, due 
to which they look small or big and due to phase 


‘Conjunction of Planets 631 


i.e. dark part depending on angular distance from 
sun. Thus the classifications are - 


Distance difference - (i) Madhya vrtta birnba- 

Average bimba size seen at average distance. 

(ii) Sphuta vrtta bimba - Current size of birnba 
depending on the sphuta distance of planet. 

Phase difference (iii) Madhya bhasvara bimba 
- Half lighted phase corresponding to about 90° 
‘angular separation from sun. 

(iv) Sphuta bhasvara bimba - True lighted 
portion according to angular separation. 
_. Actual birhba - (v) Drktulya birhba - which is 
,, actually seen according to distance and phase 
effects.

632 Siddhanta Darpana 


All other text books have compared the 
diameters of. planet in moon’s orbit , but siddhanta 
darpana has. compared them in sun’s orbit. The 
linear diameter is based on accumption that the 
distances are inversely proportional to angular 
speed i.e. proportional to period of rotation. As 
the comparative distance of moon and sun on that 
basis was rejected due to correct looking value of 
Atharvaveda, reference to moon’s orbit also was 
rejected. However, the distance of other planets 
and sun are considered proportional to their 
periods of rotation. This is justified because all 
planets move round the sun and moon around 
earth both according to siddhanta darpana and 
modern theory. 

Period of rotaiton T and distance D are not 
directly proportional, but according to Keplar’s 
third law 

Pay 

where D is distance (semi major axis) 

Thus T a@ D* instead of Ta D assumed here. 
Thus, actual relative distance of farther planets will 
be lower than calculated here. 

There is evidence in vedas that orbit was not 
meant the linear circle, but the surface of sphere 
on which this circle moves due to rotation of pata. 
The same concept is used in Jain texts also. If time 
period is considered Propo nOary to volume, then 
this relation T? a D® holds as Ta 43. 0 r°, D 
4nr* where r is radius of orbit. Then T? and D* 
both ar®. Time volume relation is only a conjecture

Aryabhata and Vatesvara have reduced the 


values of strya siddhanta and made them more 
correct. They are generally more correct then values 
of Tycho Brahe, who had observed with telescope. 


Old stirya siddhanta value is 2 to 2-1/2 times 


the values of modern siirya siddhanta and have 
been approximately followed by others in table (2). 


Siddhanta Darpana has evidently reduced the 


value of angular diameters in ratio of about 11, in 
which ratio the diameter and distance of sun have 
increased. However, compared to surya 
siddhanta ratios, he has made increase in mercury 


‘ and venus diameters and reduced the ratio of outer 
- planets. For outer planets ratio of siddhanta 


» 1/1.64 Saturn 1/1.7 
' Ratio for inner planets is 
Merucry 2.8/1, venus 1.8/1 


‘darpana and modern values are Mars 1 : 1.8, Jupiter 


634 Siddhanta Darpana 


One reason may be that, the visibility of outer 
planets reduces due to large distance from sun, 
hence they appear smaller. 

Minute values of old S.S/Seconds value of 
siddhanta Darpana for outer planets is 


Mars 1:2, Jupiter 1:3 Saturn 1:2 

For inner planets 

Mercury 1:3.6, Venus 1:7.8 

It is quite probable that Candrasekhara has 
calculated the angular diameters of inner planets 


according to their average distance from sun which 
is much less. 


Comparison of linear diameters 


Planet Siddhanta | Darpana Siiryasiddhanta Moderndiam _ Distance 
yojana Earth = 1 yojana Earth=1 Earth = 1 Earth = 1 


Mars 450 0.281 754.3 0.472 0.536 1.523688 
Mercury 930 0.581 601.6 0.376 0.403 0.387099 
Jupiter 4750 2.969 8324.5 5.203 10.925 5.202803 
Venus 2600 1.625 802.1 0.501 0.990 0.723331 
Saturn 3500 2.188 14,776.4 9.235 9.01 9.538843 


Strya siddhanta relative figure are almost 
correct for all planets except Jupiter and venus 
whose value is about half the true value. These 
errors might have come due to incorrect ratio of 
time period and distance. However, sun’s diameter 
comes to be less than, jupiter and saturn also as 
it is taken only 6500 yojanas. 


Figure of siddhanta darpana are more correct 
with two errors - Jupiter and saturn values reduced 
by about 1/4th of correct value, mars about half 
value. But mercury and venus vahes have been 
increased about 1.45 and 1.63 times the correct 
value. This appears to be due to error in estimating 
angular diameters of inner planets (more). 


Conjunction of Planets 635 


Other correct feature is that all planets are 
assumed much smaller than sun (72,000 yojana 
diameter) due to more correct diameter of sun. 


Verses 43-44 : Madhya bimba 


The angular diameters of budha and éukra in 
sun orbit are their mean diameter. Angular 
diameters of other planets are obtained by multi- 
plying their angular bimba in sun orbit by sighra 
paridhi of the planet and dividing by 360°. The 
angular diameters in vikala are 


Mangala 8, budha 25, guru (25), Sukra 70 and 
Sani 10 

Notes : Average distance of budha and sukra 
is same as average distance of sun from earth as 
these inner planets are in small orbit round sun. 
For outer planets 


Distance of sun __ Sighra paridhi of planet 
. Distance of planet — 360° 
as sun is the Sighra kendra for outer planets. . 
Hence the formula for angular diameters. 


Verses 45-50 : Bhasvara and sphuta bimba - 
Madhyama birhba (angular diameters) are kept at 
two places. At one place, it is multiplied by 
» utkramajy4 in the process of fourth gighra phala 

and divided by two times trijya (6876) Result will 
* be substracted from the madhyama birhba at other 
“ place. This will be bhasvara birhba of the planet. 
- For budha and sukra, when their sighra is in 
'- 6 raéis beginning from makara etc, then fourth 
phala kala and Sighra koti kala are added; jya of 
the sum is added to trijya. Then 3 ragis are added 
to the ighra kendra of budha and éukra and its 


636 Siddhanta Darpana 


koti rasi is substracted. Bhujajya of the remainder 
is multiplied by bimba diameter and divided by 
two times the trijya. Result will be bhasvara bimba 
of these two planets. If Sighra phala kala and koti 
kala is more than 3 rasi together, then jya of the 
* sum is added to trijya to find multipliers for budha 
and §gukra. 


Thus we get madhya vrtta birhba and madhya 
bhasvara bimba. They are separately multiplied by 
trijya and divided by their sighra karna to get the 
sphuta bimba and sphuta bhasvara birhba. 

Notes : (1) Strya siddhanta has given the 
following formula; spasta birnba 


_ Madhyama bimba x 2 x Trijya 

- ‘ Trijya + Fourth gighra karna 

This formula is correct if the madhyama birhba 
is calculated at distance of sun, but in surya 
siddhanta it is calculated at the distance of moon. 
However, this formula is correct for siddhanta 
daprana where madhya birnba has been calculated 
_ at sun’s distance. This is the second formula given 
here and is based on the following ratio. 

Trijya + 4th Sighra karna 

2 

= Madhya birba : spasta bimba. 

More accurately this should be found from 
true distance of planet from earth i.e. 4th Sighra 
karna instead of average of trijya and Sighra karna. 
Thus siddhanta darpana gives correct formula for 
spasta bithba based on ratio — 


Sighra Karna : Trijya = Madhya bimba : celeb 
birnba 


: Trijya 


Conjunction of Planets 637 


(2) Earlier correction : Bhasvara birhba is 
measure Of relative visibility. If depends upon 
distance from sun due to which brightness 
decreases in ratio of square of distance (inverse 

are law). However, due to phase also the 
brightness increases and is more when angular 
distance between planet and sun is 90° to 270°, 
we calculate utkramajya which deducted from trijya 
gives kotijya. Phase of a planet is equal to 
illuminated area divided by whole area of disc. 
.The crecent GCHFG, bounded on one side by the 
.gemi ellipse GFH and on other side by semi circle 
“GCH, is the illuminated part. GH is the line of 
“cusps and CD the diameter perpendicular to it. 
Let CD = 2a. Then the phase 
: IHluminated arc 

Area of disc 


j Figure Ba - Phase of the graha — Figura 8b - Lightad part dueto sun 
1 

35 =a (CM - FM) 

= Se ae ree eae = (1) : 


mt at 2a 


Now in figure 8b, hemisphere ACB is lighted 
sun and ere CAD ‘is seen from earth. 


ZSME = 
Hence ee = CM - FM 
= a-a cos AMC 


638 Siddhanta Darpana 


= a (1 + cos EMS) = a (1+cos d) 
Hence phase = (1 + cos d)/2 - - - (2) 


If we measure the difference between planet 
and sun, as d’, then d’ = 180° -d 

Hence phase = (i-cos d’)/2 - - - (3) 

Thus in formula we find the utkrama jya 
R (1 cos d’) and divide it by 2 R to get the phase 
according to eqn. (3). By substracting this portion 
from total bimrhba, we get the unlighted portion 
which is away from sun. 


For budha and sukra, the phase is calculated 
when they are on farther side of sun (Sighra kendra 
270° to 90°) when they are more illuminated. We 
approximately find distance of mercury from 
superior conjunction (adding 3 rasi to 270° is 0°) 
or inferior conjunction. One gives illuminted figure 
but on farther side, the other gives dark portion 
but on nearer side. 


Verse 51 : When Sighra kendra of budha and 
Sukra is 6 ragi i.e. they are between earth and sun, 
then they are like black holes compared to bright 
sun in its disc. 


Verses 52-55 : Now observed bimba of 
bhasvara is stated. Bhasvara bimmba appear sthila 
(i.e. round without sharp cusps) like a candle flame 
at far distance (which appears a round point instead 
of elongated figure) 


When a bright object is very far, it appears 
215 times its real angular diameter. Bhasvara birmba 
kala is multiplied by 16 and square root of the 
product is taken. That is observed value of seen 
bimba. 


Conjunction of Planets 639 


Notes : (1) Reasons of this arbitrary assump- 
tion are not known. However, from the discussions 
three variations in bimba emerge - 


Sphuta bimba is linear change in angular 
diameter which decreases with distance - like 
diameter of moon and sun. 


Bhasvara bimba is the lighted portion of disc 
due to its phases like moon. 


Observed birhba of a point like object is seen 
215 times bigger. But square root of bhasvara birmba 
is divided by 4 only for the diameter of observed 
bimba in kala. 

(2) Logic of this method is not under stood. 
A point like object will appear bigger due to 
diffraction or scattering of light. That increase in 
angular width will be fixed and not 215 times the 
. radius. Its angular increase will be same for sun 
‘and moon also. Possibly Candrasekhar had seen 
some star planets-with a telescope set at 215 times 


magnification as mentioned by Prof. J.C. Ray in 
his introduction. 


Verse 55 : NakSatras are self illuminated and 
their distance is fixed, as it is almost infinite 
, compared to planetary distances. Still their seen 
. angular diameter should be found out. 

Note : Though the stars are point like, two 
_ Stars or star and a star planet are seen together, 
« even when they are slightly separated. There are 
: ® two reasons for that - 

Due to scattering of light in atmosphere, the 
“point object appears to have,some width. 

____ Even when they are separated, their distance 


» Cannot be seen if it is less than limit of resolution 
| of human eye. 


640 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verses 56-60 : Types of conjunction - 

Now types of conjunction (yuddha or 
samagama) are being stated. 

(1) When the observed bimba of two planets 
touch each other, that is called ullekha yuddha 
(touching conjunction). 

(2) When bimba of.a planet enters another 
planet, it is called vedha or bheda yuddha (piercing 
conjunction). 

(3) When north south difference of two 
planets in conjunction is less then sum of semi 
diamters, then it is amnSa vimarda yuddha (part 
eclipse conjunction). 

(4) When the mutual distance is more than 
sum of semi-diameters, then it is called apasavya 
(i.e. separated), 

Then the difference is upto 1° (60 kala) i.e. 
Distance between centres - sum of semi diameters 
< 60 Kala: 

(5) When the separation is more than 60 kala 
then it is called samagama. 

(6) When, in an apasavya (separation less than 
60 kala), one planet is bright and the other is dark 
(inferior planet between earth and sun), then it is 
called yuddha. 

When both are bright, it is called samagama 

When both are dark, it is called kita yuddha. 

(7) When two planets are equal in longitude 
(i.e. in yuddha) and’ northern planet has bigger 
diameter, then the southern planet is conquered. 

When both are equal, then north birhba is 
conquered, south is victor. 


Conjunction of Planets 641 


Sukra is victor, whether in north or south (as 
it has largest birmba among tara grahas and is 
brightest). 

Notes : These are only conventions for 
predicting furture events and described in Brhat 
samhita etc. Here samagama has been used twice. 
One is conjunction when rim distance is more than 
60 kala. Another is yuddha in which both planets 
are equally bright. However, conjunction of moon 
with a star has been called samagama generally. 


‘Verses 61-63 - South north distance 


To know the north south distance, two 
drkkarmas have already been described. As in 
eclipse, nata and lambana corrections also are 
needed for the true north south distance. Earlier 
astronomers didn’t observe or calculate less than 
1/2 degree or 30 kala, hence they ignored nata and 
lambana of tara graha which is much smaller. Still 
for academic interest it is being described to explain 


‘the mathematics. 


Verses 64-67 : Nati of planets 


Parama nati of sun is 22 vikala. Madhyama 
nati of budha and éukra alsé in same. Nati Kala 


,, Of budha and Sukra (22/60) is multiplied by trijyd 
;, and divided by last sighra katna. Quotient is again 


multiplied by vitribha natamSa (drkkSepa) and 
divided by trijya for spasta nati of budha and 
sukra. 


‘For other three planets (mangala, guru and 


* Sani, parama nati of ravi is multiplied by their 
& Sighra paridhi and divided by 360. Quotient is 


sae | 


multiplied by trijyi and divided by fourth sighra 


642 ; Siddhanta Darpana 


karna. Result is again multiplied by drkkSepa and 
divided by trijya to get the spasta nati. 

As in solar eclipse, viksepa of the 5 planets 
is corrected with spasta nati to get the sphuta Sara. 

Notes : (1) Average distance of budha and 
Sukra is same as that of sun, hence their parama 
madhya nati will be same as that of sun. As the 
parallax reduces in proportion to distance similarly 
for outer planets - 


mean parallax of planet __mean distance of sun 
mean parallax of sun mean distance of planet 


_ Sighra paridhi 

- 360° 

as sun is considered gighra:kendra of outer 
planets. - 


(2) True parama nati mean distance 


. Mean parama nati ~ ‘True distance 


. ___Trijya 
~ Fourth éighra karna 


(3) Parama nati is for horizontal position for 
which drkksepa or jy4 of vertical distance (south) 
is maximum or equal to trijya (R). Since nati 
depends on jya of vertical distance towards south 

Spasta nati — drkksepa 

parama nati ~—STrijya 

(4) Correction of Sara for nati has already been 
explained for solar eclipse. They are added if in 
same direction and substracted if in different 
direction. 


Conjunction of Planets 643 


Verses 68-71 : Lambana correction 


At the time of conjunction, parama nati of 
the planet is multiplied by drggati and divided by 
trijya, and quotient is multiplied by jya of difference 
between planet with vitribha lagna and divided by 
trijya. Then we get sphuta lambana (parallax in 
east west direction). 


When planet is east of vitribha lagna, sphuta 
lambana is added to planet, otherwise substracted. 


After larnbana correction, some difference 
comes in the longitudes of the planets. Then again 
conjunction time is corrected when the longitudes 
are same. For this new conjunction time, again 
lambana is calculated and, new conjunction time 
is found, when they will be equal in longitude. 
After repeated processes, we get the true conjunc- 
tion time. 

Notes : Parama nati of the planet is found as 
above section. Drgjya is the distance of planet from 
vertical direction and nati will be propartional to 
it. Its value in ecliptic is proportionately known 


from distance of planet from vitribha. This has 


. been explained in solar eclipse. 


Ge Ee anes ee ote 


Verses 72 : Conmjunction of graha and 
nakSatra - 


Since nakSatras are very far from earth, their 


- Speed and parallax both are zero. Hence, its 
conjunction with a planet is calculated only from 


the speed of graha. 


. Verses 73-75 : Bheda yuddha 


Since larnbana and nati are very difficult, this 


Correction. is done only for finding bheda yuddha, 


644 Siddhanta Darpana 


when bimba of one planet enters the bimba of 
another. For other conjunctions this is not neces- 
sary. 

Bheda of sun by budha or Sukra should be 
calculated like other conjunctions. When they are 
moving in opposite direction (budha or Sukra is 
vakri), then from sum of the gati and when both 
are margi, by difference of gati, we calculate the. 
conjunction. According to the respective sizes of 
bimba, times of sparSa etc can be found. 


Sara of vakri budha or éukra is very little so 
vedha of sun is done by them. In this case time 
of sparga etc is found from sum of speeds. 


Verses 76 : Moon and star planets - 


Moon is corrected for nati and lambana and 
its vedha by graha bimba is calculated like sun. 


Verses 77-90 - Samagama of moon and star 
planets— When a tara graha and candra have equal 
longitude (raSi, amSa and kala), then for finding 
their larnbana, madhya gati of moon (790/35) is 
divided by 14. Quotient (56/28) is reduced by 
lambana of tara graha found from its parama nati. 
This will be maximum value of nati difference of 
moon and that planet. 


Parama nati difference is kept at two places. 
It is multiplied by 60 (to make it vikala) and divided 
by madhyama gati difference of moon and the 
planets. If the planet is vakri, then it is divided 
by sum of gati. This is time of parama larhbana in 
ghati etc; It is multiplied by drggati of that time 
(vitribha ganku) and divided by trijya (3438). Result 
is made asu. It is assumed kala and its jya is called 
‘para’. 


Conjunction of Planets 645 


Bhuja and koti jya of difference between moon 
and lagna is found. Difference of bhuja jya and 
para is squared and added to square of koti jya. 
Square root of the sum will be chaya karna. Kotijya 
is multiplied by para and divided by chaya karna. 
Result will be madhyama larhbana. 

Madhyama lambana is multiplied by difference 
of madhyama gati and divided by difference of 
sphuta gati if the tara graha is margi. If tara graha 
is vakri, then madhya lambana is multiplied by 
sum of madhya gati and divided by sum of sphuta 
gati. Result is spasta larmbana. 


This larnbana is substracted from moon, if it 
is east (more) of vitribha lagna, otherwise added. 
Then the new time of conjunction is found when 
moon and graha have the same lipta. The larmbana 
-asu is multiplied by second vitribha Sanku and 
‘divided by Ist vitribha Sanku (before lambana 
correction). After correction of moon by this sphuta 
lambana asu, we find the sphuta madhya kala of 
‘conjunction. 


According to method of solar eclipse, 
drkkSepa of vitribha lagna at mid conjunction time 
is found. Its 1/513 is added and divided by 61 to 
find nati of moon. 


By method of solar eclipce, from nata jya of 
vitribha lagna, Sara and aksamé&a valana are found. 
‘When Sara of moon and graha are in same 
direction, difference is taken, when they are in 
‘different direction they are added. This sara will 
be useful for diagram (parilekha) of samagama. 
When graha is south from moon, Sara will be 
yamya, when it is north, Sara will be saumya. 


646 Siddhanta Darpana 


For tara graha, moon is chadaka (eclipser) 
because it is closest to earth. Since moon has more 
speed, sparSa of its bithba by the planet will be 
in east and mok&a will be in west. 


After doing ayana drkkarma of graha, graha 
and nakSatra conjunction is calculated from nati 
corrected Sara. 


Notes : The methods are exactly similar to 
methods of solar eclipse. Only difference is that 
the tara graha can be vakri also, when sum of gati 
is used instead of their difference. 


Verses 91-96 - Parilekha 


Like diagram of eclipse, we draw the 
manaikya vrtta (circle with radius as sum of semi 
diameters) inside khagola vrtta with radius 57°/18’ 
angula = 3438’ radius. From same centre moon 
circle is drawn. For valana of khavrtta, sparsika 
valana in east and mauksika valana in west is given 
in their own directions. From valanagra, we draw 
a line to the centre of moon, called diksitra. 


From the points where diksitra cuts 
manaikya, we give Sara at the time of sparsa and 
mok§a in their direciton (north or south). The line 
from garagra points (end points of Sara) to centre 
of moon, cuts the moon bimba on two points 
indicating entry and exit points of graha or 
nakSatra. 

In conjunction of nakSatra and moon, sanku 
of vitribha lagna is multiplied by 100 and divided 
by 231 to give jya of parama lambana or ‘para’. 

Like moon and star/planet conjunction, vakrt 
budha and éukra enter the sun disc from east side 


Conjunction of Planets 647 


and exit from west side. Since sun has no Sara, 
the gara of only budha or Sukra is the total sara 
and direction of this will be the direction of éara. 
Disc of sun will be in centre of samasa vrtta (circle 
with radius as sum of semi diameters). 

Notes : The discription in parilekha, chapter 
10 is sufficient to understand this. 


Verses 97-106 : Observing shadow of planets 


From rays of star planets like mangala, we 
.cannot see the shadow of a 12 angula sanku. 
‘Hence, a mirror is kept on the shadow end point 
and Sanku top is seen in mirror. Exactly at shadow 
fend point, the planet and Sanku end are seen in 
vone direction. 

On a plane level surface, we keep a vertical 
peas of 5 hands hight. In it 12 divisions are 

‘marked, each being 1 angula. Sanku will be strong 
pand straight and its surface will be cylinderical. 


As explained in Triprasnadhikara, from the 
nata kala of the planet at desired time, we find 
the shadow length of 12 angula Sanku. With that 

; Semi diameter a circle is drawn with sanku centre 
fe as the centre. Direction points are marked (earlier 


pin day time) and from the centre, lines are drawn 
jin east west and north south direction. 
: Then the kranti jya of graha at the desired 
rtime is multiplied by chaya karna and divided by 
Membaiyé. Quotient will be karna vrttagra in angula. 
+E will be substracted from palabha for north kranti 
ef the planet and added for south kranti to get 
i bhuja of shadow in angula (its distance in north 
‘Or south direction from sanku). On north south 
‘Ene through centre, we mark a point at distance 


648 Siddhanta Darpana 


of chayagra bhuja in the opposite direction of 
inclination of the planet. From shadow length 
(chaya) square, we substract the square of chaya 
bhuja and take the square root. Result is dharatala 
ganku which is called koti also. When planet is in 
west half of sky, koti is given east from the end 
point of chaya bhuja. At the point of shadow circle 
where it cuts, shadow end will lie. At this point 
a tube will be kept in direction of the Sanku top 
and we see from below. Or a mirror is kept and 
its reflection is seen. 


Figure 9 (a) Figure 9 (b) ; 

Notes - In figure (a) ENWS is circle with 
radius of shadow length. Current direction of 
shadow is OP. OP is length of shaodw, ON; is 
chaya bhuja, N:P is its koti. Hence OP? = ON)? + 
N:P?. ONz’ is palabha, i.e. shaodw at the time of 
equinox midday. The difference with bhuja is karna 
vrttagra, NiN2’ = ON: - ON2 

NiN2 = aS Sin 6’ where 6’ = spasta kranti,

g@ = akSdimSa. This is explained in 

Triprasnadhikara 


Conjunction of Planets 649 


In figure (b) OC is Sanku of 12 angula length. 
OP is chaya and PC is chaya karna. Thus PC is 
in direction of planet at G. If we keep a tube in 
PC direction, planet can be seen from P end. By 
a long dark tube we can see a planet in day time 
also as scattered day light is absorbed by inner 
surface of tube and only light of planet is seen 
which is not obstructed. Alternatively, by keeping 
a horizontal mirror at P we can see planet by 
keeping eye in direction of PK, Here PK makes 


, same angle with vertical PC’ as CPC’ = 6? in 
; Opposite direction.

Verses 107-108 : Seeing the yuti 


At the time of yuti (conjunction of planets) 
we keep two Sanku at the distance of Sara difference 


~ and from the same point P we can see both planets 
through tube or a mirror. Result of different types 


of yuti are given in books of sarnhita (like Brhat 


 samhita of Varahamihira). 


‘Verse 109 : Increased size of vrtta bimba - 


Here, the birnba of planets decribed or birnbas 
of stars to be told later, are very bright, hence 
they are seen 16 times more lighted than moon. 
At the time of sunrise and sunset, their discs are 


- as bright as moon, hence their bimba value has 


been stated as 4 times = V16 larger. Thus the real 


» angular diameter is 1/4 of the seen diameter.

light (4000 to 8000 angstrom = 10° cm units). This 
is Raleigh criterion. Thus for visible light, when 
pupil is 1.5 mm diameter in day time, we cannot 
see two points which are separated by les than 
about 1’ kala. In night time when pupil is bigger 
it will be about 20” vikala. Thus the angular 
diameters of outer planets are smaller than the 
limit of resolution of eye and even when they are 
separated, they appear together. This explains as 
to why separation upto 1 kala is called samagama 
and only for larger separation, they are really seen 
separate. 


Thus at the time of conjunction, the effective 
diameters of planets are seen bigger. 


‘ (3) Other reasons of fluctuation are scattering 
of light, and fluctuations in atmosphere, which are 
almost same for both the nearby stars or planets. 
The stars are so distant, that their angular diameter 
is zero even after seeing through largest telescopes. 
Their diameter of conjunction time is seen much 
more than 215 times due to diffraction. 


Verse 110 : Solar eclipse due to sukra 


To find eclipse of sun due to venus, their 
bimnba and size of other tara graha is stated. In 
kali year 4975 (1874 AD) there was a solar eclipse 
due to Sukra in vrScika raSi (i.e. in Nov.- Dec. 
month). Then sukra bimba was seen as 1/32 of 
solar bimba which is equal to 650 yojana. Thus it

His well proved that bitnba of Sukra and planets is 
fis we smaller then sun. 


Verses 111-112 : Prayer and conclusion 


May Lord Jagannatha remove our ignorance, 
who defeats beauty of blue clouds by his blue light 
‘and lives on sea coast. 


Thus ends the eleventh chapter describing 
conjunction of planets in Siddhanta Darpana 
«written for tallying calculation and observation and 
education of students by Sri Candragekhara, born 


“an famous royal family of Orissa.

CONJUNCTION WITH STARS 


Verse 1 - Scope — To know the conjunction 
of planets with nakSatras, the longitude and 
latitude of identifying star in each nakSatra starting 
with aSvini, shape of nakSatras and number of stars 
in it and bimba of yogatara (identifying star) is 
stated first.

These are the modern positions and names 
of identifying stars. Nirayana longitude of Citra 
(a-Virginis) was fixed as 180° at 285 AD to fix the 
nirayana position accurately in zero ayanamSa year. 
Now it has become 179°59’ due to negative proper 
motion of citra. 


Verse 12-24 : Verses 12-14 give the number 
of stars in each nakSatra. Verses 15-18 give the 
shape of each naksatra. 


Verses 19-22 give the direction of yogatara 
within the nakSatra (this can be known from their 
latitude and position in nakéatra also given in 
previous table). Verses 23-24 give the diameter of 
yoga tara in vikala. Actually the diameters are 
almost zero even by talescope viewing, they are 
measures of visual magnitudes of brightness. The 
yogatara positions of 28 nakSatras including Abhijit 
according to siddhanta darpana in previous verses 
and the other details are given in chart form.

(2) Shape.of nakSatras have been decribed 
differently by different authorities. Actually, it is 
Only imagination and convention. 

(3) Longitudes and latitudes also differ slightly 
according to different authorities. 


656 Siddhanta Darpana 


(4) It may be seen that many yagataraa do 
not come within extent of their nakSatra. Hence 
three nakSatras are divided into purva and uttara 
part. In unequal division of nakSatras, most of the 
nakSatras have yogatara in their extent. 


(5) It has already been stated that diffraction 
and partly scattering of light in atmlsphere spreads 
the point like stars. Bright star has bigger spread 
as, greater spread of diffraction ring remains 
visible. 


Verses 25-40 - Other stars - 
Now many other stars are described. 


(1) Lubdhaka (Sirius) - It is brightest star south 
of punarvasu with birnba of 20 vikala, dhruva 77° 
and dhruva prota kranti 40°. Surya siddhanta name 
of this star is lubdhaka. Bhaskara II has given its 
longitude (polar) as 86°. It is 8.6 light years away 
and brightest star. 


(2) Mrgavyadha - There is another small star 
south of punarvasu. Surya siddhanta and Lalla 
have called this same as lubdhaka, but it is different 
star. Its dhruva is 56°, south Sara 32° and bimba 
is 10 vikala It may be identified with Orion, which 
is also called hunter is greek stories borrowed from 
Egypt. 

Its south latitude is same as south latitude of 
Magadaskara (now Malagasi) an island in south 
east direction of Africa - hence this island was 
called Mrga or Harina dvipa 


(3) Ilvala - This is a group of three stars 
between mrgavyadha and ardra. Its middle star is 


Conjunction with Stars 657 


yogatara, whose dhruva is 61° and south Sara 
23°30’. 

(4) Hutabhuk - According to sirya siddhanta, 
its dhruva is 52° and north Sara is 8°. 

(5) Brahmahrdaya - According to surya 
siddhanta, its dhruva is 52° and north Sara 30°. 

(6) Prajapati - It is 5° east brahmahrdaya 
whose dhruva is 57° and north Sara is 38°. (Sarya 
siddhanta) 
Modern observations have indicated the fol- 
lowing positions (by author). 

(4) Hutabhuk - Dhruva 58°15’, Sara 5°15’ north 
birnba 6” vikala 

(5) Brahmahrdaya - Dhruva 56°, north Sara 
23°, birhba 16” 

(1) Lubdhaka is now called prajapati. 

(7) Apamvatsa - This is 5° north from citra. 

(8) Apa - This is 6° north of Apamwvatsa. It 
is also called apyavasu. 

Dhruva of both (7) and (8) above are equal 
to citra. North sara of (7) is 2°50’ and (8) is 8°50’. 

(9) Agastya - Its dhruva is 95° and south Sara 
is 75°. Its dhruva becomes sphuta after doing 
ayandméa correction. Its bimba is 18” vikala. 

(10) Yama - Its dhruva is 22°, Sara is 66°. 
south and bimba is 8”. 

Siirya siddhanta has stated dhruva of agastya 
‘as 90°. This was the value at the time of writing 
that book when 121 years were remaining in satya 
yuga. In Kali era 4251, Bhaskara H has stated its 


658 Siddhanta Darpana 


dhruva to be 87°. He has stated dhruva of 
punarvasu as 93° and Agastya 6° less i.e. 87°. At 
the time of siddhanta darpana, it is 17°30’ west 
from punarvasu i.e. 90°15’ - 17°30’ = 72°45’. From 
agastya dhruva 95°, on substracting ayanamSa 22°, 
we get the same value 73° approximately. The 
change of agastya dhruva from 87° at the time of 
siddhanta siromani when ayanaméa was 11°30’ to 
mithun 13° (73°) is the change in 719 years (1869 
AD). ° 

‘Notes : AyanarmSa correction is not needed 
when the distances have always been measured 
with respect to fixed stars. There may be some 
error in identification of stars. Otherwise relative 
motion of stars is very little and _ negligible 
compared to ayana movement. Opinions differ 
regarding correct identifications of these stars with 
current greek names used. Modern names of 
yogatara have already been given. Agastya is 
canopus, apamvatsa is @-virginis and Apa - 6 vir- 
ginis, Agni or hutabhuk in f tauri. Prajapati is 
B aurigae, Brahma is a aurigae. 


Verses 41-56 - Saptarsi mandala 


' Since saptarsi mandala (great bear) is moving, 
its dhruva has not been stated by earlier 
astronomers. Still, I state their position, based on 
my experience. 

In north direction saptarsi mandala spread in 
east west direction like a bullock cart is very 


prominent in the sky. It has been most reverred 
in samhita and purana. 


Conjunction with Stars 659 


Within this group, there is an upward raised 
line towards east. Marici is in its front. Behind it 
Vaéistha is with Arundhati. Still west from Vasistha 
is Angira. 

After that, is a quadrilateral. In its ig4na kona 
(north east), lies Atri. South from it is Pulastya 
and west from Pulastya in Pulaha. North of Pulaha 
is Kratu. The great circle joining Pulaha and Kratu, 
cuts ecliptic in some point, the nakSatra or rasi of 
that point is considered the rasi of saptarsi. 


At present Pulaha and Kratu are in 21° of 
simha i.e. 3rd quarter or putrva-phalguni. 13 
kalarn$a east from them is Pulastya. 

Atri is 5 kalarn$a east from Pulaha, 9 kalamsa 
east from Atri is Angira, 8 kalam&a east from Angira 
lies Vasistha and 8 kalamSa east from VaéSistha is 
Marici. 

Arundhati is a very small star, east from 
Vagistha which is barely visible and can be seen 
with telescope. This is not giver of good or bad 
omen, like the seven main stars. Its birnba is 1 
vikala. Bimnba of Atri is 3 vikala, and all others are 
8 vikala. Mutual distance between these stars is 
same and equal to 10 pala kalam’sa. 


This 10 pala is multiplied by 1800 and divided 
by rising time of that rasi at equator. The quotient 
is added to the dhruva of Pulaha or Kratu (simha 
21° = 141°). We get the dhruva in ra$i etc for 
other stars. East west angular distance (along 
ecliptic) of saptarsi is 43°, but due to its position 
in sayana kanyaé-and tula, it appears 46° (in risinz 
time at equator). 


660 ; Siddhanta Darpang 


Distance from ecliptic along dhruva prota vrtta 
(great circle through dhruva, not kadamba .- pole 
of ecliptic) in north direction are - 


Kratu 56°, Pulaha 51°, Pulastya 53°, Atri 59° 
Angira 60°, Vagistha 62° and Marici 60°. 

If Sara of VaSisttha from kranti is fixed, then 
in the end of even quadrant, it wil be 4° from 
dhruva (North Sara 62° + kranti at end of even 
quadrant 24° = 86° i.e. 4° from dhruva at 90°), 
Even if sphuta kranti of saptarsi remains same, 
their sara changes with change in raéi. ;

magnitudes are given below -

More visual magnitude indicates lesser bright- 
ness, thus Atri is least bright and farthest,’ hence 
its bimba vikalé has been indicated small. 
Arundhati is a small star, below Vaé&istha called 
Alcor (magnitude 5). Mizar (VaSistha) itself is a 
double star when seen from telescope. It appears 
that Atri has faded now but earlier, it was equally 
bright. 


(2) Mythology : Callisto was attendent of 
goddess Juno but was more beautiful. To protect 
her from jealosy, Callisto was turned into bear by 
god Jupiter. When her son Arcas, thought her a 
bear and wanted-to kill her, he was also turned 
into bear (ursa minor) 


According to Puranas, Saptarsis are mental 
sons of Brahma. There is a separate set of saptarsi 
for each of 14 manu periods of which 7 are yet to 
come. Rsi and RkSa have been used for star, sage 
Or bear also. Hence ursa in Persian means saint, 
in Greek it means bear. Like this bear around north 


662 Siddhanta Darpang 


pole, Russian bear exists. Russian was Rsika and 
it is land of bear. Proverbially Russia is called 
Russian bear. Rsi denoted sage and bear as both 
had long hairs. Hence the name great bear came. 

(3) Motion of Saptarsis : Only Vatesvara 
siddhanta chapter 1 verse 15 has given the number 
of revolutions of saptarsi which is 1692 in a yuga. 


On that basis, Karana sara of VateSvara has 
given a method to calculate movement of saptarsis, 
as quoted by Albiruni (India I, page 392) - 


Multiply the basis (i.e. years elapsed since 
beginning of Saka 821) by 47 and add 68000 to the 
product. Divide the sum by 10,000. Quotient 1s 
position of saptarasi in raSis etc. 

According to this formula, saptarsi has a 
motion of 47 signs per 10,000 years which is 
equivalent to 1692 revolution in 43,20,000 years, as 
stated above. 


The position in Saka year 821 (Kali year 4000 
was) 

1692 x 12 x 4000 . : ,000 . 

~43,20,000. signs = 1 revolution + 10,000 signs 

This accounts for the addition of 68000 in 
formula. 

(4) The stars of the constallation of the saptarsi 
do not have a motion relative to nakSatras. So the 
statement of revolution is not correct. This appears 
to be the reason why many standard astromers 
like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta,. Sripati, Bhaskaras | 
and II, Surya siddhanta etc do not deal with the 
subject at all, as being outside the pale of 
astronomy. Therefore, Kamalakara was constrained 


pad 


. Conjunction with Stars 663 


to say in his Siddhanta Tattva Viveka, Bhagraha 
yutyadhikara, verses 25-36 - 

“Sage Sakalya has given the motion of the 
sages with their positions in his time. Sarya and 
others who explain the nature of the celestial 
sphere in their works do not give it, and therefore, 
the theory cannot be sustained astronomically. 
Even today, this motion mentioned in the samhitas 
is not observed by astronomers. Therefore, the 
seven real sages who are the presiding deities (of 
these stars) are only to be supposed to be moving 
unobserved by men, for the prediction of the fruits, 
thereof.” 


But the motion has been accepted as a fact 
by certain common people and authors of the 
Puranas, and an era called Laukika era by the 
people of Kashmir region and saptarsi ‘era by the 
puranas have been founded on this theory. 

Mahabhdrata mentions, that when Yudhisthira 
ascended the throne, Saptarsis were in magha 
nakSatra. 

Vayu purana chapter 99, tells that saptarsi’s 
remain for hundred years in one nakSatra. Hence 
they complete the round of 27 nakéatras in 2700 


7 divya years. However, same purana chapter 57, 


tells that saptarsi nakSatra is of 3030 human years. 


‘=. Hence human year appears to be taken as 12 sideral 
' revolution of moon. Divya year here means 1 solar 


year. 
2700 solar years = 2700 X 365.256263 days for 


*  Sidereal years 


664 Siddhanta Darpana 


2700 X 365.256263 ; 
= lunar years sidereal 
12_x_29.321661 


= 3007.968 years 


Varaha Mihira has written in Brhatsamhita 
13/3, that according to Vrddha Garga, Saptarsis 
were in Magha in the rule of Yudhisthira. Raja 
Tarangini of Kalahana has followed this era only 
in writing ancient history. 

(5) Explaination : Kamalaakara has explained 
that it has no relation with astronomy and it is 
‘only for astrological predictions. Siddhanta Darpana 
has tried to justify the movement of saptarsis on 
._ basis of their measurement of position on dhruva 
prota vrtta on ecliptic. Normally kadambaprota 
vrtta is used for ecliptic and dhruva prota for 
equator. This causes difference and has explained 
_ the difference in terms of ayandméa. His calculation 
of difference from Bhaskaracarya time is based on 
ayana - movement. However, this will have a cycle 
-of 26000 years and not of 2700 years of saptarsi 
era. Hence Candrasekhara has not mentioned the 
saptarsi era but has vaguely tried to justify its 
movement. 


My ren is based on basis of vedanga 
jyotista which was current in Mahabharata period, 
Rk jyotisa has a cycle of 19 years in which 5 years 
are of samvatsara type (starting between Magha 
sukla 1 to Magha Sukla 6.) Yajus jyotis starts with 
5 year cycle of 366 days each, but this also becomes 
equivalent to 19 year cycle with 6 kSaya samnvatsara 
in 5 cycles of 5 years each. P.V. Holey has assumed 
a bigger yuga of 19 X 8 + 8 = 160 years because 


Conjunction with Stars 665 


it gives very little error, but has not explained the 
mechanism of arranging the last eight years. This 
is not corroborated any internal evidence in the 
text. 

However, saptarsi era was very much in use 
and was accepted in the calendar system. This 
appears to be based on system of naming a century 
(100 solar years) on a nakSatra in same way as we 
name every guru varsa or other solar years on 
basis of Ist week day of the civil year. Thus, we 

‘can name the century on basis of first nakSatra of 
, moon (or may be sun) in a century, if the vedic 
: yuga system is followed. Then bigger yuga should 
‘be 19 X 5 + 5 years = 100 years instead of 160 = 
: 19X8+8 years. Thus in a century, we can take last 
7 5 years as the first 5 years of the 19 years Rk cycle 
;.Or 5 years first cycle of yajusa jyotisa. In taking 
, Yajusa cycle, the 19 year cycle doesn’t break and 
in sixth cycle first 5 years are subcycle which make 
a century. It can also be seen that all cycles of 19 
| year start with Sravistha but after five years of 
 yajus cycle, sixth year starts with Satabhisaj which 
pis the next star. Thus on completion of 100 years, 
t.dn this calender, moon gains one nakéatra in this 
»@alender. Thus each sucessive century will start 
with one nakéatra later, which will be saptarsi 
Makéatra or nakéatra of the century. 

_ Sri Holey has opined that Rk jyotisa was 
definitely written before 2884 B.C. According to 
traditions vedic texts or puranas were written 
thin 300 years of Mahabharata war. Thus it 
y indicates the calender system fixed in 
dhisthira time who had really started an era.

666 Siddhanta Darpana 


That time year started with Magha sukla pakSa, 
hence saptarsis were assumed to be in magha to 
start with. 


(6) Mutual distance between stars of saptarsi 
mandala is not equal as stated here. 


Verses 57-59 : Kranti of circumpolar stars 

Sphuta kranti of yama and Agastya is always 
same. Kranti of nakSatras starting with Asvini keeps 
changing. Kranti of saptarsi mandala is fixed 
according to some, but changes according to others. 

Earlier astronomers have assumed motion of 
saptarsi mandala as 8 kala per year from east to 
west. But I (author) have not seen such gati. Hence 
I do not agree to it. 


Ayana sanskara of yama, Agastya and saptarsi 
mandala has been instructed to be done in opposite 
direction. This is valid for author’s time only (1869 
AD). 

Notes (1) Ayana sarmskara is needed because, 
here dhruvaméSa have been given for yogataras and 
other stars. As stated earlier, Candrasekhara has 
assumed oscillatory motion of ayana, and according 
to this, the present backward movement will 
change after 2200 AD. 


(2) 8 Kala movement of saptarsi is 800 Kala 
or 1 nakSatra in a century whcih has been stated 
by VateSvara. This has not been accepted by author 
correctly. 


(3) Circumpolar stars are near dhruva (pole 
star) and appear to move round it. This is true 
for south polar region also. This depends on local 
latitude of the place. Day length of a planet or 


Conjunction with Stars 667 


star increases by carajya which is increase in half 
day length for north kranti. It is decrease for 
southern kranti. 

Increase in half day = Carajya 

= R tan 6 tan @ (6 =spasta kranti, @= latitude) 

If this is equal or greater than R, then the 
increase is equal to half day of equator itself and 
there will be no night i.e. the star will never set. 

For this tan ¢ tan 6 >| 

Thus for any star with north kranti, 

it is circum polar, if 

tand > cot ¢ 

Similarly for south kranti, also, if 

Tan 6 > cot @ 

then the star will never rise. 

Verses 60-62 : North pole star (dhruva tara) 
has birhba of 4 vikala. This is not the real position 
of dhruva i.e. pole of equator and dhruva prota 
is not drawn through it. The seen dhruva tara is 
1°24’ away from surface centre of equator. Hence, 
when revati naksatra comes on meridian i.e. 
dhruvatara at beginning of mesa, appears 84 Kala 
above the pole. 

When Sravana, punarvasu nakSatra are on 
yamyottara, dhruva rises above horizon equal to 
local akSamSa. Again, when citra naksatra comes 
on yamyottara, dhruva in 84 kala nata from its 
kendra. 

Notes : Polaris ( Ursae minoris) is a star of 
second magnitude and is 58’ Kala away from 
celestial pole in west direction in 1950 AD. Celestial 


668 Siddhanta Darpana 


pole is moving towards polaris upto 2105 AD when 
it will be only 30’ away, then will begin to recede 
from it. 

It may be seen that Draco or dragon group 
is pole of ecliptic i.e. pole of solar system. Thus 


Polasis 1900 AO 


Figure 2 - centre of-this circle is ecliptic pole 
proverbially sun as visnu is under draco or 
Sesanaga with 3-1/2 turns. Base of human body 
cakras is also called serpent of 3-1/2 turns 
(Kundalini). Thus it was called draco is Chaldia 
' and dragon of 3-1/2 turns in China also. 

Since pole star is 84 kala from pole to mesa 
0°, or revati nakSatra, it appears above north pole 
when revati is on meridian and below 84 kala when 
nakSatra 180° opposite citra is on meridian. When 
nakSatras 90° from these are on meridian, (Sravana 
or punarvasu), altitude of north star will be same . 
as pole (though east or west by 84 kala). 

Verse 63 - Similarly south pole star also 
appears to move around south pole like a bullock 
rotating the oilseed crusher in a circle. 


Conjunction with Stars — 669 


Note - There is no conspicous star near south 
pole. Octans group contains south pole, ‘but its 
brightest star v is of 3.7 magnitude and official 
pole star o (sigma octanis) has 5.5 magnitude. It 
is in line with bigger arm of south crogs group. 

Verses 6 : Three measurements - Three 
angular measurements (west to east) are used - 
. Man&rhéa, Kalaméa and KSetrarhéa. Rising times of 
rasis being different, KSetramSa and Kalaméa are. 
different. After one revolution, both complete 360°. 
'Manamsa. and Kalaméa are same on equator, but 
difference between them increases as we go further 
- from equator, in north or south direction. : 


Notes : The different measures depend on 
different system of coordinates shown in figure 3..- 


Figure 3 - System of Coordinates 
P = Celestial Pole (Dhruva) 
QE = Celestial equator’ i 
K = Pole of equator (Kadamba) 


670 Siddhanta Darpana 


YL’ = Plane of the ecliptic 

Y= First point of sayana mesa (vernal equinox) 

L,L’ = First points of saéyana makara and 
karka/winter and summer solstice). 

S = a heavenly body 

PS = A great circle through P,S, cutting 
equator at Q and ecliptic at B. 

Y Q = Right ascension = a = KalarmSa (time 
is measured along equator rotation) 1 Kala at 
equator = 1 asu, R.A. of 1 hour = 15° at equator. 

QS = Declination = Kranti 6 

KS = Great circle through K, S, cutting ecliptic 
at C. 

Y C = Celestial longitude = 4 = KSetramSa or 
bhogarhSa 

CS = Celestial latitude = 6 = Sara or viksepa 

Y B = Polar longitude or dhruvaka = 1 

BS = Polar latitude = vikSepa (dhruva) = d 

Polar longitude (dhruvarhsa) and _ latitude 
(vikSepa) have been used only in this chapter to 
indicate position of stars as we observe them with 
reference to fix position of pole. 

W’'FE’ is a circle parallel to equator in north at 
ange 6, latitude of the circle Y. M = @ where M 
is point on P corresponding to mesa 0°. Absolute 
length of arc between M and corresponding 
position Q’ is almost same as great circle between 
them. The great circle between M and Q’ is 
manamsa 

Arc MD = Arc Y Q. cos 6 


671 


Though the angular difference between MQ’ 
and YQ is same, manarhSa is less. It becomes 
lesser, if 6 increases i.e. we go farther from equator. 

Kalama is the distance along equator, hence 
it is equal to rising time of raSis (at equator). 


Verses 66-68 : Saptarsi measures 


Stars in saptarsi are taken from east to west 
along declining longitude (desantara), not in north 
south direction (akS4msa) (Second. half of verse 66) 

Here difference between dhruva vikSepa of 
pulaha and kratu is only 5°. Similarly, east west 
difference manarnSa between kratu and marici is 

:25° and difference in vikSepa is only 0°30’. Sphuta 
“kranti can be calculated. 


- Verses 69-70 : Conversion of three measures 


Sphuta kranti and dyujy4 are calculated. Sum 
of two dyujya for kranti vrtta and visuva vrtta is 
made half - it is called hara. 

Manaméa multiplied by trijya and divided by 
hara gives kéetraméa (degree on ecliptic) 

KSetramsa multiplied by rising time of its rasi 
and divided by 180° gives kalaméa. This way 
‘kalarhSa of marici and kratu can be found. By 

. Feverse process, manaméa can be found from this 
Sa. 

Notes : (1) In notes of previous section, vide 

figure (3) manarhga is measured along W’E’ parallel 

=f0 equator which is diurnal circle of a star of this 
Geclination. It is easier to convert it to kalaméa as 
plained in the note, or in spastadhikara for 

:€alculation of day length. 

Manaméa M = H cos 6 


peneret 


672 Siddhanta Darpana 
(where H is kalarnsa, 6 is kranti) 
_H.Reosé _ H Dyujya 
7 R ~ Trijya 
However, oO here is measured along dhruva 

prota SQ instead of SC line. Thus length along 

ecliptic is reduced due to lesser rising time of B 

compared to C, and increases due to oblique length 

of B. Thus instead of dyujya we take average 
dyujya and trijya. 

Hence Kalaméa H = aa Tuya 

>(dyuiya + trijya) 


(2) KSetraméa is converted to kalaméa as per 
_ the following approximate ratio used for calculation 


of lagna - . : 
Rising time of rasi _ Rising time for ksetrarsa 
Rasi (1800 kala) | Kalama in kala 


Rising time of kSetramsa is measured along 
equator, hence its asu is equal to kala of kalarnéa. 
Verses 71-75 : Variation of kalarnéa and 
manaméa- Dhruva star moves in a circle of 360°, 
hence its ménaréa 
_ 360_x 84 
3438 
i.e. 1° of this circle is equal to pa at of 848” 
" on.equator. | 
_ Due to change in kranti, if shape of septate 
remains fixed, then with change in kranti, their 
rising time will also change with change in dyujya. 
Since k4lantara of saptarsis is fixed with 
_ change in kranti then, east west distance ‘will 


= 8’48” 


Conjunction with Stars 673 


change with change in akSamsa. If kranti is fixed, 
then kalaméa will be constant. 


If kSetramSa is constant, then kalamga and 
manaméa wil vary. Like kalamSa and bhagaméa, 
relation between kalamSa and manaméfa also can 
be found. 


Verses 76-79 : Sara of naksatras 


The dhruvaméa of nakSatras given here are 
already with ayana drkkarma. Their Sara also is 
sphuta i.e. in dhruva prota vrtta. 


But Sara of graha is asphuta, i.e. in kadamba 
prota vrtta. After drkkarma, it will become Sara in 
direction of dhruva prota vrtta of stars. 


Even when the kadmba prota Sara of nakSatras 
is same, their kranti in dhruva prota circle will be 
_ different due to east west difference. Hence the 
length of their day and night will be different (as 
the semi diameter of diurnal circle - dyujya, 
depends on distance from equator in dhruva prota 
direction). 

If the sphuta kranti of a nakSatra is more than 
the co-latitude of a place, the nakSatra will be 
always rising at that place (it will be always seen 
there above horizon). If the south sphuta kranti is 
more than the co-latitude of the place, it will never 
rise above horizon, i.e. always set. 


Notes : Dhruvaméa has already been ex- 
plained. This has been used for indicating position 
of stars because it is easier to observe them with 
reference to north pole. 


Circumpolar stars have already been ex- 
plained. For them, carajya = R tan 6 tan ® is 


674 Siddhanta Darpana 


bigger than R, radius of equator, hence day length 
will be more than day night value. 


Thus tan éd tang > 1 

or tan 6d > cot P= tan (90° - ¢) 

Here, dis kranti, ® is akSamSa, hence 90° 
-® is lambarnSa. 

Thus d> 90° - ® 


Then the star will be always rising if kranti 
is bigger than lambarhéa. 


Similarly for south kranti, if carajya is bigger 
than R, day length wil be less than 0, i.e. the star 
will not rise. This means the same condition. 


Physically, we can understand it, because 
north pole is above horizon at angle equal to local 
akSamsa. Distance from north pole to the star is 
90° - d which should be always less than ® if the 
star is to remain above horizon. Thus @> 90° - 
dor 0> 90° -® 

i.e. Kranti > lambamésa 


Similarly, south pole is ®*° below south 
horizon, A star with south kranti will be 90° - 6 
away from south pole. If this distance 90° - 6 is 
_less than @ , then the star will never rise. 


Verses 80-84 - Conjunction of graha and 
nakSatra 


Ayana drkkarma is done for the involved 
graha and difference of dhruvaméa of graha and 
nakSatra is found. The difference in kala is divided 
by sphuta gati of the graha in kala to get result 
in day, ghati etc. If dhruva of graha is less than 
nakSatra, the conjunction will occur after that 
interval, if it is more, then the yoga has already 


Conjunction with Stars 675 


occurred, that period before. When graha is vakri 
(retrograde) then opposite order will happen (i.e. 
if graha dhruva is less, conjunction has happened 
earlier). For this conjunction time, we again find 
difference in sphuta dhruva of graha and nakSatra 
and get the more accurate value of conjunction 
time. After successive approximations, we get the 
correct conjunction time. 


After that, sphuta kranti and cara of graha 
‘and nakSatra are found and cara is calculated. That 
_will give periods of their day and night. From that 
; we get the values of udaya and asta lagna of graha 
_ and nakSatra for their rising and setting times. As 
. explained before, the rising and setting times will 
} be when sphuta sun reaches those positions (of 
‘udaya and asta lagna). By finding difference of 
amhéa at rising setting times, we get the proportional 
' difference between graha and nakéSatra according 
' to the natakala (akSa drkkarma explained earlier) 
‘and again we revise the conjunction time, when 
‘longitude of graha and nakSatra are same after 
aksa drkkarma. 


As explained in conjunction of planets, we 
’ find the north south difference between graha and 
_ hak§atra from difference of their dhruva prota Sara. 
; Distance between discs is obtained by substracting 
: the semi diameter of bimbas from this distance. 
? Notes : The methods of ayana and 4kéa 
: drkkarma have already been explained in conjunc- 
ktion of planets. Here, the problem is simpler, 
¢ because the position of nakéatra is alrady stated 
corrected by aAyana drkkarma. Further, we need 
‘Mot calculate motion of nakéatra, because they are 
fixed. Here also conjunctions will be different 
according to distance between discs.

676 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verses 85-87 : Bheda of nakSatras 


Planets can enter the following 13 nakSatras 
(or do ‘bheda’ in their extent) 

Rohini, pusya, krttika, citra, magha, punar- 
vasu, anuradha, jyestha, visakha, revati, Satabhisaj, 
purvasadha, and uttarasadha. 

Other fifteen nakSatras are never crossed by 
planets (no bheda) 

Aévini, bharani, mrgasira, ardra, aSlesa, purva 
phalguni, uttaraphalguni, hasta, svati, mila, ab- 
hijit, Sravana, dhanistha, ptrva bhadra pada and 
uttara bhadrapada. 

Among crossed (bhedya) nakSatras, punarvasu 
is crossed by every planet. Pirvasadha, revati, and 
krttika are sometimes crossed. Others are less 
frequently crossed according to kranti of the graha. 

The planet whose south kranti in 14th degree 
of vrsa (44°) is more than 2°20’, can cross the 
rohini (in shape of Sakata - cart). 

When other nakSatras are pierced or entered 
by graha, it is confirmed by seeing with instrument. 

Shapes of nakSatras and planets moving north 
or south (beyond nakSatra) can be seen in 
Brhatsamhita by Varahamihira. 

Thus positions of many stars have been told 
which are famous since ancient times. There are 
many other stars in unlimited number. Nothing 
has been told here about nakSatras expect asvini 
etc. 

Notes (1) The graha move in ecliptic with little 
deviation according to their small Sara. Many 
nakSatras have large deviations, where the graha 


Conjunction with Stars 677 


will never reach. Punarvasu is lying on ecliptic, 
hence it is crossed by all planets. This was the 
nakgatra which determined start of solar year and 
malamasa in lunar year in vedic era. Hence its 
name is punarvasu, i.e. resettle or restart of year. 
13 nakSatras with less deviations can be crossed 
by planets. 


Sakata bheda - Rohini is in shape of cart i.e. 
Sakata, hence its bheda is called Sakata bheda. Its 
yogatara has 5°32’ south Sara, but northern most 
star has 2°35’ south Sara. According to siddhanta 
darpana it is 2°20’. Moon has Sara upto 5° hence 
it can easily cross rohini, but except budha and 
Sukra, no other graha has parama Sara of this 
value. Parama Sara of Sani is 2°29’39” hence Sanis 
Sakata bheda also appears impossible. But 
-Varadhamihira and Grahalaghava author have stated 
that Sakata bheda by Sani or mangala is very 
inauspicious. 


For siddhanta darpana value of Sanis Sara, its 
Sakata bheda is just possible (at 2°20’ south Sara). 

Mangala parama Sara is only 1°51’ according 
to siddhanta darpana and modern value but still 
less according to earlier texts. Vedha of rohini is 
possible only when south Sara is assumed less, 
which is not given in the texts. 

According to star catelogues 3000 to 6000 stars 
only can be seen with naked eye. There are about 
10% stars in our galaxy (of average size of sun) 
and there are about 10°) galaxies in universe. 


Verses 88-92 : Milky way - 


A fine circular way of dense fine stars in seen 
in the sky. This is called chaya patha, vaigvanara 


678 Siddhanta Darpana 


patha or abhijit marga (akaSa ganga also). It is 
proposed to describe it. 

This chaya patha is circular. It crosses ecliptic 
in Sayana karka and sayana makara beginning. 
Again it extends 60° north from sayana mesa to 
63° south from sayana tula. This crosses south part 
of punarvasu and goes southwards. Then it crosses 
mtla and Sravana nakSatras and goes upto centre 
of abhijit and Sravana. From there, it goes 
northwards. From beginning point of karka, it- goes 
north in two branches. This can be easily shown 
by diagram on a sphere. But in sky, it is seen half 
only at a time, hence it is impossible to show it. 


We can easily see ‘the stars (separately) of 
milky way with telescope. We can also see pusya 
nakSatra, black spots on sun, ‘water, mountains 
and trees on moon. Telescope can show phases of 
budha and sukra also like moon. Ring around Sani 
‘and many new planets and satelites can be seen 
with it. 

Notes : (1) The galaxy is called akasa ganga, 
chayapatha, visnupada etc. However vaisvanara 
patha is name of ecliptic according to many. The 
akaSa ganga, is the disc portion of galaxy, which 
is dense area with more number of stars, hence it 
looks like a way. The main portion of the galaxy 
is a disc of about 30 kilo persec width. It has two 
spiral arms and sun is located in inner arm as 
shown in figure 4(a) and 4(b). Sun is 10 Kpc away 
from centre i.e. about 2/3rd of the radius. 1 persec 
= 3.26 light years approximately, kilo = 1000. The 
galaxy rotates along the central plane of disc, which 
is almost parallel to orbits of solar system, central 


Conjunction with Stars 679 


portion rotates with uniform velocity almost like a 
rigid body. Stars in vicinity of sun in the disc are 
rotating with speed of about 220-250 kms/sec 
around galactic centre. Mass of galaxy inside sun’s 
orbit is 1.4 X 10% sun masses. Total energy of 
galaxy also is about 0.8 X 10" of sun. Mass of 
stars is 2X10“ gram. 


Figure 4a - Squctire of galaxy Figure 4b - Spiral arms 

The points in figure 4a represent some of the 
globular clustures. The position of sun is marked 
with the sign. Regions are marked 1 to 5 —- 1. The 
spherical subsystem, 2 - the disk, 3 -' the nucleus, 
4 - the layer of gas dust clouds, 5 - the corona. 
Radius of corona. is at least a dozen time the radius 
of galaxy. 

Figure 4(b) is disc of the galaxy. The nucleus 
is at centre C..Two spiral arms are spreading from 
it. Sun is in one of the arms. ©

Spread of galaxy can be 
seen from figure 4c. C is centre 
and. E is edge of disc. Sun is A

ZESC=@ is spread of disc. 
Tan@ = 3/4 hence @ = 60° ap- 
proximately. Figure 4C - spread of galaxy disc 


680 Siddhanta Darpana 


Central portion and the disc are dense and 
obscured by gases. It can be observed only by 
radio telescopes. It is believed that nucleus of 
galaxy contains huge black hole. Spherical subsys- 
tem contains old stars and globular clustures. They 
rotate with about 1/5th velocity of disc stars. Mass 
of corona is many times the mass of galaxy, but 
its density is much less and it does not emit any 
light. It is felt only by its gravitation. 


Centre of galaxy is in mila nakSatra. its old 
name was mila barhani - i.e. the root from which 
cosmic egg has spread. Probably its position as 
galectic centre was known. Linga purana also states 
that brahmd travelled for 30,000 years in cosmic 
Siva linga - this is the distance in light years from 
centre to sun. 


(2) A note about magnitude of stars - The 
visual magnitude of the stars has been made in a 
logarithmic scale. Star of Ist magnitude is 100 times 
bright than 6th magnitude i.e. increase of 5 
magnitude reduces the brightness by 1/100. Change 
in magnitude of 1 reduces the brightness by (100)? 
= 1/2.5 approx. Brightness in this scale is 


Sun - 26.5 i.e. 6,31,000 times moon 


Moon - 12.0 
Venus - 3.0 
Sirius -1.4 


Rohini + 1.0 Brahmahrdaya 0.1 


Absolute magnitude is measured by emitting 
power compared to sun in similar logarithmic scale.

Verses 93-94 : Prayer and conclusion 


May supreme lord Jagannatha destroy our 
forest of mishaps, who puts the golden ornaments 
to shame with his yellow dress, who is closely 
watching the creation and events in the cosmic 
egg, who is expert in dancing on hoods of Kaliya 
naga and who is radiant near tree of desires. 


Thus ends the twelfth chapter describing 
‘conjunction of graha and nakSatra in siddhanta 
darpana written as text book and correction of 
calculation by Sri Candragekhara born in famous 
royal family of Orissa. 


Chapter - 13 
RISING SETTING OF PLANETS, STARS 


Graharksodayasta samaya varnana 


Verse 1 - Scope - Now I describe the rising 
and setting of planets and stars. In sphutadhikara, 
udaya and asta have been roughly described on 
the basis of difference of their kendramSa. 


Verses 2-3 : Types of rising and setting - 


Udaya and asta are of two types - Nitya (daily) 
and naimittika (occasional or seen). 


In first nitya type, due to rotation of pravaha. 
(daily rotation of earth), planets and stars rise daily 
in the east and set in the west. Hence, it is called 
nitya (regular) or pratyaha (daily). 

The planets rise when they are far from sun 
and are visible. They set when they become 
invisible due to closeness of sun. This is called 
naimittika (i.e. casual) udayasta. 

Verses 4-6 : Rising setting of planets (Surya 
siddhanta) - Mangala, guru and Sani, set in west 
when their longitude (rai etc.) is more than sun, 
when it is less then sun, they rise in the east. 
Vakri budha and Sukra also set in west and rise 
in east, when their longitude is more than sun or 
less than it. 

Here more and less do not mean numerically 
bigger rasi. If the planet is ahead of sun in nearer 
portion of arc, then it is more in raSi and if behind, 


Rising Setting of Planets, Stars 683 


it is west. For example, sun in mesa will be 
considered more than a planet in mina, because 
mesa is unmedately after mina. From mesa to mina 
direction, mina is greater in numbers but it comes 
at the end of circle. 


(Surya siddhanta) - When budha and Sukra, 
moon are less than strya, they set in east. When 
they are more than sirya, they rise in west. This 
is because budha and Sukra are faster than sun. 


Notes : In general the rising and setting of 
planets etc is due to daily rotation of earth, due 
to which each star rises in east and sets in west. 
This is called daily rising and setting. Siddhanta 
darpana assumes that earth is fixed and the sky 
is rotated east to west by a wind pravaha, which 
is equivalent to daily rotation of earth. 


This chapters deals with the other type of 
rising and setting caused by brightness of sun. In 
western astronomy, it is called heliacal rising and 
setting (heliacal = caused by sun, Helios = sun in 
Greek). In this rising, when the planets are very 
close to sun and they rise around sunrise in east 
and set with sun, they cannot be seen due to 
closeness of sun. They are said asta (naimitika) or 
heliacally set. When they are slightly away from 
sun and are seen slightly before sun rise (in east 
or west) or after sunset, they are considered 
heliacally risen or naimittika udaya. 


First part of the discussion is about mangala, 
guru and gani which are slower than sun. When 
sun is behind them sun appears to be moving 
towards them. When they become very close, tHese 
planets become invisible. Before that closeness, they 


684 Siddhanta Darpana 


are seen after sunset in west. After some days, 
they become invisible due to closeness of sun, 
hence they are said to set (heliacally) in west. After 
the time of closeness, sun goes ahead, then the 
planets are seen in east before sun rise. Hence the 
three planets are said to rise in east (heliacally). 


When vakri budha and Sukra are ahead of 
sun, then they are seen in west after sunset and 
set there itself. After some days, they go to the 
other side of sun (less longitude, or west) and they 
are seen in east before sunrise. Hence vakri budha 
and sukra set in west and rise in east. 


When miargi budha, sukra (and candra) are 
behind sun, they become nearer due to more speed 
and become invisible due to closeness. Then they 
are behind sun and are invisible in east before sun 
rise. Hence they heliacally set in east when they 
go ahead of sun, they are visible in west after sun 
set and are said to rise in west. 


Verse 7-11 : Drkkarma for rising and setting - 


For knowing the rising or setting time of a 
graha in west, on the approximate day of rising 
or setting, spasta sirya and graha are found at 
sunset time. If the rising or setting is to be 
calculated in the east, then on apporoximate day 
they are calculated at sunrise time. (The ap- 
proximate time of rising or setting is known from 
rough kendram§a as explained in spasta-dhikara). 
After that drkkrama of both the planets is done. 
(Strya siddhanta quotation). Ayana drkkarma is 
‘done first, then akSa drkkarma is done. 

Method for a4kéa drkkrama - Sphuta §ara of 
graha in kala is multiplied by palabha and divided 


Rising Setting of Planets, Stars . 685 


by 12. Result is multiplied by 1800 and divided by 
lagna asu of that time. Result will be in kala etc. 
This will added for south Sara of graha and 
substracted for north Sara when sun is in east 
horizon. When sun is setting in west, reverse order 
will be followed. 

(Sarya siddhanta) Difference of akSa karma 
corrected graha and sun in asu is divided by 60 
to find kalamSa. For rising and setting in west, we 
find the difference between (6 rasis added to graha) 
and the sun. By correcting graha with that, we 
again find kalaméa difference. 

Nati correction in sphuta Sara of moon is done 
by the method explained in strya grahana (chapter 
9). To see the setting of moon in east, it is added 
to accurate moon and substracted from it to see 
the rise in west. “

diameter. 


Verses 25 - KalamSa of tara grahas 

Kalamsa of taragrahas are 

Sukra 9, vrhaspati - 11, budha 13, Sani 15, 
mangala 17. 


For Sukra and budha, the above values are 
average. Their kalamsa at cakra or cakrardha (0° 
from sun - farther side is cakra, 180° from sun i.e. 
near side is cakrardha) are 


Cakra Cakrardha 
Budha 14 12 
Sukra 10 8 


Note : At the end of cakra, on farther side 
of sun, the planets are farther hence light intensity 
is smaller. Hence, they become invisible at greater 
distance. Then they rise in east and set in west. 
At cakrardha, budha and Sikra are between earth 
-and sun and vakri, then they set in east and rise 
in west. 


Verse 27-29 : Rules for heliacal rising 


When difference between sun and the planet 
or star is more than the kalarméa, it will not be 
visible (due to light of sun). 


690 Siddhanta Darpana 


Difference of graha or nakéatra with sun being 
less than its kalamSa in west, means it has already 
set. If difference in more than kalaméSa, then it will 
set in near future. 


If in east direction, rising will be in reverse 
order. If difference (kalantara) is more than 
kalarnSa, then planet has already risen, if less than 
kalarnSa, it is yet to rise. 

Notes - (1) Condition of rising are 

(1) Planet should be above horizon. 


(2) It should be night time for its being visible. 
Even in night, slightly before sunrise or after 
sunset, it becomes invisible due to twilight. In the 
limiting case of rising in east, its difference from 
sun should be more than kalaméa. Bigger or 
brighter planet will be visible at lesser distance 
from sun. 


(2) Setting in west - slow planets mangala, 
guru or Sani or stars are overtaken by faster sun. 
In west, they rise after sunset at the minimum 
distance of kalamSa, when it has become sufficiently 
dark. It the limiting case, they are east from sun 
at kalamSa distance, when distance is more, it will 
be reduced in future, when the planets or star will 
set. Same happens with vakri budha or sukra. 


For rising at sunrise time, they should rise 
before sunrise, i.e. west from sun at kalaméa. 
Distance of sun increases due to its faster speed 
in east direction. Hence if it is more than kalamSa, 
it was equal to kalaméa earlier, when planet or 
star has risen. Vakri budha and Sukra also are 
separated further as they are in west and moving 
further west. 


Rising Setting of Planets, Stars 691 


Verses 30-33 - Day of rising or setting of 
planets - Graha and sun are added with ayanaméa. 
For setting time, six rasi is added to both. For 
graha and sayana sun at rising time (6 rasi added 
to each for setting time) rising time of their rasis 
are multiplied by daily speed and divided by (1800). 
Result will be kala gati at the time of rising or 
setting. 

We calculate the difference between rising 
times of the planet and sun at sunset or sun rise 
times before akSakarma. This is ista kalamSa from 
which kalaméa of rising is substracted. This 
kalantara is divided by difference of kalagati of sun 
and forward moving graha. If graha is retrograde 
kalantara is divided by sum of kalagatis. Result 
will be past days or coming days of rising or 
Setting, as per rules explained earlier. 

Notes : (1) Since inclination of planetary orbits 
with ecliptic is very small, it can be assumed to 
move on ecliptic. 

1800 kala on ecliptic = rising time of that raéi

692 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verses 34-37 - Akéa drkkarma for stars. 

Difference of ista kalamSa between nakSatra 
and sphuta ravi and the parama kalamé§a is divided 
by kala gati of sun at the place of nakSatra dhruva. 
This will give past time or remaining time for udaya 
kala (if sphuta sun at rising time is taken) or asta 
kala. 

Half day of nakSatra is calculated for sphuta 
kranti and asphuta kranti. Their difference in asu 
is multiplied by 1800 and divided by rising time 
of the rasi for rising in east (or rising time of 6 
rasi + nakSatra for setting in west). 

Result will be aksa drkkrama in kala. When 
nakSatra has north Sara, akSa kala will be added 
to nakSatra in west and substracted from nakSatra 
in east. For south Sara of nakSatra, akSa kala is 
added to nakSatra in east and substracted for 
nakSatra in west. Result is drkkarma corrected 
dhruva and kSetraméSa is found from that. 


Notes : (1) NakSatras have no proper motion, 
hence their rising time is calculated only from sun’s 
motions. Here, in place of sun gati + nakSatra gati 
= sun gati — 0 = sun gati only. 

Similarly, kranti of nakSatra is fixed, hence 
ayana drkkarma is not done, only aksa karma is 
done. 

(2) Udaya lagna or udaya vilagna of a star is 
that point of the ecliptic which rises in the eastern 
horizon simultaneously with the star and the asta 
vilgana or asta lagna of a star is the point of ecliptic 
which rises on the east horizon when the star sets 
on western horizon.

694 Siddhanta Darpana 
Thus aksa drkkrama = Carajya for spasta

Since dinardha = 15 ghati + carajya 
difference of dinardha = diff. of carajya - (1) 
= akSa drkkarma 


Longitude of the star’s udaya lagna L i.e. arc 
TL 


= arc TA - arc LA = arc TA - arc CA approx 
= Polar longitude - akSa drkkarma. - - - (2) 


This explains when the star is north of the 
ecliptic, then a4ksa drkkarma is substracted from 
star to find udaya lagna in east. 


For asta lagna, it will be added to polar 
longitude of star (dhumvarmSa) added to six raéis. 


(3) Rules for rising and setting can be stated 
as star rises heliacally when 


sun’s longitude = udaya lagna of star + 
kalamSa. It sets heliacally when 


sun’s longitude = astalagna - kalamSa - 6 signs. 


Star is invisible if, 

Sun’s longitude - udaya lagna < kalam$a 

or, asta lagna - sun’s longitude < kalam$a + 
6 rasis 

This can be stated in terms of udayarka and 
astarka. Udayarka (or udaya surya) is position of 
sun when a star rises heliacally. 


Astarka is position of sun when a star sets 
heliacally. 

Calculation of udayarka—Star’s udaya lagna 
is taken as sun’s longitude and it is assumed that 


_ Rising Setting of Planets, Stars 695 


time elapsed since sunrise is equal to star’s kalam&a 
ghatis. Lagna at that time is itself udayarka. 


Calculation of astarka - Star’s asta lagna is 
taken as sun’s longitude and kalaméa ghatis of 
time before sunrise, we calculate the lagna. By 
adding 6 rasis to this lagna we get astarka. 

Theorem (1) - If astarka > udayarka, star will 
never set. 


When sun = udayarka, the star rises heliacally. 
Thereafter, as the sun moves, distance of sun from 
udayalagna increases and star remains visible. Since 
astarka > udayarka, the same happens when sun 
= astarka. 


The star therefore, does not set when sun = 
astarka. Thus setting is impossible in this case. 

This happens, when star has sufficiently big 
north latitude (for places of north latitude), such 
that star’s 4kSa drkkarma > star’s kalarh$a (on 
ecliptic). For, in the case. 

Udayarka = star’s polar longitude — akéa 
drkkarma + kalaméa 

< Star’s polar longitude 

and, astarka = star’s polar longitude + akSa 
drkkarma - kalaméa 

> star’s polar longitude 

_ So that, -Astagka > star’s polar longitude 

> udayarka 

Theorem (2) - If, for a star, astarka 
< udayarka, then the star will rise and also set. 
The star will remain set when, astarka < sun 
< udayarka and will remain visible when sun 
<astarka but > udayarka. 


696 Siddhanta Darpana 


Proof - When sun = astarka, the star sets 
heliacally. As the sun’s longitude increases, the 
distance between asta lagna and sun diminishes 
and star remains heliacally set. This happens until 
sun = udayarka, when the star rises helically. Thus 
sun remains set until, astarka < sun < udaydarka. 

When sun goes beyond this limit, it is helically 
visible. 

This case happens when the star’s latitude is 
north and its 4kSa drkkarma < kalaméa of star. 

For, udayarka = polar longitude of star - akSa 
drkkarma + kalaméa on ecliptic 

> star’s polar longitude 

and, Astarka = Star’s polar longitude + akéa 
drkkarma - kalaméa 

< star’s polar longitude 

so that, astarka < star’s polar longitude 
< udayarka 

This also happens, when star’s latitude is 
south. 

For, udayarka = star’s polar longitude + ak&a 
drkkarma + kalaméa 

> star’s polar longitude 

Astarka = star’s polar longitude - akéa 
drkkarma - kalamSa 

< star’s polar longitude 

so that, Astarka < _ star’s polar longitude 
< udayarka. 

Rule for set period : A star remains heliacally 
set until astarka < sun < udayarka 


Rising Setting of Planets, Stars 697 


Between this period we take sun’s speed as 
the speed at position of star’s polar longitude which 
is in between these two values, hence can be taken 
as average speed. Hence this period for setting 

Udayarka — Astarka 
~ Average speed of sun 

Verses 38 - 40 : Kalaméa of the yogatara of 
a nakSatra is expressed in kala, multiplied by 1800 
and divided by rising time of its sayana rasi (for 
rising) and by rising time of (sayana rasi + 6 rasis) 
for setting. Result will be kSetramSa in kranti vrtta. 
This will be added to drkkarma dhruva of nak§atra 
for rising or substracted for setting. This will be 
udaya or asta dhruva of yogatara. When sun’s 
dhruva (polar longitude) is equal to udaya or asta 
dhruva of the yogatara, it will helically rise or set. 


Notes : It has been explained is previous note. 
Udaya dhruva is udayarka, asta dhruva is astarka. 


Verses 41-44 : Extreme cases - Many nakSatras 
in north rise again in east before they set in west. 
Hence their setting is not necessary. Their setting 
has been discussed only to know the setting time 
in west. Udaya and asta of many nakéatras like 
Kratu should be calculated. Agastya and yama are 
in far south, hence they remain set for long. 


Day length of any graha or star can be known 
from its carajya calculated from kranti (and local 
aksam$a). Hence, their daily rising and setting 
times can be known. Still, detailed methods will 
be explained here for their times of udaya and 
asta. 


The discussion so far has been done according 
to the views of earlier astronomers. Now I describe 
more accurate methods thought by me. 


698 Siddhanta Darpana 


Notes (1) Permanent rising and setling of stars 
has been explained earlier. If kranti of the star is 
more than ‘colatitude of the place, the star will 
never set for north kranti. For south kranti, greater 
than colatitude of the place, it will never rise. 

Equivalent condition is that, astarka 
> udayarka; i.e. star will rise again before it sets 
in west, explained in theorem (1) of previous note 
(3) after verse 37. 

(2) Rising of agastya (canopus) has been 
discussed extensively. According to Aryabhata [, 
Varahamihira and Sumati, agastya rises heliacally 
when 

sun’s longitude = 120° + ® 

and sets heliacally when 

sun’s longitude = 180°-(120° + ® ) = 60°-® 

where © is the latitude of the place. 

According to VateSvara; agastya rises heliacally 
when 

sun’s longitude = 98° + 42 P/5 degrees 

and sets heliacally when it is 76° - 42P/5 
degrees. 

where P is the equinoctical mid day shadow 
in angulas. 


Manjula gives the formulas as 97° + 8P and 
77-8P. 


Bhaskara II and Ganega daivajna give 
98°+8P and 78° - 8P 


The above rules have been derived by 
substitution from the following formula 


Rising Setting of Planets, Stars 699 


Udayarka = star’s polar longitude + akSa 
drkkarma + kalaméa. 

Astarka = star’s polar longitude akSa 
drkkarma - kalamSa. 
Verses 45-50 - Sphuta kalarméa — 

Planets and stars rise on horizon, when sun 
is still below horizon. Even in such situation they 


are invisible because sun’s light reaches on horizon 
(twilight) due to reflection from atmosphere. 


Nataméa of sun from drk - mandala (when it 
is start of twilight) is multiplied by trijya and 
divided by lambajya. Result is again multiplied by 
trijya and divided by dyujya. Result will be sphuta 
kalamSa of stars from sun. 

This means that, there is big difference 
between drk-mandala amSa and kalamsa. On 
equator also, it is equal to difference between 
dyujya and trijya. At other places it is still more. 


For example at a place of 66° north aksaméa, 
in mesa month (when sun is in mesa ra$i) guru 
and sukra in mina rasi rise alongwith sun. Both 
these planets are seen only when away from sun. 
Hence, it is not necessary to calculate these kalamSa 
difference in rising times. From the kalamSa written 
for these planets, kSetramSa is more, though 
kalamSa is below the visibility limit. Hence, they 
are seen. 


Notes : Due to reflection from atmosphere, 
twilight starts when sun is still 18° below horizon. 
In India, it is assumed 15° below horizon, as it is 
north of equator. This is called usa in morning 


700 Siddhanta Darpana 


and sandhya is evening. Sandhya is used for both 
twilight periods. 

Then sun rises when it is still about 35’ below 
horizon due to refraction of rays in atmosphere. 
Hence twilight period extends from 18° below 
horizon to 35’ below horizon position of sun. 


Thus the nataméa of sun below horizon (18°) 
or nataméa of 108° from meridian is the time when 
sun light starts. Thus, it is increase in carajya which 
is equal to increase in half day length. 

Like carajya, the natamSa jya is divided by 
cos ¢ = lamhajya/trijya to find rising difference on 
diurnal circle. It is divided by cos 6 = R cos 6 /R 

= dyujya/trijya to get the degrees on equator 
whose kala is equal to asu time. Hence the formula. 

Here, dyujya on equator means kotijya of 
natamSa, instead of kotijya of kranti. For 66° north 
aksam$Sa, the difference is Sin 18°/cos 66° = Sin 
30° approx. Hence guru and Sukra rise with 30° 
or 1 rasi difference. 


Verses 50-58 - Sphuta dhruva of udayasta of 
graha - From the udaya and asta kendram$sa, we 
find the udaya and asta kala of planets. For that 
time, mandaphala of sun is calculated. This 
mandaphala is substracted from fourth Sighra 
kendra of guru, mangala, Sani at the time of udaya 
or asta, or added to it in same manner, it is 
substracted or added to sun. In budha or $Sukra, 
this correction will be in reverse order. 

If graha is less then the true sayana sun at 
that time, half the kalamésa of graha is substracted 
from sun. If graha is more than sayana sun, then 
half kalamSa is added to sayana sun. If sun is in 


{ 
& 
u 


701 


east, that will the lagna at that time. When sun 
js in west, 6 rasi is added to sun + half kalaméa. 
That will be the lagna for setting time. 

3 rasi is substracted from this lagna. Kranti 
of that point of ecliptic (tribhona lagna) is calcu- 
lated. By adding or substracting akSamSa to kranti, 
natamga and unnataméa is found (for tribhona 
lagna). 

The natamSa of Sukra, guru, budha, Sani are 
divided by 4,5,6,7,8 and result is added to 


‘ unnatéméa. Jya of the resulting angle is found. 
. KalamSa of the planets for udaya or asta is 
‘multiplied by trijya and divided by jya of the 
‘corrected unnataméa. 


Result is degrees etc. will be kalamSa of graha 


* in ecliptic. This substracted from sun will be dhruva 
; for asta or udaya. Half of this asta or udaya dhruva, 


is added or substracted from sayana sun as before 


_ « That will give corrected udaya lagna or asta lagna. 


Notes : No logic has been given for such a 
long and arbitrary process. Probable justification is 
given below 

(1) KalamSa difference from sun is measure 
of decrease in intensity of sun light. Since it 
decreases according to inverse square of distance, 
kalaméa proportinate to birnba diameter (measure 
of intensity) is reduced by half. 

(2) Mandaphala substracted from Sighra 
kendra, is distance of planet from sun, on which 
the brightness of graha depends. 

(3) NatamSa of tribhona lagna is proportional 
to inclination of diurnal circle with vertical. The 
kalaméa will increase in proportion to this obliquity. 


702 Siddhanta Darpana 


It is divided by half the values of kalamSa of graha. 
For bright planet, kalamSa is less, fraction of 
natamSa is more, then corrected unnatamSa and its 
jya will be more, hence sphuta kalamSa will be 
less as it is divided by jya. 

Still the method appears to be based on trial 
and error and probably gave better results. 

Verses 59-68 : KSetraméa of planets for mid 


Orissa KSetramSa of planets is being given for mid 
Orissa according to rasi of sayana sun.

When sun is in west, 6 rasi is deducted from 
it and then kSetramSa is found. Then the degrees 
of sayana sun are multiplied by difference of 
dhruvamSa and added to kSetraméa if increasing, 
or substracted if decreasing.

In fifth rasi, astodaya dhruva will be equal to

Verse 69 : For other places also, from 
unnatajya, kSetramSa between sun and the planet 
for udaya or asta can be found out. 


Verses 70-76 - Sphuta udayasta time. 


When difference of sun and graha is equal to 
dhruvam§Sa, then that will be the sphuta time. It 
will be made more correct by successive approxima- 
tion. 

From éara of graha or nakSatra, both ayana 
and 4kéa drkkrama correction are done. Bothy 
corrections are added together or difference is taken 
according to sign. Resultant correction (positive or 
negative) in vikala is divided by difference of sun 
Rati and graha gati in kala. When budha or éukra 
_ 4re vakri, it will be divided by sum of gati kala. 


704 Siddhanta Darpana 


Result in danda etc. is added to rising and 
setting time, if rising is in east and setting in west 
- and when drkkarma was positive. If rising is in 
west and setting in east, then it is substracted from 
rising or setting times. 

For negative drkkarma, reverse in done. The 
correction time is substracted from rising time in 
east or setting time in west. It is added to rising 
time in west or setting time in east. 


Then we get more correct time for udaya or 
asta. This correction is due to motion of planet at 
the cakra or cakradha. 


When sphuta sun and sphuta graha ‘are in 
same rasi then it is cakra time for all tara graha, 
for budha and $ukra it can be cakrardha also. 


Note - Ayana and 4kéa drkkarma have already 
_ been explained in conjunction of planets. Positive 
drkkarma means rising of planet is later and setting 
time is earlier, i.e. difference with sun is reduced. 
(rising in east and setting in west). Then their 
difference will again increase to dhruvaméSa distance 
after sometime depending on relative speed. 


Verses 77-82 - Astodaya time without 
drkkarma - For Orissa, udayasta degrees for each 
planet has been stated according to sayana sun in 
each rasi. At the time of cakra, the degrees of 
udayasta are divided by difference of speeds of 
sun and graha. For cakrardha of budha and Sukra, 
division is by.sum of gatis. Result will be time in 
days etc. For that period after cakra or cakrardha, 
graha will be set, then it will rise. It will be set 
for that period before cakra/cakrardha also. 


Rising Setting of Planets, Stars 705 


Sayana sun is calculated for the time of udaya 
or asta found approximately. Again, we calculate 
the difference of sun-graha distance and kSetramsa. 
This is divided by gati antara or sum and udayasta 
times are corrected. 


For this corrected udayasta kéla, we take the 
average position of graha and sun. Speed of sun 
and graha for that position is the sphuta gati for 
both for purpose of udaya or asta times. 


At any time we calculate the difference of 
sayana and dhruvam§Sa corrected sun and the 
sphuta graha. That is converted to kala and divided 
by difference or sum of speeds of sun and planet. 
That will give days since udaya or asta or remaining 
days according to rules explained earlier. 


Notes : (1) At cakra and cakrardha planet has 
same position from earth as sun. Then they will 
- be set due to closeness of sun. Assuming the speed 
at end of cakra/cakrardha to be average speed upto 
period of udaya, we calculate the time when the 
planets will be separated at distance of kSetramSa, 
‘when they will rise heliacally. By successive 
approximation by speeds at approximate time of 
‘udayasta, we calculate more accurate time. 


(2) The days since udayasta or remaining days 
are calculated by calculating as to when sayana 
sun - sayana graha = kéSetraméa. 

(3) 1/2 (sun + graha) at udaya or asta time is 
the mid position of sun and graha. With sufficient 

, accuracy, speeds of sun and graha at that position 
i; Can be considered sphuta. 


706 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verses 82-84 : Conclusion - 


Other astronomers have stated the udayasta 
degrees of graha 1” less than values stated here. 
According to them the degrees are - guru 10, budha 
12, Sani 14, mangala 16, vakri Sukra 7, margi Sukra 
9, 

This is not the real setting or loss of a planet. 
In course of rotation of earth and their own motion, 
they keep coming east, west, up or down. As eyes 
are dazed due to brightness of sun, tara graha 
become lightless like light flies and become in- 
visible. Due to bigger angular diameters, candra, 
guru and sukra are seen in day light also. 


At equator 22°30’ kalamSa before rise or after 
setting of sun, its light starts reaching horizon. At 
other places this kalamSa is multiplied by lambajya 
of the place and divided by trijya. Light of sun 
will go upto that distance. (kalaméa). 


At equator, light of moon is visible 8 kalamSa 
after, setting or before rise. Light of Sukra is visible 
1 kalamSa before rise or after setting. Kalam$a at 
other places is obtained by multiplying it with trijya 
and dividng with lambamSa jya. 

Notes : It has already been explained, how 
planets set hetically. KalamSa of sun here has been 
taken as 22°30’ at equator against 18° taken in 
modern astronomy. Kalam$a of moon and ésukra is 
not calculated, as it is ineffective compared to light 
of other stars. 


At other places, kalamSa depends both on 


kranti and akSaméa as calculated earlier. Roughly 
we can assume that, sun rays will reach same 


Rising Setting of Planets, Stars 707 


manam$a at other places also which is equal to 
kalam$a X trijya / lambajya 
Verses 85-86 - Prayer and end 


I pray thousand times to revered lord Jagan- 
natha, whose brightness is like jewel of Indra (Indra 
nila mani is blue), whose lotus feet are worshipped 
by Vasuki, Ganesha, Siva, moon and sun. 


Thus ends the thirteenth chapter discribing 
rising and setting in Siddhanta Darpana written 
for correct calculation and a text book by Sri 
Candrasekhara of a famous royal family of Orissa. 


Chapter - 14 
LUNAR HORNS 


Candra Smigonnati Varnana 


(Elevation of lunar horns) 


Verse 1 - Scope - For knowledge of persons 
of sharp intellect, it is proposed to describe accurate 
daily rising and setting of moon, elevation of lunar 
horns (candra Srmga) and diagrams (parilekha). 


Verses 2-11 : Time after sun set when moon 
sets. 


Rising time and setting time of moon are 
calculated roughly according to method described 
earlier. At the time of sun set, accurate moon and 
sun are made Sdyana (ayanam$Sa is added). Then 
drkkarma sanskara is done. 

6 rasi is added to sdyana and drkkarma 
corrected sun and moon. By difference of their 
lagna (rising times of rasis between them), kalaméa 
is found out. 

Among sun and moon, bhogya (remaining) 
asu of lesser rasi, bhukta (lapsed) asu of bigger 
rasi and rising time of other rasis in between in 
asu - all are added and divided by 60. Result will 
be sphuta kalaméa difference between sun and 
moon. 

Kalaméa difference divided by 6 gives the 
result in ghati etc. This is multiplied by gati of 
sun and moon and divided by 60. Result in kala 


Lunar Horns 709 


etc,is added to sun and moon. Again, we find the 
difference of their rising times. After repeated 
procedures, rising time difference between sun and 
moon will become steady or fixed. 


Here, ayana and akSa drkkarma of moon is 
to be done every time, otherwise Sara will be 
different due to change in distance between moon 
and its path. 


When the rising time difference between moon 
and sun becomes constant thus, 3 rasis are 
substracted from moon. For this vitribha lagna, 
‘nata and Sara are found, and its ayana and ak$Sa 

- drkkarma are done. 


To make it more accurate, the drkkarma 

* correction is made to moon and sun with 6 raéis 

added to them. The rising time difference in asu 

is found. Sphuta gati of moon is divided by 14 

and multiplied by trijya and divided by lambajya 

- to get the lambana asu of moon. On substracting 

this from the rising time difference, we get correct 
difference in asu. 


This period after sun set, moon will set. While 
finding instantaneous sun and moon, asu should 
be considered savana (21,659 part of savana day) 
and while finding moon at any time it will be 

» NakéSatra (i.e. 21600 part of a nakéatra day). At sun 
Set time, asu will be candra savana (i.e. 22, 390 
& asu). 


Notes : (1) Second half of fifth and Ist half 
= of sixth verse are quoted from sirya siddhanta, 
* which was considered by many to be an interpola- 
| tion. However, here, they are further specified by 
ke _ Giving the values of asu to be taken in these 


710 Siddhanta Darpana 


calculations. This is the method for calculating 
setting of moon in Sukla pakSa (bright half). 
Though this is not specified anywhere, but next 
verse tells about procedure for krsna pakSa. It has 
been clearly specified in stirya siddhanta. 


(2) Rough method for rising and setting time 
of moon - This has been stated in chapter 8 - 
candragrahana verses 60-65. That is for pirnima | 
and can be used for 8th of Sukla pakéa to 7th of 
krsna pakSa. This ignores Sara and doesn’t do 
drkkarma sanskara. 

Rising time - At sun set time sdyana sun and 
moon are calculated. 

Rising time of moon after sunrise 

= Rising time of remaining part of raSis of 
sayana sun + for lapsed part of sdéyana moon + 
for rasis in between sun and moon + 56 asu as 
larnbana correction for moon = A asu 


A 
* 360 ghati 


Setting time of moon : Moon set time after 
sunset = rising time of remaining rasis (of sun at 
sun rise time + 6) + for lapsed part of rasi of 
(sdyana moon at sun rise + 6 raSi) - 56 asu = A 


asu eos hati 
= 369 Shati- 


Sara correction - Sara kala x palabha / 12 is 
added to rising time if ara is south and substracted 
if Sara is north. Reverse correction is done for 
moon set time. 


* tynar Horns 711 


Around purnima, moon rise is around the 
time of sunset, hence the position of sun and moon 
at sunset time are taken for better approximation. 

Rising time of moon - rising time of sun in 
east = rising periods of ecliptic between rasi of 
sayana sun to sayana moon. 


Due to larmbana, moon will appear lower 
when seen at horizon and rise 56 asus later or set 


'.56 asus earlier, the time needed by moon to cover 


EAR 


earth’s radius in its orbit. 


When moon is setting (moon + 6 ra$i) is rising 
.in east. Similarly at sunset time sun + 6 raéi is 


- rising. Hence moon set - sun set. 


= rise of (moon + 6 raSi) - rise of (sun + 6 
ra$i) 

= rising time between (moon + 6 ragi) to (sun 
+ 6 rasi) 

For equator, rising time of a rai and 6 raéi 
away from it is same. 

If we use the time of setting of rasis instead 
of rising, addition of 6 raSis is not needed. 


Sign Time of setting in asus Sign 

‘at the equator at the local place 
1. Mesa 1675 1675 +a 12 Mina

5. Simnha 1796 1796 - b 8 VrScika 
6.Kanya 1675 1675 - a 7 Tula 


Here a, b, c are the rising time differences 
for mesa, vrsa and mithuna. 


712 Siddhanta Darpana 


Due to north Sara, effective kranti is increased, 
hence carajya will increase. Component of Sara 
parallel to kranti i.e. perp to equator is s cos ¢ 
where é is inclination of moon’s orbit with equator. 
Hence, corresponding carajya increase is 


_ s X_palabha 
s tan ® = a 


This is substracted from rising time as day 
length increases due to increase in kranti. 


(3) Successive approximation and drkkarma - 


Due to aksa and ayana drkkarma, difference 
between sun and moon is corrected as visible from 
the place. 


Difference in moon set - sun set 
. = rising time diff (sayana moon + 6 rasi) 
(sayana sun + 6 raéi) 

as the rasi at 6 rasi difference is rising when 
sun or moon are setting. 

That will be sphuta time difference in asu. 

Asu__ Kala 

60 60 : 

360° = 60 danda (naksatra time) 

Hence 1 danda time = 6° KalaméSa 

Speeds of ravi and sun are calculated for 
savana dina, hence sdvana asu is to be used (i 
day = 21659 asu). For calculation at sunset time, 
we take candra savana dina because moon set to 
moon set time is equal to candra savana dina. 


= degree 


From speed of sun and moon at the asta time 
of moon, further corrections are done. 


713. 


(4) Larhbana correction at setting time is 
sphuta gati of moon divided by 14. This is larnbana 
améa at local akSAmsa. To convert it into kala at 
equator or asu, it is divided by cos ¢ i.e. R cos 
/R or multiplied by trijya and divided by lambajya 
= R cos ¢. This is substracted from setting time. 

Verses 12-13 - In krsna pakSa, sun at sunset 
time is calculated, 6 rasi is added to sayana sun. 
Difference in rising times between (sayana sun + 
6 rasi) and sayana moon at that time.is the time 
after sun set when moon wil rise. 


Here also drkkarma is to be done for sun and 
“moon both at sun set time. At rising time, larnbana 
»asu is added. After repeated calculations with sun 
and moon positions at moon rise time we get 
steady value of differnce in sun set and moon rise 
in east. 

Notes : In krsna pakSa, difference between 
sun and moon is more than 6 rasi. Hence at sun 
set time, moon is below east horizon, Hence, we 
calculate the difference between east horizon 
ecliptic point (i.e. sun + 6 rasi) and moon. 
However, while the position of moon at sunset 
time comes on ecliptic, moon goes further east due 
._ to its motion, hence real rising will be later. This 
'. difference is corrected by successive approximation. 


Verses 14-18 : Position of moon at desired time 


s Now, method is described for calculating 
'; Position of moon at sun set time or any other time 
«,; 88 observed from earth’s surface. 


By method explained in chapter 6, sphuta 
, Candra is found at desired time. Its position east 
; or west half of sky is found (from lagna etc.) 


714 Siddhanta Darpana 


Lagna for desired time, vitribha lagna and 
vitribha Sanku is calculated. Drgjiya for moon in 
east or west half of sky is multiplied by drggati 
(vitribha Sanku) and divided by trijya. Result is 
multiplied by first sphuta gati of moon and divided 
by 14 X trijya 3438 (= 48132). Result in kala etc 
will be added or substracted to moon, if moon is 
east or west from vitribha lagna. Then we get 
lambana corrected moon at desired time. After that, 
we find nati of moon again. Nati and Sara are 
added or difference is taken according to same or 
different directions to get sphuta Sara. From that, 
we do ayana and 4akSa drkkarma. By making 
drkkarma correction, we get the samaprota vrtta 
moon as seen from earth surface. 


Notes : Methods of lambana and sphuta 
candra have already been explained in chapter 9 
on Solar eclipse. 


Verses 19-27 : Elevation of lunar horns 


There are two types of elevation of lunar 
horns (rnga). Generally horn means, pointed ends 
of the bright portion of the disc. But some 
authorities consider elevation of horns of black 
portion also. This horn is not seen but it can be 
known from calculations. 

From one rise of moon to its next rising time 
is called savana day of moon. 

From sphuta kranti of moon, its nata kala is 
found by method explained earlier. 

In first half of Sukla pakSa (Ist day to 8th) 
and second half of krsna pakSa (9th day to 14th), 
elevation of bright horns is found. For other days 
i.e. 2nd half of Sukla and Ist half of krsna pakéa, 


Lunar Horns 715 


elevation of dark horns is calculated. Out of bright 
or. dark parts, whatever is. less than half, its 
elevation is calculated. 

Moon in its vimandala (inclined orbit) is 
lighted by rays from sun in apavrtta (kranti vrtta 
or ecliptic) and is seen in many shapes. 

Even when both the horns of moon are 
equidistant from sun, they appear small or big and 
inclined. 


At a place where midday sun at the end of 
uttara-ayana (i.e in sayana mithuna) is above head 
(i.e. akSamSa of the place is equal to maximum 
kranti - karka rekha place), the sun at beginning 
of sayana mesa will be in sama mandala at sunset 
time (i.e. in east west circle). At that place moon 
with zero Sara will move exactly in east direction. 


This shows that according to position of kranti 
vrtta, position, speed and horns of moon are 
decided. That also changes due to change of Sara. 

As in candragrahana, in finding elevation of 

-horns also, ayana and akéa valana are calculated. 


Verses 28-29 - Sara valana 


We consider the right angled triangle whose 
‘sides are 


(1) Perpendicular side is the jya of difference 
between moon and sun. 


(2) Base is the bhuja of Sarajya (or Sara with 
direction) 


(3) Square root of sum of these squares is 
karna - i.e. linear distance between sun and moon. 


71460—~COiC Siddhanta Darpana 


Sara is multiplied by trijya and divided by 
karna. Arc of the result in kala is divided by 60 
to know the valanaméa of Sara (i.e. angular 
deflection). 


Notes : Here we form the right angled triangle 
for deflection from ecliptic only. For sun it is zero. 
In sirya siddhanta, it is calculated for defleciton 
from equator. For that we take the difference of 
kranti of sun and moon = p 

Then, base 

_p_X_chaya karna of moon + 12 akSajya 

- lambajya 

Perpendicular = Sanku of moon i.e. kotijya 
of natamsa 


Then, Karna =Vbase? + perp? 


Here karna has been termed as madhyahna 
candra prabha karna i.e. straight distance (like a 
light ray) of mid day moon. This has been confused 
with mid day of sun. Ranganatha in his gidhartha 
prakasika tika on Surya siddhanta, interprated it 
as mid point of civil day between sun rise to next 
sunrise i.e. sunset time. Accordingly, he derived 
the formula. This was followed by Burgess who 
wrote the commentary in 1860 at Chicago U.S.A. 
after he got Ranganatha Tika in Mahdarastra in 1835. 
Svami Vijhanananda followed it in his Bangala 
commentary in 1909 and Sri Mahavira Pd Shrivas- 
tava in his Vijhana Bhasya in 1940. 

When moon is at meridian or its midday, sun 
is at horizon or above it i.e. within + 90° of moon, 
as the bright portion is less than half for a horn 


SPROTTEARYE IE, Sag Teor rman gear * 


‘Lunar Horns 717 


to follow. Hence it will be almost correct for other 
positions also. 
Proof : 

SZ is a quarter of the yamyottara vrtta. Let 


0 G F K 


Figure 1 


¢ be .its centre and Z zenith. Let EC be nadi 


" mandala. ZC is produced to D, so that CD 
» represents a Sanku of 12 angulas. 


When sun is at E, DF is equinoctical shadow 


_ of CD or palabha. When sun is at A, DG called 


-. bhuja is shadow and GF agra. When sun is at B, 


DK called bhuja is shadow and FK agra. 


Thus Bhuja = Palabha + Agra; or + Agra, 


i -when sun is on horizon. 


Similarly bhuja of moon = Palabha + moon’s: 


‘ agra in the sphere whose radius is candra chaya 
' karna i.e. hypotenus of right angled triangle whose 
., One side is Sanku of 12 angula and other is shadow 
, caused by moon. 


Thus in this sphere, sun’s agra 
_ Sun agra x candra chayéa karna 


Trijya 
Candra agra x Candra chaya karna 
Trijya 


Moon's agra = 


718 Siddhanta Darpana 
Kranti jya x Trijya

Hence difference between sun’s and moon’s bhuja 
= Palabha + (Candra kranti jya + Sun kranti jyé) 
Candra chaya kama 
Lambajya 


Palabha 12 


akéajya = Tambaye H hence we get the 


formula for base. 


But agra = 


From this base and sanku of moon’s height, 
we get the karna which is direction from sun to 
moon in meridian circle, i.e. projection of sun moon 
line in this circle. 

(2) Due to the confusion about this interpreta- 
tion and apporximate formula, siddhanta darpana 
has given more direct and accurate formula which 
can be used for any position of sun and moon. 


Figure 2 - 

It is known that sun is always on ecliptic, but 
position of moon at M on ecliptic is perpendicular 
foot on ecliptic. Thus MM’ is perpendicular on 
plane of ecliptic, i.e. on line SM’ of this plane also. 


Arc SM’ is difference in moon and sun on 
ecliptic i.e. their rasi difference. Line SM’ is the 
jya of that difference. MM’ is Sara of moon i.e. 
Sara jya (arc MM’ is the Sara). 

Hence SM = Vom? + MM

gives prabha karna of moon at any time.

We are following the scale of 1 angula = 1° 
on khagola circle in diagram. Hence, kala is 
converted to degree or angula by dividing it with 
- 60. 


_ Verses 30-43 - Diagram of lunar horns 


We draw a khagola circle for same radius 
(57°18’) as in diagram of eclipse. Directions are 
- marked. 


Here also, moon is shown as a Circle of radius 
6 angula (i.e. 12 angula diameter). When moon is 
in east kapala, sphuta valana is given in eastern 
point and if moon is in west half of sky, valana 
is given near west point in its direction (north or 
~ south). 

Valana of Sara is given in opposite direction 
_ from valana given earlier in both kapalas (east or 
west half of sky). 


End point of Sara valana is assumed to be 
sun and from that, a line is drawn upto centre of 
moon and extended. The point where it cuts the 
circumference of moon will be the border point 


between bright and dark portions of moon due to 
sun. 


Difference of moon and sun in kala is divided 
by 900 to get the angula width of bright portion. 
From centre of moon, on the sun line (the end 


720 Siddhanta Darpana 


point of Sara is sun), we give two points on kha- 
vrtta at 90° distance from sun on both sides. From 
these points also two lines are drawn to the centre 
of moon. 


These two points cut moon on ends of a 
diameter. On sun line, from circumference, a point 
at distance of width of bright portion is given. 


To draw a circle through these points, we 
draw arcs with 5 angula radius from each of three 
points. They form two fish figures, whose head - 
tail lines cut at the centre of circle through these 
points. From the arc through the three points, the 
portion towards sun will be the bright portion of 
moon, 


In stkla pakSa, if moon is in western sky, or 
in krgsna paksa moon in east sky, the bright side 
will be towards sun point. For Sukla pakSa moon 
in east, krsna pakSa moon in west, the bright side 
of moon will be on opposite side of sun: point. 


In Sukla pakSa, less than half bright moon 
will be shown by putting the diagram on west side 
wall. Horns will be bent towards north or south. 


In krsna pakSa, this will be shown on eastern 
wall. For more than half portion of moon bright, 
it will show elevation of dark horns. 


Notes : (1) Valana of moon depends on akéa 
and ayana valana and due to its Sara from ecliptic. 
Hence both are marked. 


Since moon circle is of 12 angula diameter, 
complete diameter 12 angula will be bright when 
moon - Sun = 180° = 10,800 kala

This assumes that moon’s speed is constant, 


~ which makes little error. But another assumption 


is that bright part is proportional to angular 
difference between sun and moon. Actually, it is 
proportional to utkrama jya i.e. R (1-cos @ ) as 
shown below.

: EMF is the face of moon perpendicular to CS 
* direction of sun. Thus the portion of moon between 
: EMF and EBF is the bright portion seen to observer. 
But the circle EMF is seen obliquely by observer, 
:, hence it is seen as half ellipse as projected on 


- BEAF plane whose major axis is EF and semi minor

"hence equal to CB and CN is projection of CM, 
: hence 


722 Siddhanta Darpana 


CN = CM cos MCN = CB cos SCC’ 


Because ZMCN is the angle between planes 
which are prependicular to the directions of 
observer and sun. Hence bright portion NB 

= CB - CN = CB - CB cos SCC’ 

= CB (1 - cos SCC’) = CB. Utkramajya SCC’ 

LSCC’ is roughly the angle between direc- 
tions of sun and moon. If they are considered in 
ecliptic it is difference between longitudes. More 
‘accurately, it can be found from triangle OCS 
whose sides OC, OS and CS are known. 

(3) In first half of Sukla pakga, when sun is 
setting, moon will be in west half of sky as it is 
less than 90° ahead of sun. Hence, the diagram 
will be shown on west wall with direction of sun 
downwards. In later half of Sukla pakga, moon will 
be in east half of sky,. hence its dark horns will 
-be shown in east sky because more than half part 
in bright. 

Verses 44-61 - Modern method of showing 
lunar horns. Thus the method for finding lunar 
horns has been described according to old 
siddhanta texts. Now, I describe accurately, ob- 
served bright, part of moon according to my 
experience and logic. 

Jya of difference of moon and sun rai etc is 
multiplied by yojana karna of moon and divided 
by yojana karna of sun. Result in kala etc is added 
- to moon of sukla pakSa and substracted from moon 
of krsna paksa. That will be sphuta moon. 

From this sphuta moon, rai of sun is again 
substracted and utkrama jy4 is found. That is 


Lunar Horns 723 


divided by 573. Result in angula etc. will be 
measure of bright portion or dark portion which 
ever is less than half. 


When less than half of moon is bright, this 
resultant angula will be marked as bright portion. 
If more than half is bright, then bright angula 
measure is (6 angula - the result). 

As before, from the end point of Sara valana 
in the direction of sun, three points on bright dark 
boundary are found. Through fish lines, we find 
the centre and draw a circle through these points. 


Bright portion of moon less than 1-1/2 angula 

(i.e. 1/8th of moon’s diameter) is not seen, because 
the end portions of horn are very thin. Increase 

in phase of moon, or its decrease should be shown 

to people through diagrams. On 4th day of bright 

-Whalf (Sukla pakSa), at the sunset time, moon circle 
is drawn in north direction on earth’s surface. 4 

diameters are drawn through directions points and 

angle points. All the diameters bisect each other 

at the centre. West from moon at a distance, sun 

is shown. Due to this sun, west half of moon will 

be bright. To see the bright portion, earth point 

is given at a distance of 5 hands (5 X 24 angulas) 

from moon’s centre in agni kona (south east 

_ direction). North of this earth point will indicate 
Zenith of sky. Though half the moon is always 
,dighted to sun, the portion seen from earth is much 
‘less than half due to angle between white circle 
“and visible circle. From southeast direction, we see 
. the diameter through nairtya (south west) and igana 
:Points (north east). Of the bright portion touching 
p#he north south line, lower half portion will be 


peeen from earth. 


724 Siddhanta Darpana 


The line from earth centre to south point of 
moon touches west point and cuts the north east 
- south west line. From this point in direction of 
south west, bright portion will be seen. Rest part 
upto north east point will be dark. 


When difference of moon and sun is 45°, 
ancient texts, have assumed 3 angula bright 
portion. But in this calculation only (1/45) angula 
is actually seen. Hence, scholars calculate the bright 
portion of moon from utkrama jya4 only, because 
in a sphere, any object will be seen in line of sight 
(in perpendicular plane only). 

Notes : (1) Use of utkrama jya - The formula 
as proved in previous section is through utkrama 
jya as shown, Logically we can infer it because we 
see the sphere from curved side, not from side of 
centre. Hence the distance of plane surface will be 
proportional to utkrama jya, from centre it is 
proportional to kotijya. 

(2) Proof of the formula- c 

As in figure 3, we need s 
to know the angle C’ C S as 
seen from moon _ between 
directions of sun and direction 
from observer. 

Z SCC’ = £2 CSO + 
Z COS - (1) 

Z COS is the angle be- 
tween directions (rasi) of SUNgigure 4 - angle from moon 
and moon). between sun and earth 

In Sukla pakSa (moon - sun) is less than 180°, 
hence it is smaller angle COS itself. In krsna pak$a 
it (moon - sun) is more than 180°, hence we 


Gt 


Lamar Horns , 725 
- calculate the outer angle (360° - ZCOS) Then 


» £SCC' = ZCOS - ZCSO - ~ - (la) 
Now in ACOS, by sine-rule 
OC OS . OS 


oO 


SinCSO = Sin OCS Sin SCC’ 
as Sin SCC’ = Sin (180°-OCS) = Sin OCS 
or, Sin CSO = OC/OS Sin SCC’ 


io Z CSO is very. small, because OC is very 
é, .. small compared to OS. Hence Sin CSO = Z CSO 
and sin Z SCC’ = Z SOC approximately. 


.. Then Z CSO = OC/OS (Z SOC) - - - (2) 
Here, OC = candra karna, OS = siirya karna 
Putting the value of 2 CSO in (1) or (1a), 
‘we get the SCC’ whose utkrana jya is to be found. 
(3) Angula value of bright part. 

4 For angle of 90°, utkrama jya is 3438 kala and 
;, bimba is 6 angula bright 

Hence for utkrama jya 1 kala, 


eo bright portion is 3438 573 angula

WS line is hence the boundary of bright portion. 
it cuts SW-NE line on K. Hence from K to SW, is 
bright portion and remaining part from K to NE

(5) Modern method - The great circle from 
sun’s centre to moon’s centre is perpendicular to 
line joining lunar’ horns. The great circle from 
zenith to centre of moon is at angle from sun 
moon great circle, which is the angle of lunar horns 
with horizon. This angle can be known from 
spherical trigonometry, as. discussed in tripra$na- 
dhikara. ,

180° - 2 ZMR is the angle of elevation of 
horns, because it is equal to Z PMR. If sun is 
north from moon, then north horn will be upper 
and if south, then south horn will be upper. If 
digamSa of both sun and moon are same then 
horns will level. After knowing this, diagram of 
horns should be drawn as per figure 6(b). -

In India, north horn is mostly seen higher in 
both west and east kapala. Very rarely, south horn 
is seen higher. 


Notes : For akSaméa more than 28-1/2° north, 
both sun and moon will be always in south. As 
we see from north, northern portion of bright horn 
will look bigger. 


Verses 64-67 : Reasons. for new. methods 
—Earlier astronomers used to find difference of 
kranti’s of sun and moon through a ganku of 12 
angula and. from that, elevation of horns was 
found. Since this method doesn’t give results as 
observed, I am rejecting it. When sun is prepen- 
dicular to equator, half disc of moon in sayana 
makara beginning is seen cut by meridian line at 
zenith. Hence, half disc is seen bright. 

Hence utkrama jya of (moon-sun) is multiplied 
by Ist sphuta gati of moon and divided by (173452). 
Result in kala is added or substracted from half 
dise of moon to find the bright portion width. This 
is added to half diameter when bright portion is 
more than half, otherwise substracted from it. This 


729 . 


will be correct measure of birhba in both east and 
west sky. 

When moon is at 11° from sun, its light is 
‘more than budha bimba of diameter 17 vikala and 
less than bright bimnba of guru. Hence, it is not 
proper to consider heliacal rising and setting of 

“moon at 11° kalamSa difference. The author 
. considers ' it to be between 11° and 12°. 

At the end of Ist day of bright half, 108th 
. part of moon’s disc is seen, even though it is very 
‘thin. On 4th day, its 1/6 part will be seen bright. 
“At the end of 5th day, 1/4 parts will be bright. At 
-the end of tenth day 3/4 part will be bright. On

MAHAPATA VARNANA 


Verse 1 - Scope - I am describing mahapata 

as told in scriptures, which destroys the good deeds 
. (sara) earned in pilgrimage, sacred thread wear- 
Hing, marriage etc, in whose discussion mathe- 
pmaticians are also confused, and on whose 
é results of charity, japa and bath become 
1, auspicious as in an eclipse. 

“Notes : Mahapata is a fictious conjunction of 
i sun and moon and is as good or bad as an eclipse. 
iit destroys results of good deeds which accrue due 
to. marriage etc as described in scriptures. But if 
/'good works like charity are done during mahapata, 
_ they are as fruitful as in eclipse. This is a difficult 
, topic, as the conjunction is observed only mathe- 
‘ matically not as a real phenomenon. 


' Verses 2-8 : Two mahapatas - 

Patas are of two types - Vaidhrti and vyati- 
pata When their (sun moon) krantis are equal, then 
these patas occur. Out of gola and ayana, if ayana 
is same, then pata is vaidhrti and if gola is same 
then it is vyatipata. 


When moon and sun are in same diurnal 
arcle, they have gola sandhi. When both are in 
Place of parama kranti, they have ayana sandhi. 

When moon and sun are in one gola but 
different ayanas and their krantis are equal then 
it is vyatipata yoga. 


732 Siddhanta Darpana 


When moon and sun are in different gola but 
same ayana and their kranti are equal, it is vaidhrti 
yoga. When kranti is same, their aspects are added 
(i.e. they are at same angle with equator plane), 


(In Surya siddhanta) when moon and sun 
both have same kranti, due to combination of their 
rays at same angles there is flow of fire which is 
destructive for living beings. 


Atipata yoga is always bad and destructive. 
Other names of this yoga are vyatipata and 
vaidhrti. 

Each pata has dark colour, very ferocious body 
and red eyes. Both are valiant and occur every 
month. Pata from spasta position (of moon and 
sun) is more destructive than pata from mean 
position. (Quotation ends) 


Notes (1) Two yogas are named vaidhrti and 
vyatipata, but. these have no relation at present 
with the two mahapatas. However, these can be 
calculated from sum of longitudes of sun and moon 
and in that way they are related to yoga cycle.

Figure 1 - Mahapata 

Figure 1 (a) shows vyatipata when, moon and 
‘sun have common diurnal circle-i.e. same kranti 
put at the other end of orbit. 

Figure 1 (b) shows, vaidhrti yoga, in which 
_ the kranti of moon and sun are equal and opposite, 
‘je. diurnal circles of moon sun are at equal 
‘ distances from equator, but in opposite direction. 
, Sun and moon are in same side of sphere i.e. in 
j same gola. 
le In these figures Y is 0° sayana mesa and QQ 
tis pata of moon i.e. rahu. € is inclination between 
‘equator and ecliptic and € between ecliptic and

If latitude of moon’s orbit is neglected (it is 
Jess than 5° always), both moon and sun are on.

‘moon from sayana 0° are taken, then for equality 
p of kranti. 

Sin S, = Sin Mi 

= Sin (180°-M1) 

or S; = 180°-My or S,+M;, = 180° 

When they are numerically equal but in 
* Opposite direction, then Sin S; = - Sin M; = Sin 
& (360°-M;) 

Hence S; + Mi = 360°. 

(2) In vaidhrti yoga, S. + My; - 2 ayanamSa 


aca 


BREE se 


For Vyatipata yoga S, + My, - 2 ayanaméSa 


Thus vaidhrti yoga coincided with vaidhrti 
fMahapata when ayandméa was ()°. But vyatipata 


734 Siddhanta Darpana 


yoga is only 10th yoga starting at 120° and it will 
not tally with the mahapata. 


Verses 9-15 : Calculation of yoga - 


When sum of sadyana sun and saéyana moon 
is 12 rasi then vaidhrti yoga is near. 

Similarly, if sum of sayana sun and sayana 
moon is 6 rasi or 18 rasi, then vyatipata yoga is 
imminent. 

When sun and moon are in different quad- 
rants of ecliptic, then only pata can happen. Both 
vyatipata and vaidhrti yogas occur once each . 
month. In some months vyatipata occurs twice, 
sometimes it doesn’t occur in a month. 


Pata are possible when viskambhaka etc yogas 
occur. For that, we multiply ayanaméa by 2 and 
added to minutes (kala) of a circle (21,600) or half 
circle (180° = 10,800’) if substracted earlier, and 
substracted if added earlier. When result is more 
than (21,600), cakra (21,600) is substracted.' By 
dividing it with (800), result will be past no. of 
yogas from viskumbha etc. Adding 1 to quotient 
it will give the number of current yoga. Remainder 
multiplied by 60 and divided by 800 gives the part 
of current yoga lapsed. 


If moon has no Sara, then it is also the time 
of pata. When moon has Sara, pata will be slightly 
before or after this time. Hence we should roughly 
calculate pata, first according to madhyama kranti 
(i-e. Kranti of ecliptic point of moon without Sara). 

Notes : If has been explained earlier that patas 
will occur when sum of sayana moon and sun is 
6 rasi (for vyatipata) or 12 rasi for vaidhrti. 


Mahépata Varnana ; 735 


For, if S, amd My, are sayana longitudes of 
sun and moon, when their krantis are equal, for

or Sy = 180°-Mi or S; + M, = 180° --- (1)

Sin S, = - Sin Mi = Sin (360°-M1) 

or SL+ML = 360° --- (2) 
> ~ While pata is calculated with sayana sun and 
“moon, assuming madhyama kranti without Sara, 
_yoga is calculated for nirayana moon and sun. 

. Hence, if ayanamSa is A and nirayana moon 
rand sun are S and M, then 
a _ Gt 
ee reg re 

«because each yoga extends.for 800 kala of sum 

~of sun and moon position. 

» S_ = A+S, Mi = AtM 

Hence for patas 

St + ML = 6 rasi or 12 rasi (180° or 360°) 
‘oF (S+A) + (M+A) = 6 or 12 raSi 

or S+M = (6, or 12 rasi) - 2 A 
. Putting this value of S+M in kala in (3), we 
- get the yoga number as stated in text. 

i Formulas (1) and (2) give kranti depending 
* only on ecliptic. Since Sara is very small it will be 
. approximate time of pata also. As ayanaméa 
; remains almost constant, the yogas for’occurrance 
- of pata are fixed for some years. We can thus 
know the approximate time of pata by the current 
» Yoga. After knowing sthila pata, we get it corrected 


736 : - Siddhanta Darpana 


for Sara of moon to know when sphuta kranti is 
equal. 

(2) Since yoga is sum of sun and moon, it 
changes with sum of speeds i.e. (790/35+59/8) = 
849/43 average speed. At this rate, rotation takes 

21,600 Kala 

849/43 kala/day 


Ina lunar month of 29.5 days it will definitely 
complete one cycle, hence both the patas will occur 
once at least. Due to extra length of lunar month, 
sometimes, one pata may occur twice. If true kranti 
of moon is more than 23-1/2°, a pata may not 
occur. 


= 25.4 days approximately 


Verses 16-20 : Sthila pata for present ayanaméa. 


At present (1869 AD - writing of book), 
ayanaméa is. 22°. (It can be almost same in 1996 
also with only 1° difference). Hence in sukla (24th 
yoga) and vrddhi (11th yoga), vaidhrti 3rd quarter 
and vyatipata Ist quarter often fall. That is their 
madhyama time. 


Hence, we assume the Sukla yoga and vrddhi' 
yoga as cakra (21,600) and cakrarddha (10,800 kala) 
aproximately. On the day of that yoga, we calculate 
accurate value of sun and moon (at the end of 
these yoga times). Ayanam$Sa is added to both sun 
and moon. Then we find the difference of (sayana 
sun+moon) from (10,800) or (21,600) Kala. That will 
be divided by sum of’sun and moon gatis and 
multiplied by 60 to get time in danda etc. (It can 
be calculated from proportionate duration of cur- 
rent yoga also) This time is added to time of sukla 
or vrddhi yoga if (sun+moon) was less than that, 
otherwise it will be substracted. 


‘Mahapata Varnana 737 


After successive approximations, sum of 
sayana sun and sayana moon will be equal to 6 
or 12 rasis at the calculated time. Then we calculate 
the Sara of moon. 

These yogas are not visible, hence drkkarma 
or lambana, nati are not needed for moon. Pata is 
calculated from earth’s centre only. 


Notes : According to method described after 
verse 15, the yogas at the times of pata have been 
calculated (based on madhya kranti of moon, 
assuming zero Sara), for 22° ayanam$a. At present 
also for 23-1/2° ayanamia, it is almost same. 

Accurate time of madhyama pata is found by 
method of successive approximation. 


Verses 21-33 - Pata from sphuta kranti 
(From Strya siddhanta) - In odd quadrants, 
.if:sphuta kranti of moon (i.e. kranti of its ecliptic 
Eee corrected for sara) is more than kranti of 
»,8un, then pata has already passed. If sphuta kranti 
«is less, then pata is yet to come. In even quadrants 
sf sphuta kranti of moon is more than kranti of 
sun, then pata is to come, if it is less then pata 
..has passed. 

Persons conversant with gola (spherical 
trigonometry) can know the time of sphuta pata 
‘ through their methods. But detailed calculation 
: method is explained for common men. 


When sum of rasis of sun and moon (both 

' Sdyana) is exactly squal to cakra or cakrardha kala 

(21,600 or 10,800 minutes), then if pata has lapsed, 
Aen 60 danda is substracted from that (mean pata) 

me. If pata is yet to occur, then 60 danda is 


738 Siddhanta Darpana 


added to that time. For that revised time, we 
calculate sun, moon’s pata and Sara and difference 
between sphuta kranti of sun and moon. If sign 
of (candra kranti - sun kranti) has changed after 
this revised time then, pata has occured during 
this 60 danda interval. If sign is same, then pata 
is beyond that interval. 


To find the correct time of pata, we find the 
difference of krantis of sun and moon, both at the 
mean pata time and at interval fo 60 danda. If 
they are of different sign, they are added. If 
difference is of same sign their difference is taken. 
This will ‘be the first kranti gati for finding pata. 


First kranti difference in kala is multiplied by 
60 and divided by first kranti gati. Quotient in 
danda etc is added to mean pata time, if pata was 
to come and substracted from it, if pata had already 
passed. 


At first corrected pata time, we again find the 
kranti difference of sun and moon and find the 
second kranti gati kala. Kranti difference of Ist 
corrected pata time is multiplied by the time 
difference and divided by second kranti gati. By 
the result in ghati etc, we again correct the Ist 
corected pata time. Kranti gati is found by 
multiplying the change in kranti difference by 60 
and dividing by the time difference. 

By repeating this process, by successive 
approximation we get the time of mid-pata. Last 
kranti gati wil be the gati of kranti antara at mid 
pata time.

Notes : (1) Whether pata has gone or not - 


In figure 2, VBAC is the ecliptic where V is 
“ vernal equinox. (or sayana mesa 0°) and A is 
"autumnal equinox. B and C are solstice points in 
“summer and winter at 90° from these. Thus the 
_ 3, 2, 3, 4th quadrants from V are VB, BA, AC and 
* CV in the direction of motion shown by arrows. 


ie When moon is in odd quadrant (VB or AC), 
«eg. M in VB, then for vyatipata sun is at S; so 
: that VM = AS; and VM+VS; = VM + VA - AS = 
‘’VA = 180°. Similarly for vaidhrti, sun will be at

2nd or 4th quadrants i.e. in even quadrants.

* is zero, in VB portion it increases in north direction 
«and in AC portion in south direction. Thus the 
«.kranti increases in VB and AC which are odd 
: - quadrants and decreases in the even quadrants BA 
F, _ and CV. 

, Thus when moon is in odd quadrant and its 
; true kranti is more than sun (when madhya kranti 
* is equal) then kranti of moon will further increase 
and sun will decrease for even quadrant. Hence 
wed will be equal at an earlier time i.e. pata had 


740 Siddhanta Darpana 


already passed. If moon’s true kranti is less than 
sun, it will increase and sun’s kranti will decrease 
and they will be equal after some time. Hence pata 
will come after some time. 

When moon is in even quadrant, sun will be 
in odd, hence moon kranti will be decreasing and 
sun kranti will be increasing. If moon’s kranti is 
more, it will be equal to sun after some time and 
spasta pata will come. If moon’s kranti is less, pata 
has already passed. 

This analysis has considered increase of only 
mean kranti of ecliptic point. Sara of moon also 
changes, which will change the true kranti. Hence, 
for correct calculation, moon’s Sara also has to be 
calculated. 

Suppose moon in first quadrant has 5° north 
Sara (maximum value). Then its true kranti at 
madhyama pata will be 5° more than sun. Moon's 
pata decreases at average rate of 5/6.8 degrees 
perday, because its quarter revolution is in 27.3/4 
= 6.8 days. Kranti of sun will decrease and madhya 
kranti of moon will increase at the rate of 23.5/91 
= 1/4° per day approximately. Hence total increase 
in moon’s Kranti will be 5/6.8 + 1/4 + 1/4 per day 
= 1.24° per day compared to sun. Thus the true 
pata will be about 4 days before madhyama pata. 
Suppose it is vaidhrti pata. If previous vaidhrti is 
3 days later, then they will be in 25-7 = 18 days 
and in 12 days of the month another pata can 
occur. Thus there will be two vyatipata which 
comes about 12 days after vaidhrti and one has 
already passed between two vaidhrtis. 


Mahdpata Varnana 741 


(2) Calculation of true pata time 


To To + 60 T1 


Fig - 3a 


Figure 3 - Calculation of true pata time 


To is the madhyama pata time when mad- 
hyama kranti of sun and moon are equal. But the 
true krantj of sun and moon are unequal due to 
Sara of moon. Let ATo be the difference of kranti 
-of moon and sun at time To (it is negative if kranti 
‘of moon is less). To make a first aproximation of 
true’ kranti time, we calculate the: position at 60 
ghati difference according to the pata time is earlier 
or later. Then kranti difference is BB’ where B’ 
indicates time To + 60 danda. When kranti 
difference has same direction i.e. at O (To) and B’ 
moon-sun kranti) is both positive or negative, the 
;true kranti will be equal at time C outside B’ i.e. 
outside the interval of To to To + 60. We assume 
‘here that kranti difference has same gati (or rate 
‘of change), hence it will be zero where line AB 
‘Cuts the line OB’ where kranti diff. is zero. This 
‘ts shown in figure 3(a). 

Figure 3(b) shows that the sign of kranti diff. 
changes. Then AB line cuts OB’ between the 
anterval at C. 


742 Siddhanta Darpana 


In both the figures we draw a line BA’ parallel 
to OB’ which cuts AO (or AO extended in fig b) 
at A’. Then AA’ is change in Kranti diff. in 60 
danda time. Here AA’ = AO-BB’ = diff of kranti 
diff in fig (a) when kranti difference has same sign. 

AA’ = AO + OA’ = AO + BB’ = sum of kranti 
diff. in figure (b) when they are of different signs. 

Thus speed of kranti diff. is AA’/60 in each 
danda. Hence it will be zero in time Tp Ti 


AO X 60 
AA’ 


Here AA’ is the gati of kranti antara in 1 day 
or Ist kranti gati. 


Thus we correct the madhya pata time 
according to difference of kranti antara in 1 day. 


By calculating the kranti difference again at 
point T, we get more accurate value of true pata. 


_ (3) Surya siddhanta has given another 
method, using difference of moon from rahu. Here 
we have not described the method of calculating 
$ara of moon, which is necessary for sphuta kranti. 
Sara depends upon bhuja jya of difference between 
moon and rahu, hence, we take this as difference 
of sphuta kranti in stirya siddhanta. 


danda 


Verses 34-42 - Sparsa and mokéa of pata. 


This was the time, centres of moon and sun 
were having same kranti i.e. mid point of pata. 
When the first points of moon and sun have equal 
kranti, this is called sparsa time as in eclipse and 
When the last point has equal kranti it is mokéa 
time. Thus full pata time is from sparsa to mokéa. 


Mahépita Varnana 743 


Now, method to find sparsa and mokéa time is 
being ‘described. 

Like method of lunar eclipse, we find the 
birnba of moon and sun at mid time of true pata 
and add their semi diameters (manaikyardha). Sum 
of semi-diameters is multiplied by 60 and divided 
by last kranti gati (i.e. kranti difference gati at mid 
pata time). 

Result will be madhyama sthiti ardha time in 
danda. By adding to pata mid time, we get mokSa 
time and by substracting we get the sparéa time. 

At these approximate times of sparsa (or 
mokSa), we again find the difference between 
sphuta krantis. If this is less then manaikyardha 
(sum of semidiameters of sun and moon) then 
sparsa time has passed (or mokSa time is to come), 
as the kranti difference decreases from sparSa time 
(equal to manaikyardha) to mid time of pata, where 
it is zero. When kranti antara is more than 
manaikyardha, then sparga is to come (or mokéa 
time has passed). 


Kranti antara at sparsa (or mok$Sa) time 
multiplied by 60 and divided by madhya sthiti 
ardha will give Ist kranti antara gati at sparsa (or 
mokéSa) 

Manaikyardha vikala at sparsa (or mok§a) is 
divided by first kranti antara gati at sparéa. It will 
give sthiti ardha for sparsa (or mok$a) in danda. 
By substracting them (or adding) to mid pata time, 
we get the time of sparSa (or mok§a) - Ist sphuta 
value. 


744 Siddhanta Darpana 


Now at the first sphuta value of sparSa (or 
moka), kranti antara kala is multiplied by second 
sthiti ardha time in ghati for spargsa (or mokSa). 
We get second kranti antara gati at sparsa (or 
mok$Sa). Again we can get second sphuta value of 
sparsa (or mok&Sa) times and _ sthitiardha. By 
successive approximation, we get the steady wale 
of sthiti ardha etc. 


Figure 4 - Sparsa and mokéa of pata 


Notes : In figure 4, fictitious joining of sun 
and moon have been shown. Kranti’s are equal in 
a pata, but they may be in different direction. They 
have been shown in same direction. Sun and moon 
are always in adjacent quadrants for pata as shown 
in figure 2, but they are shown at one place for 
explaining equality of kranti of different parts of 
sun and moon. At point O, kranti of centres of 
sun and moon are equal. Hence, it is mid time of 
pata. When centres of moon and sun are at Mi 
and S;, their kranti antara is M; S; and discs touch 
each other at T;. Kranti difference is moving along 
M; OM2. At position M2, S2, the discs just touch 
at To. 


Thus before M; or after M2 position, the 
krantis of no part of sun and moon will be same 
and there will be no pata. Between these positions, 


Mahapata Varnana 745 


some point of moon will have same kranti as some 
point of sun, hence it will be pata. 


It is clear that at sparsa time 

Kranti antara M;S; = MyT) + Ti S; 

= semi diameters of (sun + moon). 

Similarly at mokéa time also it will be equal 
‘to manaikyardha. 

First we calculate the approximate position S, 
_ $2 from the kranti antara gati at O. Then we correct 
it with the gati at approximate positions of S; and 
S2 to get more correct value. By repeating this 
process, we get the accurate value. 

This is only a diagram to explain equality of 
kranti of different points, there is no closeness of 
.sun or moon as in ecliptic. 


Verses 43-45 : Effects of pata - According to 
Surya siddhanta the time of pata from beginning 
to end is fiery like burning fire and all auspicious 
works like marriages, sacred thread ceremony etc 
are prohibited during this. 


Pata arises due to equality of kranti’s of sun 
and moon. That destroys all results of noble deeds. 


By knowing the period of pata, penances like 
bath, charity, mantra, Sraddha, worship, offers in 
fire all give good results, as on the occasion of 
eclipse. 

Verses 46-49 : Duration of pata 


Average duration of pata is two prahara or 
15 danda. Minimum duration is 9 danda and 
maximum duration is 2/20 days. 


746 Siddhanta Darpana 


When ucca and pata of moon is in the last 
part of 12th rasi (mina), sayana sun is near mina 
and sayana moon is near kanya, then pata duration 
is minimum. 

When candra, its ucca, and pata all are at 
beginning of karka rasi, sayana sun is at the end 
of dhanu rasi, then pata is for maximum duration. 


If pata of candra is between mithuna 28° to 
karka 1° instead of karka beginning, then there is 
minimum time between two equalities of krantis 
(i.e. mahapatas). If at the end of ayana, spasta 
kranti of moon is more than 28°, then krantis 
cannot be equal. 


Notes : (1) Here pata has been used as short 
form of two mahapatas - Vaidhrti and vyatipata 
when kranti of sun and moon are equal. But pata 
means the point of inter section of a planets orbit 
with ecliptic which is sun’s orbit. For moon’s orbit, 
pata’s are called rahu or katu. As in case of all 
orbits, the pata point after which planet starts 
having north sara, the ascending node (rahu) is 
pata of moon. 


When moon, its ucca and .its pata are in 
beginning of karka i.e. 90°, then sun in 270° will 
cause vaidhrti. Then moon has almost zero Sara 
and its true north kranti is equal to sun kranti in 
opposite south direction. Speed of krantis will be 
slowest and speed of moon also will be slowest 
near its ucca, hence its pata will be longest. 


If moon pata is between mithuna 28° to karka 


1° (i.e. 88° to 91°) then within this movement of 
3° pata, just before pata position moon kranti will 


Mahdapata Varnana 747 


be less then 23-1/2° equal to kranti of sun before 
270°. After pata, Sara of moon will rapidly increase 
and spasta kranti will be equal to sun kranti 
maximum at 270°. Hence next pata will come 
earliest. 


Opposite to the longest pata, moon at 180° 
and sun at 360° (vyati pata), if ucca and pata of 
moon are near 360," then speed of moon is 
maximum, 0° kranti period will be for lowest period 
as kranti speed is maximum at 0° kranti and Sara. 
hence pata is of smallest duration. 


For such situations, maximum and minimum 
periods of patas have already been given. 


(2) Maximum kranti of sun can be only upto 
23-1/2° in either direction. However, due to Sara, 
moon can have kranti upto 28-1/2° due to its 
parama Sara of 5°, when madhya kranti and Sara 
both are maximum and in same direction. Then 
.moon’s kranti will be between 23-1/2 to 28-1/2° and 
sun’s kranti will be always less than 23-1/2°. Hence 
true krantis can not be equal and there can be ng 
true pata, though madhya pata will occur. 


Verses 50-54 : Gola and ayana for pata 


For calculating true pata, Sara of moon 
changes due to its orbit (distance from its pata 
rahu). But madhya krdanti is same as kranti of sun 
in that ayana. At gola sandhi (zero Sara) sphuta 
kranti doesn’t change due to Sara. But in ayana 
sandhi (maximum kranti but least kranti speed), 
kranti gati changes due to Sara gati. Reason is that 
kranti gati is more in gola sandhi (at equator) and 
least in ayana sandhi (maximum kranti position). 


748 Siddhanta Darpana 


In south and north gola, north south motion 
of moon due to Sara doesn’t change its total kranti 
gati. Being deflected north or south due to pata, 
moon still continues its motion on kranti vrtta. It 
is not affected, whatever maybe the value of Sara. 


Varahamihira has described gola and ayana 
system for mahapatas very logically in his 
Brhatyatra book. 

Notes : This is an objective description and 
needs no further comment. Brhatyatra is not a well 
known book of Varahamihira who has written three 
texts in three branches of jyotisa - Brhatsamhita 
(Samhita), Brhatjataka (astrology - phalita) and 
Parca siddhantika (astronomy). 


Verses 55-58 : Inauspicious times 

In grahasphuta - chapter 5, 27 yogas have 
been described according to sum of rasi etc of sun 
and moon. Out of them 27th yoga is vaidhrti and 
17th is vyati pata. These yogas are very fiery 
because sun and moon become very angry, their 
aspects being inclined at same angle to equator, in 
same manner as two bullocks become angry when 
they are forced to move together round a pole for 
crushing oil seeds or separating grain chaff. 


From Surya siddhanta - Last quarters of aSlesa, 
jyestha and revati - rasi and nakSatra both have 
their borders. Hence last quarters (1/4th part) of 
these nakSatras is called ganda. Half of first quarter 
(first 1/8th part) of next nakSatras (magha, mila 
and agvini) are called gandanta. 


All auspicious works are prohibited in sandhi 
(junction) of raSis. Last navamSa of karka, vrscika 


._Mahapata Varnana 749 


and mina rasi are in mina rasi. First navam§a of 
next raSis (sinha, dhanu and mesa) falls in mesa 
rasi. Hence all these navaméa are also bad. Like 
gandanta, these navaméa also fall in the junction 
of rasi and nakSatra, hence good works are 
prohibited in them. Visti (bhadra) etc bad karanas 
are also to be avoided. 


Notes : This has nothing to do with ganita 
jyotisa. This can be considered use of these 
calculations of pata, naksatra karana and yoga. 


Sarya siddhanta explains that 3 vyati patas, 
3 rasi sandhi and 3 nakSatra sandhi all are very 
bad. 


Here 3 types of vyatipata are - mahapata called 
vyatipata and vaidhrti, yogas named vyati pata and 
vaidhrti. Mahapata are of two types - one from 
mean value of kranti and one from true kranti, 
hence three types of vyatipatas. 


12 raSis or 27 nakSatras both are equal to 360° 
or full circle. Hence 1 ragi is equal to 2-1/4 = 9/4 
nakgatras. Thus when 4 raSis are complete, 9 
naksatras also are completed, and their junctions 
combine. 


To tally rasi with nakSatra, each nakSatra is 
divided into 4 quarters, so that each rasi has 9 
quarters. Each rasi is also divided into 9 parts 
called navamsa. Thus, 1 navamSa = 1 quarter 
nakSatra = 3°20’. Navaméa also is counted like rasi 
starting with Ist navam§éa of mesa as mesa, 2nd 
navamsa as vrsa etc. 


Thus at the and of 4, 8, 12 raSis, 9th, 18th 
and 27th nakSatras i.e. mina navamSa is completed. 
Next navamfa i.e. Ist navaméa of 5, 9 Ist raSis are 


750 Siddhanta Darpana 


mesa navam$Sa. According to rules stated, last 
quarter of 9th, 18th and 27th rasis or first half 
quarters of next nakSatras are bad. If a child is 
born during this period (i.e. if moon is in ganda 
or gandanta nakSatra), that nakSatra is worshipped 
when it comes again (on 27th day of birth). 


As the seventh day sunday was not meant 
for work in christianity, 7th karana visti is not 
good for starting any important work or for 
proceeding on a journey. It is also called bhadra 
(meaning good - probably for holiday purpose). 


Verses 59-62 : Comments on the siddhanta 
methods - Brahma took 47,400 divine years in 
creation of world, which is called srsti kala (creation 
period). From next day after creation, revolutions 
of graha, their ucca and pata etc started. Hence it 
has aheady been stated that for calculation of graha 
etc, the years of creation will be deducted from 
the years counted from beginning of kalpa. 


After completion of creation, caitra $sukla 
pratipada was the first tithi. Then sun was rising 
in Yamakotipattana and it was mid night in Lanka. 
This day was named as ravivara (sunday). From 
that instant Brahma left graha, ucca and pata to 
move in their orbits from first point of aévini 
nakSatra: (mesa 0°) From that time only days, 
months, years, kranti and revolutions of graha etc 
started. They had not started from start of day of 
Brahma (called kalpa). From that time, only ghati 
(1/60 of a civil day), yuga and manu etc started. 

Sages like ParaSara have described king, 
ministers and protectors of the years, clouds like 
drona and puSskara, rulers of grains etc, parts of 


Mahdapata Varnana 751 


fire, rain and deceases, raja yoga etc for predicting 
ood or bad results of future. Sometimes, they 
ive the said results, sometimes they don’t. Due 
to that, these have not been described here, as in 
other siddhanta texts. 


Sun and moon complete their revolutions at 
the end of every yuga and also in 1/4th part of 
yuga. During a quarter of yuga (10,80,000 years), 
savana ahargana (civil days) are (39,44,79,457). At 
the end of dvapara, srstyabda (years since creation 
end) was (1,95,58,80,000). This divided by years of 
‘a quarter yuga (10,80,000) gives quotient (1811) and 
zero remainder. hence there is no need to state 
dhruva (positions) of sun and moon at the end of 
dvapara (after complete revolutions they are again 
at start of mesa 0°). 


Verses 63-66 : Start of Karana for this book 


From beginning of creation to dvapara end, 
past years (years completed at entry of mean sun 
‘in mesa) were (1, 95, 58, 80, 000), and at (4970) 
completed years in kali (1869 AD - Karanabda) the 
aharganas are (7, 14, 40, 22, 96, 627) and (18, 15, 
334) from creation and kali. Both are correct as 
checked by vara (weekdays). 


At beginning of karanabda, when mean sun 
_had entered mesa, first day according to mean 
. value (sun and moon) was caitra sukla pratipada. 
The dhruva stated for that day (mean positions at 
' beginning of year), when added to daily motion 
‘for lapsed days, becomes dhruva of madhyama 
- graha acording to surya siddhanta. Ahargana of 
karanabda starts with tuesday (mangala vara). 


752 Siddhanta Darpana 


The day before beginning of karanabda has 
been assumed monday. That day was caitra sukla 
pratipada. (mean speed). According to Spasta 
position it was vaisakha adhimdasa (extra month) 
pratipada. Hence the day before start of karanabda 
is correct caitra pratipada according to mean speed 
and monday, which is convenient day for stating 
dhruvas. 


From starting point of karanabda, (18, 15, 
334-15) days before, kaliyuga had started at mid 
night at Lanka. According to ancient authorities, 
that was caitra Sukla pratipada by mean positions. 
Again first day of karanabda is in vaisakha by true 
position. To find this caitra Sukla pratipada, dhruva 
at the end of dvapara is to be added. Thus the 
dhruva have to be stated after specifying whether 
it is for mean time or true time. 


Vikrama years = Kali years - 3044 

Saka years ~ = Vikrama years - 135 
Bhasvati year = Saka years - 1021 
Bhaskara If years = Bhasvati - 51 
Kuchanna year = Bhaskara II year - 148 
Darpana year = Bhaskara II years - 719 


Verses 67-68 : Importance of Siddhanta etc. 

The text which calculates graha from number 
of days since creation is called siddhanta. 

The text calculating graha from days since 
yuga beginning is called ‘tantra’. 

The text which starts its count of days from 
beginning of Saka year or any convenient year 
nearby is called ‘karana.’ 


Mahapata Varnana 753 


Siddhanta Darpana contains all the three 
methods. 


- On seeing a knower of siddhanta, papa (result 
of bad work) done in ten days is destroyed. Knower 
of tantra destroys 3 days papa and karana knower 
destroys 1 days papa. The man who beats his drum 
about time without knowing jyotisa is a multiple 
loafer. 


Verses 69-70 : Discussion of dhruva etc. 


Many astronomers like Bhaskara saw that 
moon is 3 rasi ahead of sum in half fortnight, 
hence they added 1/3rd of the nakSatra dhruva. 
They had not observed it directly. Many 
astronomers differ about starting point of mesa 0°. 
I have not accepted them in absence of proof. 


Current age of Brahma has been assumed to 
be 50 years by some, or 58-1/2 years by others. 
This has no importance for any practical use, 
because graha is calculated from the current day 
' (kalpa) of Brahma. We should be satisfied with 
that only. 


Verses 71-73 : Prayer and end. 


Lord Jagannatha is ocean of mercy for uplift 
of down-trodden and is beloved husband of 
LakSmi, daughter of ocean. He has thrown my 
mind out of his bhajana, so dear to me, into the 
market of mathematics. He may provide shelter to 
my intellect, so that it doesn’t lose its way in hard 
work. 


Thus ends the fifteenth chapter describing 
pata in siddhanta darpana written as a text book 


754 Siddhanta Darpana 


and for accurate calculations by Sri CandraSekhara 
born in famous royal family of Orissa. 


Thus first half of siddhanta darpana is 
complete which contains 3 adhikaras containing 15 
chapters where correct siddhanta and accurate 
planetary calculation has been described for hap- 
piness of the learned. 


Chapter - 16 


QUESTIONS ON METHODS 
4. GOLADHIKARA 


Verses 1-4 : Prayer and scope - 


By meditating on whose lotus feet, learned 
_men like Brahma, Vaégistha etc. often wrate new 
- siddhanta texts after seeing errors in earlier texts, 
: logically explained the questions by students and 
» even knowing all, wrote small texts like the author, 
‘I pray to the same lord of worlds Sri Jagannatha. 

I pray to the sun also who moves around 
-earth with mean velocity carrying all the planets 
_as a first among planets, removes misery of people 
“by providing light, as true position is epitom of 
‘three vedas, and is like eyes of grand cosmos. 

I pray my guru Sri Bhaskaracdrya (I) who 
wrote his siddhanta siromani, because earlier texts 

developed errors as shown by him, who revised 
_the new numbers of revolutions after seeing the 
-Brahas in his time, and who did a great work for 
:my benefit as well as of world at large. 

For lord Jagannatha staying at Nilacala, whole 
“world is a play field. He destroys sins. By keeping 
‘his radiance in my heart, I have completed 
ugrahaganita and start gola ganita with happiness 
vabo&it which old astronomers have written in detail. 

Notes (1) Scope - Now all the methods 
"pertaining to calculations of planets are over. Now 


756 Siddhainta Darpana 


all the doubts regarding the methods and assum- 
pitons will be explained. All the explainations arise 
from curiousity or doubts of students, hence first 
of all questions are framed. These are the doubts 
expressed by common people and critics, sup- 
porters of other theories and explainations for his 
new methods. All the questioners are symbolised 
as student. In astronomy, all the calculations are 
done on a spherical surface, as the planets and 
stars move on the imaginary celestial sphere. hence 
spherical trigonometry is the main instrument to 
explain the methods. Hence this part is named 
goladhikara, i.e. section on gola (sphere). After 
questions, this will explain the details of two golas 
- bha (earth) and bha (sky). 


(2) Purpose of writing new texts is to explain 
the changes and errors whch have developed in 
old texts. This is not to.say that earlier sages were 
at fault, they were knowing everything, but 
explained only those matters which were necessary 
at that time. 


(3) In addition to lord Jagannatha, ista deva 
of the author, all the ancient and_ recent 
propounders of the subject have been prayed. Out 
of 18 acaryas of jyotisa, Brahma and VaSsistha have 
been remembered first. Out of the traditional 18 
siddhantas, only 5 survive in panica siddhantika in 
which Brahma siddhanta is the oldest. The same 
brahma siddhanta was updated by Brahmagupta. 
VaSistha siddhanta is available in fragments in 
addition to 5  siddhantas explained by 
Varahamihira. In the current siddhantas, sury4 
siddhanta is the latest and most accurate and 
popular. Sun god has been prayed in three forms 


Questions on Methods 757 


- as acarya of sirya siddhanta, as god he is form 
of visnu and epitome of three vedas, and thirdly 
he is first among planets which move around him. 
Here it is assumed that mean sun moves around 
earth and all other planets move around it. 


Lastly, Bhaskaracarya (Il) has been prayed 
whose siddhanta Siromani has been largely fol- 
lowed in this book and who is considered guru 
by the author. 


Verses 5-11 : Importance of gola 


To explain gola ganita to layman, I have 
explained the statements of Bhaskaracarya, and 
sometimes quoted others also. Due to study of old 
texts, my ideas also have emerged. 


(Rest from siddhanta siromani) By not know- 
ing true meaning of mean and true planets and 
secrets of mathematics, astronomer remains con- 
fused and he is not respected in society of the 
‘learned. I am writing this ‘gola’ text so that secrets 
of astronomy are as clearly seen as an ‘amala’ fruit 
kept in palms. 


An astronomer is useless without knowledge 
* of mathematics in same way as food of all tastes 
is without ghee (butter), state without king and a 
Symposium without learned speaker. 


A clever speaker may tell a lot to gathering 
f learned even without clear knowledge of 
‘grammer. But finally he is humiliated with sarcastic 
emarks and glances. Similarly, an astronomer 
Without gola knowledge also becomes a matter of 
ke when he fails to understand many questions 
nd secret statements. 


758 Siddhanta Darpana 


Gola (sphere) is a model to understand the 
location and size of earth, planets and stars. Gola 
has been considered an independant subject which 
can be understood only through mathematics. 


Predictions of astrology have been considered 
authentic according to old astronomers. Predictions 
are according to lagna, and lagna is according to 
position of planet (earth). Without knowing true 
positions of planets, predictions cannot be made 
only from lagna. All planets move on celestial 
spehre only. Hence knowledge of gola is necessary 
for ‘calculating true positions of planets. Gola can 
be understood only by mathematics. Thus a person 
cannot understand jyotisa without knowing math- 
ematics. 


Mathematics is of two types-‘vyakta’ (i.e. 
concrete - arithmatic and applied mathematics) and 
‘avyakta’ (abstract - pure mathematics like algebra, 
-geometry). After knowing these two types of 
mathematics and grammer, one can read and 
understand jyotisa. Without them, he is a name- 
sake astronomer only. 

Notes : Modern branch of gola is spherical 
trigonometry. Spehre is a model in the sense, that 
it is a coordinate system. For stars and planets, 
we only measute the direction and distance is 
immaterial. Hence they can be observed as points 
on a spherical surface which are from same distance 
from observer. 

Knowledge of gola needs calculation methods 
(vyakta or pati ganita) and avyakta (abstract) ganita 
like trigonometry, algebra etc. Grammer is needed 
to understand the text of jyotisa and to describe 
it correctly in own words.

Verses 12-39 : Doubts about earth 


Now sky, earth and nakSatras are being 
described as dialogue between student and teacher, 
so that all secrets are explained. (12) 


(Student) : O Teacher ! you have explained 
‘about graha ganita and gola in your nectar like 
voice. But you have discussed views of many 
| Acaryas with too much description of scriptures. 
.These various branches of thoughts have only 
increased my doubts, instead of clearing it (13-14) 

Earth according to puranas ; Long ago, at 
beginning of creation, the creator formed earth for 
our living. First, explain me its clear form and 
location (15) - (question 1). 

After that only, I can really understand the 
celestial sphere and planetary orbits. (16) 


Puranas have described earth in shape of a 
circle. This earth has been held by varaha, snake 
: (Sesanaga) and kacchapa etc. Area of earth is 50 
crore yojanas (17). 
In central portion there is Jambi dvipa of 1 
lakh yojana extent (area) which is surrounded on 
. all sides by salt-water ocean (18) 
At centre of Jambu dvipa, there is meru 
; Mountain, 84,000 yojana above surface and 16000 
» yojana below surface (19). 


Beyond Jambiidvipa, there are two other 
dvipas surrounding it and surrounded by oceans 
which are successively of double sizes. (20) 

; . Outer most ring of puskara dvipa, has 
‘ &nasottara mountain in its centre in shape of « 
t Ting on which chariot of sun moves. (21) 


’ 
i 


760 Siddhanta Darpana 


Outside these dvipas and oceans there is 
lokéloka mountain whose surface is golden. That 
is surrounded by spherical shell of brahmanda. (22) 


At 1 lakh yojana from earth, sun rotates, 
when it is far and oblique, we see its rising or 
setting. (23) 

Above sun, planets like moon, mangala etc. 
move. Dhruva is above all, exactly above meru. 
Successively above dhruva are lokas like mahah, 
jana, tapa etc. (24) 

Bauddha view : NakSatras rotate around earth, 
hence base of earth is not located in any direction 
(otherwise it would have collided’ with nakSatras). 
Due to lack of a heavier base for earth, it is 
continuously falling down. (25) 


Jain view : According to jaina view, there are 
2 suns, 2 moons and 54 nakSatras in the sky. They 
rotate round 4 cornered pillar of meru and 
alternately enter and come out of water. Hence 
from meru, one of the two suns rises alternately. 
(26-27) 

Modern view : Sharp minded scholars of 
England tell that earth itself is elongated sphere 
and rotates round much bigger sun in elliptical 
orbits like other planets mangala etc. being attracted 
by sun (28-29) 

Thus one revolution of earth in east direction 
is completed in (365/15) days. Day and night are 
caused by earth’s rotation on its axis. (30) 

Thus due to two types of earth’s motion - 
daily and annual - day - night and year are caused 
respectively. Due to annual rotation of earth, it iS 
at different place each day. (31) 


Questions on Methods 761 


Due to earth’s attraction towards its centre, 
people do not fall in any direction. As the persons 
in a moving boat think their boat as fixed and 
mountains moving, similarly on moving earth 
people feel earth as fixed and graha, nakSatras as 
moving. (32) When earth is in mesa beginning 
(from sun), sun is seen in tula beginning. Due to 
inclination of north south axis of rotation, sun has 
north or south kranti. (33) 


Planets in increasing order of distance from 
sun are budha, Ssukra, earth, mangala, guru and 
Sani. Due to increasing distance, their speed 
becomes slower. They rotate around sun with their 
own speeds. (34) 


Small satellites revolve round planets and due 
to being attached with planets, they revolve round 
sun also. For example, moon is a satellite of earth 
in orbit round it. Along with earth, moon also 
rotates round sun. (35) 


As on earth, on other planets also seasons 
change due to difference in light and heat for 
different positions in orbit round sun, (36) 


On this assumpiton, planetary motions, 
eclipse etc. can be calculated from earth’s position. 
Small objects move around bigger object due to its 
attraction, this is logical explaination of planetary 
orbits, (37) 

Other old theories - According to other old 
theories (both in India and outside), earth is fixed 
m space and is surounded by the orbits of moon, 
mercury, venus, sun, mangala, jupiter and saturn. 


762 Siddhanta Darpana 


Aryabhata I, stated that earth moves at its 
own place; i.e. rotates around its axis. Hence, 
persons living on earth rotating in east direction, 
feel that nakSatras are moving in west direction. 
(39) 

Notes : Purpose of stating these theories is 
to know as to which of the theories is correct and 
why ? 


Verses 40-45 : Other questions about earth 


(Student to his teacher) - Now you tell that 
sun rotates around earth alongwith planets in orbits 
round it. Moon also rotates round earth. (What is 
the correct position ?) (40) 


First you had stated that speeds of planets in 
yojanas is same. Now you tell that it is not equal. 
Why this new idea has come ! (41) 


There are many explainations about this 
creation by God, whch one is correct? What is the 
order of creation of planets? How earth was 
created? (42) 

Tell the size and base of earth. How many 
are the oceans, continents and mountains on earth? 
How many persons live on it? (43) 


Please tell the circumference, diameter, surface 
area and volume of earth. How the loka, graha 
and nakSatras are situated from earth one above 
the other? (44) 


How many living and inanimate beings live 
on surface of earth or below the suface ? Do similar 
creatures live on the surface of other planets like 
moon and mars also? (45) 


Questions on Methods 763 


Notes : These questions are similar to ques- 
tions in sarya siddhanta put by Maya to sun god, 
who taught sirya siddhanta. All siddhantas assume 
that linear speeds of all planets in yojanas is same, 
difference in angular speed is only due to change 
in distance from earth. According to this theory, 
sun was at 13.4 times distance of moon, because 

‘moon’s rotation round earth is 13.4 times faster. 
But Candrasekhara revised the diameter of sun 
.about 11 times the accepted value, hence its 
_distance also was increased 11 times because 
‘ angular diameter is same. Hence, ratio of sun 
, distance to moon distance has become 150 : 1 
| instead of 13 : 1 according to same linear speed. 

However, linear speed of other planets have been 
assumed to be same as sun. From part following 

: of equal yojana speed theory, a doubt about its 
correctness has arisen. 


: Merses 46-48 : Revision of bhaganas 


As the graha were not observed according to 
their kalpa bhaganas stated in old siddhantas, 
Aryabhata etc assumed other values of bhaganas 

. which gave correct observations. Bhaskara II etc 

again rejected them and determined their own 

values of bhaganas. But your bhaganas are again 
different from those of Bhaskara. It appears that 

_ bhaganas are not constant. Then what will be fate 

“of your values ? Wil it be revised by others 

pilikewise?

There are infinite number of stars in sky, still 
why the darkness doesn’t go in night as in day

sun reach ? How far the light of planets and star 
go ? (i.e. from how far can they be seen ?) (67) 


Verses 68-69 : Size of brahmannda 


According to §Sruti (veda), circumference of 
brahmanda is found by multiplying the savana dina 
numbers in a kalpa by daily speed of planets in 
yojana. But here, according to you, daily yojana 
speeds of planets is not same. Thus Sruti saying 
has been contradicted. Then how the circumference 
of brahmanda can be found according to you and 
what is its value? 


Notes : Basis of calculating the dimensions of 
brahmanda are two assumptions - (1) All planets 
move the total distance of circumference of 
brahmanda in a kalpa, and (2) Linear speeds of 
planets are same. Assumption (2) follows from first, 
as 

Circumference of brahmanda 

= Linear speed X savana dina in a kalpa 


Since savana dina and circumference are fixed; 
linear speeds of all planets are same. 


This assumption is similar to observation on 
quantum mechanics that very fast particles have

very small life period (rather half life), hence they 
travel almost the same distance during their life as 
‘we travel in our life, proportionate to our size. 
Approximately this holds correct, but time period 
and dimension are not in direct linear proportion. 

This principle has been rejected in siddhanta 
darpana as moon’s linear speed has been assumed 
11 times that of sun. Then what can be the basis 
of calculating the dimensions of brahmanda ?

Bhigola Sthiti Varnana 


Verses 1-2 - Scope - 

As an excuse to answer the questions raised 
by a good student, I attempt here answer to all 
in sanskrit through a discussion of the essence of 
scriptures. 

Now I establish the lack of movement of earth: 
and movement of sun and other planets and form 
of celestial spehre and spherical objects by three 
methods of proof - pratyakSa (direct), Sabda 
(quotation) and anumana (indication). - 

Notes : Purpose of this chapter is to describe 
location of earth in solar system. According to 
author, earth is fixed and the planets and sun 
move around it. Then, size of earth sphere and 
other planets are to be told. According to nyaya 
(logic) dar$ana, proofs (pramana) are of three kinds- 

(1) Pratyakéa - direct method or observation 

(2) Sabda - By accepting the authorities of 
vedic assertions (3) Anumana - Induction due to 
relation of cause and effect. To prove one’s. point 


through these methods is called vyavastha (estab- 
lishment). 


Verses 3-12 : Support for earth 


Centre of orbits of tara grahas budha, sukra, 
Mangala guru and Sani is sun, but it is not sphuta 


770 Siddhanta Darpana 


sun (actual position of sun) it is madhyama sun 
(its fictitious position with mean speed). Earth is 
at centre of orbit of this madhyama surya. 
Madhyama strya sometimes comes near to earth 
or goes far. At the centre of sky, earth is fixed 
with its own force. It is surrounded by orbits of 
sphuta sun, nakSatras and moon. (3) 

(Siddhanta Siromani) - Earth is filled with 
mountains, orchards, villages, brick structures, 
domes etc everywhere, in same manner as pollen 
grains fill the flower of kadamba. (4) 

This is my siddhanta (view) that earth is 
without any other base in centre of space, 
surrounded by orbits of sun, planets and 
nakSatra, and earth and all planets are spherical. 
I will prove this view by replying to questions 
of persons with different views. (5) 

(Surya siddhanta) Earth is situated in the 
middle of sky being fixed from all sides. Since it 
holds itself by holding power given by Brahma, it 
is called dharini (i.e. holder). (6) 

(Siddhanta Siromani) - If we assume somebody 
else as holder of earth, then a third will have to 
hold the holder, then third will be held by fourth 
and so on. At last we have to assume some abstract 
force only as final holder. To remove this defect 
in logic, there is no harm in considering the abstract 
force as holder of earth in beginning itself. Is the 
earth not a form of god of eight forms? (7) 

The incarnations of god like Karma had held 


the earth. That means that they held only a portion 
of earth, not the whole earth. (8) 


Location of Earth 771 


Mountains also hold only a part of earth, 
hence they are called ‘bhiidhara’ (i.e. holder of 
earth). Similar was the holding of earth by 
incarnations such as Kurma, due to which they 
are called bhusthayi etc. (9) 


When king of serpents (sesanaga) is tired of 
holding earth on his head, he takes rest by bowing 
his head, which causes earth quake. This sentence 
also doesn’t mean holding of the whole earth, but 
-only a part of it. (10) 

If Sesanaga holds only a part of earth, then 
‘why earthquakes occur in every part of earth ? Its 
-explaination is that the whole body shakes when 
yany limb of the body has vibration. Similarly, if 
;any part of earth shakes, the vibration spreads to 
- other parts also. (11) 

Any matter is small part of earth only, hence 
' earth attracts every matter. When it falls on earth, 
‘it gets a support and does not fall further. But 
“there is no attractor of earth in any particular 
, direction, so there is no reason for earth to go in 
_any direction. (12) 

Notes : Within solar system, earth and all 
: Other planets are held by sun due to its force of 
},attraction. The planets are in their fixed elliptical 
: Orbits because they are balanced by two forces - 
force of attraction towards sun (centripetal force) 
and force due to circular motion (centrifugal force) 
[ away from sun. 

It is doubtful if vedas claims that earth was 
fixed. It was merely a convenient assumption, 
because geocentric calculations are done by assum- 
xing earth as centre of coordinate system of celestial 


772 Siddhanta Darpana 


sphere. Assumption of earth as centre is merely 
for calculation of events as seen from earth. It 
doesn’t mean that earth is fixed and is centre of 
sky.

It is a philosophical question - what is the 
ultifnate support of universe? Attraction of sun 
holds the planets of solar system. Sun itself moves 
round the galactic centre (chapter on conjunction

particles of gas (theory of Sir J.H. Jeans). This is 
universally accepted, with minor effects between 
galaxies of a clusture. About the ultimate infinity 
we don’t know. Mach’s theory, incorporated in 
steady state theory of universe is that the gravita- 
tional attraction between matter bodies is result of 
presence of matter spreading to infinity. The 
mutual attraction among galaxies is balanced by 
expansion of universe - each galaxy is moving away 
from the other. Whether this attractions will be 
able to halt the expension and reverse it, needs a 
minimum density of matter. We are doubtful

be stated about spherical shape and circumference 
of earth? (22) - Quotation ends. 


If earth is plane instead of round, then speed 
of sun at far end in east will appear very slow as 
in case of a cloud. But there is no difference in 
motion of sun in east direction or in mid day. In 
all directions, speed of sun is uniform like motion 
of a golden bowl in water (used for measuring 
time - which water takes to fill the bowl through 
a hole). Thus it is concluded that earth is not plane 
but spherical (23-24). 


When a ship is approaching sea coast, first 
its top portion, then middle portion and at last 
the whole ship (above water) is seen. If earth is 
not spherical, plane surface of water wil not 
obstruct the vision like this. At the time of lunar 
eclipse also, shadow of earth covering moon at any 
.time is circular. Circular shadow at all times, proves 
that earth is spherical (25-26) 


If earth is plane, not spherical, then sun 
,would have risen at same time at all places from 
,east to west. There is time difference between 
sunrise at places east-west to each other, which 
proves spherical shape of earth. Increase or 
, decrease of phases of moon also is in circular shape 
_whch proves that moon also is spherical. On the 
_basis of Sastra and observation, ancient acaryas 
- have stated sun, nakSatras and all planets as 
. Spherical. (When all bodies in universe are spheri- 
“cal, earth also should be spherical - inductive 
inference) (27).

Earlier acaryas have stated the location of 
moon over sun and planets over nakSatra. This is 
when observed from heaven side, not according to 
revolving bodies. (29) 

Lord Krsna had shown world vision to Arjuna 
in KurukSetra, to Markandeya in water of deluge, 
and to king Dhrtarastra in his royal court. That 
spherical world is different from our earth. That 
vision and our earth are not same. (30-31) 


Hence, we are not concerned with the earth, 
mountains, oceans, sun and nakéatra etc which are 
described in puranas. Earth described in ganita 
jyotisa is different from that. (32) 

Notes : Spherical shape of earth is well proved 
and needs no further discussion. 

Reason of spherical surface of all planets and 
stars is that it is the equilibrium surface under a 
central gravitational field, hence liquid water of 
ocean maintains a spherical surface. Any deviation 
from that surface will cause a change in gravita- 
tional potential and there will be a force against 
that change to take it back to spherical shape. 


Due to rotation of all planets and sun 
(probably all other stars) also around their axis, 
they are elongated at the equator. Gaseous planets 
are flattened at axis more, they also rotate faster. 
Since gaseous molecules have more internal motion, 


Location of Earth 777 


they get move angular momenturm due to gravita- 
tional collapse. 


This causes correction in aksaméa, which has 
already been formulated in appendix to 
triprasnadhikara while calculating palallax. 


Verses 33-38 : Critism of Bauddha view 
(Siddhanta siromani quotation continues) O 
followers of Buddha! Your intellect is really dull. 
You clearly see that every bady thrown upwards, 
falls back on earth. Even then, how do you assume 
that earth is continuously falling down ? (33) 


(Notes - There is no up or down for earth, 
hence falling down of earth has no meaning. If 
earth also falls, then the falling object moving in 
same direction will not reach earth, assuming that 
speeds of both are same). 


You see the polar fish (star group containing 
north pole star) as centre of daily revolutions of 
nakSatra, sun and moon around it. Still you 
thoughtlessly tell that there are two suns, two 
moons and two set of 27 nakSatras. You are really 
worthless. (Quotation ends). (34) 

There is a star group in north sky in shape 
of a fish, called polar fish. In mouth of this there 
is pole star and a smaller star is in tail. The 
dhruvaprota through this smaller star in tail meets 
the ecliptic at 19° from visakha. Between mouth 
and tail star there are many stars in two rows. 
This tail star joins west horizon at sunset time 
while remaining in visakha nakSatra. At mid night, 
this is below pole star i.e. in south north circle 


778 Siddhanta Darpana 


(meridian). Again at sunrise time it joins the east 
horizon. It is clear from that, that there is only 
one sun. Even then, O Buddhist brothers, how do 
you imagine two suns ? (35-38) 

Notes : (1) Pofar fish - This group is called 
ursa minor in modern astronomy as it has same 
shape as ursa major (saptarsi mandala) but has 
smaller size. 

In Dhruva bhramanakhyatika, the polar fish 
is described as follows - 


Around that one sees a constellation of stars 
consisting of twelve stars and looking like a fish. 
It is named as the polar fish. From a distance, one 
sees a pair of bright stars, one at its mouth and 
the other at its tail. Star at the mouth is 3 degrees 
from pole and the star at tail in 9° away. 

The Persian scholar Al - Biruni says 

The Hindus tell it Sakvara and SiSumara also 
Sigumara is a great lizard, as it is called susmara 
in Persia. There is a similar aquatic species like a 
crocodile. 

Diurnal rotation of polar fish has been used 
to refute the Jain theory of two suns and two 
-moons rising alternately, by Brahmagupta, Lalla 
and Bhaskara II. It is not known as to why Bhaskara 
ascribed it to Buddhists. 


(2) Concept of two suns, moons etc. - The 
gatha in Jaina text Surya prajnapti lists daily 
observations of sun at the time of rising and setting, 
for the purpose of calculating mean tropical year. 


Location of Earth 779 


Position of two suns daily was noted (for sun set 
and sun rise). 
32" 32 


v v 
Q 


Figure 1 (a) _ Figure 1 (b) 


Hence two suns were thought wrongly. 
Average north south motion of sun is about 16’ 
per day (24 X, 2° in 180° uttarayana or 


" dakSinayana). Hence if the rotation of sun of 32’ 
* diameter sun forms a mandala (circular strip) then 
~ sun covers half a mandala each day as shown in 


b. 
fy 


i 


_ figure 1 (a). 

Due to two observations of sun each day, two 
suns were thought and Malayagiri wrongly inter- 
prated half mandala as half circular strips of 


- diameter width as in figure 1 (b). Thus one sun 


ay Uy, 


E. moves in upper mandala ABC one day, next day 
, it moves in lower mandala A’B’C’. Then after two 
i days, it will go to next mandala on upper side. 


Another reason of such interpretation is 


d system of calculation of obliquity of earth’s axis 


and declination of planets also on a flat surface. 
- It is similar to projection of earth’s map on a plane 
‘ paper. Then Jambi dvipa was the first concentric 
Circle from north pole to line of maximum north 


780 Siddhanta Darpana 


kranti of sun. Next concentric circles will have 
much larger areas on plane projection. That will 
be explained while explaining dimensions of mount 
meru. However, a separate map will have to be 
prepared for south hemisphere, resulting in 
another sets of sun, moon and stars. 


It may be noted that increasing sizes of 
concentric circles are due to projection on plane. 
Radius of Jambudvipa is 50,000 yojana and height 
of meru is 1 lakh yojana out of which 1000 is 
below surface. That gives attitude of pole star meru 
from 24°N, which is periphery of Jamba dvipa. 
According to this system area of Jambidvipa will 
be about 75 crore (yojanas)* out of which polar 
area is to be reduced to make it about 50 crore 
(yojana)*.. This is the value stated in verse 13 of 
this chapter. 


Verses 39-78 Arguments against motion of earth- 


If your intellect is sharp, and according to 
you, Sun is fixed and earth is moving, then you 
will be contradicted by your own theory and will 
be defeated in the logic. Hence, stop your illogical 
‘talks and listen to me. (39) 


Everybody in this world sees earth without 
any movement, hence fixed earth is directly proved 
by observation (pratyaksa pramana). Similarly mo- 
tion of sun also is seen clearly. Hence, what is the 
use of assuming sun as fixed and earth as moving 
_? 40) 

(1) First logic for earth motion - A person 
sitting in a boat moving in current of the river, 
sees the trees on river bank moving opposite to 
motion of boat. He also sees that an object thrown 


Location of Earth 781 


upwards, comes back to him, as if boat is fixed. 
Similarly, from moving earth, we see both events. 
Due to motion of earth, fixed stars and sun etc 
appear moving in opposite direction. From earth 
also any object thrown upwards comes back. If 
this is the logic for thinking motion of earth, then 
listen to refutation. (41) 

Refutations - If wind is blowing from east and 
if a person keeps a silk flag on a pole, will the 
flag always be towards west ? Does the motion of 
wind happen only from east towards west, due to 

_ eastward rotation of earth on its axis) ? (42) 

(2) Establishing fixed earth - According to 
_jyotisa, pravaha wind moves the nakéatras one 
round daily from east to west. If you refute that 
the planets cannot move to east compared to 
nakéatras, then listen to the answer. On earth also 
clouds and birds can move east-wards even when 
wind is towards west. Similarly the stars are rotated 
towards west, but planets can move eastwards due 
to their own power. (43) 


(3) Sabda pramana for fixed earth - Ancient 
acaryas and knowers of veda have told the earth 
as fixed. If you don’t accept this, how you can be 
inclined towards pious work ? (44) 


You may tell that world is called ‘Jagat’ 
meaning always moving. But it has other explaina- 
tions also. World including heavens, living world; 
lower words, is destroyed in 4 types of pralaya 
(deluge or destruction). In that sense only, ear 
is called ‘jagat’, meaning that it will be gone or 
destroyed. (45) 


782 Siddhanta Darpana 


If you interprate the other meaning only, then 
please tell - why earth was called ‘acala’ and 
‘sthira’? (Both mean fixed). In addition, it holds 
everything, hence it is called ‘dhara’ also. (46) 


(4) Logical inference for fixed earth - 


If you do not accept-the vedic statement as 
truth or standard, only due to your argumentative 
nature, then I am stating logical proof also to prove 
the opinion of stirya siddhanta or Bhaskara II. (47) 


(1) Your assertion is that under attraction of 
sun the planets like budha move in their orbits in 
addition to moving on their axis. Similarly, earth 
also moves on its axis and in its orbit round sun. 
(48) 

You also say that a body moves only under 
action of force and there are two types of force 
(on heavenly bodies) - Forces of attraction towards 
centre (centripetal force) and force of repulsion 
away from, centre (centrifugal force due to circular 
motion). (49) 

In that case both the forces should be in earth 
also, because earth must have been created first, 
due to abundance of atoms in it. But we do not 
see the repulsion force of earth. Similarly, no other 
object on earth moves on its axis on its own. (50). 
We have not seen a stone rotating on its axis even 
for a moment, when it is thrown upwards. But on 
plane surface, a round object like wheel is seen 
rolling. (51) 

(Forces towards centre and opposite) - A 
round body is rotated by tying it with rope, 
exerting force by hand. When it is separated from 
rope, then it moves away, and only force on it is 


Location of Earth 783 


attraction towards centre of earth. Thus we see 
only two forces - repulsion by hand, and attraction 
by earth. We do not see its rotation on axis or 
forces of attraction and repulsion both in hand. 
(52) 

(Axial motion) Similarly, if earth is moving 
due to forces of attraction and repulsion by sun 
on its centre, then motion of earth should always 
be in the direction of sun. Then there should 
always be light on one side of earth and darkness 
on the other side. (53) If earth rotates round sun 
in this manner, then the region on equator where 
there is day, there would have been no night and 
at night places, there would have been no day. 
(54) 

(2) You may argue that axial rotation of earth 
is like rolling of a round object like wheel on plane 
surface. But this statement also is contradicted with 
your own theories. (55) 


In rolling motion, earth will move equal to 
its circumference in one day, only then the same 
place will face sun again after one day. But 
circumference of earth is (12,000) kosa (= 40,000 
kms approx.) (56) But according to your view, daily 
motion of earth in east direction is (8,00,000) kosa. 
How can it move so much compared to circum- 
ference. 


Again this motion in east is in plane of 
equator, how motion of earth can be in the plane 
of ecliptic ? (57) How a person going in isana kona 
(north east) can move towards east? (58) 

(3) You may assume the side motion (rotation 
on axis) of earth like a cancer, then these are 


784 Siddhanta Darpana 


different types of logic - one is nisarga (natural) 
and other is upadhi (artificial). (59) 

According to you, earth’s motion around sufi 
is not natural, it is only due to attraction of sun. 
But cancer moves*on its own, not due to any force 
of attraction. Hence this comparison is not proper. 

(4) Similarly it cannot be accepted that motion 
of earth is not in the plane of kranti. (60) When 
moon is in plane of equator, its spots are seen in 
south east direction ‘for south ayana, and in north 
east direction in north ayana. (61) If motion of 
earth is in equator plane, like motion of planets, 
then spots of moon would have been in the 
direction of ayana (north or south). (62) 


(5) Moon doesn’t leave ecliptic, even when it 
has north Sara in south kranti or south ara in 
north kranti. But earth has no Sara, how can it 
leave ecliptic, by moving in equator plane? (63) 

Further logic against axial rotation in dif- 
ferent direction - (1) When rotating nut fruit in 
thrown towards sky, wheel is rolled on surface or 
in air, or rolling the ball during play - in all cases 
rotation around axis is always in the direction of 
motion. But rotation of earth is in direction of 
equator. How can it move in the direction of ecliptic 
? (64) 

Moon moves in its orbit (vimandala) oblique 
to the ecliptic and also rotates on its axis. If earth 
also similarly rotates along equator but moves along 
ecliptic, then we could have seen hills or trees in 
east, moving in angle direction - as we: see rising 
of nakSatras in different directions. (65) 


Location of Earth 785 


(2) You may interprate my saying that if with 
equator motion, the ecliptic motion of earth is in 
direction of sun, then due to elongation of ecliptic 
(ellipse shape), kranti gati (north south direction) 
will be straight like a chord, not curved like an 
arc. My answer is that sayana sun should appear 
smaller in karka and makara beginning (due to 
distant part of eclipse) and should be bigger in 

‘mesa or tula beginning... But it is not so. (66) 


Similarly, orbit of moon should be straight 
and’ its spot should be seen always in same 
direction. But it is seen in different directions from. 
earth. (Hence earth does not move). (67) 


(3) You may say. that motion of earth is in 
direction of ecliptic, inspite of attraction towards 
sun due to god’s desire. Then I will say, that same 
god may desire, that earth should remain fixed, it 
should not move. (68) 


Force of attraction : You may tell that sun 
attracts due to its big size. But force of attraction 
should be in earth also (69). A small fixed iron 
magnet also attracts bigger mass of iron. This 
‘proves that reason of attractive force is not the big 
size, but its natural power. (70) 


Even after so much explaination, if you say 


i that only a big object can pull a smaller object, 
“ and not vice versa, then I will say that it is possible 


¢ 


+ only for an independent body. But objects, small 


y 


* Or big do not have their independent force, their 
, attractive force depends upon will of god. (71) 


In a pond, big boats also revolve round a 


small pillar to which they are tied. Very big sun 


786 Siddhanta Darpana 


along with planets revolves round the small earth, 
according to desire of god, for welfare of the world. 
(72) 

Axial rotatign of different planets : (1) You 
say that sun and all other planets rotate on their 
axis, so earth also must rotate on its axis. This 
doesn’t contradict the fact that earth is fixed’ 
Whether one moves or the other is fixed - depends 
on their nature. It is not necessary that all should 
act in same manner. 


(2) You have seen the axial rotation of planets 
with talescopes. Why you couldn’t see any axial 
rotation in moon also, which is nearest ? (That 
contradicts your statement, that all planets should 
move on their axis also). (73) 


(3) You may say that satellites don’t move on 
their axis like bigger planets. But I say that the 
satellites like moon have same relation with planets 
like earth, which the planets are having with sun 
(in both cases smaller objects are in orbit round 
the bigger object). Like planets, the satellites also 
receive heat and light from sun, why they are not 
similar in motion also ? (74) 


Notes : Actually moon also rotates on its axis, 
but due to a strange coincidence its speed of axial 
rotation is exactly same as the speed of revolution 
round earth. Hence we see the same side of moon 
always. If moon was without axial rotation, 
different points on its surface would have faced 
earth due to its revolution. 


(4) Earth is very close to sun and completes 
revolution of sun in 365 days and axial rotation in 
60 danda (24 hours) Jupiter is farther from sun 


787 


and hence it takes 12 years for one rotation round 
sun. But it is very big compared to earth, still it 
completes axial rotation in only 25 dandas (10 
hours), i.e. less than half the time for earth. Form 
this, it seems there is no rule for these things, 
god’s desire is the only cause. (75) 


If it is stated that bigger planets have faster 
rotation on axis, then axial rotation of sun should 
have been in less than 25 dandas time for jupiter. 
But it takes 25 days, though it is much larger than 
jupiter. (76) 

Notes : (1) Mass and period of rotation on 
axis - All planets and their satellites rotate. The 
rotation of planets confirms to a certain regularity 
- the more the mass of the planet, the faster it 
rotates. There are some exceptions, due to special 
reasons, but in general the rule appears to be true. 


According to modern concepts, the sun and 
planets had formed out of a rotating nebula 
composed of gas and solid dust particles. The 
particles collided and joined .into larger bodies, 
thereby forming embryos of the sun and planets. 
The largest number of collision were at the centre 
of mass of the system, where almost all the gas 
of the nebula had been attracted. So the sun was 
formed. But almost all the initial moment of 
‘Momentum of the nebula appeared to be con- 
centrated not in the sun, but in planets. After the 
Sun was ignited, its radiation dispersed the light 
gases from immediate surroundings to peripheral 
Areas to form three giant planets. Planets of the 
yterrestrial gorup turned out to be composed of 
Solid particles. 


788 Siddhanta Darpana 


The matter of the rotating nebula being 
compressed into dense spheres, the velocity of 
rotation increases due to principle of conservation 
of moment of momentum (i.e. angular momentum). 
Thus the giant planets have a higher velocity of 
rotation than that of-smaller planets. 


It can be assumed that in beginning, the 
rotation periods were faster according to bigger 
mass, but some planets deccelarated their rotation 
due to different reasons. About neptune, our 
knowledge is not sufficient. But pluto appears to 
have been its satellite in the beginning. Then 
neptune has partially lost its moment of rotation, 
after pluto has broken away. 


(2) Resonance in rotation of moon, venus and 
mereury - The earth is braked by its satellite, the 
moon. The nearer and farther points of earth from 
‘moon, are attracted more and less by moon. Hence 
they are raised from the surface of earth. The hump 
of water in oceans causes tide. Since rotation 
velocity of earth is more than ‘speed of moon’s 
revolution round earth, the tidal humps drag the 
earth rotaiton. The humps appear not on straight 
line from earth to moon, they are turned in the 
direction of earth’s motion by about 2°. This causes 
decrease in earth’s angular velocity by 2 X 10 of 
its magnitude per year. Consequently the length 
of day increases each year by 2 X 10° seconds. 
Loss in angular momentum of earth is compensated 
by increase in distance of moon by 3 cms per year. 

When the evolution of solar system had just 
started, the decceleration of rotation of earth - 
moon system was reciprocal. As moon applied 
brake on earth’s rotation, earth also applied brake 


Location of Earth 789 


on fast rotation of moon. As a result of this the 
moon is facing the earth always by one side - its 
sidereal perod of rotation P = moon’s revolution 
period round earth T = 27.322 days. This is called 
resonance, when ratio of oscillation periods is 
integer, here it is 1. This resonance condition was 
achieved quickly because moon was closer to earth 
in past. The centre of mass of moon is 2-3 Kms. 
from its geometrical centre towards earth. This was 
when moon was 5-6 times closer to earth some 
billions of years ago. Since then powerful tidal 
forces have turned moon to face one side forever. 


Abnormally slow rotation of venus and mer- 
cury is explained by the hypothesis that they 
revolved round sun together (like earth and moon) 
in one.orbit. Then their rotations were in resonance 
with each other. But now mercury’s rotation is in 

resonance with its revolution round sun, and venus 
rotation is in resonance with earth’s revolution 
round sun. 


Orbit of mercury has high eccentricity, hence 
its speed at perihelion is 1.52 times higher than at 
appelion. Its period of revolution T = 88 days on 
earth. 


| 2T 
Period of rotation P = 5 58.7 days 


Hence the solar day on mercury Po is given 


1 
PR - pT. 2zt 
2 T = 176 days 


790 ; Siddhanta Darpana 


Thus mercury’s solar day is three times longer 
than its sidereal day and twice longer than its 
period of revolution. In perihelion, its one side or 
its opposite side only faces, in aphelion the points 
perpendicular to it only face. 


For venus, the axis of rotation is almost 
perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, but. the 
direction of its rotation is reverse. Hence its period 
of rotation P = - 243.16 days. Its period of rotation 
P is related to its revolution period T and earth’s 
period of revolution To = 1 year accuretely by the 
following formula.

Thus, at time of conjunction, when venus is 
nearest to earth, it always faces us with one and 
same section of the surface. 


Explanation by natural qualities : As the 
natural quality of sun and fire is heat, moon has 
coldness, water is fluid, rock is hard and wind is 
motion, similarly natural quality of earth is its 
remaining fixed. The different natures and abilities 
of objects is strange, it has no explaination. (77) 


Even small qualitity of soil sinks in water, but 
big ship of wood floats. Similarly in wind 
(pravaha), small sized earth also sinks (i.e. is fixed) 
and sun etc of bigger size are floating (moving), 
because they are lighter (78). 

Notes : Floating is due to specific grevity being 
less than water. Even a ship of iron, heavier than 
water will float if it is made hollow and flat shaped, 
so that it displaces more water than its volume 
which is equal to its weight. 

Neither earth, nor planets float or sink in 
pravaha, which is very light (solar atmosphere). 
Even the concept of ether was as a lightest object. 


Thus the aguments are highly erroneous, due to 


incomplete understanding of ‘pravaha’ or modern 
theories. 

Verses 79-93 : Planetry motions from fixed 
earth - What is the time when bhagana (revolutions 


‘ of the grahas had started according to you, 


(supporter of modern astronomy) or its time is not 
specifically known ? According to me (author) it 
had started just after creation was completed. Do 
you agree ? (79) 


792 Siddhanta Darpana 


Whatever may be your, opinion, the daily 
motion of a planet comes out to be same, whether 
calculated according to your period of revolutions 
or my values of number of revolutions in a kalpa. 
Hence this dispute is immaterial for calculation. 
(80) 

If sun is the centre of all planetary orbits, 
then as viewed from earth, the sphuta sun will be 
(1) mean position for budha and Sukra and (2) 
Sighrocca for mangala, guru and Sani. If from the 
observed sighra and mandaparidhis, we find the 
true planets from spasta sun (instead of mean sun) 
then we observe some errors. When true sun is 
in kanya or mina, then the positions of mangala 
and sukra near their ucca (aphelion - farthest point) 
differs from the true values by 52 kala and 54 kala 
respectively. Again when they are closest to earth, 
the error is 262 and 334 kalas for mangala and 
Sikra. Similarly other planets also will give errors 
if we assume true sun as their centre instead of 
mean sun as correct centre. (81-85) 


Thus sphuta sun cannot be considered mean 
position for budha and §ukra or Sighrocca for 
mangala, guru and sani. However, the persons 
who say that we are getting corf ct postions of 
planets by assuming true sun at centre, - are not 
giving correct logic. When a palm fruit (strongly 
bound to tree) drops just after a crow sits on tree, 
we cannot say that fruits was plucked by force of 
crow, which is much less than required force. Thus 
mere coincidence doesn’t make a proof in support 
of heliocentric theory. (86-87) 


By assuming mean sun as centre of planetary 
orbits, we have been calculating true planets 


Location of Earth 793 


correctly since long. (88) Hence, the planets are 
not attracted by sphuta sun at the centre of orbit. 
Rather they rotate on their own being attracted by 
their gods at ucca like moon. This appears more 
reasonable (89). (This is again palm fruit - crow 
logic criticised above). 


In cakrardha, mandaphala of sukra is very 
little and for mangala, parocca and mandocca also 
are same. Hence they can be found according to 
your theory (heliocentric) also. (90) 


Different planes for orbits - The planets 
starting with budha are rotating on their axis 
perpendicular to ecliptic plane and are revolving 
under attraction of sun. Hence there orbits should 
be in ecliptic plane only (which is not so). (91) 


Earth moves under attraction of same sun, 
and under earth attraction, moon moves. In such 
a condition moon also is forced to move in the 
direction of axial rotation. It cannot move in a 
different plane (inclined at 5°). (92) 


Again, rotation and revolution of earth being 
in same plane of ecliptic, dhruva will be qn 
perpendicular side from sun’s direction on equinox 
day. Then how, spasta kranti of moon can occur 
without attraction of ecliptic motion. From all these, 
fixed earth is well proved. (93) 


Notes : (1) Due to concept of relative ‘motion, 
it is possible to assume any body fixed, and to 
calculate relative motion of other bodies. In 
heliocentric theory also, we have to calculate 
geocentric positions to know the planets as seen 
from earth, because they are seen from earth only. 
Hence, method of calculation doesn’t prove which 


794 Siddhanta Darpana 


body is fixed or moving. This way both theories 
are correct. 

However, considering sun as centre, calcula- 
tions are simpler for heliocentric position. More 
important is that we can formulate theories of 
planetary motion (Introduction to chapter 5). 

(2) Even in Indian methods, finding manda 
sphuta graha before sighra phala calculation is for 
finding heliocentric position only. If mean sun only 
is the true centre of orbits, then sighraphala could 
be calculated only in one step like mandaphalas of 
moon and sun. Hence, the four step calculation 
and approximation in the first two steps is due to 
assumpiton of heliocentric orbits. (Explained in 
chapter 5) 


Verses 94-101 - Sara of planets 

Planets are located above or below, south or 
north due to their mandocca, sighrocca and pata. 
‘The citcles showing this motion are not real paths 
of the planets. (4) 


They are unseen lines of circle. In this orbit 
only the planets have Sara (at the end of which 
they are situated, not on the circle of orbits). As 
the western scientists assume the sun attraction to 
be reason of motion, we assume the gods of 
Sighrocca and mandocca having attraction power, 
and god at pata having repulsion (vikSepa) power. 
(95) 

If earth also is considered like other planets, 
then why guru, much bigger than earth goes far 
in north or south of its orbit due to pata ? (96)

Location of Earth 795 


Like venus, earth also is near sun (compared 
to Jupiter), why earth is not having viksepa like 
venus ? If motion of Sara depends on size of planet, 
then éara of earth cannot be less than jupiter (as 
shown from examples of nearer and _ farther 
planets). (97) 

If Sara of earth is assumed to be 3 kala 
according to you, then correct sun cannot be found 
due to difference in equinox and solstice position 
due to Sara. Hence eclipse shadow, time or lagna, 
nothing can be calculated. (98) 


All these can be calculated if we don’t assume 
Sara for earth. Hence, assuming earth as fixed, is 
the correct principle. In both the golas (north or 
south) when bhuja of sun is same, krantis also are 
exactly same. From that also, earth appears to be 
fixed. (99) 

If we assume earth’s motion, its Sara has to 
be assumed which creates this confusion. Just as 
you think that sun has no Sara, I think that earth 
has no Sara. Disc of sun is separate from madhyama 
sun (mean fictitous position of sun). Then why 
can you not accept Sara of sun ? (100) 

You tell that earth is like all other 
sun with only one difference, that earth doesn’t 
have Sara like other planets. In a similar way, I 


; can say that all other planets revolve round sun, 
i only earth is fixed. By nature itself, earth is fixed, 
q why do you object ? (101) (Both assume exception 


for earth). 


Notes : We regard earth orbit as the reference 
plane, hence earth has no Sara or sun has no Sara 


796 Siddhanta Darpana 


as viewed from earth. More correctly the axis of 
angular momentum of the whole solar system 
should be taken as reference. That is inclined to 
the pole of ecliptic at an angle of 1.7° in direction 
of mithuna. Similarly polar axis of sun is inclined 
at angle of 7°15’ to the ecliptic pole. Rotation period 
of sun near its equator is 25 days and near the 
pole it is 35 days. Inclination of sun’s axis to ecliptic 
is almost similar to inclination of nearest planet 
mercury. 


However, taking sun’s orbit as reference is 
useful for calculation of all events related to sun, 
year, lagna, seasons etc and also for calculating 
eclipse. 


Verse 102-104 : Vapours from planets 

If nearby planets like mangala are like earth 
and: they also contain 6 seasons as on earth, then 
the vapours forming clouds in that planet would 
have acted as cover between earth and the planet, 
as moon covers sun in eclipse. 


Planets budha and Sukra are formed of water, 
earth is made of soil and bigger than them. This 
shows that all planets are not same. Hence there 
is nothing illogical in assuming earth as fixed and 
planets starting with budha as moving. 

The water near earth becomes vapour due to 
heat of sun, which forms the cloud. On other 
planets, there is only water, hence there is no 
vapour and hence clouds are not seen. 

Notes : All these are totally wrong and need 
no comment. All inner planets between guru and 


_ Location of Earth , » 797 


sun are formed of rocks. Atmosphere and water 
vapour are contained due to higher force of 
gravitation and lower heat. Water vapourises 
anywhere, whether near earth or not. It depends 
only on temperature or pressure. There are much 
denser clouds on venus due to high temperatures. 


- Verses 105-111 : Centre of mass — 


At the ends of a high- rod, one heavy and 
_ one light body is suspended. If the rod is supported 
at the balance point, it remains horizontal. That 
. balance point is called centre of mass. (105) 


If the rod is suspended on that point by a 
‘thread and rotated, small object will move in a 
bigger circle and heavy object in smaller circle. 
- Earth and sun are similarly assumed small and 
“ heavy objects. (106) 

. Their mass centre is within sun, hence sun 
‘has been considered fixed at centre (of solar 
Me system). In this manner earth is moving in a large 
. circle far away from sun. If this is the reason 
‘explained for fixed sun and moving earth, then 
; this too is defective. (107) 

b Refutation of fixed sun - Mass (weight) of sun 
© isin proportion to its volume. Volume of sun (cube 
"Of its diameter) is divided by volume of jupiter 


7 (cube of its diameter) Then we get 

; -massof sun __ 45,92,64,62,91,33,53,882 
mass of Jupiter —-551,23,42,00,467,707 
= 896 + remainder = 897 almost. 


By dividing the distance between sun and 
Jupiter by this ratio, 


798 Siddhanta Darpana 


; 24,50,10,000 
897 


Thus mass centre is 2,72,018 kosa away from 
centre of sun. Radius of sun is 2,22,261 / 2 kosa, 
which is less than half the distance of mass centre. 
Thus mass centre doesn’t come within sun. Hence 
your reason for keeping sun as fixed is not correct. 
(109) 

Here also period of revolution is found by 
finding the revolution time around sun. Then why, 
you unnecessarily assume mass centre away from 
sun (instead of sun itself) ? (110) 


Weight of planets can not be measured, hence 
discussion about their mass centre is useless. For 
benifit of students and teachers, this has been 
discussed in conneciton of mass centre. (111) 


Notes : (1) Here mass and weight has been 
considered as one. Mass is amount of matter in 
an object. Weight is the force of earth’s attraction 
on it, hence it is defined only on earth. It is 
proportional to mass, hence in common language 
both are used for same meaning. 


we ge = 2,72,018 kosa. (108) 


Mass is measured in terms of action of force 
on it, and in that sense, it is intertial mass. Force 
per unit mass, is the rate of change of its speed, 
called acceleration. In heavenly bodies, only im- 
portant force is gravitation, which is also 
proporitonal to mass. Mass measured as per its 
gravitational pull, is called gravitational mass. 
These are the same - gravitational or inertial mass, 
according dt physics understood so far. 


When two or more bodies are under action 
of parallel forces (like force of attraction on a body 


Location of Earth 799 


small compared to earth), the resultant force passes 
through the mass centre. 


" M2

Figure 2 


In figure (2), O is mass centre of bodies with 
masses M; at A and M2 and B. Then M; X OA = 
M2 X OB. ; 

(2) Mass is not proportional to volume for all 
objects, it is only for objects of same density. 

... _ _mass 

Pens volume 

Hence, iron of same volume in 8 times as 
heavy as water. Here it has been assumed that 
densities of planets are same which is not correct. 
Rocky planets like earth have more density. 
Gaseous planets like Jupiter and beyond are less 
dense. Even sun is less dense then earth. Density 
of earth is 5.52 and of sun it is 1.41 if water density 
is considered 1. 


Verses 112-115 - Efects of earth’s rotation 

Due to rotation of earth, high mountains or 
houses move in a bigger circle. Hence their linear 
speed is more, than the speed of rotation of surface. 
If a stone is dropped from top of a high building 
or mountain, it will fall at a point slightly towards 
east, from the vertically down point (as earth is 
rotating in east direction). (112) 
. This would not have happened, if earth had 
‘No rotation. According to me (author), it is because 


800 Siddhanta Darpana 


an earthly wind named ‘Avaha’ moves steadily 
from west towards east always. (113) 

Due to that wind, all grass, trees are slightly 
inclined towards east. Hence, the stone falls slightly 
eastwards. (114) 

Hence, we need’ not assume rotation of earth 
to explain it. On plane surface, and covered space, 
free of winds, all objects fall directly downwards. 
(115) es 

Notes : Effect of earth’s rotation is both’ static 
and dynamic. Due ‘to centrifugal force, the force 
of attraction reduces. It is also slightly bend away 
from equator giving bulge at equator. Resultant 
force is also slightly towards east from the true 
vertical, hence definition of vertical itself changes. 
Plumb line is towards east from true vertical line. 
Due to that also stone will fall towards east. 

Another effect is dynamic called coriolis force. 
All motions tend to turn clockwise in north 
hemisphere. This is seen in the climatic winds, 
which start moving north, then turn towards north 
east slowly. 


Verses 116-128 : Relation between distance and 
period of revolution. 

Distance of planet centre from centre of sun 
is called distance. The time taken by a planet to 
make one revolution of sun is called its period of 
revolution (bhagana kala). (116) 

The ratio between cube of distance and square 
of bhagana kala is same for all the planets (Keplar’s 
third law). (117) 


Location of Earth ; 801 


Square of mars’s bhagana kala __ 687* 

Square of earth’s bhagana kala 3652 

= 3/31 = 3.519 (118) 

(Mars distance)? __ (7,22,50,000)? 

(Earth distance)? —_ (4,75,00,000)? . 

= 3.519 = 3/31 = (119, 120) 

Thus both ratios are same. If, on that basis, 
you tell that earth moves, then I become perturbed 
- and many things will have to be told. (120) 

There is no effect without cause. Planets move 
around sun following this rule, only if sun itself 
rotates around its axis by the same rule. (121) 

If this proportion is correct, then: any planet 
very close to sun should move round the sun in 
25 days, becuase rotation of sun around its axis 
takes 25 days, as seen by telescopes. (122) 

Comparing this with distance and rotation 
period of budha, 

(Bhagana of sun’s surface)* (Sun radius)° 

(Bhagana of budha)” : (Budha distance)? 
or (Bhagana)? of a planet at sun’s surface 
(2,22, 161/30)? 
(Budha distance)° 
Bhagana of that planet comes only 6/52 
‘dandas, i.e. sun should complete 1 quarter less 
‘than 9 round on its.axis in one day. This is. against 
the observed period of rotation of 25 days. (123-125) 


Again if we assume the rotation period of sun - 
to. be 25 days, then 


= 88? X 


802 Siddhanta Darpana 


(sun radius)* 
_ (Mars distance)? x (sun bhagana)? 
7 (Mars bhagana)* 

Then sun’s radius comes out to be 36 times 
its true value. (126-127) 


' Thus, if diameter is considered correct, then 
rotation period in wrong. If rotation of sun is 
considered correct, then its diameter is wrong. Thus 
sun’s own period of rotation and diameter are 
against this rule of proportion. Thus, under its 
influence, planets like mangala will not revolve 
under this rule. (128) 


Note : Sun’s own rotation is not the result 
of an orbital motion, it is residual angular 
momentum since its formation. Other planets move 
in the field of sun’s gravitation, hence they follow 
this rule. Sun doesn’t attract itself, and this rule 
cannot. be applied to self rotation. 


Verses 129-133 : Manda and éighra kendra - 


In’ their own orbits, Ssighra kendra of grahas 
starting with mangala lies in cakrardha in nearer 
position and in cakra for farther position. (129) 

Similarly manda kendra is at closest point and 
farthest point from madhyama sirya. In mangala 
etc, Sighra phala and mandaphala is of same types 
(nearest or farthest points are reference for measur- 
ing). Since direction of earth (from sun) is opposite 
to direction of sun, it is more convenient to assume 
that sun rotates around earth along with planets. 
(130) . , 

At the end of odd quadrant mandaparidhi of 
mangala is 3° more. This mandocca is attracted by 


Location of Earth 803 


parocca in direction of earth from sun. Hence 
mandaphala of mangala is slightly more than gighra 
phala, as it is attracted by mandocca, which is in 
turn attracted by parocca. This is due to manda 
kendra of mangala. (131) 


For mercury, increase in Sighraphala_ or 
decrease in mandaphala is not due to sun alone. 
(This is due to manda-kendra of sun and mercury 
both). (132) 

Mars and mercury, thus revolve around sun 
and earth both. Since manda and Sighra both are 
seen, it is clear that at least one of. earth or sun 
moves. If sun is assumed fixed, then correct 
positions of planets will not come. Thus it is settled, 
that sun moves round earth, while carrying 
planetary orbits with it. (133) 


Note : Whether sun is considered fixed or 
not, we have to calculate both - distance and 
direction of sun from earth, then distance and 
direction of the planet from sun. The smaller 
distance is called sighra paridhi. In heliocentric 
position also, same calculation method is adopted. 
As explained in chapter 5, siddhanta formulas are 
symmetric for both inner and outer planets, as 
smaller orbit is always considered Sighra paridhi. 
Hence, a common formula is sufficient for both 
inner and outer planets. However, this doesn’t 
contradict movement of earth. 


Verses 134-138 : Distance and nature of stars 

Scientists (western) say that stars are very far, 
and so, they appear fixed. The stars are all like 
- 8uns and situated all over sky in different planes. 
. (134) 


804 Siddhanta Darpana 


Other suns also are with their family of 
planets. Nearest star is at distance 8,000 times the 
distance from earth to sun. (135) 


Many stars are larger than sun also. How all 
can rotate round the much smaller earth? Hence, 
movement of stars in, seen, only due to rotation 
of earth. (136) 

If you say like this, then listen to my 
explaination. NakSatras rotate round earth at 
distance of 360 times the distance of madhyama 
sun. (137) 

(Distance of stars from earth = 360 X mean 
distance of sun = 360 X 76,08,294 = 68,47,46,460 
yojana). 

Based on this distance, the difference in Sighra 
paridhi at the end of even and odd quadrants 
should be 1°, which is actually observed. hence 
the sighra phala stated by me is correct. Earth’s 
rotation in east like a worm (cancer) is illogical. It 
will be proved at last by discusson of kranti. 


Notes : Differences in Sighra paridhi is not 
due to finite distance of stars’ as explaiend in 
chapter 5. Distance of star given here is as per old 
estimates. Nearest star is at least 3,60,000 times 
more distant than sun. If nearby star vega at 26.5. 
light years moves at a speed of 100 Kms/second 
perpendicular to its direction it will move only 1° 
in 1400 years. Other stars move much less. 


Verses 139-142 : Motion of nakSatra sphere. 


When earth is at the end of dhanu rasi (from 
sun), then a star is seen at some point. When 


Location of Earth 805 


earth is at 47° kranti difference from that place 
(i.e. in end of mithuna sayana ra&i), then the star 
should be seen at 8 kala south of its earlier rising 
point. (47°/360° = 8 kala) based on star distances. 
But this does not happen. So I consider the earth 
as fixed. (139) 


You cannot say that stars are fixed and they 
don’t move. Reason is movement of ayana. Due 
to change in north and south krantis, movement 
of nakSatra circle is clearly seen. If you explain 
that it is due to movement of kranti vrtta, then 


listen to my explaination. (140) 


Earlier acaryas had stated observed values of 
dhruvaméa and Saraméa of naksatras. It continues 
the same today also. If we assume movement of 
kranti -vrtta and consider the nakSatras as fixed, 
this will not happen. Hence nakéSatras as well as 
kranti vrtta both move. (141) 


Movement of ayanas, daily rotation of 
nakSatras from east to west, show that earth is 
fixed. If there were other stars in sky like sun, 
then there should not have been darkness during 
night. (142) 

Notes : The difference in calculated positions 
of stars for maximum 47° kranti difference is on 
assumption that stars are only 360 times more 
distant than sun. They are at least thousand times 
more distant than assumed here. 


Verses 143-145 : Darkness in night 


With the telescope of magnifying power of 100, 
‘lubdhaka’ star is visible even at 8 kala difference 
from sun. If lubdhaka also, is same as sun, then the 
light from two suns in same direction 


806 Siddhanta Darpana 


will create terrrific brightness. (Hence there is not 
an infinite number of stars like our sun). (143) 


You explain that stars are very far, and their 
light is absorbed by vapour and ice particles. Hence 
their light is not as bright as sun. My objection is 
that stars cannot be as bright as planets, who have 
various types of motions (stars are thus dull). 
Assumpiton of ice or vapour particles is only due 
to confusion. (144) 


Due to nearness, light of planets like mangala 
is constant. But light from far stars absorbed by 
snow etc. is flickering. Hence they vibrate like 
flames of fire. But like fire, their light also may be 
extinguished. Has it been seen ? (145) 


Notes : If infinite sun like stars are assumed 
uniformly spaced in all directions, then there will 
be infinute number of stars in any cone of vision. 
‘Area of any spherical shell increases in proportion 
to square of its radius (R’). Hence the number of 
stars will be proportional to R*. Light from an 
individual star at distance R will have intensity 
proportional to 1/R*. Hence all spherical shells 
contribute the same amount of light. From infinite 
shells in space, light at earth will be infinite. This 
is called Olbers’ paradox. 


This doesn’t happen because, light is absorbed 
by gases spread in sky. But even then the gases 
will became heated and will start emitting light. 
Then the temperature at each place will be 6000°K 
which is average surface temerature of a star. 

Its real explaination was provided by expan- 
sion of universe observed by Hubble in 1928. Due 
to expansion, the stars at farther distance have 


Location of Earth 807 


lesser influence. Hence, we are mainly affected by 
nearby star sun only. Thus, when we don’t face 
sun side, there is darkness in night. 


Verse 146 - Equatorial bulge : If an earthen 
sphere is rotated along its diameter, the sphere is 
pressed along axis. Similarly, on earth also polar 
regions (meru) are depressed and equator portion 
has a bulge. This confirms the rotation of earth 
along its polar diameter. Reply to this logic is that, 
in creation of god there are many similar strange 
things. To explain coincidence of both these results, 
it is not necessary to assume axial rotation of earth. 


Verses 147-150 : Desire of god 


If the west rotation of nakéSatras is due to east 
rotation of earth, then why god had to create 
pravaha wind with hard labour for west rotation 
of stars ? Reason is that god can keep rye as fixed 
and make the mountains move. To show his 
abilities, he has made the earth fixed. (147) 


Playful god has done impossible acts many a 
times to punish the cruel people for good or bad 
works. But in earthly creation there is no blemish. 
Human body is transitory, but the earth created 
with great labour from stones and gems will be 
kept fixed by god. As man doesn’t leave his nature, 
God is always engaged in rotatig stars, while 
keeping the earth fixed. (148) 


Worldly people are always hankering after 
house and other properties. This is not done by 
adepts. Similarly god acts only for justice (not to 
satisfy his habit). Against this logic, my reply is 
that, god has not achieved any goal by giving 
lesser life period to men, elephant and horse and 


808 Siddhanta Darpana 


longer life to crow, jackal etc. God’s desire is the 
only reason. (149) 


Earth is created out of internal (detached) and 
external (visible) abilities of god. As a body of god, 
earth is living place of all beings and having all 
attributes. Hence grahas also which are parts of 
god, revolve round it. There is nothing strange in 
it. (150) 


Verses 151-152 - Summary of evidence 


Through many reasonings like fruits of 
siddhanta tree, theory of three types of earth’s 
motion has been demolished-daily motion, annual 
motion and kranti. May it remove the tiredness of 
people out of motion of earth, through good taste 
of the logical fruits. (151) 


Thus fixed position of earth has been proved 
by the following arguments - (1) rising of same 
star in celestial sphere always at the same place 
(2) Increase or decrease of manda and Sighra phala 
of budha and mangala due to their manda kendra 
(3) Spots of moon always look alike from earth (4) 
From the nature of light and heavy bodies (5) 
Movement of attracted body in the direction of 
attraction (6) sun has no Sara (deviation from 
ecliptic). (152) 


Verses 153-154 - Earth as gem 


(Siddhanta Sekhara) - As the iron embedded 
in gem is round, so the earth, without any support 
and shelter for all, is definitely round. (153) 

(Varaha purana) - As iron is embedded within 
a gem, similarly earth of 5 mahabhita (fundamental 
elements) is within the sphere of stars. (154) 


Location of Earth 809 


Verses 155-159 : Background of discussions 


Due to ali these reasons, I hold that earth is 
fixed. Sun through its mean form carries all planets 
and revolves round the earth. The planets do not 
move in any fixed order (they have independant 
motions). The scholars who know the value of 
labour, should give a thought to my theories. I 
will be satisfied only with that. I am not concerned 
with praise or criticism of my views. (155) 

O learned astronomers ! You are friends to 
all. Please pardon my out-spoken views to prove 
the fixed earth. To explain the fixed earth to 
students, I told whatever came to my mind. Who 
‘is without fault in this world ? (i.e. there is possible 
fault in my logic also). (156) 

Man wants his rise only. While constructing 
idol of god, if it becomes a monkey idol, what can 
be done ? It can be thought as fate only, not fault 
of the man. (157) 


Universe has originated from ocean in which 
world is continuing. It is not affected by strong 
winds etc. and remains as such in the space. As 
described in puranas, it is full of seven seas, 
continents and mountains all around. Here I have 
not described the universe. Only its base, earth 

- and sun etc. have been told. (158) 


Movement of earth has never been heard in 

; past. In 144th part of kaliyuga (I.e. kali samvat 

i: 3000 or 102 B.C.) there was a cursary mention of 

b ,earth’s motion by Buddhists. The great scholars 

‘alike Bhaskara also replied it lightly. hence much 
Chad to be told here to counter that view. (159) 


810 Siddhanta Darpana 


Notes : The arguments are mainly directed 
against concepts of modern physics and Keplar’s 
law of planetary motions, which the author heard 
during discussions with Prof. Jogesh Chandra Rai 
of Cuttack, wo wrote introduction ot siddhanta 
darpana in 1899 AD.‘His logic depends on the fact 
that both the calculation methods for planetary 
motion are equivalent. Even in heliocentric theory 
we have to calculate geocentric position as all 
observations are from earth only. 


The author has partly understood the concept 
of centre of mass. But concepts of relative motion, 
attraction and repulsion at different points, motion 
in direction other than direction of force have not 
been grasped by him. Force causes acceleration of 
a body in its direction, but if initial motion is in 
different line, the resultant motion will not be in 
direction of force, i.e. velocity can be in a different 
direction. This can be understood from any 
graduate level text book of physics or mechanics. 


Candrasekhara also, expresses doubts about 
correctness of his theory of fixed earth in verses 
(155-157) 

Though nowhere in the vedas, earth has been 
told as fixed, siddhanta jyotisa calculates on basis 
of earth as centre of cordinate system as it is done 
now also. Hence without specific mention of fixed 
earth, it creates this impression. 

In supporting this view, author has felt that 
atternate theories will demolish the siddhanta 
jyotisa which is not so. Another reason is pride in 
Indian thoughts and the feeling that European 
theories were popular only due to political and 


Location of Earth 811 


financial influence of those countries. That was 
definitely so, as Greenwich became reference for 
0° longitude in place of Ujjain, or Gregorian 
calender was accepted worldwide after rise in 
British power. In next verse he has felt that, 
movement of earth has been felt only due to hope 
of getting gold medals - and this has been named 
golden theory. 


Verses 160-161 - Prayer and end 


Theory of moving earth and fixed sun has 
been proved true, undeservingly due to influence 
of gold (gold medals or economic and _ political 
power). May Lord Jagannatha living in Nilacala 
bless me, by whose grace many thoughts were 
expressed by me and the fire of logic melted the 
golden theory of moving earth. 


Thus ends the seventeenth chapter describing 
position of earth in the sky in siddhanta darpana 
written as a text book for accurate calculations by 
Sri Candrasekhara born in famous royal family of 
Orissa.

ef . As part of Parama Brahma, Sarhkarsana 
| adopted body form and entered into nature 

(energy). He is all pervading but knowable (due 
«to body form). First of all ‘apah’ (vapour or gas) 
‘was created. Seed was put into it by Sankarsana. 


814 Siddhanta Darpana 


That seed developed into golden egg (radiant 
from out side, spherical), inside which was only 
darkness. Within that, eternal Aniruddha took form 
(or became bright to be seen). (6) 


This ‘Aniruddha’ has been called ‘Hiranya- 
garbha’ (cosmic egg of light or energy - Hiranya 
means gold as well as light). Being the first born, 
he was also called ‘Aditya’ or ‘Stirya’. (7) 

He was called ‘Param jyoti’ because it removed 
darkness. Because he created world, he was called 
‘Savita’. He produces living beings and also 
revolves round all bhuvanas (3 or 14). (8) 


Being brightness or energy himself, Surya 
destroys darkness and is famous as ‘mahana’ (The 
great). Rk veda is his mandala (spherical spread), 
Sama veda is his light rays and yajur veda is his 
body. (9) 

Thus siirya is embodiment of three vedas. He 
is soul of Kala and creator who has produced Kala. 
(Time measures are based on sun, creation or 
destruction are another meaning of Kala, which 
are also due to stirya). He is soul of all beings. In 
microscopic form, he is within every body. In his 
grand form, everything is included in him. (10) 


The whole world with moving and non- 
moving is his vehicle (ratha or chariot). Chanda 
(rhyme or vibration) are his horses. They are 
connected with rays of light and revolve with sun. 
All are controlled by sun. (11) 

Only one quarter of sun’s energy (teja) comes 
out, three quarters are hidden as indestructible. 
He created ‘ahamk4ra’ (individual differentiation) 
and then crated Brahma to create the world. (12) 


Description of Earth 815 


Surya gave ‘vara’ (method) of vedas 
(knowledge) to Brahma and put that grandfather 
of all beings.in a great egg (Brahmanda). He himself 
rotates with brightness. (13) 


Becoming in form of Ahamkara, Brahma 
desired to create the beings. Moon was formed 
from his ‘mana’ (mind - hence the words mind 
and moon evolved from ‘mana’), fire from ears 
-and sun from eyes appeared. (14) 

‘Mana’ gave birth to akaSa (space), from akaéa 
came vayu (air), agni (fire) from vayu, water from 
fire, and earth (soil) from water appeared. Thus 
five mahabhitas (elements) appeared with one 
guna (attribute) more at each step. (15) Thus 
appeared agni (fire), jala (fluid), sun, moon and 
then mars etc. Five star like planets (tara grahas 
starting with mangala) appeared from five elements 
- teja, earth, akaSa water and wind. (16) 

Again Brahma divided himself into 12 parts 
and took form of 12 rasi’s (signs of zodiac). The 
‘ same 12 raSis were divided into 27 nakSatras. (17) 


Then gods were created and through creation 
of prakrti (female form of god or energy), he 
created the whole world with moving and non- 
- moving bodies in order of upper, middle and lower 
_ planes. (118) 


With his knowledge of vedas, he assumed 
;,different classifications according to guna (at- 
. tributes) and karma (functions). (19) 

From these classifications or regions, following 
z Were created in that order - graha, nakSatra, stars, 
“earth, bimmba (disc of planets etc), brahmanda, deva, 
Sura, man and siddha (adepts). (20) 


816 Siddhanta Darpana 


In the hollow space of brahmanda exist lokas 
like bhu, bhuvah, svah. Brahmanda is shaped like. 
two big bowls joined at their edges. (21) 


Internal circumference of brahmanda is called 
‘vyoma-kakSa (i.e. orbit of the sky). Within this, 
move nakSatras etc. starting from periphery . (22)

Meaning - At that time (of the creation of the 
universe) there was no ‘asat’, no ‘sat’, no solar 
system (rajas), no space, nothing else was present. 
Then what covered on ? where ? For whose shelter? 
What was that unfathomable and profound thing 
emitting sound (ambhas) ? 

‘Sat’ means the existant things, like water, 
horse etc., ‘Asat’ means non existant things. 


Description of Earth 819 


Satapatha brahmana (10-5-3) tells 

qq mT yemaseenista weia anitfea ar gene Jara 
SF TATA |. TEMAS BOM) A Tere 
aalataerifira | ta fe way Fara | 


It is not true that cosmos did not exist (asat), 
nor was it sat or did exist. It was there, and it 
was also not there. Only mind (manas) was there. 
Later on it says that manas created vak, then come 
prana, which created organ of vision end so on. 


At other place the brahmana says (6-1-1) 
Sa] SCAT amet Ware, Fe cere aha ae aa as % 


sea | dae: FH WA sa WON a RA FT 

Fea afeaftrada: AAT TTA LITBAGIA: | 

The cosmos was asat in the beginning. What 
is asat? Rsis were asat in the beginning, who are 
those rsis? Pramas were the rsis. Because they 
strained themselves desiring creation of this cos- 
mos, they are called rsis. 


Thus asat means pranic energy, which Sayana 
tells nameless and formless brahman. It is non 
existant in the sense that it is energy and not 
matter which has mass or which covers space etc. 
Universe was created out of this pranic energy - 
it was neither matter (sat) nor energy (asat) - may 
be a combination of both as dual nature of matter 
or energy particles. Asat gave rise to ‘manas’ and 
from manas, a desire to create arose, and creation 
commenced. 


Negation of both means, that neither of them 
- existed alone - a combination of both sat and asat 
was present - or the entity which was both. 
‘Rajas’ means ‘loka’ when used in plural. It 
has also been used in the sense of ‘antarikSa’ loka 
i.e. solar system (creation in sky). Thus it means 


820 Siddhanta Darpana 


the primordial substance which formed the lokas 
later on. As a quality it is the desire which is cause 
of creation. Satva is only existance or pure 
knowledge. Rajoguna is action oriented, it means 
controlled action which creates. Thus there was no 
matter or solar system which can create and 
support life. 


There was no vyoma (akaSa) at that time. 
‘Om’ means original sound or vibration. Creation 
started with vibration which is form of energy and 
it caused interaction between matter and energy 
particles. Vibration felt by us is sound i.e. Sabda 
tattva. Vyoma means space without vibration. 
Vibration was not present when creation had not 
started. After vibration, vyoma becomes 4ka%a. 

‘Vayu’ means central core and ‘vayonadha’ is 
its covering envelope. Vayonadha has been also 
called ‘chandas’ or garman’. Satapatha Brahmana 
(8-2-2-8) tells 

mon & ar aataran. | wntdie wd aga Tar! Barf o ear

(Sarma) has become ‘carma’ (skin) i.e coverin 
surface (3-2-2-8) - wa awlartaq Soren (Eyre weg wi 
@aial | Thus there was no covering surface as there 
was no material to be covered. In modern 
astronomy, space expansion means expansion of 
materials (galaxies) which are spreading from each 
other. (Hubbles theory 1928). In beginning it was 
a point universe without cover. 

The third question - for whose shelter all this 
was prepared ? - is unanswered so far. 

‘Ambhas’ means fluid, though whch vibra- 
tions can pass, i.e. sound producing material. 
According to Gamow, the initial distribution of 
matter was uniform and very thin with density of 


Description of Earth 821 


1072 compared to 1 for water. This. extreme rare 
matter has been termed as ’Ylem’ which has no 
meaning. But ambhas indicates true qualities of 
that matter in which vibration was the only 
prominent effect. 

In first line, it is told there was nothing. Next 
line questions - what covered on ? That means 
that during very short period all the elements came 
into being. (There are books on first 3 minutes of 
universe, History of time etc.).

There was neither death, nor immortality. 
Since there was no creation, there was no question 
of permanence or death. Here martya means 
changing and amartya means everlasting principles. 
Both are necessary for creation. 


There was no day or night, as there was no 
sun or planets from where day night can be 
. observed. 

Second line - There was only that one 
breathing without air, with his own energy. Really 
there was nothing else. 


There was only one thing - means there was 
orly one primordial fire ball - from which universe 
appeared after big bang. This is called ‘Hiranya- 
garbha’ - fire ball. This was only thing present as 
per santipatha-“feoart: aaaday yes are: Ghats sai” 

It is clarified that this breathing was without 
air, as it was not available in space. This was 
; pulsation of surface found in star due to interaction 
_ between nuclear forces of expansion in interior of 
. Star and gravitational attraction which compresses 


822 Siddhanta Darpana 


it. Thus Gamow writes - spectral lines of Cepheid 
variables prove that the stars are so to speak 
breathing - i.e. their surface layers are periodically 
rising and falling. 

Here ‘bala’ is force in a dormant stage, in 
action it is Sakti and result is kriya4. Svadha’ means 
Sakti which is able to create. It is also called maya 
bala i.e. force seen due to its effect (oscillation 
etc.). In pralaya it merges with rasa as waves in 
ocean calms down and merge with sea. Thus, 
svadha in star is its nuclear energy causing creation, 
which also causes breathing.

There was darkness to begin with. There was 
something mysterious in the darkness. It was 
impossible to understand. It was all undulating 
matter (salila) ‘Abhu’ originated from the surround- 
ing was wrapped by lighter material. It developed 
further due to heat energy. 


Initially stars are cold spheres of rarefied 
gases, which do not emit light. They become 
compressed due to gravitation. Then heat and light 
are produced, and finally nuclear reactions starts, 
resulting in creation of new atoms. 


Gamow says - At dawn of universe, the stars 
must have been so dilute that they occupied all 
space forming a continuous gas. Later, due to some 
internal instability, the continuous gas must have 
broken up into a number of separate clouds or gas 
drops. 


Salila’ means a matter with ripples, i.e. 
undulant cosmic gas. Separate clouds or gas drops 


Description of Earth 823 


are ‘abhu’ - i.e. a thing formed from surrounding 
material (31a-ald Vata sft S1Y) Though called drops, 
the gas drops were 2-3 light years wide with mass 
of about 10° kg. So ‘abhu’ is a better word than 
drop. Abhu was covered with still lighter matter 
as stated in the verse.

The great worldly desire comes from the 
minute, invisible, unworldly seed of mind, in the 
same way ‘sat’ come from ‘asat’. The yogis with 
far reaching intelligence have recognised this fact 
after complete thinking in the mind and thorough 
scanning in their hearts. 


A smallest molecular disturbance or a speck 
of vibration (or smallest bija) started the chain 
reaction in rare gas clouds, which started creation. 
Thus the reason is smallest force or matter called 
‘kama’ or desire. First action was from ‘mana’ i.e. 
minutest.

Strands or rays scattered out; were they 
oblique or downward or upward ? They became 
germ holders and became mighty. Those who tried 
to keep themselves aloof (@Manafagfataul) remained 
small or those who surrendered themselves (I 
eufagfa tae) became inferior; while those who tried 
hard became superior. 


‘Rasmi’ means strands or rays. ‘Abhu’ (gas 
drops) emited light rays in all directions. They also 
scattered matter in strands which are seen in spiral 
nebulae. Our galaxy also has two spirial ‘arms’. In 


824 Siddhanta Darpana 


space there is no real direction, hence up, down 
or oblique has no meaning. Thus the strands were. 
in all possible direction, or in spiral shape with 
changing directions. 

Out of-the matter in the strands, some lump 
came together to become germ holder. Those which 
remained aloof remained small - named ‘svadha’. 
Some bodies surrendered themselves to others, 
these are also ‘svadha’. Other bodies absorbed more 
and more matter and smaller bodies by gavitational 
attraction, and became enormous. These are 
‘Prayati’. 

This is similar to Nebular Hypothesis of

826 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verses 23-32 : Comment on creation 

In the above 20 verses of sirya siddhanta 
order of creation has been explained. Now the 
form of sun mentioned there, is being explained 
in detail. Everywhere work is done at four levels 
(Sankalpa or decision, planning, execution and 
result) - as it has been stated in Sri Naradiya 
Purana. Here Pradyumna is padmabhia brahma 
(23-24). 

Origin of brahma is sun in form of mahattat- 
tva. From Brahma another sdirya has originated. 
(25) 

Hence two sirya (suns) are stated. First surya 
(first sun) is the origin of self created Brahma, from 
whom creation started through this sun. (26) 


Second sun is creator of deva, asura and man. 
Two forms of sun are in form of sphere and in 
form of deva. (27) 

Sphere of sun is formed of five elements, still 
it is very bright, so it emits light like a lamp. Its 
brightness can be felt by touch. (28) 


There are 8 parts of sun. Out of that, 4 are 
energy (fire) and other are having one parts each 
of remaining four elements. (29) 

Since fire (teja) element is dominant in sun, 
it is called taijas. But ‘teja’ of divine sun is 100 
times that of mars, fire etc. (30) 

Similarly in 8 parts of moon, 4 parts are water, 
hence it has coldness like snow ball. (31) Other 
parts are one each of remaining 4 elements. This 
is lighted with sun light only. (32) 


Description of Earth 827 


Notes : Only one notion borrowed from vedas 
is correct. First sun was the original fire ball 
(Hiranya garbha) from which Brahma was created. 
Second sun is the present sun, like any of the 
other stars. They are rather called first and second 
generation of stars. 


Hotness of sun or coldness of moon are 
completely erroneous ideas of middle period or 
dark ages of knowledge. Temperature of sun at 
surface is 6000°K and at centre it is almost 20 
million K. This cannot be felt by touch. Absolute 
temperature of fire is 300°C or about 600°K for 
wood fire. Surface temperature of sun may be 
called 10 times. Other comparisons have no sense. 


Verses 33-35 : Drinking of rays of moon 


It is stated in Santi patha of veda that moon 
drinks fire with its first ray or kala. This is not 
real but metaphorical. When brightness of moon 
is less, it looks red, hence, it is said that it drinks 
fire. (33) 

Light (Teja) cannot be drunk. Hence its 
meaning should be use or enjoyment. For ex- 
ample, Devadatta ate village, means he enjoyed 
the village. (In sanskrta ‘bhuj’ means to eat or. to 
enjoy). (34) 

Kala word has been used to indicate the time 
of increase or decrease of moon’s phase. Otherwise, 
on new moon day, all rays of moon are lost. Then 
we cannot talk about increase of kala. (35) 


Verses 36-38 : Nature of moon 


Small object is neglected compared to large 
one. Hence, due to abundance of cold in moon, 


828 Siddhanta Darpana 


its minor heat is not felt. But it is not a fact that 
moon is totally devoid of heat. In absence of heat, 
it will be still colder like snow. (36) 

Moon is full of water. It contains trees, 
mountains etc. They have been described as spots 
on moon. There are many old stories about it. (37) 


Mangala etc. also are like moon only (lighted 
‘by sun). But stars have their own light, according 
to me. Some persons call them water bodies also. 
Since long, there is controversy. (38) 


Verses 39-41 : Light of stars 

Diameter of moon at distance of stars is only 
5 vikala. If stars are pure water bodies, then they 
cannot be as bright due to sun rays at they are 
seen. On the other hand, if they are bright like 
sun, there will not be darkness during night. 
Hence, stars are neither bright like sun, nor watery 
like moon. (39-40) 

Thus, their light is reflected (aupadhika) like 
earth’s (or like mars’s). Planet is seen according to 
the extent of sunlight falling on it. 


Verse 42 - Due to base, colour of fire changes. 
Similarly sun rays are of one colour only, but it 
gets different colours after falling on different 
planets. 


Notes : Distance of stars is much larger than 
assumed here, hence the conclusion. Heat and 
coldness are same thing - different states of heat 
energy, which desperses like light at a distance. It 
is meaningless to talk of their combination. No 
planet, including earth is composed of mainly 


Description of Earth 829 


. water. Moon is totally waterless. Its spots are 
mountains and valleys on its surface. 


Sun light has all the colours, predominent 
portion reaching earth is the light visible to human 
eyes. Actually eyes of living beings on earth have 
evolved to see only that part of light. Colour of 
an object is seen because, rays of particular colour 
are reflected more, remaining are absorbed. 


Verses 43-44 : Beings on planets 


According to scriptures, pitr loka is on back 
side (invisible side from earth) of moon. Similarly, 
on other planets also, different life forms exist. (43) 


In any loka, living beings formed of that 
mahabhita exist, from which the loka has formed. 
_They use only that part of earth in whose contacts 
they come. (44) 

Notes - So far there is no evidence that any 
living beings exist on any other planet except earth. 
‘There may be life forms within dense clouds of 
venus or in interior almosphere of Jupiter, where 
heat and organic matter are available. But so far 
no evidence has been found from samples of those 
planets. 


On earth also the animals of different habitats 
‘are not different. A fish, a bird or an animal all 
have same body composition, it doesn’t has excess 
of water, air or solid. Actually water, air or earth 
are not element at all - they represent different 
States of matter - solid, liquid or gas. 


Verses 45-47 - Composition of earth. 

Situated at centre of universe, earth is formed 
_Of five mahabhitas. At the beginning, it had 4 
‘Parts of land (soil) out of 8 parts. (45) 


830 Siddhanta Darpana 


Remaining 4 parts were 1 part each of the 4 
other elements. On earth’s surface 3 parts are water 
and one part is land. Thus on one fourth part of 
the surface only, all men are living. (46-47) 


Notes - This composition of 4 parts soil and 
other parts have no meaning, as understood by 
modern science. It is mostly rocky and about half 
interior is hot liquid. 


Verses 48-53 : Jamba dvipa and Meru 


Surrounded by salt water ocean, two con- 
tinents are situated - one is upper and the other 
is lower continent. (48) 


Upper part of the lower continent and upper 
continent has been called Jamba dvipa. Southern 
half of lower continent and 1/12th of north half is 
called asura bhimi. This contains rivers and 6 
oceans and continents forming boundaries and 
countries. (44-50) 


Jamba dvipa also is divided into many 
countries by mountain ranges. Its area has not 
been stated by Brahmagupta, Sun god (in sirya 
siddhanta) or Bhaskaracarya. (51) 

In detail descriptions of earth, mountain 
details are not real (there are contradictions). Hence 
they are described only by name by learned men. 
(52) 

All texts have described height of meru as 84 
yojana. Its width is 256 yojana at surface and 320 
yojana below earth. 

Notes : (1) According to Jain jyotisa texts 
followed by Puranas, earth is regarded as made 
up of concentric rings of land masses alternatively 
surrounded by ocean rings. Mount Meru is placed 
at centre of central island Jambidvipa. Meru or 
Sumeru is north pole and Jambi dvipa is land 


Description of Earth 831 


mass upto 23-1/2°N latitude. Hence almost the 
entire north hemisphere is occupied by Jambi

(2) Dimensions of Meru - Aryabhata gives 
diameter of meru as 1 yojana, with same height. 
According to Puranas, Meru is 84,000 yojanas high 


832 Siddhanta Darpana 


of which 16,000 yojanas lie inside the earth. (Vayu 
purana Ch.34, gatha 1-45 ch.35, Ch: 35 gatha 11-32, 
Visnupurana AméSa 2, Ch. 2, gatha 5-19) 
Markandeya ch 54, gatha 5-19, Matsya purana ch

' Abhidhamma kosa of Vasubandhu, tells meru » 

as 1,60,000 yojanas total height of which 80,000 
yojanas are in water and remaining above earth. 

Lokaprakasa of Jain tells it 1,00,000 yojanas 
high of which 1000 yojanas lie inside the earth and 
99000 yojanas outside earth. Jambidvipa Prajnapti 
adds that it has diameter of 10090-10/11 yojanas at 
its base (inside flat earth) 10,000 yojanas at base 
on flat earth and 1000 yojanas at top. Tiloya Pannati 
also states equivalent measures. Meru is made up 
of frustrum of cones. Its diameter at lowest base 
is 10090-10/11 yojanas and goes on decreasing 
uniformly upto 1000 yojanas at a height of 1,00,000 
yojanas. 

Besides, at centre of the top of meru, a cilika 
(apex or summit) having 12 yojana diameter at its 
base, 4 yojanas at top and 40 yojanas height.

denote the diameter of meru at its lowest base,

Now let us assume - 
(i) That the observer is situated at O, lying 


‘at circumference of Jambudvipa whose radius of 


~ 50,000 y. 


~ 


(ii) that OGK represents the true horizontal 
plane of observer and it meets the direction of 
earth’s axis at G such that P lies at the true celestial 
north pole and OW represents a plane parallel to 
the equatorial plane. 

(iii) that OAK’ is the apparent horizontal plane 
of the observer 

(iv) that P’ is chosen such that its apparent 
altitude ZP’OK’ is equal to 2PGK (angle between 
axis of earth and true horizontal plane OGK). 

Now join P ‘with A, the point of intersection 


of apparent horizontal plane with axis of earth. 


Extend P’ A till it meets perpendicularly the plane 
OFJC at J. The plane OFJC is inclined to equatorial 
plane at 2 FOW which is equal to Z FAJ = angle 
between their perpendiculars. 


Imaginary locus of revolution of P around P’ 
is projected on flat earth as locus of F revolving 
round J. This produces the cone AFC. This is cut 
at G by plane GHB, parallel to flat earth. True 
horizontal plane OGK meets the axis of meru at 
N. 

Earth is concentric ring of landmasses, alter- 
nately surrounded by ocean rings with meru at 


_ centre. Hence, radius of Jambudvipa = OJ = 50,000y

ZP’ = Z P’AK’ - P’OK’ = 0°.49.

Thus true altitude of eBlestial north pole is

earth’s equator with ecliptic 23°28’ instead of 23°27’ 
at present. 

In ‘this figure, obliquity of ecliptic 2 PGK =

838 Siddhanta Darpana 


(ii) Circumference of Jambi dvipa coincides 
with parallel of maximum north declination of sun. 
Axis of meru is instantaneously taken such that 
OJ = 50000 y wherever O lies on periphery (23°5 
N). Earth’s true axis- passes through hypotenus of 
cone by meru, hence true radius of Jambi dvipa 
= 45000 y. 

(iii) Meru is an astronomical model for 
explaining attitude of celestial north pole as shown 
above. This view is further supported by the fact 
that the famous Kutuba minara in Delhi is situated 
at 28°31’28” north latitude and inclined at an angle 
of 5°1’28” to the vertical to south, i.e. perpendicular 
to 23°30’ north latitude. Sri Kedar Nath Prabhakar 
explains in Varahamihira Memorial volume that 
Kutubmindra is a model of meru at scale of 1 yard 
= 1000 yojanas. Inclination of Kutubaminara is 
equal to inclination of lunar orbit to the ecliptic. 
Thus its location is maixmum north latitude of 
moon. Hence kings of Delhi were called 
CandravamSsi. 


(4) Source of height of meru mentioned here 
is not Known. Candrasekhara has not mentioned 
as to which sastra he has quoted. However, 84 
yojana a figure appears to be 84,000 yojana of 
puranas. he has ommitted thousands because it 
will far exceed radius of earth. Even 840 yojana is 
equal to radius of earth. 


Since Jambtdvipa is from 23°.5 N to 90°N 
only, the deva bhimi or north hemisphere is extra 
land from equator to 23°.5 N latitude. Jambudvipa 
is thus most of Asia (above 23°5 N) and most of 
north America. Amoung southern land masses, 
parts of south America and Africa are north of 


Description of Earth 839 


equator, whch are estimated here 1/12th of north 
hemisphere. 

Oceans of water or sand (desert) serve as 
natural boundaries between continents. They are 
further subdivided by natural boundaries of moun- 
tains. Continents are called dvipa, its divisions by 
mountains are varsa. Varsa are further divided into 
janapada according to political and racial divisions. 


Verses 54-81 : Height and distance limit of 
vision. 

Varga parvatas (mountains dividing con- 
tinents) like Himalaya are each 50 yojanas high. 
Their width also is only 50 yojanas. Thus a related 
mathematics is being explained. (54) 

From this method, we can find the distance 
of high objects like ganku or hills, their visible 
portions or their limit of vision on earth’s surface 
can be found out. (55) 


Take a circle of any size and imagine it to be 
earth of (21,600) kala circumference (i.e. 360°). A 
Sanku of desired height is placed at its top. Its 
height is multiplied by 21,600 - - - (56) 

. and divided by circumference of earth. 
Result will be Sanku named sanskrta. This sanskrta - 
Sanku is kept at two places. At one place it is 
multiplied by trijya and at other place it is added 
to trijya. Sum is divided by product at first place. 
(57) 

Result will be utkrama jyad. Its chord will Be 
‘distance of visible limit is kala. If it is multiplied 
by circumference of earth and divided by kala of 
circle (21,600) Then (58) 


840 Siddhanta Darpana 


result will be distance from which sanku 
can be seen. If utkramajya is less than 7, another 
method is followed. It (utkrama jya ) is substracted 
from trijya. Square of remainder is again sub- 
stracted from trijya. Square root of the remainder 
will be the chord of utkramajya. (59) 


If utkrama jya chord is more than its arc, 
then its value is taken in vikala. (60) 

Example : Height of himalaya is assumed .to 
be a Sanku of 50 yojanas. (61) 

It is considered to be placed on circumference 
of earth of 5026 yojanas. By the method explained, 
its sanskrta Sanku will be 225 kala (62) 


By calculation at two places, its utkrama jya 
‘is 202. Its arc 1182 is the limit of visibility in kala. 
In yojana, it is 275. (Then 50 yojana high Himalaya 
can be seen from a distance of upto 275 yojanas). 
(63) 

Distance between observer and _ observed 
(Sanku) is. multiplied by kala of a circle (21,600) 
and divided by circumference of earth (5026). It 
will be bhuja kala. (64) 

If this bhuja kala is less than 3 raéi, then 
observer can see the Sanku. Square of bhuja kala 
jya is substracted from square of trijya. Square root 
of the remainder will be koti jya. (65) 

This koti jya substracted from (3438) trijya, 
will be utkramajya. Then sanskrta Sanku is multi- 
plied by kotijya and divided by trijya. (66) 

It gives sphuta Sanku. It is not seen, if it is 
less than utkramajya. Its excess height over 
utkramajya is seen over the obstructed part. (67) 


Description of Earth 841 


Utkramajya substracted from sphuta Sanku is 
dréya jya (jya of visible portion). Dréya jya is 
multiplied by trijya and divided by jya of difference 
between observer and observed. We get unnata 
“jya. (68) 

Arc of this unnatajya is visible portion of 
ganku over horizon of observer. This is multiplied 
by circumference (of earth) and divided by lipta of 
a circle (21,600). (69) 

Result is visible portion of Ssanku i.e. 
drsyonnati. This drsyonnati is multiplied by trijya 
and divided by kotijya to get visible portion height 
in yojanas. (70) 

Again utkramajya is multiplied by circum- 
ference of earth and divided by (21600). Result is 
multiplied by trijya and divided by kotijya. (Result 
is unseen portion of Sanku. (71) 

Example of Puri : Assume Nilacala (Puri) 
located 161 yojana south of Himalaya mountain 
base as place of observer. (72) 

For 161 yojana distance, bhujakala is 692, 
utkrama - jyd is 70 and kotijya is 3368. (73) 

Sanskrta sanku is 215, sphuta Ssanku 211, 
drSyajya 141 and unnata jya. (705) - - - (74) 

Arc of unnatajya (710) is unnatakala, 
dréyonnati 33 and sphuta drSyonnati is 34... (75) 

Visible portion is 16 yojana. Hence from 
Nilacala, Himalaya will be visible 12° above horizon 
(arc of 16 yojana). (76) 

These mountains are not visible due to 
_ obstruction by smoke, dust, frost, or cloud from 


842 Siddhanta Darpana 


such a far distance. But many stars of polar fish 
are obstructed by Himalaya. (77) 


That gives indication that himalaya is situated. 
But this doesn’t really prove the height, length 
and width of himalaya, NakSatras can be obstructed 
by cloud also (even if himalaya doesn’t reach that 
height). Real height of himalaya is only 1/40 part 
of this value (50 yojanas). (78). 

Thus, if himdlaya is assumed to be a Sanku 
of height 20,000 hands (30,000 ft.), then its sanskrta 
$anku is 322 vikala, whose utkrama jya also is 322 
_ vikala (i.e. 5 kala 22 vikala). (79) 


Its arc will be 192 kala, hence visible limit is 
89 kosa: (44-1/2 yojana). Hence himalaya can be 
seen only from a distance upto 89 kosa from its 
base. (80) 

Kulacala (mountains dividing varsa_ into 
janapadas) Mahendra parvata is only 1/8 as high 
as Himalaya. This can be seen from a distance upto 
30 kosa from its base. (81).

However angular elevation of BD from

Visible height L-h is given by drSyajya/cosé

(3) Since radius of Jambidvipa is assumed to 
be 50,000 yojanas, the varSa parvatas, dividing it 
into sectors should be equal to 50,000 yojanas. 
Then they will extend from ocean to ocean if they 
completely divide the continents. Thus himalaya, 
theoretically is assumed to touch ocean in both 
ends. See Kumara sambhava of Kalidasa, Ist verse-

i.e. Himalaya touches ocean both in east and 
west and as such it is a scale to measure earth, 
in the sense that it is a standard for division of 
continents. We may assume that the extended 
direction of himalaya or other varsa parvatas in 
both direction upto ocean are the dividing lines.

Verses 82-87 : Meru and Kumeru 


Meru has 84 yojana height and 256 yojana 
extent width. Then the gods situated at end of 
Amaravati (last portion of Meru) will not have 
night, even when sun is in south kranti. (82) 
Becuase its lambam&a will be 11°30’ (aksamSa 
78° 30") and drstaméa (vision limit) will be 25° (for 
84 yojana height). On this arc, sun at southernmost 


848 Siddhanta Darpana 


position also will be seen 13° above horizon. Thus 
it cannot be said that gods do not see sun for 6 
months. (83) 


On equinox day (when sun has 0° kranti), 
then in part éclipse of moon, shadow of meru 
within earth’s shadow will be 4 kala more. Hence, 
height. of meru should be less than Himalaya. 
(84-85) 

Sailors in ocean, see dhruva (pole star) above 
their head, but don’t see meru. This doesn’t mean 
that meru doesn’t exist. (86) 


Meru is abode of gods and Kumeru of asuras 
(dernon) Due to their maya (illusion), they are not 
visible like gods and demons, meru and kumeru 
also can be seen only by their worship and grace.

S is southern most ee of sun, E is 
equator. 


Then OSX is direction of sun. _ 23-1/2° 

ZEOV = Z NOE - Z NOM - Z MOV 

= 90° -- 11°30’ - 25° = 90° - 36°30’ 

Then ZSOV = ZSOE + ZEOV = 23-1/2° + 
90° - 36°30’ = 90° - 13° 

Hence Z VSO = ZXOV’ = 90° - (90° - 13°) 
= 13°. Thus sun will be 13° above horizon from 
M or Vv.

Radius of shadow Meru shadow 


Radius of earth Meru height 

' 84 x 33 Kala 

or Meru shaodw = ——ei- 4 Kala approx. 

This can be seen on moon only in part eclipse 
against bright portion of moon. Neither shadow of 
meru is seen, nor it is visible to sailors, because 
it is not a mountain at all. It is a projection of 
earth’s axis. 


Verses 88-91 : Location of India. 


(Southern) Coast of Jambiidvipa is at average 
distance of 270 yojanas from equator, but this 
distance is not uniform every where. (88) 

Kumari antaripa (Kanya Kumari) is in nairrtya 
. (south west) direction from Nilacala (Puri). Dvaraka 
is in vayavya angle (north west) from Kumari. 
Again Puri is east from Dwaraka. All ‘the. _ three 
places are on coast. (89) Si 


Thus the triangle formed by these three places 
is in southern part of India (Bharata varsa). Again 
by seeing the .difference (distance) between east, 
west and central portions, it is clear that (90) - - - 


850 Siddhanta Darpana 


Bharata is shaped like a conch shell (Sankha) 
Therefore, Jambudvipa is not circular. Similarly 
oceans also are not circular (as stated in puranas) 
(91) 


Verses 92-98 : Variations in oceans 


Oceans also are of diffrent shapes and areas. 
They have been named as eastern, western, 
southern and northern. They have been named | 
differently at different places. (92) 

In lavana (salt water) ocean there are more 
than hundred islands. It is learnt that more than 
100 crore people live in earth. (93) 

In 1 kalpa, earth sphere increases by 1 yojana 
in all directions, this principle has been well 
established. This is average increase, and actual 
increase differs from place to place. (94) 

In many directions soil is eroded to different 
extent due to wind, ocean, rains and river flow. 
(95) 

Due to unequal erosion, sometimes small and 
large islands submerge in water, sometimes they 
arise from ocean. Their shapes also change. (96) 


Still this change of land mass or ocean doesn’t 
change the spherical shape of earth. There is only 
change of place between land and sea. (97) 

galt water ocean is partly mixed with milk 
and curd at some places. Oceans of pure milk’ or 
curd stated in puranas don’t exist anywhere. (98) 

Notes : Population of earth at present is above 
500 crores. There is no evidence of increase of 1 
yojana radius of earth in a kalpa, though miniute 
quantity of meteors are added. Due to change in 
salt content, depth, currents or waves and im- 


Description of Earth 851 


purities there is slight change in colour of rivers 
or oceans. To highlight those changes, they have 
been named as red sea, blue nile, ocean of milk 
etc. 


Verses 99-108 : Discussion on meru 


There have been many changes from the 
creation. Earth as described in old siddhantas and 
the situation at present time are different (99) 


(Adi yamala) The meru mountain at centre of 
earth on one of whose hills, there are 33 crore 
gods as described in puranas, is only heard now, 
but not seen anywhere. (100) 


(Sirya siddhanta) : From centre of earth two 
meru mountains extend in opposite directions. 
They are golden and contain many jewels (101) On 
north meru, Indra and other gods and sages reside. 
On lower (south) meru or kumeru, demons 
(asuras), anti to gods reside (102) Around both 
merus, ocean has surrounded earth along its whole 
circumference. They divide the regions of gods and 
demons very distinctly. (103) 

Devas live on sumeru and asuras on kumeru. 
The greatest circumference at equal distance from 
both is called equator (or circle with zero latitude). 
(104) 

The circles parallel to equator, become succes- 
sively smaller in direction of either meru. They are 
called aksamSa (latitude) lines. The line between 

-two merus cutting these circles is called desantara 
(longitude) line. (105) 

Thus the lines which have been assumed on 
celestial sphere, have been assumed on earth’s 
surface also. The place on earth, where line from 


852 Siddhanta Darpana 


earth centre to celestial line meets, is the location 
of that line. (106) 


As there are ‘cakras’ (nerves centre in energy 

body) in human body (6 cakra in spine and one 
‘at top of head), in the universe as grand body of 
god also, seven lokas are situated in its spine like 
‘pravaha’ wind. (107) 

Meru in sky has been supposed to be support 
of all lokas (worlds) by scriputres. It is said to be 
very windy. Its base is within water and it has 16 
tops. (108) 


Verses 109-112 - Hints on geography - 


Earth is called ‘Hiranmayi (golden, or full of 
energy or gems). It is viewed as a spherical body 
like bowl. Its first cover is land or soil. Beyond 
that, successive layers exist, each being 10 times 
the previous. (109) 


Next to land is the layer of water, and at last 
there is prakrti (energy field). Countries (seas, 
towns, etc are generally described in bhugola 
(geography) only. (110) 

Hence only a brief hint of that subject has 
been given here in a text of astronomy. Later on, 
in gola chapter, their real measures will be stated. 
(111) 

For satisfying curiosity, and identifying loca- 
tions of various places on earth, many verses are 
quoted from the standard text ‘siddhanta siromani’ 
(by Bhaskara II). (112) 

Verses 113-152 : Geography quoted from 
Bhaskara - At the centre of earth, on equator, is 
located Lanka. East from Lanka (90°E) is Yamakoti 


Description of Earth 853 


pattana, at same distance in west in Romaka 
pattana. Just below Lanka (i.e. at 180°) is Sid- 
dhapura. In north of Lanka (at 90°) is sumeru 
‘(north pole) and south is south pole. (113) 

All these six places are at 1 quadrant from 
each other. Sura (gods) and siddha (sage or adepts) 
live in meru. At Aurva or Badavanala’ (south pole 
- kumeru), asuras live. (114) 

Wherever a man is located on earth, he thinks 
earth as below and himself as above. He considers 
places at 90° distance as oblique. (115) 

As we see reflection in water vertically 
downwards, men on earth at 180° from each other 
see themselves as upwards and the other as head 
down wards. But as we are steady at our position, 
the persons at oblique and down places also sit 
like wise. (116) 

North of salt water ocean is Jambiidvipa (the 
great jambia continent), which is half of the earth 
(or half the land mass). Opposite to it in south 
hemesphere there are salt water and other oceans 
and 6 dvipas (continents) (117) 


First lies lavana (salt water) and then kSira 
(milk) ocean. From milk ocean moon and Laksmi 
arose. Vasudeva himself resides there, whose body 
is the whole universe. All the gods including 
Brahma (creator) worship his feet. (118) 


After milk ocean, lie curd (dadhi), ghee 
(butter), sugarcane juice, wine and lastly fresh 
water oceans at increasing distances. Within this 
fresh waters ocean lies Badvanala (fire within seas) 
or southpole. Deep places on earth are called 
Patala. (119) 


854 Siddhanta Darpana 


In patala loka asura and serpents (sarpa) live. 
That is lighted by mani (jewel) in head of sarpas. 
Siddhas roam about with their jewel of virtues. 
Then the gold ornaments of their bodies shine. 
Beautiful bodies of siddha and divine ladies are 
always shining with brightness of ornaments. (120) 


All seven oceans are circular (ring shaped). 
There are six continents interspersed between 
them. Continents are named as Saka, Salmali, Kuéa, 
Kraunca, Gomedaka and Puskara. Another name 
for gomedaka is plakSa. (121) 


North from Lanka is Himalaya, then 
Hemaktita and Nisadha mountains. Each extends 
upto ocean. Again from Siddhapura, northwards 
lie Srngavana, Sukla and Nila mountains. The 
countries between two mountains are called ‘droni’ 
(trough) countries. (122) 


North from Lanka, first comes Bharatavarsa, 
then Kinnar deSa, then Harivarsa. North from 
Siddhapura are kuru, Hiranmaya and Ramyaka 
versas in order. (123) 


North from Yamakoti pattana is Malyavana 
and North from Romaka is Gandhamadana moun- 
tains. Both mountains extend upto Nila and 
Nisadha mountains respectively. Region between 
Nila and Nisadha is called Ilavrtta varsa. (124) 


Region between Malyavana and ocean is called 
Bhadraturaga. Geographers call the land between 
Gandha-madana and ocean as Ketumalaka varsa. 
(125) 

[lavrtta varsa is surrounded on four sides by 
Nisadha, Nila, Gandhamadana and Malyavana. In 
this large country devas live happily in their 


Description of Earth 855 


houses. Soil of this land is beautiful and strange 
and contains gold mines. (126) 


At its centre lies Meru mountain. Its soil is 
golden and according to Purana knowers, it is 
abode of devas. This mountain itself is the stalk 
of lotus like earth from which Brahma had taken 
birth. (127) 


There are four viskumbha (branch) mountains 
of Meru - Mandara (mandaracala), Sugandha 
(Gandha madana) Vipula and Suparsva. They 
abound in, respectively Kadamba (Ficus Kadamba), 
Jambu (Eugenia jambolana), Vata (Ficus Bengalen- 
sis) and Pipala (Ficus religiosa). (128) 

From the fall of juice of ripe jambu fruits, 
one river of jambu juice has formed. In contact of 
this water, soil turned to gold. Deva and siddha 
like its water so much that they leave even drinking 
of nectar also. (129) 


Below the four branch mountains of Meru, 
there are four forest regions. Caitraratha is very 
picturesque, In Nandana forest apsara (deva girls, 
literally, ladies moving in water) play. Dhrti forest 
gives ‘dhairya’ (patience) to gods. Vaibhraja is very 
interesting. (139) 

There are four lakes in these four forests 
Aruna, Manasa, Mahahrada and Sveta - dala. When 
deva women are tired, they enjoy in these lakes. 
(131) 

There are three top of Meru - each is formed 
of jewels and gold. On the three tops are the pura 
(towns) of Visnu, Brahma and Siva. Below these 
tops lie the towns of Indra, (kings of gods), Agni 
(fire god), yama (Death god - JamaSida of Persians), 


856 Siddhanta Darpana 


rakSasa (a race of man in direction of Africa - south 
west from India), Varuna (Taj or Arab race), Pavana 
(north west direction), Kubera (wealth god) and 
Siva. (These are in eight directions from India 
starting from east clockwise - and called lord of 
those directions). (132) 


From feet of Visnu, Ganga river first landed 
on Meru. From there, it was divided into four 
parts, and proceeded below four branch mountains 
through their four lakes. (133) 

Sita ganga in Bhadraéva varsa, Alakananda 
(Ganga) in Bharatavarsa, VakSu ganga in Ketumala 
and Bhadra ganga in north Kuruvarsa. (134) 

Many sinners are purified by Ganga - by 
listening,. desire to see, seeing, touching, bath, 
drinking water, devotion, memory or praising. (135) 

‘ust by proceeding towards Ganga, the 
bondage of pitr rna (debt of forefathers) is broken. 
Man jumps with joy as soon as he reaches banks 
of Ganga and wins over agents of Yama (death). 
By entering water, he is free from hell and enters 
heaven. (136) 


There are many parts of India - Indra, KaSeru, 
Tamraparna, Gabhastiman, Kumarika, Naga, 
Saumya, Varuna and Gandharva. (137) 


Varna order (4 codes of conduct) exists only 
in Kumarika khanda. There are 7 kulacala (moun- 
tains dividing the Kula or races of man) 
Mahendra, Sukti, Malaya, Rka, Pariyadtra, Sahya 
and Vindhya. (138) 

The place of zero latitude is called equator. 
Region near equator is called bht loka, north region 
is called ‘bhuvar loka’. Meru is ‘Svah’ loka. Above 


Description of Earth 857 


that lie the lokas of Mahah, Jana, Tapa and satya. 
(139) 

. When it is sunrise at Lanka, it is midday at 
Yamakoti, sunset at Siddhapura and mid night at 
Romaka.. (140) 


Rising direction of sun is called east and 
setting direction is west. The directions between 
east and west are north and south on either sides. 
Four angle directions are bisectors of the angles 
between four directions. Meru is north from all. 
- (141) 

Yamakoti pattana is 1/4th circumference (90°) 
east from Ujjayini. But Ujjayini is not exact west 
from Yamakoti. Lanka is exact west from Yamakoti. 
(142) 

It appears thus, that a place may be east from 
first place, but first place may not be west from 
that. Only on equator, this strange thing daesn’t 
happen. (143) 

On equator, a man sees both poles, sumeru 
and kumeru on his horizon towards north and 
south. Kranti vrtta (ecliptic) is above his head like 
a water instrument (for measuring time). (144) 


_ As a man proceeds north from equator, kranti 
vrtta progressively dips towards south, and north 
pole rises above horizon. Altitude of north pole 
above horizon, or dip of ecliptic below zenith is 
exactly equal to the aksama (latitude) of the place) 
north of equator. (145) 


Distance from equator in yojana is multiplied 
by 360 and divided by circumference of earth. It 
gives aksamSa of the place. By doing reverse, we 


858 Siddhanta Darpana 


can find the yojana distance of equator from 
akSamSa. (146) 

As the people at sumeru, see north pole 
vertically above, similarly at kumeru, south pole is 
seen at zenith. In north pole ecliptic is seen moving 
in left (clockwise) direction. At south pole it looks 
moving in right direction. (147) 

Due to matter expelled from earth (in volcanos 
etc.) radius of earth increases by 1 yojana in all 
directions in a kalpa of Brahma. In night of Brahma, 
this increase is nullified. (148) 


Daily death of living beings is called daily 
pralaya. When whole creation merges in body of 
Brahma after end of his day (kalpa), it is called 
Brahma pralaya. (149) 


After Brahma completes his life period, whole 
creation merges in nature (Prakrti - Energy field). 
All distinction between matter ceases. Mimansakas 
(thinker - one of 6 branches of philosophy) call it 
Prakrtika pralaya. Again, at the time of creation, 
prakrti creates distinction among particles. (150) 

Yogis burn their good work and sins both in 
their fire of realisation and engage their mind 
wholly in god. They are totally merged in god and 
don’t desire to come into world again. That is 
called atyantika pralaya. Thus there are four types 
of pralaya - daily, brahma, prakrtika and atyantika. 
(151) 

Thus these verses have stated locations of 
earth, mountains, deva, danava, manava, nakSatra, 
graha and their orbits, lokas mahas, jana tapa etc 
one above other. They are all located in the interior 
of universe (stomach like cosmic egg - brahmanda). 
(152) 


Description of Earth 859 


Notes : (1) There is great confusion about 
lokas, dvipas etc. and puranas are not consistant 
in their description. They do not describe the 
present cofiguration of continents. However Jain 
astronomy indicates that Jambtdvipa is the earth 
north of 23-1/2°N latitude and Meru is axis of 
earth’s rotation. In that context meru and kumeru 
are very clear as north and south poles of sky. 
However, on earth, the Meru mountain is con- 
sidered to be ‘Pamira’ plateau from where 4 great 
mountain ranges like Himalayas spread. 

Thus Jambtdvipa means most of Asia and 
complete Europe and North America except Mexico 
south portions (Central America). Other dvipas are 
other peripheral regions of Jambidvipa or southern 
continents like Australia, South America and Africa. 
It doesn’t include Antarctica (south polar continent) 
which is said to contain ‘badavanala’ i.e. ocean fire 
- which may refer to land mass below cold ice or 
water. 


Seven lokas in tantra are seven levels of man’s 
existence or seven levels of physical, shadow or 
energy body etc. However, Brahmavaivarta purana 
tells 7 lokas in svarga (i.e. north hemisphere) or 
Jambidvipa 

Bhu, bhuvar, Svar (Kasmira or Tibbet), Mahar, 
Tapa (Steppees) and satyaloka (snowbound polar 
regions) These are northwards from equator. 


At base of meru (down ward portion kumeru), 
there is town of Ananta (Sesa naga) who holds 
the earth. Ananta is ‘Antarctica’ and the town in 
that direction is Tiru - Anantapura in kerala which 


860 Siddhanta Darpana 


is almost southern most town of India. South of 
it there is no land mass except Antarctica. 

In lower regions (south hemisphere) or lower 
from Pamira, there are seven patala - 

Atala, vitala, sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Patdala 
and Rasatala. (lowest region). 

From Pamira, rasatala corresponds to Amajon 
river in Brazil. S. Muzaffar Ali has opined that tala 
means incline, which is also indicated in puranas. 
This has become ‘Iklima’ in Hebrew and Arabic, 
clime in Greek and climate in English. If the regions 
are successively south of‘equator they are definitely 
climatic regions. However, viewed from Pamira, 
they start after end of Eurasian continent. Thus 
according to Bhagavaddatta, .Talatala is north 
African region where a town Til-at-tala (amarna) 
still exists. Atala is Italy and corresponds to old 
Atlantis contient and present Atlantic ocean. 

8 Towns of Indra etc. are on eight sides of 
Meru (or Pamira). Varahamihira opines that these 
directions are taken from central poriton of India, 
Ujjain. Thus Indra is east (Burma and Thailand - 
Jravati river). Agni region is Australia or Indonesia. 
Yama region cannot be in exact south hence it may 
mean .Australia and New Zealand. South west 
(Nairrtya) is Africa, West varuna is Arab land. 
Bhagavaddatta also opines that old name of Arab 
race is Taj, derived from Varuna (yadas). Northwest 
is marut (windy areas of central asia). North is 
Kubera i.e. Tibbet and its north. North east is 
China, Japan (iSa) - of MaheSa. Muzaffar Ali opines 
Hwang-Ho as Maha ganga.

Lanka

Pattana 


Yamakoti 
pattana 


Figure 7 - Jambidvipa of Puranas 


Location of cardinal towns : Lanka is south 
of Ujjain at equator by definition. The country 
named Lanka is very close to it, but slightly 
towards east and north. Hence Lanka has been 
assumed point on equator on longitude of Ujjain. 


Yamakoti and Romaka have been described 
as pattanas (i.e. ports). Hence they must be coastal 
towns 90° east and same longitude west of Ujjain 
75°54” E. Thus Romaka pattana could be Conakry 
of Guinea in west Africa which is a port at that 
longitude and close to equator. ‘Conakry’ like 
‘Konark’ means a port. Yama means south direction 
and Koti is end point of a land mass protruding 
in sea. That is south western tip of south island 
of New Zealand or south eastern tip of New 
“Celedonia (Nouma) which is also a port very close 
‘to south tropic near equator. Nauru island is almost 
Rear equator at that longitude, but it is not a Koti, 
but a coral island. However, it is very close to 


862 Siddhanta Darpana 


Kiribati islands where huge stone structures are 
found. At the location of Siddhapura, the town 
nearest to equator is west of Mexico - At present 
near lake Chapale or Guadalajara town. Nearby 
huge pyramids exist which were constructed to 
mark the end of east direction as remarked in 
Valmiki Ramayana (Kiskindha Kanda). 

At angle direction in south west is abode of 
RakSasa - 45° west from Ujjain are the great 
pyramids of Egypt. Neighbouring Libya was named 
after Prahlada son of the first Daitya king Hiranya 
kaSipu, who ruled before gods. North of Libya are 
‘Daitya’ lands i.e. Deutsch land (Germany) and 
Dutch (Netherlands). That was approximately 
‘Atala’ loka ruled by Prahlada (around Italy). 


(3) Seven continents : All seven continents 
are interprated within Eurasia and Africa by various 
scholars. However, the description of Jambu dvipa 
means that it includes most of Eurasia and north 
America. The diagram in Fig 7 indicates that 
Jambtidvipa has following parts 

Asia - From north-Ilavrtta - Scandinavia, 
Siberia, north Russia, Nisadha is Varkhoyansk 
range (varsa parvata) in Siberia, Urala mountains 
(north Russia) Kjolen mountains of Sweden may 
be its west boundary. Then comes Harivarsa 
(Russian and Mangolian planes). Hemkita is Altai, 
Nan shan ranges in China. Then China, Tibet area 
is Kimpurmsa varsa, whose mongoloid features 
have given the name Kinnar or Kimpurusa (Are 
they man?). Then is Bharata Varse North Mexico, 
i.e. present Mexico, Texas etc are Kuru. Mexico 
plateau is Srngvana, middle Rockies and Ap- 
palachian mountains are Sveta or Sukla (white 


Description of Earth 863 


mountains). Plains of U.S.A are Hiranyaka varsa 
(‘Red’ Indians). North Rockies and Labrador are 
Nila mountains. Candian plains are Ramyaka varsa. 


Above Yamakoti, there is no land mass. Hence 
only one mountain has been .named, which may 
be ‘Sikhote Alin’ range east of Siberia. Thus 
Bhadraéva varsa may be China, Japan, Korea and 
east Siberia. 


Above Romaka pattana also is only one 
mountain range Gandhamadana. First range is 
Atlas which continues through Spanish plateau to 
Alps. Ketumala may be west Europe and north: 
Africa. 


Other dvipas should start from south 
perlphery in east or west of Jambidvipa or south 
of Mexico. 


(2) Kuga Dvipa is almost universally accepted 
as Africa. Egypt was called Kua in earlier days, 
Ethiopians call themselves Kua. Muzaffar Ali 
opines Persia to Isreal as Kuga including north 
Africa. Himalayas in Afganistan are called Hindu 
Kua i.e. Indian part of Kua. It is by nature grass 
land or desert. 


(3) Saka Dvipa is south east Asia which 
abounds in Teak trees accordig to M. Ali. (Saka 
means Teak). It might also include land upto 
Australia and New Zealand, including Indonesia. 


(4) Salmali dvipa is identified as south and 
.€ast Africa. It included Madagaskara - Harina dvipa 
Of puradnas or Sankha dvipa (Zenj of Arab) 
Zanjibar i.e. Tanzania coast. 


(5) Kraufica dvipa - It is named on mount 
Kraufica. Mahabharata. tells it west from Meru, 


864 Siddhanta Darpana 


(12, 14, 21-5) and in north (6-12). Brhat samhita 
and Ramayana locate it in the north. KuSa and 
Kraunca are always mentioned together. It may be 
north west Europe according to Sri M. Ali and on 
similar considerations, eastern Canada and Green- 
land. It surrounds ghrtoda (butter like) sea i.e. icy 
seas between north west Europe and Canada. 

(6) PlakSa dvipa - It is mentioned as Gomeda 
in varaha, matsya puranas and siddhanta Siromani. 
It is named after PlakSa or Pakara’ tree which is 
characteristic of warm temperate or mediterranean 
islands. It is also in central America and Careabian 
islands. It is identified with fig tree. According to 
Wilford, the name still persists in Placia, a town 
in Mysia. There was a Peleasgi race in Cristone or 
Crotoen near Tyrrhanians in Itlay and Pelagsi who 
lived on shores of Hellespont. According to 
Herodotus they all spoke the same language. Sri 
V.V. Ayer identifies it with Greece and adjoining 
lands. The old names of America have been lost 
but it. appears to be continued till central America 
through West Indies and old Atlantis. 

(7) PuSkara dvipa : It has two parts - one has 
no rain fall, no springs or vegetation. Other part 
is full of water, lakes. It has a huge circular 
mountain chain named Citransu in eastern half of 
dvipa. Western half is surrounded by another 
circular range named Manasa with Mahavita (as its 
spur covering outer rim) son of Manasa. Other 
puranas tell that there is a mountain range running 
through the whole of dvipa, dividing it into two 
parts. According to Mastya, Manasa is like a full 
moon rising near sea coast. 

Sri M. Ali identifies it with Korea and Japan. 
Other efforts are also unsatisfactory if we limit 


Description of Earth 865 


ourselves within Jamba dvipa only. The mountain 
range on east coast is in Australia, which is 
actually ‘called the great dividing range and is 
almost semi circular. Mountains of west and central 
desert are not exactly circular but the region 
between them is full of lake and rivers, while outer 
region is desert. 


It tallies better with South America which is 
totally divided from north to south by Andes 
mountain in west portion. This may be manasa 
range which is exactly semicircular from north coast 
to Bolivia. Guyana highlands are almost its con- 
tinuation which may be called son of Manasa or 
Mahavita. Circular mountains in east coast are 
Brazilian high lands which are called Citransu due 
to’ extensive forest cover (hence colourful and 
picturesque). 

West of Andes is desert, but east and specially 
north east portion is full of water. 


Actually north America also is continuation of 
that mountain range. Rockies and Andes combined 
may. be called Lokaloka parvata as it extends from 
north pole to south polar region. Beyond that is 
Pacific, the biggest ocean, called sweet water ocean. 


(4) : Parts of India - The later descriptions, 
describe whole Jambudvipa within Asia only. M. 
Ali identifies the mountains of Jambudvipa as 

Nila - Zerafshan, Trans Alai, Koksal Tan,

Verses 153-166 : Dimensions of earth 
. Diameter of earth is 1600 yojana. Its circum- 
ference is calculated by multiplying with 3927 and 
dividing with 1250. For simpler method, multiply 
the diameter by (600) and divide by (191) to get 
circumference. (153) 

By this method circumference of earth is 1600 
X 600 / 191 — 

= 5026/10/41 yojana, which is author’s view 
also. Circumference multiplied by diameter gives, 
surface area which is 

5026/10/41X-1600 = 80,41,885 (yojana)?

area of circle. Area of circle multiplied by 2 
gives area of curved face of hemi-sphere con- 
structed on that. This is 1/4th more than the earlier 

result. (158) 


Hence method for correct volume is stated. 
Circumference of a sphere is divided into (21,600) 
kala. Its radius is (3438) kala. Above and below 
the circumference we mark the two surface centres. 
(159) 

Central circumference (21,600 kala) is in exact 
middle of upper and lower centres. It is called 

- €quator, From top point upto equator, we draw 
circles at difference of 225 kala, each parallel to 
equator. (160) 

i: There are 23 rings between equator and these 
_sircles Width of each ring is 225 kala. As we

proceed from the equator to top, circumference 
gets smaller. The width of each ring is perpen- 
dicular on circumference. (161) 

Find the akSajya at each place. Its square is 
substracted from square of trijya and we take 
square root of remainder. Result will be meee. 
(162) 

Sum of all these lambajya will . be 
(52,532/38/24). Area of largest ring is found by 
multiplying its circumference (21,600) by its width. 
(225) 

This area (48,60,000) is multiplied by sum of 
all lambajya and divided by trijya. (164) 

We get the area of surface of hemisphere 
(7,42,60,800). Its double is surface area of sphere 
(14, 85, 21,600) in (kala)* - - - (165) 

(Diameter X circumference) also gives the same

that the surface area of sphere is equal to area of 
rectangle of length as circumference and width as 
diameter. (166) |

Area of sphere is calculated by method of 
integral calculus, i.e. dividing its surface in infinite- 
ly small circular strips (or any other type of

Brahma and Surya siddhantas. have called the 
half chord as jya. (Jyardha). At some places gavyuti 
has been stated equal to yojana of 4 kosa. (Then 
8 kosa = 1 yojana). By this scale, diameters of 
earth, moon and sun are reduced by half to 800, 
222, and 36,000 yojanas. (171) 


According to Visnudharmottara Purana, . 


1 Sanku = 12 angula 

12 Sanku = 1 hand 

4 hands = 1 dhanu (bow) 
1000 dhanu = 1 kosa . 


As per this measure, value of diameters is as 
_ Stated in this book earlier (Sun 72,000, moon 444, 
earth 1600) (172) 

Quotation from the purana gives the above 
measures (173) 

If we raise our hands above head and stand 
on toes, then 1/5th of that height is called 1 hand. 
By this scale 1 yojana has been considered equal 
to 28160 hands (= 8 miles). In this scale circum- 
ference of earth is 3093/40 yojana and diameter is 
984/45 yojana. (174) 

Area of earth in this scale is 30,46,488 (yojana)* 
and volume is 50,00,04,843 i.e. approximately 50 
crore yojanas. (Explaination of Brahma siddhanta 
value quoted in verse 13 of chapter 17). After 
concluding description of earth, now I will state

Chapter - 19 
EARTH AND SKY 
Bhigola Khagola Varnana 


Verses 1-2- - Origin of spheres 

Before creation of living beings; for creating 
sense organs of body and their subjects of 
experience, Brahma (creator) created two types of 
seeds - internal and external types. External seed 
became cover of cosmic egg (Brahmanda). From 
internal seed, five spheres were created within 
universe - sky, air, sun rays, moon and earth. (1) 

Meru of sky itself has been called marut (air). 
In sky spehre, Meru (line joining north and south 
poles) is like axle (yasti). Around it, nakSatras 
revolve. Universe is tied with this Meru-danda (rod 
of meru - also means spine of hurnan body). From 
earth as root of the tree of universe, upto 
Brahmanda, seven airs, starting with avaha, are 
located in spherical shells, one containing the 
previous. Within these 6 shells of air, lie moving 
and fixed creation, stars, planets, clouds etc. 


Verses 3-6 : Air’ spheres as per Siddhanta 
Siromani 

Air on earth is called avaha. After that lie the 
spheres of pravaha, samvaha, suvaha, parivaha, 
and paravaha, one above the other. (3) 


; Earth and Sky 889 


7 From earth’s surface, earth’s air or Avaha 
‘ extends till 12 yojana. This contains clouds and 
‘lightning etc. Above that exists Pravaha whose 
motion is always from east to west. (4) 


At its centre, orbits of planets and _ stars 
revolve in westerly direction being pushed by 
Pravaha. (5) 


Within the west moving nakéatra sphere, the 
planets move with their small east motion, as an 
insect moves on a rotating wheel of potter with 
small speed against the rotation of wheel. (6) 


Verses 7-11 - Nature of planetary orbits. 


Madhyama sun moves in east direction. 
Around it, planets attracted by mandocca, revolve. 
They go in west direction also. Hence, the orbits 
of planets are of many types like madhyama and 
sphuta. (7) 

Moon and sun revolve round earth. Due to 
small or big attraction of mandocca, their motion 
is changed slightly. Hence at first madhyama kakSa 
(mean orbit) is written. Then smaller orbits for 
finding true motion will be written. (8) 

As the planets mangala, guru, Sani are very 
far from earth and move with slow speed, their 

-madhya kakéa has centre at madhyama sun. (9) 


Orbit of madhyama sun will be their sighra 
orbit. Between sun and earth, budha and Sukra 
are faster, hence their madhya kakSa is sun orbit 
only. (10) 

The sighra orbit of budha and sukra around 
“sun can be treated as mean orbit also to find the 
distance (manda karna) from sun, as the madhya 


890 Siddhanta Darpana 


orbit of sun and moon is used to find their distance 
from earth. Distance of outer planets from sun is 
manda karna and from earth is sighra karna. 
Verses 12-18 : Orbit lengths 


Madhya orbits of sun, budha and sukra are 
4, 78,00,800 yojana. 


This is also the sighra orbit of mangala, guru 
and Sani. 


Sighra orbit of Budha is (1,84,56,420) yojana 
Sukra Sighra orbit is: (3,46,55,580) yojana 
Mangala manda or mean orbit (7,23,03,600)

_ Madhya orbit 
Moon orbit is (3,06,000) yojana —

Kakéa (orbit) length multiplied by 191 and 


divided by 1200 give distance of tara graha from 
sun and of nakSatra and moon from earth. 


' Notes : Distance of planet mainly depends on 
bigger orbit called manda or madhya orbit. Minor 
differences are due to smaller pEbit which is faster 
also. 
Orbit length is circumference of the circular 
orbit = 2 ar where r is radius or karna - distance 
of planet from centre of its orbit.

Verses 19-21 : 

Sphuta mandakarna in yojana 

_ madhya karna X_sphuta karna in kala 

- Radius (3438) 

As mandaphala correction in madhya graha, - 
in Sighrocca of budha and Sukra also this correction 
is done. (19) 

Distance of 5 tara graha is found by multi- 
plying madhya karna by third manda karna in kala 
and dividing by trijya. Result is multiplied by 4th 
Sighra karna in kala and divided by trijya. Karna 
multiplied by 1200 and divided by 191 will give 
the orbit. 

Notes : Madhya karna in kala is the value of 
trijya in kala. Thus average distance of each planet 
is assumed 3438 kala. Thus proportionate value of 
‘sphuta karna also is expressed in kala. 

Sphuta karna kala 
Madhya karna kala (trijya = 3438) 
: Sphuta karna yojana 

Madhya karna yojana 

For tara graha we obtain mandasphuta first, 
' by the 3rd manda karna by this formula. Then the 
change due to Sighra orbit (Sighra karna) is found 
_ by treating manda sphuta as madhya karna = trijya 
3438. 

Thus 

manda sphuta karna _ Sighra karna yojana 

Trijya (3438) ~ Sighra karna kala

-Sun diameter 72,000 


(2) Evidently, in accepting WMoaandiancer 1444

been dropped. As per this principle

This is equal to for equal linear 


. After rejecting this theory, he has not given 
any new Principle to calculate the distance of the 
planets. 

However, ene discussion shows that, 
for inner planets

and for outer planets 
_Sumorbit: _ Sighra_kakéa 
Orbit length length “>. 360° ; — 
Thus the dimension of fighra paridhis are the 
basis of calculating their lengths. Then we can use . 


the formula given above in note (1) in verse 23 to 
find linear speed. 


Verses 28-29 : Linear motion in nakSatra kaksa 
Linear speed in nakSatra kaksa (Ayanagati) 
Linear speed in own orbit 
own orbit in kala x 21,600 
Ayana gati in yojana is multiplied by graha 
kak§a yojana and divided by nakSatra kakSa yojana. 
Result will be added to graha gati, if nakSatras are 


moving towards east, otherwise substracted. This 
will give sphuta gati of graha from sayana mesa. 


Notes : Motion of nakSatras is the motion 
relative to sayana mesa point due to precession of 


894 Siddhanta Darpana 


equinox. Its motion towards east means that sayana 
mesa has moved west and ayanee is added to 
find sayana position. 

To find sayana gati of graha, we have to find 
its motion in nakSatra kakSa because nakSatra gati 
is 2094 yojana in that orbit. Yojana gati of graha 
in bigger nakéatra kak§a is more in proportion to 
length of nakSatra kakSa. Here ratio of the two 
kakéas is expressed in kalas of graha orbit by 

. graha kakéa in kala 
NakSatra kaka 21,600 kala 

_ _ graha kak&a yojana 

~ Nakéatra kakéa yojana 

Here: ——ounorbit_ 1 _ _ 60 

USES’ Nakéatra orbit 360 21,600 

Thus sun orbit is 60 kala. Other orbits in kala 
can be found directly or in proportion to sighra 
kaksa as explained in note (2) after verse 27. 


Verses 30-31 :. Kaksa and éara gati 

Due to attraction by ucca, a graha goes up 
-and down (or farther and nearer) in its orbit. But 
inspite of change in karna (distance from centre), 
- its-yojana gati in east always remains the same 
(mandasphuta gati only) (30) 

North south motion due to repulsion of pata 
is proportional to their mandakarna. 

Notes : Principle of equal linear speed has 
been assumed for each planet separately i.e. it 
should remain constant in one orbit only. Speeds 
‘of different planets vary as shown in verses 23-27. 


Earth and Sky 995 


However, even this principle is not correct. 
. The linear speed also reduces, when a graha goes 
- farther in the orbit. According to Keplar’s law, the 
. areal speed (i.e. area covered by manda karna in 
“unit time) is constant. It can be understood in 
. another way. When an object is thrown upwards, 
its speed reduces slowly and finally it comes back. 
_Thus the speed reduces with increase in distance 
in a gravitational field.

Here, eastward motion is only in their own 
mean orbit around sun. By adding Sighra gati it 
may change, and even go back wards also. 
‘Verses 32-37 : Explaining with diagrams 
Earlier astronomers have stated that ‘around 
earth, successively larger orbits are of moon, 
mercury, venus, sun, mangala (mars), jupiter and 
saturn, but this is not clearly observed. (32) 
KakSa values in yojana are divided by its kalpa 
bhagana (fractional part). We get the distance 
covered by graha in its orbit in yojanas. (33) 
Orbit of planet is drawn and its centre «is 
marked as ‘bhi’ (earth). Position and east speed 
of each graha is indicated in their orbits. (34) 
' From this positon, graha is shifted forward 
(i.e. east) or backward according to Ssighra phala. 


896 Siddhinta Darpana 


We see the direction of tara graha from earth, 
whether it moves backward (in cakrardha i.e. 180° 
from sighrocca) or not (for other positions). (35) 


Tara grahas with speeds slower than sun (i.e. 
_ mars, jupiter-and. saturn) are bent towards sun- 
planet direction from earth-planet direction i in their 
retrograde motion. (36) 


Angular diameter and §gara of a_ planet 
decreases or increases according as its distance from 
earth (Sighra karna) increases or decreases. This 
demonstration shows that the tara grahas revolve 
round madhyama sun. (37) . 


Notes : Retrograde motion of planets’ has 
already been explained with diagrams in 
spastadhikara, chapter 5. 


1 a - outer planets 1 b - inner planets 


Fig 1 - Planets around mean sun 
= Sun, E = Earth, P = Planet 

Mean sun S moves round the earth and 
around sun the planets move, inner planets in 
smaller orbit and outer planets i in bigger orbit. This 
doesn’t make any difference in calculations as, all 
planet orbits are around sun in both system. Sun 
has apparent motion around earth. 


Earth and Sky 897 


Verses 38-42 : Lower values of Larmbana 

If we assume that orbits of tara grahas are as 
big as stated by sirya siddhanta or Bhaskara II, 
then their horizontal lambana in east or west will 
be 1/15 of their daily motion. (38) 


Thus madhyama lambana (horizontal) of 
mangala 31/26 + 15 = 2 kala approximately. This 
lambana in cakrardha is found by multiplying it 
with trijya and dividing by sighra karna, and comes 
to about 6 kala. (39) 

When mangala is 24 kala vakra from its true 
position, it rises in west and its disc is seen after 
sunset. (40) 


At setting time, mangala will be seen with a 
particular star (indicating its position in ecliptic), 
24 kala west. 

Next day at rising time it should be with same 
star due to lambana. But this does not happen. 
The author has not seen its lambana in nica place 
(180° from sun) even to be 1 kala (against 6 kala 
calculated value). (42) 


Notes : At nica position mafigala is vakri with 
maximum speed (59/8 - 31/26) i.e. (sun - mars 
speed) = 27/42. In half day, mangala will move 
about 14 kala west.. However, lambana at setting 
time makes it 6 kala west. The difference is 6+6 = 
12 kala east, between west horizon and east horizon 
place, which compensates the vakra gati towards 
west. Thus position of mangala should appear same 
at west setting and next rise in east. 


898 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verses 43-46 : Higher sun/moon ratio — 


Due to very small real lambana of mangala. 
I have assumed bigger orbits for these planets 
compared to strya siddhanta. (43) 

Bhujajya of (moon-sun) is multiplied by moon 
distance and divided by sun distance according to 
strya siddhanta or Bhaskara II. (44) 

The result is added or substracted from moon 
in bright or dark half. On Ist quarter of Sukla 8th 
(when moon - sun is 84° to 87°) or last quarter 
of krsna 8th (moon-sun, being 273° to 276°), half 
of moon disc should be bright, but it doesn’t 
happen. (45) -

Fig 2 - Half bright moon 

But at the end of Sukla 8th 2nd quarter (when 
moon-sun=90") or Krsna 8th 2nd quarter (when 
moon-sun = 270°), half of moon disc looks bright. 
Hence I have taken sun.distance more than those 
texts. (46) 
' Notes - Moon is half bright, when, sun and 
earth are at perpendicular distances from moon i.e. 
ZEMS .= 90°. But viewed from earth E, the angle 
between sun S and moon M is ZMES which is 
less than 90° for Sukla pakSa and outer angle (reflex

Hence the half bright position should be 4°17’ 
away from the position of 90° or 270° difference 
as seen from earth. But this appears negligible, 
‘hence sun distance should be much larger. 


Verses 47-52 : Finding true distance of sun 

The much larger value of distances and orbits 
of planets as ratio of moon in comparison to strya 
siddhanta, should be derived logically. Hence, I 
am stating the method, how these values have — 
been found. (47) 


Without authority of Vedas, only guess work 
is not appreciated. Hence, I have accepted the 
diameter of sun as stated in vedas.. (48). 

In Brahmavidya upanisad, while explaining 
the importance of Pranava (%), diameter of sun 
has been stated to be 72,000 yojanas. (49) 


900 Siddhanta Darpana 


In- Atharva veda also, same diameter of 
Mahapurusa (Sun) has been stated. In sirya 
siddhanta,. the diameter of earth and angular 
diameter of earth are stated, which are verified by 
observation. (50) 


By observing through instruments also, mean 
bimba (angular diameter) is 32/32 kala as stated by 
Bhaskara II. (51) 


I have stated distance of sun from ratio of 
yojana diameter and angular diameter. Accordingly 
orbit extent has been stated. 


Notes : This has been explained in chapter 8 
of lunar eclipse. Extent of solar mandala means its 
circumference as Kak&a length means the same. 
The akaSa yojana = 5 earth yojanas. Hence true 


diameter according to vedas should be 


72,000.x 5. 72,000 x 5 x 8... 
——<7 yojana = = — Se = — = kilo meters 


= 9,16,732 kms. which is the correct modern 
value. By assuming it to be diameter in earth 
yojanas it is only 63% of correct value. This 
interpratation of 4kaSa yojana is based on distance 
of usa (dawn) from sunrise as 30 yojanas mentioned 
at several places in vedas.

Notes : This has been explained in verses

Verses. 55 - Moon orbit 


Distance of moon has been decreased due to 
slight increase in moon’s larhbana. Thus its bithba 
.and. diameter of earth’s shadow have been 
decreased. 


Notes : Larhbana has been observed to be 
(moon speed / 14) instead of (moon speed / 15). 
Due to. its higher value, it should have smaller 
-orbit as lambana decreases with increase in dis- 
tance. . 

Since angular diameter of moon is same as 
mentioned in surya siddhanta, linear diameter 
should be decreased slightly in same ratio,. as

Maximum éighra phala of grahas from sun (to

for budha and éukra (56) and less for mangala, 
guru, sani. Then the difference between 
bhujaphalas (57) is seen 1/360 of the manda orbit. 
Hence the orbit of nakSatras have been assumed 
' 360 times the sun. 


902 Siddhanta. Darpana 


Notes : Variation in Sighra paridhi is due. to 
same season as variation in manda paridhi i.e. 
because the real orbits are elliptical. However, here 
it has been assumed that the distance of nakSatras 
in 360 times distance of sun (compared to 60 times 
of sun). Actually it is 4 lakh times for nearest star. 
Due to finite distance (360 times sun distance) the 
distance of sighra paridhis are different from sun 
and from earth. Hence there is difference is of 1° 
i.e. 1/360 of suns orbit. This is explained by 
diagrams below -— .

substend different angles at NakSatra circle at N. 


Verses 59-64 : Distance and diameter 
For sun and moon, from angular diameter, 
we know their distance (karna). For stars and: other 


planets, angular diameter (birnba) is known from 
their distance. (59) , 


Earth and Sky 903 


We make a circular disc and find the distance 
of the disc from eyes at which it completely covers 
the disc of star, ie. their angular diameters are 
same. (60) 

Distance is found by multiplying distance 
between eye and disc by angular diameter and 
divided by disc diameter. (For sun and moon). By 
reverse process, we can ed pumps from distance.

Since angular diameter of hole and star are

Verses 70-75 : Height and distance. 

From shadow of a ganku, height of lamp or 
a mountain can be found. This interesting method 
is being described. (70) 

From lamp kept at a height we keep a ganku 


at a distance on level ground and measure its 
shadow. (71) 


Earth and Sky 907 


In same direciton, another Sganku of same 
height is kept and its shadow also is measured. 
Distance between two Sganku is measured. To this, 
we add the second ganku shadow and substract 
shadow of first Sanku. °72) 

_ Result is multiplied. by first shadow and from 
quotient, shadow of first Sanku is substracted. 
Remainder will be the distance of first Sanku from 
base of lamp. (73) 


The earlier quotient multiplied by height of 
Sanku and divided by shadow of first Sanku gives 
height of lamp. (74) 


Or, distance between sanku and lamp is 
multiplied by ganku and divided by shadow. Result 
is added to height of Sanku to give height of lamp. 
(75) . 

Notes : This is one of the problems of high 
school trigonometry, called heights and distances. 
Since much more complicated problem of spherical 
trigonometry were known to all astronomers, this 
simple example is intended only to popularise the 
astronomy to layman. Such simple’ and practical 
methods can be understood and verified by any 
body. This method is described in detail in Lilavati 
of Baskara [,-: which has been described as 
necessary base alongwith his bija ganita to under- 
stand astronomy. Patiganita of Sridhara also 
describes it in chapter on Chaya vyavahara (shadow 
methods). Interestingly all the methods of 
astronomy are described in Narada purana parva 
bhaga, 2nd quarter, chapter 54. The method of 


908 Siddhanta Darpana 


shadows -has been called ‘parikarma’. In these 
places methods for single Sanku shadow has been 
described and the method of two Sankus has been 
posed as a problem (solved in Lilavati). Solution 
is given in a single verse in Lilavati -

Verses 76 - 79 : Height of a hill 

On a plane land where top of a hill is seen 
for a distance of 1 kosa, we place two sanku in a 
line from hill top at 100 yards distance minimum. 
(76) 

'Each sanku will be 5 hands high and stout. 
Then on earth’s surface, we keep a mirror in line 
of hill top and sanku so that, tops of mountain 
and sanku are seen in one line. (77) 


. From location of mirror, we fix the positon 
of shadow ends and, as in previous method for 
height of lamp through two Sankus, we find height 
of hill and its distance. When hill is very far, its 
height is found by a single Sanku. (78) |

A hill of height AB = h and a Sanku of A’B’

This will give height of hill if distance D of 
hill is known. In practice, D cannot be measured 
as, base of mountain is away from B due to its 
. Slope. Hence two Sanku have to be used. 


Since AB and A’B are parallel, A’B’ will be 
bent. from vertical at B’, if we consider curvature 
of earth. This will be equal to angular distance of 
that place given by D x 360° / 5026 as 5026 yojana 
is circumference of earth equal to 360° arc. 

First we have to approximate the distance D 
from straight Sanku, then find the angular distance. 
A‘B’ is bent towards hill by that angle. This will

cloud similarly by trairasika (Rule of 3). (85) 


Notes : These calculations are based on equal 
proporiton of two sides of one triangle to the two 
sides of a similar triangle. Out of these four 
quantities, if 3 are known, fourth can be calculated. 
This is expressed by Bhaskara II in Lilavati / Chaya

vision had been described. Now further information 
is given which will make the spherical shape of 
earth more clear. (86) 


ie. chaya karna of cloud = 


The circle around a Sanku with radius equal 
to the limiting distance of vision, is called the 
visible horizon of Sanku. (87) 


914 Siddhanta Darpana 


The hill which is not visible due to great 
distance, becomes visible when we climb on a high 
place. (88) 

From two hills at a distance, two circles of 
visible horizon are formed. In the common area of 
two circles, both the hill tops will be visible. (89) 

On the boundary of horizon of one hill, the 
other hill will be seen upto some portion below 
the top. (90) 

From horizon point of one hill, the angle of 
visible part of second hill is multiplied by difference 
of height of both hills and divided by distance 
between the two Sankus. This will be sphuta value 
of visible angle in miniutes (lipta or kala). (91) 

If the horizon circles of two hills do not meet, 
then from horizon of one hill, the other will not 
be visible. (92) 

If the horizon circle of a small hill is 
completely within horizon circle of a big hill, then 
from horizon of big hill only big hill will be seen, 
smaller hill will be below the horizon. (93) 

if the horizon circles of both hills touch each 
other, then from the contact point, bigger hill will 
be seen just above the small hill. (94) 

If surface of earth had been plane like a 
mirror, then from small height also, small hills at 
distance would have been seen close to earth’s 
surface. (95) 


From the hill top, round shape of earth is 
seen within the horizon circle. The round shape 
of ecliptic also is clearly visible from hill top. (96) 

A person at hill top sees the sunrise earlier 
by asus equal to deSantara lipta of visibility limit 


Earth and Sky 915 


compared to person at the base. He sees the sunset, 
same time later. (97) 


A person of 3-1/2 hands height sees the 
horizon on a plane surface upto 9000 hands. (98) 


If the difference of time at hill top and base 
is less than 1 pala, it is neglected in calculation. 
Even though it is observable, it has no use in 
eclipse. (99) 

Circumfernce of earth is (8,04,24,960) hands. 
On this the visible distance limit is being stated in 
units of 1/4 kosa. First Sanku is 4096 hands height. 
Next second to 11th Sankus are each half of the 
former sanku (100); 


To find the visible distance, height of Sanku 
is divided by (4096) hands and multiplied by square 
of its visible distance (162? = 26,244). Square root 
of the result is the distance. (101)

Radius of earth is (1,28,00,000) hands. We 
find its square and square of radius added with 1 
hand. Of the difference square root is taken. This 
will be limit of visible distance for Sanku of 1 hand. 


916 Siddhanta Darpana 


To find visible distance, the distance for Sanku 
of 1 hand is squared and multiplied with height 
of given Sanku. The square root of the product 
will give visible distance upto 8 lakh hands. aa 


Notes : (1) Visible horizon 


Fig 1a Fig 1b 


Fig 9 - Visibility circles 

Figure 9(a) shows visibility circles of hills at 
A and B having common area CD. Since this area 
CD lies in both circles, both the hills will be visible 
from any point in it. From point C, B will be just 
visible, but a grater portion of A will be visible. 
Its sphuta angle is defined as 
hi — hy

In figure 9(b), visibility circle of Bi is com- 
pletely within circle of A. From point D, A will 
be visible, but B, is beyond limit of visibility, hence 
will be below horizon. Visibility circle of Bz touches 
it at C. Hence from C both hills will be just visible. 


Earth and Sky 


(2) Visible distance 
of desired sanku-Sanku 
of height h is placed at 
A. Its visible distance is 
at point B. BC is tangent 
and perpendicular to 
radius OB. Hence 

OC? = OB* + BC? 

or (rth)* = r* + d? 

where r is radius of 
earth and d is distance BC from sanku top 

or r* + 2rh + h? = r* + d? 

or d* = 2rh + h? = (rth? +r? - - - (1) 

or 2rh approx. - - - (1a) 

Thus from (1), we add the sanku height to 
radius and from its sqaure, we substract the square 
of radius. That is d“ whose square root is the 
distance d. ; 

From (la), d? = 2rh 

If n is distance for 1 hand Sanku, then 

nr’ = 2r 

or d*= n*h ord = vazh 


Hence square of visible distance of 1 hand 
Sanku is multiplied by height of Sanku and its 
Square root is taken. In this formula, we neglect 
the height square as very small. Hence this will 
work only for d upto r/16 = 8 lakh hands. For 
greater accuracy, we find the distance in com- 
parison to Sanku of 4096 hand height from (1a).

Verses 103-108 : Lords of days etc. 

To know the lords of days, years, hora and 
month, the traditional position of planets will be 
assumed. Slowest planet will be kept at top. (103) 


It will be followed by next faster planets in 
order. According to Surya siddhanta their order is 
Sani, guru, mangala, strya, Sukra, budha and 
candra. (104) 

In this sequence, fourth planet from Sani will 
be owner of day and 3rd from guru will be lord 
of civil year. (105) 

In 60 dandas, there are 24 kala horas. They 
start with mid night at Lanka. (106) 


Beginning with Sukra, 2nd and 3rd etc. 
planets upwards will be lords of.civil months. At 
the beginning of creation, sun was lord of all - 
day, month, year and hora. (107) 


Lords of year (solar and other), months (solar) 
‘and days etc are counted from beginning itself. 
(108) 

Notes : This system of ownership was fixed 
by Varahamhira in his Brhatsarnhita at the begin- 
ning of Vikrama era. He has stated his time as 500 
Saka, which is actually Sudraka Saka in 500 years 
before Vikram era i.e. 557 BC. By misquoting as 
Salivahana gaka which started 135 years after his 
time, his time is taken as 578 AD. The same system 
was followed in Chaldea in around 300 BC. 


The order of ownership is based on following 
scale of civil time - 


24 hora - 1 day (origin of hours) 
30 days = 2 month 


Earth and Sky 919 


12 months = 1 year 

Order of planets with increasing speed is 

(1) Saturn, (2) Jupiter (3) Mars (4) Sun (5) 
Venus (6) Mercury (7) Moon 


Starting with hora lord with saturday, next 
day hora lord will be 25th i.e. (7X3) + 4th lord. 


Similarly after 30 days we cross 3 lords each 
day i.e. 90 lords in 1 month = 12 X 7 + 6 i.e. 7th 
planet will be lord of next month. Thus the 
previous planet or moving upwards in the list we 
get the month lords. 


After 12 months we cross 12 X 6 = 72 lords 
or 10 X 7 + 2 = 2 lords. Thus 3rd lord will be 
owner of successive year. 


Thus Ist hora lord on saturday is saturn, but 
on next day Ist hora lord is sun, hence it is called 
sunday. Thus the weak day lords are found by 
counting 4th planet in this series each time - 
Sunday, Monday etc. 


Verses 109-119 : Extent of spread of light 


Scriptures have said that brightness of sun is 
hundred times the combined light of moon and 
stars. When diameter is 10 times, area of circle is 
100 times. (109) 


Spread of brightness is according to area. 
Hence the light from 1/10th of diameter will reach 
1/10th of distance reached by light from full 
diameter. (110) 


At 10 times distance, krightness becomes 
1/100. Hence, at distance of 2000 times the sun’s 
diameter, heat of sun light vanishes. Hence the 
heat of other planets and stars also vanishes at 


920 Siddhanta Darpana 


distance of 200 times their diameter because their 
brightness is 1/100 of sun. (111-112) 


Similarly, heat of earth’s energy also vanishes 
at distance equal to 200 times its diameter. 
Brightness of ray however is upto 50 times, this 
distance. (113) 


Visibility of ray is further 25 times the 
distance. This limit has been estimated by me from 
light of lamp, moon and sun. (114) 


Diameter of sun is (72,000) yojanas. Hence 
limit of its heat is upto (14,40,00,000) yojanas. (115) 

Brightness of its rays is upto (7,20,00,00,000) 
and its visibility limit is (1,80,00,00,00,000) yojanas. 
(116) 

Human distance and time units multiplied by 
360° give divine units. According to divine units 
100 crore yojanas is the diameter of universe 
(Brahmanda). Hence, in human yojanas it is 
(3,60,00,00,00,000) yojanas (117-118). 

The limit of visibility of sun (and stars) is the 
visibility orbit of sun. Orbit of that universe 
(circumference) is (11,30,97,60,00,000) yojanas. At 
this distance angular diameter is 1/12 vikala. Other 
planets are 1/72 of this value. (119) 


Notes : Light comes out of a sphere of radius 
r from its surface area 4 zr?, hence its total out 
put is proportional to r?. After unit time, it spreads 
to equal distance in all direction. At distance R, it 
is spread over surface of sphere 4 zR?. So intensity 
of same’ amount of light is propotional to 1/R’, 
which is light per unit area. Thus if r is increased 
by K times, total light will increase K? times, and 
its 1/R’ intensity will be at KR distance. 


Earth and Sky 921 


Here, propogation of heat, brightness and 
visibility all are subjective words without any 
quantitative definition. Earth is at distance of 109 
X diameter of sun. Heat limit has been assumed 
to be about 20 times this distance. According to 
this we should feel the heat of mars and venus at 
their farthest distance. We definitely receive some 
energy, but physically we cannot feel the heat. 
Similarly, brightness means very bright and 
visibility means just visible to human eye. This 
depends on eye sight. With telescope, visibility is 
more and light rays go almost to infinite distance. 
Telescopes can see objects upto 10 billion light 
years away. 


Verses 120-122 : Criticism of Bhaskara II 


Sri Bhaskaracarya ! You have said that akasa 
Kaksa lies at the place where light of sun vanishes 
and blackness starts. According to you, the planets 
move exactly this distance during a day of Brahma 
- (1 kalpa). If a learned man like you tells like this, 
we can only feel hurt. (120) 


If a planets moving in any orbit moves equal 
to length of akaSa kakSa, then a man will move a 
distance equal to earth’s circumference within his 
own house, why this doesn’t happen ? (121) 


You have stated the circumference of sky as. 
(18,71,20,49,20,00,00,000) yojanas. Diameter of sun 
(6522 yojanas according to Bhaskara) is not even 
1 part in 1 lakh parts. Then how the darkness 
upto sky sphere is removed by sun ? 

Notes : These discussions are based on two 
cosmological assumptions 


922 Siddhanta Darpana 


(i) Limit of sky is the distance till which sun 
rays reach i.e. sun is visible. 


(ii) All planets move with same linear speed 
and move the distance of sky orbit in one kalpa. 
In a way this is the basis of calculation of kalpa 
and yuga, when all planets complete one revolu- 
tion. Then from actual linear speed of moon, we 
can calculate length of sky orbit. 


Verses 123-125 : Prayer and end 


God is ocean of surprises. There are infinite 
- worlds within his great body. Their number is not 
known to Brahma also. hence the measurements 
of world in vedas and puranas cannot be false 
(must be true for some world). But I will discuss 
only the planets visible near earth. (123) 


May lord Jagannatha, do good to the beings 
with bodies of 5 elements like sky, by whom 
Sankhasura had been killed giving pleasure to 
gods, whose lotus hand looks more beautiful with 
sign of conch (Sankha), and who is lord of Sankha 
kSetra. (124) 

Thus ends the 19th chapter describing stars 
and sky in siddhanta darpana written as text book 
for correct calculation by Sri Candragekhara born 
in famous royal family of Orissa. (125) 


Chapter - 20 
INSTRUMENTS 


Goladi Yantra Varnana 


. Verses 1-5 : Scope and introduction 


Without instruments, motion of planets and 
eclipse etc. cannot be known easily. Motion of time 
also cannot be known without instruments. Hence 
Sri Candragekhara describes the process of constrc- 
tion of instruments according to his intellect. (1) 


Types of instruments are classified on. basis 
of sphere or time. Within those also, many sub 
types exist. Out of them some instruments can be 
constructed easily. Some are described for infor- 
mation of laymen. (2) 


Here two types of gola yantras will be 
described. One is of one KakSa (axis) and other is 
bahu KakSa (multiple axes). One axis yantra has 
been described by earlier acaryas. Bahu kakSa is 
being described according to my own research. (3) 


After. bath and well dressed, astronomer 
should go to a secret (or reserved) and clean place 
and he should worship various gods - Sun and 
other planets, nakSatras all around. (4) 

Lokapalas such as Indra, guhyaka and guru 
(teacher) also are worshipped to remove obstruc- 
tions. After that, construction of golayantra should 


924 Siddhanta Darpana 


be started for instrument knowledge of students. 
(5) 

Notes : (1) Instruments are necessary to 
explain the model of universe, to make measure- 
ments of planetary positions, and to know the 
times from planetary motions or from automatic 
watches. 


Models are necessary because, three. dimen- 
sional spherical locations cannot be drawn on a 
paper and it is difficult to comprehend their true 
motion without models. The gola yantras described 
here are basically models to explain planetary orbits 
and the sphere of earth. They can also be used to 
make measurements, but the method thereof has 
not been described. 


Construction or name of other handy instru- 
ments has been mentioned only without their 
methods of use. They can be used for rough 
measurements. 


The really accurate instruments can be con- 
structed only at a great cost with govenment 
assistance. During thousand years of muslim and 
foreign rule this was not provided, rather sup- 
pressed. We neither know their theory nor have 
samples to see, so that they could be described by 
the author. 


(2) Since last one thousand years, only 
obstruction has been feared in construction of 
astronomical instruments due to foreign rule. 
Hence it has been prescribed that the work should 
be done secretly. Various pujas are for praying 
divine help, as well as to make it look like other 
elaborate pujas. 


Instruments 925 


Only when Mughal empire declined after 
Aurangajeb, Sawai Jaisingh, could control a sizeable 
area in Rajsthan and Gujarat and after a lot of 
requests to Muhammad Shah he could reconstruct 
some of the instruments described in earlier texts. 
He collected informations about all practical con- 
strunctions in independant Islamic countries 
motably observatories of Maragha, south from 
Tabriz in Iran founded by Halagi Khan and 
Samarkanda, founded by Ulug beg. He also 
collected many books from Europe to know about 
their current state of development. He procured a 
telescope from European travellers and tried to 
learn the practical methods. Through Jesuit 
travellers to China he procured Chinese lists also. 
However, the attempts of revival lasted only for 
about 20 years from 1720 to 1743 till the time of 
his death. He named his observation tables 
Ziz-i-Muhammad Shahi, so that his work would 
be allowed to continue. Yantra raja-racana and 
surya siddhanta vyakhya are directly attributed to 
him. In addition, his astromomers like Jagannatha 
Samrata wrote many books. Jagannatha directed 
the observations, wrote books based on Ptolemy 
and Euclid and independant works also like yantra 
prakara. Kevalarama wrote many saranis (charts) 
for calculating and pancangs. Nayanasukha 
Upadhyaya translated many books and wrote 
yantraraja.

(4) Most of the texts including the present 
book do not explain how the instruments are used 
for measurement. Their use as model is very clear. 
But they have not been in use for about 1000 years. 
Hence their principle of working is derived from 
their descriptions mainly during Jaisingh period.

Verses 6 - 44 - Golayantra of 2 or 1 axis - 


Construct a wooden sphere (globe) of circum- 
ference 6 angulas. Position of continents, oceans 
and mountains are marked in it (6). 


Holes are made at pole points and a 
dhruvayasti (polar stick) called meru-danda (meru 
stick or back bone) also is inserted. This rod is 
round (cylindrical) 6 hands long, made of strong 
wood. (7) 


To hold this merudanda, we fix two pillars 
of 5 hands length each firmly at north and south 
ends at a distance of 5-1/4 hands. (8) 


These pillars are fixed in earth or in a heavy 
wooden frame. Height of pillars from wooden or 
earth base will be 5 hands each. At the height of 
3 hands, we make holes in both pillars in which 
dhruva yasti can be inserted. (9) 

Two holes in inclined direction are made at 
an angle with horizontal equal to latitude of the 
place. It is above the 3 hand height point in 


930 Siddhanta Darpana 


northern pillar and below the 3 hand height in 
south pillar. (10) 


Two circular strips of 360 angula circumference 
each are constructed. One of them is called kSitija 
vrtta (horizon circle). (11) 

The other circle is called ardhvadhara vrtta 
(meridian circle). This is joined to horizon circle at 
north and south points and two holes are made 
at joints. (12) 

Dhruva yasti is inserted in the circles keeping 
globe in middle. Both circles will be loosely fitted 
and greased so that they are rotated easily. The 
dhruva yasti will be inserted in holes of the pillar 
(not specified whether horizontal or inclined holes). 
(13) 

Another bamboo strip 360 angula long will be 
folded into a circle and be kept in plane of equator 
of earth i.e. between horizontal and vertical circles. 
This is called nadi mandala. Angles will marked 
(in time units) on this. (14) 

_On both sides of equator circle, we put 3 
circles on each side at a distance of krantis of 1, 
2, 3 raSis - i.e. total 6 diurnal circles of decreasing 
sizes. (15) 

On both sides of dhruva yasti, one circular 
plate each will be fixed with yasti through its 
centre. Along the circumference 360° degree 
divisions are marked with one thin pointer at each 
division. (16) 

The pointers will be fixed with ‘vajralepa’ 
(strong paste or welding) so that they do not fall. 
On this plate we give mark of north pole at 0° 
and south pole at 180°. (17) 


Instruments 931 


On the rings of bamboo which start after 
dhruva signs at end of plate, lines are marked at 
the end of 1 angula each, corresponding to 1° 
difference. These signs will be in different planes 
of the rings. (18) 

On wooden globe of earth, we fix thin bamboo 
circles parallel to equator. These will be biggest at 
equator and become smaller as we proceed towards 
poles. (19) 

In the bamboo circle, boundaries of raSis are 
marked prominently. Then ayana corrected mesa 
0° is put in contact with equator circle. (20) 

Maximum difference between this kranti vrtta 
and equator circle will be at sdyana karka and 
makara beginning equal to 23°30’. (21) 

On these circles 6 points are given - east, 
‘west, north south points of horizon circle and 
upper and lower points on vertical (meridian) circle. 
These two points (upper and lower) are called 
svastika. Upper point is called zenith (kha-svastika). 
(22) 

Patas of planets like moon is marked on 
ecliptic (kranti vrtta). Moon vimandala (orbit) is 
fixed at that place on kranti vrtta and again at 6 
rasi difference. (23) 


At 3 raéi difference from these sampata points 
(of vimandala and kranti vrtta), the distance 
between the circles will be equal to maximum Sara 
of moon in north and south directions. (24) 

Similarly vimandala (orbits) of other planets 
like mars also will be fixed to the kranti vrtta. But 


932 Siddhanta Darpana 


their pata are corrected with sighra phala. Their 
maximum Sara (distance from ecliptic) is found in 
proportion to their distance (from earth). That will 
be maximum distance of vimandala in north and 
south, (25) 


Horizontal circle at equator is called 
unmandala at other places. This circle measures 
the cara (difference in half day length). Intersection 
with diurnal circle and meridian circle is called 
kharddha. Perpendicular from kharddha on udaya- 
asta line on horizon plane is called ‘hrti’. In great 
circle (equator) hrti is called ‘antyajya. (26) 

Both base circles (kSitija and turdhvadhara), 
equator, ecliptic, have equal diameter. Still kSitija 
vrtta is kept slightly bigger. Otherwise, the circles 
cannot be rotated. (27) 


Dhruva yasti will be firmly fixed with earth. 
Bhagola (the four circles on its surface) is such that 
it can be rotated freely. That can be done by oiling 
the joints. (28) 

_ This way bhagola is contructed and planets 
and stars are shown. Kranti of planets, and Sara 
of planets other than sun is found and their sphuta 
position is calculated. (29) 

These planets are placed in their orbits at 
their rasis. By moving the gola we imagine the 
‘pravaha’ rotation. (30) 

This bhagola construction. is according to 
Lanka position. Now it is explained as to how 
khagola will be fixed to it. In both pillars at the 
height of poles, holes are drilled by iron nail. (31) 

Then khagola will be formed outside bhagola. 
6 circles are tied firmly to it - kSitija vrtta, p&rvapara 


Instruments 933 


vrtta (east west), meridian, two angle circles and 
dik mandala. These 6 circles of khagola being fixed, 
bhagola will move within it. (32-33). 

To see the shadow and rising and setting of 
planets in own place, we keep the dhruva yasti in 
the inclined holes of pillar at angle of local aksamSa. 
(34) 

In khagola and bhagola both - east west circle 
and horizon circle of the local place are tied. (35) 


On khagola, we put nails on the points of 
intersection of yamyottara and samamandala circles 
(upper and lower kha-svastikas are these points). 
On these nails, drgmandala is fixed so that it can 
move freely. (36) 


Drg mandala is kept outside bhagola like east 
west circle so that it can be moved around dhruva 
yasti as desired. (37) 

Drgmandala will be kept on position of a 
planet. When it is kept on vitribha, it becomes 
drkkSepa circle. (38) 

It is impossible for a man to enter within 
these spheres. Hence, we see the planet from 
outside towards earth’s surface. This line will be 
same as line of sight of planet from earth’s surface, 
but in opposite direction. (39) 


In eight directions (4 cardinal and 4 angle 
directions) of horizon circle 8 small nails are given 
and the hemisphere below it is covered with cloth. 
Above horizon, a wooden horizon disc is kept, so 
that upper hemisphere is seen. (40) 


Alternatively, sphere will be kept inside a 
trench so that lower half remains underground and 


934 Siddhanta Darpana 


upper half remains visible outside. Then bhagola 
can be rotated and the visible hemisphere of local 
horizon can be seen according to position of earth 
etc. (41) 

(Siddhanta Siromani) Bhagola is tied with 
dhruva yasti. Yasti is inserted inside khagola tube 
and bhagola is rotated. At end of yasti, two tubes 
or nails are used to keep khagola and drg gola 
fixed. (42) 

One axis gola : This two axis gola made of 
bhigola (earth), bhagola (nakSatras), drggola 
(visible circle) and aka$a gola (sky) can be made 
one axis gola also. (43) 

Bhagala (nakSatras) is seen in orbit of moon 
only, hence it can be attached to that only. 
Intelligent persons can change the sizes of these 
golas according to their convenience. (44)

Ecliptic, equator and diurnal circles are on

(not stated in text) and is fixed to polar axis 


(yasti). 

Khagola is outer sphere made of kona circles, 
east west and meridian circles, horizon and 
unmandala - six circles. It is attached to two hollow 
cylinders in which yasti in inserted. 

Outer most sphere is drggola in which circles 
forming both inner spheres are mixed together. 
Hence it is called double sphere (drg = eyes = 
number two). 


(2) This is called armillary sphere in western 


: astronomy and Dhat-al-Halaq in Arabic. A rough

Figure 2 - Armillary sphere 


diagram of armillary sphere is shown in figure 2. 
It is fixed on a stand like a globe. All circles are 
not shown. One metal sphere of 53 cms diameter 
of Jaisingh period is in Jaipur museum. 

(3) Use of the instrument - (i) To find the 
time since sunrise and the lagna at that time, the 
sphere is set so that east point is exactly towards 
east and horizon is level as water. The position of 
sun on ecliptic is now obtained by calculation and 
the bhagola is rotated to bring this point of ecliptic 
on the eastern horizon and a pin is fixed here to 
mark the position of sun. A pin is also fixed to 
mark the point of equinoctical in the bhagola 
intersected by the eastern horizon i.e. east point. 
The bhagola is now rotated west ward till the sun 
throws its shadow on the centre of the earth. The 
distance between mark made on the equinoctical 
and new eastern point of the horizon will represent 
the time from sun rise. The point of the ecliptic, 
now cut by the horizon will be lagna (Siddhanta 
Siromani). 


937 


(ii) Sun and moon positions - When both sun 

’ and moon are visible, ecliptic ring is rotated so 

- that shadow falls on itself. Then outer latitude ring 

is rotated so that its shadow falls on itself. The 

point of intersection of two rings (ecliptic and 
latitude) is spasta surya. 

Next, at the same time, rotate the inner 
latitude (for sighting, two vanes are kept on a 
diameter) ring, so that moon is seen through the 
two sighting apertures on the vanes. The point of 
intersection of inner latitude ring and ecliptic facing 
moon indicates true moon. From the ecliptic, upto - 
the place of sight, above or below ecliptic, the 
angular distance indicates the north or south 
latitude of moon (yantra prakara). 


(iii) Planets and stars in night - Calculate the 
sign and the angular distance of a star from 0° of 
ecliptic and it is marked on ecliptic ring. The outer 
latitude circle is aligned with that point and is 
clamped there. Then the planet or star is sighted 
with the latitude circle. Another person should 
observe the star with sights of inner circle. When 
this is done, the sign or latitude of the object is 
given by the intersection of latitude circle and 
ecliptic ring. 

Celestial latitude is the angular distance of the 
point of intersection of latitude circle and ecliptic 
to the sighting aperture. 


Yantra prakaéra recommends two latitude 
circles (orbits) for any planet, one above and one 
within the ecliptic. At inner circle a sighting vane 
' (holes in a diameter direction) is made. Outer circles 

are in drggola. 


938 Siddhanta Darpana 


Verses 45-75 : Bahukaksa yantra (multiple axes). 


Now I describe bahukakSa yantra (multi axis 
or chamber) by whose mere seeing; movement of 
planets, their disc, latitude, direct and retrograde 
motions can be directly observed from earth itself. 
(45) 

Two solid wooden wheels of 1 hand diameter 
each are made. Two pillars are fixed in north south 
direction on an axle kept on two pillars, two wheels 
are kept within the pillars. (46) 


In both wooden wheels, Sara (wooden stick) 
is inserted through a hole and at the end of this 
Sara, a ‘nemi’ (wooden, circuilar strip with divisions 
of 360° marked) is attached. Distance between nemi 
and axle will be 90 angula. Wooden wheels are 3 
hands from each other. (47) 


To move the two wheels with nemi, one 
wooden stick 3 hands long will be inserted ‘in these 
wheels. In the 3 hand distance between wheels, 
orbits of planets and earth will be placed. (48) 


36 angulas from south wheel towards north, 
one rod will be inserted. At the end of that, a 
small size earth will be fixed. Around earth will 
be moon’s orbit. (49) 


Moon’s orbit will be movable round earth and 
will be 6 angula length. At half angula distance 
on circumference 1 rasi will be marked. In moon’s 
orbit, kranti, mandocca, pata and candra position 
are shown. It will be fixed to south wheel through 
four rods or pins. (50) 


12 raéi will be marked in south wheel. In that 
scale only mandocca and pata of moon will be 
shown. In north wheel, orbit of other planets will 
be shown. (51) 


Instruments 939 


Then a graha cakra yasti (rod containing 
orbits) will be made. This rod will be thin and at 
the end will lie sun. This will be wider at base 
where other planets can be fixed. This rod will be 
for fixing in the north wheel. (52) 


At the end of planet rod (graha yasti), madhya 
sun will be on a thin pin. At 1/4 angula from that 
sphuta sun will be placed in the direction of 
mandocca. This (sphuta sun) will be bigger than 
earth, smooth and perfectly round. (53) 


At 1/4 hands (30 angula) north of graha yasti, 
12 spokes will be fitted with a central wheel. Each 
spoke (ara) will be 3 hands long: (54) 


Madhyama sun will be at end of.southern 
rod at centre of base wheel and around it will be 
orbit of other planets. (55) 


In all these orbits, we show the ucca, kranti 
and pata etc. It will be marked with rasi and 
degrees. On its:inner surface, the five star planets, 
starting with mangala will be located. Planets can 
be placed at their places in orbits made of wooden 
strips, which can be rotated. (56) 

First orbit around madhyama sun will be of 
mercury with circumference 18 angula. Next 2nd 
and 3rd orbits will be of Sukra (36 angulas) and 
mangala of 72 angulas. (57) 

Guru orbit will be of 246 angula and Sani of 
441 angula. These orbits called vimandala will be 
joined with unequal nails. (58) 


On these south facing nails, vimandala is 
fixed. The nails will be equal in gola sandhi 


940 Siddhanta Darpana 


(equinox position) where the orbit will be in 
east-west plane through medium sun. (59). 


In south ayana end (max. south kranti), nails 
will be longer and at north ayana end they will 
be shorter. Their difference will be proportional to 
kranti difference in north and south ayanas. (60) 


To rotate sun orbit, a hole in north wheel is 
made at 7/38 angula distance from centre of wheel. 
This hole is bigger in uttarayana (north kranti) and 
smaller in south ayana. Graha cakra rod will be 
inserted into it. (61-62) 

From outside of the north wheel, graha yasti 
is rotated in east direction. Planets will be fixed in 
their proper positions of rasi etc, through pins. 
(63) 

We set it so that sun at end of yasti is in 
east west circle and in gola sandhi from earth (mesa 
0° sayana). At beginning of sayana karka, sun will 
go (3/2/30) angula north and in sayana makara 
beginning same distance south. (64) 

The circular hole (in north wheel) also will 
be similarly at more or less distance. Graha cakra 
yasti can also be rotated from south side by putting 
hands within its spokes. (65) 

We find the manda sphuta graha (as seen 
from centre of sun) for the desired time. Sun will 
be rotated to its position as seen from earth. (66) 

As seen from earth, graha will be seen at its 
sphuta rasi etc. Then we come out of instrument 
and again rotate it westwards. (67) 

Alternatively, an intelligent person can make 
an ecliptic with 27 nakSatras marked. It is fixed in 


Instruments 941 


bhagola at proper place (inclined at 23°30’ to 
equator). In this nakSatra circle, we see the direct 
and retrograde motions of the planets easily. (68) 

Or, we fix two pillars east and west from sun 
at distance of 344 angulas distance. In that, circle 
of kranti will be fixed showing 1°=6 angulas. (69) 

Mean sun is put west from earth and mangala 
is kept at 6 rasi difference from that in its orbit. 
(70) 

The line from earth to mafgala is extended 
upto sign in the east direction. In this direction, 
sun will be located in orbit of 48 angula. (71) 


Mean sun will move 1 angula (7-1/2°) in half 
a fortnight (1/48 of year). mars will move 1 angula 
in same period (equal to 5° in 72 angula orbit) 
from sun. From the sun-mars line, the earth mars 
line will be upwards in the east pillar. (72) 


As seen from earth, motion of mars will look 
retrograde. Similarly, the forward and retrograde 
motion of other planets also can be seen. Motion 
of moon and its eclipse should be seen from 
equator plane. (73) 


Moon orbit is kept between Sukra and 
mangala orbits, so that they don’t collide. To move 
the planetary orbits to east or west, care has to 
be taken, so that they do not bend or break. (74) 

This is description of my bahu kakéga (multi 
axis) yantra. In this, motion of planets can be seen 
as in sky. This can be seen separately for each 
planet with help of thread (to know the direction).

Notes - O; is centre of north wheel W, with

nemi N; around it. At P when OP = 7/38 angula, 
yasti PS is inserted. In middle there are 12 spokes 
fixed around a wooden base. On nails from spokes, 
orbit of planet R is inserted. Earth is inserted 
through a rod fixed at centre O2 of wheel W2. W2 
also has Nz of 90 angula radius. Around earth E 
orbit of moon M is fixed through rods connected 
to wheel W32. 


Thus earth and moon are fixed in middle 
through south wheel. At same position, orbits of 
mean sun, and planet orbits around it, are fixed 
through north wheel, as shown in diagram. 


Through the angles graduated on nemi of 90 
angula radius on each wheel, we can see the 
plafietary position. To see them more clearly and 
to measure through thread, an ecliptic circle in 
middle is placed through pillars in east west 
direction. |

Verses ‘76-77 - Kala yantra 

Gola yantras of 1 and many axis have been 
described. From movement of shadow of any object 
or of own body, or from rotation of an instrument, 
time can be known. Still for the knowledge of 
laymen, I state about Kala yantra (time instru- 
ments). (76) 

Time can be known from cakra yantra, yasti, 
capa yantra (semi circular), Sanku, quadrant, ghati 
_yantra, phalaka yantra described by Bhaskara, a 
glass pot, water, sand or thread yantra etc. Persons 


944 


knowing yantra can use any of them to find time. 
(77) 


Verses 78-81 - Golardha yantra 


A hemispherical bowl is made in earth like 
lower half of a water pot. Its circular base is 
upwards on ground level. On that, direction points 
like east west are marked. The ground level circle 
is dividor of the sphere. (78) 


On its internal surface, east-west and meridian 
circles (half portions) are drawn. Below the south 
point, north pole is marked at difference of latitude. 
Then we draw a circle with centre at pole and 
difference between sun and pole as radius. (79) 


This will be the diurnal circle for that time. 
A straight Sanku of height equal to radius of diurnal 
circle is kept. The diurnal circle also will be marked 
with danda pala etc. From position of Sanku, 
shadow at that time can be known. Intelligent men 
can know the time during night also by observing 
moon. (80-81) 

Notes : This has been called kapala yantra by 
Varahamihira etc. But kapala yantras described by 
Aryabhata and sarya siddhanta are water instru- 
ments. Varahamihira instrument is movable 
hemishphere with a Sanku equal to radius at its 
centre. Its plane surface is raised so that north 
elevation is equal to latitude, i.e. it is in hoirzontal 
plane of equator. 


- However, the kapala yantra here are fixed 
bowl excavated in earth as described in siddhanta 
samrata of Jagannatha and yantraprakara of 
Jaisingh. Jaisingh made two modifications, his 
JayaprakaSa yantra contained cross wires in north

into equatorial coordinates and not for observation. 


The main golardha yantra may be called 
kapala A, it is shown in figure 5. Its surface 
represents inverted images of two spherical coor-

through N, S and bottom point (lower half of 
Meridian). From bottom zenith point a number of 
:@qual azimuth lines are drawn upto the rim or 
‘horizon. Next, a number of equally spaced circles 
with their centres on vertical axis passing through

zenith are inscribed on the surface. These circles 
are parallel to rim and intersect the equal azimuth 
(angle with east west direction) lines at right angles. 

For equatorial system, a point on meridian 
below south point S on rim represents the north 
celestial pole. At a distance of 90°, a great circle 
intersecting meridian at right angles represents the 
equator. On both sides of equator, a number of 
diurnal circles are drawn. From the pole, hour 
circles radiate out in all directions upto rim. These 
coordinates measure the time as stated in this book. 


On a clear day, the shadow of the cross wire 
falling on the concave surface below indicates the 
coordinate of the sun. These coordinates may be 
read either in horizon or in equator system as 
desired. The time is read by shadow’s angular 
distance from the meridian measured along a 
diurnal circle. 

For determining ascendants, this has a set of 
12 curves on its surface. The curves represent 12 
ascendents. On a clear day, the shadow of cross 
wire falling on one of the curves, indicates the 
ascendant or sign emerging at the horizon at that 
very moment (In JayaprakaSa, madhya lagna is 
indicated). 

The ascendant lines are drawn from the fact 
that sayana mesa 0° always rises at east point on 
horizon. Then pole of ecliptic is exactly 90° away 
from the east point on its diurnal circle. With the 
location of pole as starting point (kadamba), divide 
the diurnal circle of pole into 12 equal parts. Then 
with these points of divisions as centres, draw arcs 
of radius 90° on the surface. These arcs represent 
path of the sun’s shadow on the instrument’s 
surface.

Figure 6 - Kapala B for change of coordinates | 


In figure 6, Kapala B has arcs representing 
two sets of coordinate systems - horizontal and 
equatorial. For the horizon system of coordinates, 
rim of instrument represents the meridian and 
north point Z of the rim represents the zenith. 
Another point at distance of latitude of place to 
the east of this zenith, designates north celestial 
pole. The north point of the original horizon is 
located at the east, pint of the rim. The “original 
horizon” lies in the vertical plane passing through 
the east-west points on the rim. A great circle 
passing through the north and south points of the 
rim and bottom point of the rim represents the 
prime vertical (yamyottara circle). 


First, a point on the instrument's surface is 
plotted in given coordinates. Now angular distance 
of this plotted point from equator is found along 
hour circles. This is declination. Similarly, distance 
from rim of meridian gives the hour angle. Finally, 
by adding or substracting from hour angle, the 
angular distance between vernal equinox and 
meridian at time of observation, we get the right 
ascension (equatorial longitude). 


948 Siddhanta Darpana 


The angular distance between any two stars 
may be determined by plotting two points on the 
instrument according to their coordinates and 
spanning the points with a dividor. Then from the 
graduated scale on rim, the separation in degrees 
in found. 


Verses 82-92 - Mana yantra 

Now I describe Mana yantra which can be 
used to find the angular difference between two 
planets or stars in the sky. We can also know the 
height and distance of a hill or a tree etc. (82) 


A plane surface is made smooth by thick paste 
layer. A circle of 360 angula circumference is made 
and marks at interval of 1 angula = 1° are given. 
With same centre a wooden circular board is made 
and its centre is put on centre of ground circle. 
From the centre, lines are drawn to the 360 angle 
marks at circumference. (83) 


At circumference of wooden board, even the 
degrees may be further subdivided. At centre of 
the board a strong and straight rod is inserted 
with length equal to the radius. (84) 

Size of board may be 4, 5, 30, 15 or any 
desired part of the ground circle. (85) 

Rod is held in hand and board is kept in 
plane of two planets or stars. By keeping the 
rod and an angle line in direction of planet, we 
know their angular difference. The difference in 
degrees is divided by 6 and multiplied by trijya 
(3438). (86) 

Result is divided by diameter of diurnal circle 
of that day, to -<: time difference in danda.

Height of Hill 
Distance from base of hill to Sanku base 
= x Sank jy 
drgiya 

Same way height of a tree is found. (87) 

A dark cloud also can be seen through 
manayantra to find its angle of elevation or 
depression. Its drgjya is multiplied by (2500) hands 

‘(average height of dark clouds) and divided by 
§anku to find the distance of cloud base and own 
position. (88) 

In finding height of trees or hill through two 
Sankus, we use mana yantra as a Sanku. Its shadow 
at a near place is calculated. (89) 


Then at a farther place the Sanku and its 
shadow is calculated. Second sanku shadow is 
_multiplied by first Sanku and divided by first 
‘shadow and second Sanku. it gives the ratio of 
distance of second shadow and first shadow from 
base of hill, Remaining method has been explained 
earlier. In this method height and distance can be 
calculated even when the ground is plane or 
oblique. (90) 

For more correct value of tree or hill, yasti 
will be taken 5 hands long. Then the end of rod 
is kept in line of hill top. Then another Sanku is 
kept between observer and hill, so that its top and 
hill top are in one line. Then we proceed as per 
earlier method. (91) 


As we observe the north pole (in meridian 
circle), by same method we observe hill top (in 
any other direction). By seeing the jya of elevation 
_(unnatajya = proportional to height) and jya of 


950 Siddhanta Darpana 


depession (drgjya proportional to horizontal dis- 
tance) at two places we can find the height and 
distance of the hill. Drg jya gives distance and 
unnatajya gives height. (Text describes east west 
difference jya, this means distance in any direction, 
not in north only). (92) 


Notes (1) : Construction of mana yantra has 
been described very clearly. But purpose of such 
construction is ‘not clear. Oriya translation by 
Pandita Vira Hanumana Sastri terms it ‘mapa 
yantra’ whose meaning is same. However, Bhaskara 
and Lalla have termed it yasti yantra, as mentioned 
in this chapter verse 77 also. Bhaskara II has 
mentioned that ‘dhi’ (i.e. intelligence) is main 
instrument (yantra) for using yasti or other instru- 
ments. But Sri S.D. Sharma has described a yantra 
named ‘dhi yantra’ on that basis. Yasti has to be 
used with a plumb line, hence Sri Sharma has 
considered dhi yantra as a stick with plumb line 
“at its end. 


Figure 7 - Construction of mana yantra 

Figure 7 shows construction of mana yantra. 
A circle'C of 360 angula circumference (i.e. 57/18 
angula radius) is drawn at plane ground. Its 
circumference is C and centre O. With same centre 
O, a wooden circle D is kept. C is divided into 
360 divisions of angle. From O lines are drawn to 
each mark so that D also is divided into 360 parts.

“This appears to be purpose of drawing bigger circle 


- for accurate division of angles on wooden board. 


:Then the degrees can be subdivided. A pole OP 
‘equal to radius of C (57/18 angula) is kept. 


According to Bhaskara, D should be of radius equal 


‘to dyujya. But this circle is made on the ground. 
When wooden circle is formed this is not important, 
“only angle divisions are necessary as it is clear 
. from verse 85. Length of rod equal to radius (57/18) 
‘makes it easy to calculate the jya of bhaja and koti 
directly if it is kept in bent position:

OB is yasti of length equal to radius (57/18

-at'O- and OB is pee towards north pole in 
“direction OP. Perpendiculars are drawn on earth 
» form O and B through plumb lins OO’ and BA’. 


952 Siddhanta Darpana 


Perpendiculars from both ends of yasti have to be 
drawn as eye is above the ground level. 

Then OA = O’A’ is the bhuja or bhuja jya 
because we have taken OB = R. This is proportional 
to distance of an object or drgjya. In Fig 8b, 
natam§sa of object D is ZVOB or ZVOD and its 
jya is OA = drgijya. 

AB = A’B - OO’ = Koti is the jya of unnatam$Sa 
which is ZBOA in fig 8 B. 

DC is height of object (proportional to 
unnatajya) and OC is its distance (proportional to 
drgjya) becuase OAB and OCD are similar triangles 
and 


OA _ AB 

OC ~ CD 

(3) Elevation of sun with yasti 

To find the elevation of sun, we keep the 
‘yasti at centre of circle and point the other end 
towards sun, so that no shadow is formed. Since 
yasti = R, its perpendicular on ground is unnata 
jya of sun and distance of base of perp is drgjya 
or jyad of natamSa. 

In 60 danda sun moves 360° , hence in 1 
danda it moves 6°. We see its movement along 
diurnal circle, hence to convert its elevation in 
equator, we multiply it by radius (3438) of equator 
and divide by semidiameter of diurnal circle 
(dyujya) - (Verses 86-87) 

The distance between Sanku and the east west 
line in known as bhuja. Difference of bhuja of two 


Instruments 953 


gankus (in same direction) is multiplied by 12 and 
divided by difference of Sankus is gives equinoctical 
shadow (palabha). 


If we observe Sanku at three times, in 
morning, evening and at mid day we know 
declination and from that position of sun can be 
known (indicating the north). The base of morning 
and evening Sankus is on rising setting line which 
is parallel to east west line through centre of circle. 
Then midday shadow gives the north south incline . 
of sun whose sum or difference with aksamé&a (or 
palabha) gives declination as explained in chapter 
3; 


(4) Difference in two planets : Lalla describes 
the method of finding angular distance between 
sun and moon from which tithi of a lunar month 
can be known from formula 


Moon — sun 
12° 

He described this as a Sakata yantra because 
two hollow tubes joined at angle are used, like 
two bamboo joined at angle to form chassis of 
bullockcart (Sakata). One tube is kept in direction 
of sun and through other, moon is seen (when 
both are visible). This position of tubes is clamped 
and put on the circle with point of intersection on 
the centre. Angle difference read on the ground 
is the angle between sun and moon. Similarly 
angular difference between any two planets can be 
known. 


= Tithi 


954 Siddhanta Darpana 


This is described under use of yasti by Sri 
R.N. Rai. Here no yasti is used, however, the 
graduated circle on ground is put to some use 
(with ‘dhi’ yantra i.e. intellect). 

(5) Use of circular disc : By bending yasti in 
any direction and using a plumb line elevation of 
any object on earth or in sky can be known. More 
conveniently it can be done with Sakata yantra or. 
inclined tubes (Lalla). Siddhanta Darpana refers to 
those methods only. Then what is the use of fixing 
rod at centre of a graduated circular disc ? 


The clue is given by Salaka yantra (needles) 
mentioned by Lalla. He uses long pins to be used 
as Sanku and hypotenus of shadows, but when 
disc is available, we can use pins only to read its 
angle measurements. Rod can be taken as a 
permanent pin at the centre. For that purpose it 
should have one sharp end, exactly perpendicular 
to the central point. We have to set the disc in 
plane in which difference of angle is to be measured 
and kept fixed in that position. For height of tree 
or hill, it will be vertical with edge of disc in 
direction of the tree etc. Then both points (base 
and top, or two objects in sky) are seen. In 
direction of rod and one of the points, pin is given 
at circumference of the disc. In line with other 
point and rod a another pin is given. The angular 
distance between the two points gives the angular 
distance between two objects (or elevation of top 
from base). 


Instruments 955 


Figure 9 - elevation through mana yantra 

Disc of mana’ yantra is kept in plane of 
observer and points A and B whose angular 
difference is to be found. Edge of the rod (yasti) 
passes through the centre O of disc. In line with 
point O and B, we put pin pi. Similarly pin P2 is 
put in line OA. Thus ZP; OP2 = ZAOB- ZP,OP 
is read from distance P; Pz as O is at centre of 
the circle. 


(6) Use of yasti as in double Sanku method: 
In double Sanku method we use Sanku of same 
height. But here, we use the yasti as karna, hence 
Sanku unnatajya has different lengths. Thus we 
have to divide the Sanku shadow by their Sanku 
to know the proportionate length of shadow as 
mentioned in verses (88-89). It will be more clear 
from figure 10.

We observe the elevation of hill AO of height 
h from point B and C which are at distance x and 
y = xta from O. Yasti is CT, = BT; = Radius R 
(3438). Thus Sankus at B and C are not equal

accuracy. 

Verse 93 : Cakra yantra is circular. Its half 
i.e. semicircular instrument is called capa yantra. 
Half again of capa i.e. 1 quadrant is called turiya 
yantra. Cakra can give any time in day or night, 
capa yantra gives time in day, and turiya during 
half day. Turiya yantra has been called yasti here. 
(93) 

Notes : (1) Cakra yantra - 


Figure 11 - Cakra yantra 
The cakra yantra has been described by 
Vardhamihira as follows - 


Take a circular hoop, on whose circumference, 
the 360° degrees are evenly marked, whose 
diameter is 1 hasta, and which is half an angula 
broad. Through a small hole in the circumference, 
allow a ray of sun at noon to enter in oblique 
direction. We get the enith distance of sun at mid 
moon. (The oblique direction can be seen by a 
pointer of diameter length). 

It is not explained how the time will be 
determined. Other astroromers recommend cakr>

yantra of metal or seasoned wood and of 3 meters 
diameter. A needle should be kept at centre whose 
shadow at lower end gives the height of sun. 
Cakra yantra built in observatories of Jai Singh 
at Jaipur and Varanasi is shown in figure 11. Jaipur 
piece is 6 ft. in diameter, one inch. thick and two 
inches broad, faced with brass on which degrees 
and minutes are marked. They are mounted on 
pillars and fixed so as to revolve round an axis 
parallel to earth’s axis. At southern extremity of 
the axis, and on pillar which supports the 
instrument, there is a graduated circle in the plane 
of equator. This axis carries a pointer, which 
indicates the hour angle on the fixed circle. The 
main movable circle carries an index and a sighter 
through which heavenly bodies can be observed. 
There are certain prominent stars whch are 
very near the ecliptic. Their celestial longitude 4 
and latitude f are - 
Pusya ( d6cancri; A = 128°1’ 6 = 0°.5’) 
Magha (aLeonis, Regulus,A = 149°8’, 6 = 
0°28’) 
Satabhisaj (4 Aquarii,A = 340°’53’, 8 = 0°23’) 
Revati (€ PiscicumjA = 19°11’, B = 0°13’) 
The circle should be held such that the above 
stars should appear to touch its circumference, then 
the circle will be in ecliptic plane. While observing 
any of the stars, one should observe a planet and 
determine the distance between the star and the 
planet. This distance is added to longitude of star 
in west or substracted from it, when star is east 
of planet, to get longitude of the planet.

(2) Capa yantra - A large semicircle is divided 
into 180° and subdivisions of a degree. At its 
centre, a fine hole is made through which a needle 
is inserted. It is held in such a way that, chord 
in horizontal. Then it is rotated so that both sides 
are equally illuminated by rays of sun. The number 
of degrees between horizon point (bottom of 
circumference) and shadow of the needle gives the 
zenith distance of sun. The distance from base of 
yantra is elevation. From them time after sunrise 
or before sunset can be calculated as explained 
earlier. 


Figure 12 - Capa yantra 
Capa yantra of Aryabhata is slightly different, 
in which chord end was kept on the ground and 
gnomon or needle was moved on the circumference 
so that its shadow fell on the centre. 


(3) Turiya yantra - 

This is formed of fourth part of a circle, hence 
called ‘Turiya yantra’. It is made of flat plate of 
metal and each arm (radius) is about 1.5 meters 
in length. It is graduated into 90° and degrees are 
further subdivided. A small nail is fixed at the 
centre and quadrant is kept in meridian (north 
south vertical) plane. One arm of quadrant is 


960 Siddhanta Darpana 


vertical and other horizontal (this side will be upper 
most facing away from sun). At mid day, shadow 
of nail will give zenith distance. The difference of 
mid day zenith distance at its least value (for places 
north of 23-1/2°N) for sun in sayana cancer and 
‘greatest value for sun entering capricorn is double 
the angle of inclination of ecliptic. Time can be 
found as with capa yantra. 


In another form, a small tube is fixed at the 
centre pointing towards point on circumference 
along one of the arms. Another small tube is fixed 
at this end pointing towards the centre. This end 
is known as the horizontal point end and point 
on circumference is known as sky point. A plumb 
line is suspended from the centre. The quadrant 
is now held in such a way that rays from sun 
entering the tube at the centre fall on the tube at 
the horizontal point. The degrees between this 
point and plumb line gives zenith distance of sun. 
Degrees between plumb line and other side give 
height of sun. Moon, planets, starts can be 
observed by placing eye at horizontal point and 
observing bodies by directing instrument at them, 
so that they will be observed by the light entering 
both the tubes.

The yantra cintamani recommends that each 
arm should be divided inot 30 parts and half chords 
parallel to the other arm should be drawn from 
each point. Also an index rod should be fixed .to 
the tube at the centre rather loosely so that it will 
revolve freely along the circumference.

A phalaka or board of metal or good seasoned 
wood of rectangular form is made, 90 angula high 
and double i.e. 180 angula in length. At middle 
point of the length we should attach a chain by 
‘which it can be held in a vertical plane. From this 
middle point, a line is drawn which is perpen-

dicular to the edge and is called the lamba rekha. 
This is divided into 90 equal parts, each of one 
angula. Through each of the dividing points we 
should draw lines parallel to top and bottom edges. 
These horizontal lines are called sines. 

With the point of intersection of 30th sine 
from the top and lamba rekha as the centre, a 
circle of radius of 30 angulas is drawn. This circle. 
will cut the lamba rekha at the 60th sine and its 
diameter is equal to 60 angulas. Now circumference 
of circle is marked with 60 ghatis and 360° and 
each degree is divided into 10 parts of 1 pala each. 
A pin is inserted at the centre of circle through a 
hole which is considered as the axis. 

A thin pattika or index arm of copper or 
bamboo is taken 60 angulas in length, divided into 
60 parts. It is half an angula broad except at 
beginning where it is 1 angula broad and where 
a hole is bored for suspending it near mid point 
of board. Graduated side of pattika coincides with 
lamba rekha.

When the bjuja of sun’s longitude is 15, 30, 
45, 60, 75, 90, the value of 12 (1-cosd) /cos 6 is 4, 
15, 32, 50, 63, 68 sixtieths _respectively. The 
differences of these values are 4, 11, 17, 18, 13, 5 
which have been given above. On multiplying these 
difference by h, equinoctical hypotenus and divid- 
ing by 12, the quotients found are called khanda 
for a place. By assuming bhuja of sun’s longitude 
as an argument, we can find the result through 
khandas. Let r be this result, then 


r 10 rt

because in the instrument R = 30 


10 r ; 
Thus . cos T = (h+ é0) Sin A 


+R sin (asc diff) 

It is evident that the value of the yasti, y will 
-always be greater than 30 because h is always 
greater than 12 except at equator where h is 12. 
At equator, yasti will be equal to 30 only if 6 = 
0. If on holding the instrument so that rays of the 
sun illuminate both its side (so that it is in a 
vertical plane), shadow of the axis at O cuts the 
circumference of the circle abcd in s. The angle 
. sob is equal to angular height of the sun. 


Now the index arm is put on the axis and 
putting it over the place where the shadow cuts 
the circle and measuring along index arm a length 
equal to yasti found above, let m be the point so 
obtained. Then 


= y sin A 


968 Siddhanta Darpana 


If the place is on the equator, we have to 
find T such that R cos T = mn. Then T gives value 
of time in degrees to or after midday. 


At any other place, the correction for asc. 
diff. has to be applied. For sun having north kranti, 
R sin (asc. diff) is substracted from mn. Let the 
amount to be substracted be mr. Then R cos T = 
tt’ and the angle is given by the arc ct. If the sun 
is in southern hemisphere, correction mr’ is to be 
added and R cosT’= TT’ and the angle is given 
by arc CT. 


Once table of values of the yasti and correction 
for asc. diff for different bhujas of sun’s longitude 
has been constructed for a place, the instrument 
will give time very quickly. 

Verses 99-108 - Svayarnvaha yantra. 

For svayamvaha yantra (automatic rotating 
instrument) we make a disc of 60 angula circum- 
ference. At each angula of the circumference one 
-line is. given corresponding to 60 dandas in a day. 
_At 5 angula intervals, bigger marks are given (5 
ghati = 2 hour interval). (99) 


A smooth axle is fited at centre of this disc 
and is fitted on two pillars in north south direction 
3 hands high. Disc should have uniform weight 
so that it moves freely. (100) 

The disc can rotate in east west plane. Sun 
and moon signs are given at east and west 
horizons. Below west horizon a copper tube is 
placed vertically. (101) 


Instruments 969 


This tube will be 60 angula long. At bottom 
a small hole will be made, so that water comes 
out in 60 dandas. Below it a pot will be kept to 
keep the outflown water; otherwise it will spread 
on ground. (102) 


Then a thread is tied round the circumference 
passing from lower, eastern and top portion and 
coming back near the tube. A weight is suspended 
through the thread. (103) 


The thread is made smooth through wax or 
grease (parada). When weight is put in water, it 
will slowly turn the wheel once in a day-night. (A 
light weight - hollow cover of hard fruit is 
recommended which will float on water). (104) 


In east horizon a pointer will be kept which 
‘will be near sun mark at sunrise time. Starting 
from sun rise time, the mark on circumference 
touching the pointer will indicate the time lapsed 
in day-night. Next day also wheel will be set in 
same way. (105) 

Lower half will be kept covered so that it is 
not seen by visitors, otherwise their curiosity will 
be lost. This secret method should be shown only 
to good students. (106) 


The gola yantra stated earlier can also be 
rotated like this svayamvaha yantra. Another view 
about this is being stated. Two circles are made of 
thin wood (circular disc with a wooden groove) to 
be fixed near dhruva. (107) ; 

In hole of dhruva cakra, we put dhruva yasti 
after oiling it properly. Then west of the sphere, 
two nails are fixed and two tubes are fixed below 
them. (108) 


Two weights are suspended from the nails 
. into the tubes. Thread is tied around gola upto

the weights. Then gola yantra will move in equator 
circle like east west circle. 


Notes : This is a crude and unnecessary 
instrument when accurate clocks on spring and 
pendulum action have already been made in 
Europe. First mechanical clock was made by 
Giovanni de Dondi between 1348 and 1362. This 
clock indicated motions of sun, moon and five 
planets with’a series of gears. The use of the 
pendulum as a controlling device was suggested 
by Galileo and independantly discovered by 
Huygens (1629-95). Thomas Tompion in 1676 built 
two spring winding clocks with 13 foot pandulums, 
beating two seconds for Greenwich observatory. 
These clocks could go without winding for almost 
one year. 


In stead of pendulum, eccentric free wheel 
was used in table clocks and wrist watches for 
keeping correct time. The rotation was made with 
electric power also in electric clocks. The electric 
movements in 20th century were controlled with 
electronic oscillations stabilised by oscillations of 
quartz crystal. These are most popular now and 
very accurate.

More accurate watches for scientific purpose 
are made on basis of oscillations of Cs atom or 
Ammonia laser. These give error of less than 1 
second in 10,000 years. Even at the time of 
Candra$akhara accurate clocks and watches were 
available in India. However, he has imagined a 
svayamvaha yantra mentioned by Aryabhata and 
surya siddhanta whose mechanism has not been 
mentioned. This mechanism in principle can work, 
but it will be very rough. Eye estimate of time 
may be more accurate than this. Scheme of 
construction is shown in figure 19. . 


Verses 110-113 - Conclusion 

(Surya siddhanta) By acquiring knowledge of 
graha, nakSatra and gola, a person becomes rich 
and goes to graha loka after his death. (110) 


(Siddhanta Siromani) - Graha knowledge is 
divine and beyond human perception. It was given 
originally by the creator (Brahma), then it was 
spread on earth by sages like Vasistha. This sacred 
knoweldge should not be given to violent, 
treacherous, wicked and men of unsteady wit. By 
not obeying this injunction of sages, one loses his 
longevity and result of holy deeds. (111) 


May the brightness of Supreme lord always 
come before my vision for giving pleasure, whose 
mahaprasada stops re-birth and purifies down 
trodden like me by taking it in hands, mouth or 
stomach, (112) 


Thus ends the twentieth chapter describing 
instruments in Siddhanta Darpana written as a text 
book for accurate calculation by Sri Candragekhara 
born in respected royal family of Orissa. (113)

REMAINING EXPLAINATIONS 


Vasana Sesa Rahasya Varnana 


Verse 1 - Scope - After completing description 
of graha and_ gola, the rationale of mathematical 
methods is being explained as answer to questions 
posed earlier. 


Veses 2-6 - Difference in day lengths 


Horizon of equator is called unmandala for 
other places (on same longitude). Sunrise occurs 
in own- horizon for any place. Between local 
horizon and unmandala (horizon of eqautor).(2) 
the portion of diurnal circle intercepted is cara. 
This is the difference between sunrise times at 
equator and local place. It is day time when sun 
is above horizon in its diurnal circle. (3) 


When sun is below ‘horizon, it is night. 
Equator is the largest diurnal circle. It is bisected 
by horizon of all places. Hence, when sun is 
moving on equator, day and night are equal at all 
places. At equator, day and night are always equal. 
(4) 

When sun is north of equator, then in north 
hemisphere, sunrise is before equator rise and 
sunset is after equator sunset. In south, 
hemispehre, it is reverse. (5) 

Reason is that in north hemisphere unmandala 
is above horizon. Before reaching unmandala 


Remaining Explainations . 973 


(sunrise at equator), sun comes at local horizon 
and local sunrise occurs. In the south hemisphere 
unmandala is below horizon (hence opposite 
occurs). (6) 

Notes : Already it has been explained in 
chapter 5. 


“Verses 7-13 - Day-night at poles 


Special event occurs at places whose latitude 
is more than 66-1/2° which is being told here. (7) 


On north polar region (66-1/2°N to 90°N), it 
is day as long as sun has north kranti and it 
becomes night when sun has-south kranti. (8) 


Equator is horizon for deva (in north pole) 
and asura (in south pole). Hence north pole. is the 
zenith of deva and south pole, that of asuras. (9) 


When sun is in north hemisphere, devas see 
it moving above south horizon. When sun is in 
south horizon, it is seen above north horizon by 
asuras. (10) 


Half portion of the ecliptic (séyana mesa 
beginning to sayana tula beginning) is north of 
equator. Thus when sun is in north hemisphere 
for first half of ecliptic, it is day time for deva and 
night for asura. It is reverse when sun is in south 
gola. (11) 

However, smrtis has stated that for uttarayana 
(i.e. north ward movement) of sun, it is day of 
deva and night of asura. Daksinadyana (southward 
movement) of sun is night of deva. After midday, 
.8un starts going down in the direct on of night 
and after midnight, it starts going uf in direction 
of day. (12) 


974 Siddhanta Darpana 


Hence from mid night itself start of day is 
assumed. Thus day of deva (gods) starts with 
uttarayana. By celebration of day starting rituals 
then by men, gods become happy. (13) 


Notes : Séyana makara sankranti is the start 
of uttarayana (just before christmas). Bhisma waited 
till christmas for his death after being mortally 
injured in Mahabharata war. Now we are following 
nirayana system, hence christmas falls on 25th 
December (winter solstice on 23rd december) and 
makara samkranti on 14th January. Thus makara 
sankranti is celebrated as a festival. 


Sayana makara sankranti is start of grand day, 
hence christmas is called bada dina. In civil calender 
it falls on margéirsa month. Twilight period is 
1/12th of day time i.e. 1/24 of day night. In grand 
day of 1 year it is 15 1/4 days approximately. Hence 
15 1/4 days before start of margaSirsa, it is bada 
Osa (grand twilight). 


Verses 14-17 - Other day-nights 


Brahma is very far from earth, hence he 
always sees the sun and his day continues. Only 
when sun is destroyed in pralaya, his night starts 
and he sleeps. This is stated in Puranas. (14) 


Day night of others (deva-asura, and men) is 
due to one sun only. At the end of Brahma’s night, 
another sun rises (because previous one has been 
destroyed). (15) 

When sun is visible, it is day and when it is 
obstructed, it is night. Thus for pitrs living on 
moon’s back surface, day-night is equal to a lunar 
month. (116) 


Remaining Explainations 975 


At the end of amavasya, it is mid day of 
pitars and at end of purnima, it is mid night. 
Bright half 8th day is their evening and dark half 
8th day is their sun rise. (117) 

Notes : Brahma’s day is when creation of sun 
and planets is on. When creation is destroyed, it 
is pralaya. In modern cosmology, it is expansion 
of universe, when matter is in different forms. At 
the time of contraction, there will be infinite rise 
in temperatures corresponding to pralaya. 

Pitara live on the other side of moon. Hence 
when we see bright moon, it is dark for them. 


Verses 18-22 - Different rising times of rasis 

The portion of ecliptic touching east horizon 
is lagna at that time. The portion of ecliptic 
touching west horizon is the asta (setting) lagna 
for that time. (18) 

Between east and west horizons, the lower 
and upper directions cut the ecliptic in points called 
4th and tenth lagnas. These can be known from 
triprasnadhikara. (19) 

Oblique portion of ecliptic rises and sets 
quicker, but straight portion being longer (on 
equator) takes more time to rise or set. (20) 


Hence the rising times of rasis of ecliptic are 
not equal. At equator 90° part of ecliptic rises in 
15 ghati. 180° (half) of ecliptic rises in 30 ghatis. 
(21) 

Whatever is stated or ommitted here, should 
be explained by the instructor, by rotating the 
model of globe (earth) and ecliptic. (22) 


976 


Verses 23-26 : Ecliptic parts visible at places 


At aksamSa 69°48’, dhanu and makara raéis 
are not visible, but mithuna and karka always rise 
(they never set). (23) 


For place of aksamSa 78°30’, 4 rasis starting 
with vrécika are always below horizon and 4 raSis 
starting with vrsa are always above horizon. (24) 


At aksamSa 90° north (on sumeru), 6 raSis 
starting with tula are never visible, but other 6 
rasis are always visible. (25) 


Thus in deva part (north hemisphere) and 
asura part (south hemisphere), raSis are visible or 
invisible acording to latitude (akSamSa) of the place. 
The rasi which is always above horizon in deva 
part, is always below horizon at that latitude in 
asura part. (26) 


. Notes : Condition for a star being circumpolar 
has already: been explained in chapter 8 on lunar 
‘eclipse. The north kranti of a star being more than 
colatitude of the place, the star will never set. 
Similarly south kranti being more than colatitude 
for north. hemispehre, the star wil not rise. The 
south kranti of (270°+30°) i.e. dhanu, makara or 
north kranti of mithuna karka (90° + 30°) is 20°12’ 
i.e. sind = Sin 60° X Sin 23°30’, thend = 20°12’. 
Hence at 69°48’ = 90° - 20°12’, dhanu, makara 
never rise and mithuna, karka never set. Similarly 
kranti for vrsa beginning 30° or sirnha end 150° 
is 11°30’ hence at 78°30’ = 90°-11°30’, the rasis 
between them never set. Here, the raSis are sayana. 


Verses 27-28 : Unequal linear speeds - 


If yojana speed of planets is considred same, 
then according to their angular velocity, orbit has 
to be made bigger. (27) 


Remaining Explainations 977 


Then the sighra paridhi of planets doesn’t 
come to observed value. Hence, the planets starting 
from budha sukra with successively lower speeds 
in angle must have lower linear speeds also. (28) 

Notes : Relation with Sighra paridhi has 
already been explained in chapter 19 verses 53-54. 


Verses 29-31 - Heliocentric motion 


In old texts also the diameter of planets 
(angular), Sara (latitude) and sighra phala are stated 
to change. Thus they also accept the heliocentric 
orbits, through do not state it specifically. I have 
stated it clearly. (29) 


Sun and moon rotate around earth and other 
planets rotate around mean sun. They move in 
east direction as seen from mean sun. (30) 


This is the natural motion of planets, which 
is due to attraction of mandocca. When planet is 
far or near earth, its angular speed changes. (31) 


Notes : Change in sighra phala and distance 
have been explained in chapter 5 and 17, which 
indicates heliocentric orbit. This should have 
included earth also, but assumption of solar orbit 
around earth makes no diference in relative speed, 
hence there is no contradiction. 


Linear speed of a planet around mean sun or 
earth has been assumed constant. Actually linear 
speed also is reduced when it is far from centre 
of orbit. Its angular speed is further reduced due 
to increase in distance. 


Verses 32-41 : Calculation from kalpa beginning 


Different astronomers have given different 
numbers of revolutions of graha and their ucca. 


978 Siddhanta Darpana 


Hence some astronomers (Aryabhata) tell that time 
periods of kalpa etc are not correct. (32) 


But this is against scriptures and hypocricy. 
If we assume the kalpa bhaganas of mean sun and 
moon, then present mean positions can be known 
from lapsed civil days in the kalpa. (33) 


We see that 1400 years after Aryabhata, even 
1 kala difference has not occured in positions of 
mean sun and moon. Thus the theory of ancient 
scriptures cannot be considred wrong. (34) 


Due to almost fixed position of sun mandocca, 
madhyama sun speed can be ascertained for 5-6 
years, only by seeing earth shadow etc. (35) 


But mandocca of moon moves faster, hence 
its ucca motion or mean motion cannot be known 
without siddhanta. (36) 


By repeated observations of moon only its 
variation in motion can be known. Since speed of 
‘Sani is very slow, we cannot find its mandocca 
and mean motion in less than hundred years. (37) 


Due to these reasons, revolution of sun and 
moon, years months and days etc should be 
counted from kalpa beginning only. Thus the 
assertion of siddhantas also are correct. (38) 

The difference in bhagana (revolutions) of ucca 
and pata of moon and of mafgala can be observed 
in a yuga only. The revolutions numbers in a yuga 
are for rough calculations. Accuracy can be 
achieved by revolution numbers in a kalpa only. 
(39) 

Learend Bhaskaracarya found errors in cal- 
culations from yuga revolution numbers. Hence he 
assumed complete revolutions only in a kalpa. (40) 


Remaining Explainations 979 


He ignored the creation period and made 
calculations from kalpa beginning itself. According 
to him, kalpa started from mean sunrise at Lanka, 
not from mid night. (41) 


Notes : Bhaskaracarya has explained 
‘bhaganotpatti’ (origin of revolution numbers) in 
detail in goladhyaya. 

Moon’s motion among the stars can be seen 
most easily, at the rate of 1 nakSatra per day. 


Tropical revolution of sun can be found very 
easily with change of seasons and interval between 
equinoxes. 


Sidereal revolution of sun could have been 
by following method - (1) Repeatition of solar or 
lunar eclipses and comparison of lunation and 
sidereal revolutions of sun. (ii) Observing the star 
which was rising at sun set. Motion of sun within 
stars will be seen towards east within a month. 
From sidereal and synodic motions of moon, the 
difference speed of sun could be determined (iii) 
The sidereal revolution can be checked after one 
year by heliacal rising of a particular star. 


Among tara grahas, average sidereal periods 
of mercury and venus coincided with sun, thus 
they were found oscillating around sun in smaller 
orbits. Other 3 tara grahas had very longer periods 
of direct motion. Their sidereal periods could be 
found by periods between heliacal rising and 
settings. Let x" be angular speed of a planet in a 
day, and a° be the speed of sun. Then during one 
day, sun over takes the planet by (a-x)°. Thus their 
synodic period S between consecutive heliacal rising 
or settings is 


980 Siddhanta Darpana 


360 
“a-x 


From the value of x, we can calculate sidereal 
period 360/x as a is already known. 


As the inner planets appear to oscillate around 
sun, similarly for outer planets mars, jupiter, 
saturn, earth will appear to oscillate round sun. 
Seeing in reverse, the average of sidereal period - 
round earth and round sun will be same. Hence 
-bhaganas given in our siddhantas tallies with 
heliocentric revolution period given in modern 
astronomy. This result has been proved by D. Arka 
Somayaji in ‘A critical study of Ancient Hindu 
Astronmy’ published by Karnataka university, 
Dharawar. 


The revolution of planets and pata and ucca 
of moon make complete revolutions within a period 
of 43,20,000 years. This is the minimum period of 
complete revolutions and has given the definition 
of a yuga. 

Mandocca and pata of other planets move 
very slowly and minimum period of their complete 
revolution is 1000 yuga or a kalpa. 


Verses 42-54 : Reasons of correcting bhaganas 
Bhaskaracarya found that positions of sun and 
moon were more, when calculated from mgumber 
of days lapsed since kali beginning. (42) 
Hence, he deducted the difference kalas from 
the revolutions of sun and moon and changed their 
revolution numbers. (Sun correction was made by 


Remaining Explainations 981 


ommitting creation years, start of kalpa from 
sunrise etc.) (43) 


Similarly, he found bhaganas of other planets 
‘by making correction (bija) from calculated posi- 
tions to tally with observation. (44) 


By his bija corrections in sun and moon, it 
became clear that bhaganas are not fixed (otherwise 
corrections will not be needed). (45) 


Calculation of sun and moon by present 
siddhanta (i.e. siddhanta darpana) confirms well 
with the observations. But there is more error in 
Bhaskara method. (46) 


Had the correction in bhaganas been done 
before Bhaskara to calculate the observed position 
of planets, (47) then the error of Bhaskara values 
would have been less. 516 years before him 
Brahmagupta had stated revolutions in a kalpa in 
which he found errors. (48) 


Thus he revised the revolution numbers which 
is his great achievement. But his defect is that he 
started motion of planets from kalpa beginning (not 
deducting years of creation) and from Lanka 
sunrise (instead of mid night). (49) 

Still, by recording the correct planetary posi- 
tion of his time he has done a great favour to me 
(author made further corrections on that basis) with 
lesser intellect. (50) 

Aryabhata, Satananda, Bhaskara II etc. wrote 
about planet positions of their times and calcula- 
tions according to them were done by Kama 
(Kamalakara) Bhatta etc. (51) 

I have compared their calculations with 
Present position of planets and accordingly I have 
found the correct bhaganas. (52) 


982 Siddhanta Darpana 


Thus I feel that my calculations will hold true 
upto 10,000 years in future. There is not likely to 
be any difference in tithi, nakSatras etc or true 
positions of mangala etc. (53) 


I do not know past,. present and future. Hence 
my methods cannot remain valid for ever. How- 
ever, after 10,000 years, corrections will be needed 
in bhagana values to correct the true position of 
planet as observed then. (54) 


Verses 55-70 : Corrections after ten thousand 
years. 


If the planets calculated after 10,000 years 
according to kalpa bhaganas are less or more than 
the true position, the following numbers will be 
added or deducted to kalpa bhaganas to get correct 
values. The corrections can be some multiple of 


given values also. (55-60) 
Addition to Multiples Deductions Multiples 
—— of these from Bhagana of these

Thus there are 33 atternative multiples of 
corrections.. If there is difference of 30 kala between 
Bhaskara time (1124 AD) and my time (1869. AD) 
i.e. in 745 years, then this substraction or division 
will have to be made. (61) 


For tithi and nakSatra or, for eclipse, we need 
mandocca and pata of moon. Hence their correc- 
tions are being stated. (62)

been stated to be (48, 81, 17, 940) (63) .

After long period, (how much ?) if the 
observed values are more than values calculated 
from this figure then this revolution number will 
be corrected. (64) 


We add or substract 1672, 2381 or 4053 (65) 


If in the revolutions of moon pata, there is 
difference of 1° in observation and calculation after 
10,000 years, (66) 

we add or substract 1672 to pata bhagana of 
moon. Correction to revolution of kranti pata will 
be (3090) or (67). 

(5170), (6180) or (8360), double or triple of 
(8360) i.e. (16720), (25,080) or (19,810) or (28,170). 
If kranti pata doesn’t become correct even after 
that, then kranti will be found from shadow of 
sun. (68-69) 

Sun will be calculated from calculation as well 
as from shadow (by method explained in 
triprasnadhikara). 

Notes : It is not given here whether the 
corrections are for 1° error or not. Same correction 
is recommended to Bhaskara figures for errors upto 
30’ i.e. 1/2°. Thus the minimum error which can 

_ be measured with eye is 1/2° First let us see the

Thus the figures are not corrected from 
Bhaskara by this formula. Actually all the figures 
for these planets are quoted from Brahma sphuta 
siddhanta. Brahmagupta mentioned revolution of 
moon in a yuga in that book, hence moon’s 
revolution for kalpa were quoted from his other 
work Khanda Khadyaka. Brahmagupta was the first 
to give kalpa revolutions, who claimed the origin 
in Brahma siddhanta and Visnu dharmottara 
purana (those parts are not available now). 


Let us see the corrections of Brahmagupta 
figures by Bhaskara in 516 years. That also doesn’t 
follow these figures or their multiples. 


It is clear from the figures that the correction 
for outer planets are proportional to (sun-planet) 
speed, i.e. the comparison is made between synodic 
periods. Figures of mercury and venus are proper- 
tional to their periods of revolutions. Except for 
Jupiter there is too much difference in positive and 
negative corrections and there are two many 
optional multiples of correction for venus. They do 
not fit into any consistant theory. 

1° error in 10,000 years becomes 4,32,000 
degrees error or 1200 bhaganas in 1 kalpa. This figure 
approximately tallies only with figures of Jupiter. 
Corrections are reduced so that change at present 
time is complete bhagana (to be found by 
indeterminate equations) 


Verses 71-78 : Guru years 


According to Brhatsamhitaé of Varahamihira, 
when creation started, Jupiter was at beginning of 
mesa. Hence it must have entered kumbha rai 
after 22 years. (71) 


Remaining Explainations 985 


Then guru year named ‘prabhava’ started. 
Again when guru entered mesa, the year was Sukla. 
(72) 

Hence to find the guru year starting with 
‘prabhava’, 2 rasis are added to mean Jupiter. If 
bhaganas of Jupiter are changed in future, then... 
(73) 

Guru revolution will be divided by 5 (because 
guru varsas are 60 in 5 revolutions of 12 years 
each). Since beginning of creation vi$vavasu (39), 
5ist kapila or pingala - - - (74) 

3rd (Sukla}) or 15th vrsa or 27th vijaya 
samvatsara will be counted (corresponding to full 
revolution, samvatsara number will change by 12 
or its multiple). The name of samvatsara current 
in a country should be written. (75) 


For those assuming kalpa_ revolution 
(36,42,57,840) of Jupiter, sarnvatsara should be 
started with Sukla only. (76) The mean Jupiter 
calculated from this revolution number should be 
reduced by 15 kala to see its real mean position. 
(77) 

After 1142 years (19X60+2), we should calcu- 
late guru according to above value and traditional 
value and see whether same value comes. Then 
corrections should be made. (78) 

Notes : Traditional guru year is as given by 
surya siddhanta which assumes 3, 64, 220 revolu- 
tions in a yuga instead of (3, 64, 257.84) assumed 
here. 


Verses 79-83 : Calculation of padakas 


When there is error in astronomical calcula- 
tions, god as protector of world order creates a 


986 Siddhénta Darpana 


man to correct this subject. Only that man is able 
to understand this subject. All cannot know the 
secrets. (79) 


Motion of planets in 1 day has been given in 
kala etc in 10 sub-divisions. To find the motion in 
days which are multiples of 10, the daily motion 
will be multiplied by 10. (80) 


Smallest division value is divided by 60. 
Remainder is kept there and quotient is added to 
next higher division. Number at that division also 
is divided by 60 and so on. Product is again 
multiplied by 2, 3 - - - 9 and divided by 60 starting 
with smallest place, to know motion for 20, 30, 

- + 90 days. (81) 

Results are kept till vipara (=1/60X60 vikala) 
position. Starting from rasi we keep the total for 
5 places in chart (upto para only). (82) 

These will be written in columns. These 
_ numbers are called padakas. It is easier to calculate 
planets from ahargana with them. (83) 


Verses 84-86 : Geocentric corrections 


Finding true positions of planets through 
mandaphala and Ssighraphala is applicable only for 
observing from earth. Same position will not be 
observed from other planets. (84) 


The positions observed from other planets will 
be found from the distance of that planet from 
earth and other planets from sun. This is the 
meaning of mandaphala and Sighraphala. (85) 

(Siddhanta siromani). Earth centre is also the 
centre of naksatra mandala, but it is not the centre 
of planetary orbits. Hence a planet will not be seen 
at its mean position, when observed from earth. 


Remaining Explainations 987 


Hence, astronomers correct the mean planets by 
bhujaphala (manda or Sighra) to find true position. 


Verses 87-112 - Eccentric circle for moon 


To understand the process of finding true 
planets and see their real position (for sun or 
moon), we make kaksa vrtta on plane ground with 
scale 1 angula = 1° (i.e. radius = 3438’ = 57°18’ = 
57/18 angula). (87) 

Circumference of kaksa vrtta will be 360 
angula. In this, 12 rasis from mesa are marked 
starting from east point. (88) 


At the centre, earth is formed of 9 angula 
diameter. Mandocca of moon is imagined in mesa 
at some distance.from earth. (89) 


From centre of earth at a distance of twice 
the jya of antya phala (300’X2=600 = 10 angulas), 
a point is given in the direction of mandocca. (90) 

From mid point of line joining this point and 
centre, we draw a perpendicular equal to trijya. 
The end point is at distance from centre or antya 
jya given by square root of sum of squares of trijya 
and antya jya. (91) 

Twice the distance (115/2) is divided by 60 to 
make it angula. With this diameter, we draw a 
circle from mid point of centre-antya. ((2) 


This circle will be called ’prativrtta’ (Eccentric 
circle) of radius (57/31). This is formed due to 
attraction of mandocca. (93) 


Pratimandala (Eccentric circle) meets the kaksa 
vrtta at the end of odd quadrants and is equal to 
that. At end of even quadrants, its width is 26 
kala more than kaksa vrtta. (94) 


988 Siddhanta Darpana 


Manda kendra of the graha is its distance 
from mandocca. This kendra moves in opposite 
direction of the planet. Hence in pratimandala raéi’s 
are written in opposite direction. (95) 


When manda kendra is equal to 12 rasis, the 
difference between kaka vrtta and prati vrtta is 
maximum equal to 5/13 angula.: (96) 


For manda kendra in 6 raési, this maximum 
difference is (4/47) angula. At these places, the 
attraction due to ucca and nica are maximum. (97) 


When mandocca is in east, pratimandala is 
attracted towards east. When moon is at the end 
of mithuna. (98) 


..-it will be at end of dhanu in prativrtta (same 
points measured in different directions). When it 
is at end of dhanu raéi in kakésd, it will be at 
mithuna end in prativrtta. (99) 


Since planet is attracted towards ucca in east, 
true planet will be less than mean planet in north 
part of orbit in six rasis from mesa beginning. (100) 

In south part of orbit in six rasis starting with 
tula, true planet is more then mean planet. At 
beginning of mesa and tula, true and mean planets 
are same. (101) 


We draw lines from earth centre to true and 
mean planets. These lines will cut both the circles. 
(102) 

The difference between two lines in prativrtta 
in kala is the manda bhujaphala. This is oblique 
almost in direction of mandocca. (103) 


Between the two circles, portion of line from 
earth centre to true planet is koti or kotiphala. 
Dohphala and koti phala are squared and added. 
Square of sum is karna ,(true distance). (104) 


Remaining Explainations 989 


This karna line is inclined towards mandocca 
(from line to mean planet). The difference between 
two planets (mean and true) is antyaphala or 
antyajya. From diagram of this true moon, we can 
find observed values of karna and bimba and 
eclipse also. (105) 

Bimba (angular diameter) of graha is smallest 
at ucca and largest at end of 6 rasis. For kendra 
of 6 and 12 rasis, there is no bahu (bhuja) phala 
and kotiphala is maximum. (106) 


For manda kendra at end of odd quadrants, 
mandaphala is maximum and kotiphala is zero. At 
these places birnba of planet has mean value (half 
the sum of ucca and nica birmbas). '(107) 


Planet is slowest at ucca where it is farthest 
and is fastest at nica due to nearest position. Its 
variation is same as bimba value. (108) 


Though motion is same, gatiphala is negative 
in 6 ragis starting with makara and positive for 
manda kendra in other six rasis (starting with 
karka). (109) 


(Siddhanta Siromani) In oil mill, bullock 
moves in one direction, but the crusher of oil seed 
moves in opposite direction. Similarly in nicocca 
vrtta, planet moves in the opposite direction. (110) 


When sun and moon in ucca kakSa are in 
odd quadrants, their distance is more than trijya 
and it is attracted towards ucca. (111) 


Notes : Elliptical motion of a planet is 
approximated by two equivalent methods - one by 
nicocca vrtta or manda paridhi and the other by 
eccentric circles. Both the methods give ap- 
proximate mandaphala from which true man- 
daphala is obtained by a geometrical construction. 
It can also be done by continuously varying 


990 . Siddhanta Darpana 


mandaparidhi which makes the orbit completely 
equivalent to ellipse as proved in chapter 5. Here 
this has been done by unequal eccentric ‘circles 
which is a new idea in siddhanta jyotisa. 

Figure 1 (a) and 1 (b) show epicycle (man- 
daparidhi) and eccentric circle methods with fixed 
manda paridhi 


Figure 1¢ » unequal pratimandala 

Fig 1 (c) is of unequal pratimandala described 
here. In all the figures E is centre of earth, UMN 
is kakSa vrtta of sun or moon. U is mandoca and 
N is nica in that circle. Mean planet is moving on 
this circle in anti clockwise (positive) direction, and 

its distance from U is manda kendra. 
- Cis on line EU such that EC is parama manda 
phala at U (mandakendra = 0° or 360°). M is a

position of mean planet. At U position, mean and 
true positions both start from same direction, Ui 
is the true position. In 1(a), true planet is on manda 
circle with centre at M and radius EC, but is moving 
in opposite direction. In (b) and (c), true planet is 
moving in a circle with centre at C in same 
direction. Thus CT; |! EM in (b) and MT; II EC 
and equal. Thus in all figures CEMT; is paral- 
lelogram. 

In l(a) and 1(b) Ti on second circle is the 
approximate true position. T1C meets kaksa vrtta 
at S. If ES meets MT1 extended at Ti then T is 
the true position of planet. This can also be done 
by continuously varying the mandaparidhi, due to 
which path of T becomes an ellipse. If mandaparid- 
hi is r and kakSa radius is R, then change in manda 
radius is TiT. In similar triangles 


_ TT, S and SCE, 
T1 T “CE. or 


r r 7 
or TT = 5 x TS = RX (ET ~ ES) 


Here K = manda karna © 


Thus T gives the correct position of true 
planet, as per changing r. In fig. 1(c), the elliptical 
motion is obtained by increasing the radius of 
pratimandala so that, for mandakendra at Q or Q’, 
at end of Ist and 3rd quadrants, true and mean 
planets are same. Then radius of pratimandala CQ 
is given by 


992 Siddhanta Darpana 

* CQ? = EC? + EQ? = (parama mandaphala)? + 
(Trijya)’ 

Here CT II EM, but CT is slightly bigger then 


EM Hence MT is approximately in direction of EU 
but not exactly parallel to it. 


For moon EC = 300 kala = 5 angula 

CQ = v34382 + 3002 Kala = 57/31 angula 
R = 57/18 angula 

UU; = EU; - EU 

= (EC + CU;) - R 

= 5 + 57/31 - 57/18 = 5/13 angula 

NN, = CN - CN; = CE + EN - CN, 

= 5 + 57/18 - 57/31 = 4/47 angula. 


This explains the varying parama manda 
phalas. 


Similarly we can explain variations in bithba 
and gatiphala also. 
Verse 113-114 : Ucca kaksa 

Manda karna of sun and moon multiplied by 
53 and 23 respectively give their ucca_ karna. 
Accordingly their ucca kakSa should be imagined. 

Notes : For sun, ucca radius (karna) 

= mean distance of sun (manda karna) X 53 

= 76,08, 294 X 53 = 40,32,39,582 yojana. 

Ucca karna of moon = 48,705 X 23 = 11, 20, 
215 yojana 

This has no physical relevance. Ucca of these 


planets move with much slower speed than 
suggested by these orbits. 


Remaining Explainations 993 


Verses 115 : Corections for moon 


There is no logic behind pata of moon and 
three other corrections of its motion. These are 
based only on observed results. 

Notes : Reasons and natures of these correc- 
tions have been explained in chapter 6. Though 
Candragekhara didn’t understand the reasons be- 
hind them, he explained the deviations observed 
by Bhaskara II and himself through these empirical 
equations. He could understand the period of these 
variations and their maximum values. 


Verses 116-129 : Direct and retrograde motions 


As in bahu kakSa yantra (chapter 20), kaksa 
of a planet is made with mean sun at centre and 
earth is kept at centre of mean sun orbit. ‘(116) 

In prati mandala, sighra kendra is given in 
opposite direction. Moiton of sighrocca is much 
more then mean motion of planet. Hence motion 
of sphuta graha is corrected with Sighra phala. 
Similarly mean gati is corrected with Sighra gati 
phala. (117) 

At nica position or near it, budha and sukra 
have more speed than sun and they are between 
sun and earth. Hence they are seen moving in 
reverse direction. (118) 


Again, the planets slower than sun i.e. 
mangala, guru and Sani are seen moving in reverse 
direction, when they are in direction opposite to 
sun, i.e. in 180° position and nearer to earth. (119) 

Now direct and retrograde motions are ex- 
plained in detail with logic. Sun orbit is made in 
proportion to its mean distance from earth. (120) 


994 Siddhanta Darpana 


With scale of 1 angula = 13,000 yojana, mean 
dist. f ig Cees 58 roximatel 
istance of sun is “73099 = approximately. 


Thus radius of sun orbit will be 58 angulas. (121) 


The centre point of this orbit will be earth; 
and mean sun is shown west from that with mean 
sun as centre, a circle of radius 87 angula is made, 
showing mangala orbit (with same scale 1 angula 
= 13,000 yojana). (122) 

Mangala will be kept in eastern point of its 
orbit. A line through earth, sun and mangala is 
drawn and extended to east. (123) 


In east direciton; a star will be assumed at 
big distance. Mangala will be kept close to earth 
in direction of the star. This will be on right side 
of the orbit. Motion will be assumed upward this 
side. (124) 

Then sun at left side will be moved down 
wards with 1 angula daily speed (orbit is 360 angula 
= 360°) is moved same distance with sun, but 
within it mangala is moved upwards with 1/5th 
less speed i.e. 0/48 angulas per day (its linear 
speed). (25) 

Mangala is moving north (0/48) angula, but 
its orbit is moving south by 1 angula. Thus its net 
south movement is 0/12 angula in its orbit. (126) 


Distance of mangala is half the distance of 
sun, hence the retrograde motion will be.24 kala 
for 0/12 angula linear speed. (127) 


When sun and mars are in same direction 
from earth, south motion of mangala will be 107 
sub-divisions of-angula. It is,107 kala in sun orbit 
of 360 angula circumference, hence it is multiplied 


Remaining Explainations 995 


by radius. (58) of sun orbit and divided by distance 
of mars (radius of sun orbit + mars orbit = 58+87 
= 145). (128) 

We get 107 X 58 / 145 = 43 kala as direct 
motion of mars per day for this position. This is 
clearly seen in the above diagram. Similarly we 
can see the direct and retrograde motions of other 
planets also. (129) 


Figure 2 - Direct and retrograde motion 
Notes - E is centre of earth, SPN is orbit of 
sun round earth of radius 57/18 angula (i.e. 34°38’ 
where 1 angula = 1°) Thus 57/18 or 58 approx. 
-angula =.76,08,294 yojana, mean distance of sun. 
Le. 1 angula = 13,000 yojan approx. 
In same scale Mars orbit around S will be of 
87 angulas radius. a oa 
Orbit of mean sun 5S is 360 angula where 1 
angula = 1°. Here the diagrant in fig 2 has been 


996 Siddhanta Darpana 


drawn with 1 cm = 10 angula = 10° = 1,30,000 
yojana. 

When mean sun is at S, mars is at M in its 
orbit PMN. SEM are in.one line towards a. star B. 


When S goes. to S’, orbit of mars goes to P, 
M, N; with centre at S’ all south wards by 1 angula 
(instead' of 1 mm, sun is moved by 4.5 mm for 
clarity of figure). 

Corresponding position of mars is Mi, but 
mars in same anticlockwise movement goes up to 
M2 in its orbit. Average speed of 31 kala in mars 

31. x 87 


bit: =. —————_- = a 
orbi 58 48 kala 


Hence, compared to earth at E mars goes from 
M to M2 where MM? = 1 - 0/48 = 0/12 angula. 


At 58 angula distance at point A it will make 
12 kala angle. But it is at distance 


= SM - SE = 87 - 58 = 29 angula 


ct 58 
Hence angle is 0/12 X 7 0/24 degrees. 


Similarly, when mars is in same direction as 
sun at M3, when:sun is at S’, position M3 shifts 
to My.due to’shift: of orbit. Due to own motion of 
mars, it’ moves. farther south to. Ms. Here M3 My 
' = 1 angula, My. Ms. = 0/48 angula. Distance from 
earth E is: EM;.= ES + SM3 = 58+87 = 145 angula 

Since. the angle. at 58 angula is. MsMs. = 1/48 
(1 angula = 1°): angle x at-145 angula is given by

Verses 130-142 : Sighra and mandagatis 


We take the sun orbit as before (mean sun 
moving in circle around earth of radius 57/18 
angula). Earth is asumed as centre of mars orbit 
also (mean mars). It will be a circle of 109 angula 
radius around earth. (130) 


Sun, earth and mars will be kept in same line 
towards some star of nakSatra orbit. Mean sun is 
sighrocca of mars. Due to its attraction mars will 
be seen at its nica place at 72 angulas west in 
cakradha i.e. 180° away from gighrocca sun. (131) 


Daily motions of sun and mars will be shown 
towards south and north in their orbits as before. 
(132) 

There east motion of mars will be seen 13 
kala from sun i.e. about 1/6th of sun’s attraction 
(72 angulas). (133) 

Mars at nica position will be seen moving 
retrograde from earth. On earth sun line, sighrocca 
and nica are in opposite directions. At one place 
mars will be moving east wards (direct) and at 
nica, it will move towards west. (134) 


Due to attraction of Sighrocca, mangala and 
other planets have Sighra prati vrtta (eccentric). 
Sighra kendra measured from sun as Sighra, proves 
the orbit of planets around mean sun. (135) 


When orbits of mars etc are shown around 
earth as centre, then they are affected by mandocca 
attraction also as in case of moon. (136) 


In absence of mandocca attraction, their 
correction from mean place would have been only 
due to Sighrocca attraction. Then we could get 
correction by multiplying the Sara (deflection) by 


998 . Siddhanta Darpana 


trijya and dividing by 4th karna (true distance). 
(137) 

In the orbit around mean sun, a planet is 
deflected by two attractions - mandocca in its own 
orbit and Sighrocca due to change in sun position 
(sighrocca). (138) 

Thus the movement of planets being corrected 
by sighra and manda both, their orbits around 
mean sun is proved. (139) 


The orbit of 5 star planets is seen centred at. 
sun, hence their direction of manda attraction is 
different from sighra attraction. (140) 


_ Since the 5 star planets move in sun centred 
orbits, their manda sphuta positions are calculated 
at first by half sighra phala of mean planet and 
then half manda phala of corrected planet. (141) 


Then sphuta mandaphala correction is made. 
Then the planets being farther from earth, and to 
see the manda spasta planet in naksatra, fourth 
Sighra phala correciton is made.

mars is also with E as centre but with radius EM 
= 109 angula (= 2.7 cm). Mean sun S, Earth E and 
mean mars M are in one line towards star K. True 
position of mars is seen deflected west from mean 
position-M to true position T where MT = 72 
angulas (1.8 cm). Thus true planet is attracted in 
direction of sun, which can be considered its 
sighrocca. True planet can be considered moving 
on sighraparidhi ATB of radius 72 angulas. 31 kala 
movement at M is in radius 109 angula hence it 
‘is 31 X 109 / 58 parts of angula. Similarly in Sighra 
paridhi of 72 angulas it is 72X31 / 58. Difference 
is. (31/58) (109-72) = (31/58) X 37 

_ As seen from sun at S at distance 58+37: = 
95, it is 31 X 37 / 95'= 13 kala approx. 

_ (2) Manda and. sighra by epicycle method - 
Planets have two fold inequalities (1) inequality of 
apsis or mandocca; and (2) the inequality of apex 
of quick motion or sighrocca. These are mandaphala 
and éighra phala. Sighra phala is elongation of 
‘inferior planet and annual parallax for superior 
planet. 


Figure 4 - Epicyclic method for manda and §ighra parallax of 
superior planets 


1000 Siddhanta Darpana 


Calculation of both is shown by epicyclic 
method in figure 4. ABM is orbit of a planet with 
centre E, the earth. Its radius is called trijya. AEM 
is apseline (ucca nica line) and EC is direction of 
Sighrocca. A is centre of first epicycle of planet 
and UPN epicycle or mandaparidhi. U is its apojee 
or mandocca and N is mandanica or perigee. UA’ 
is radius or manda - antyaphalajya. 

As for sun or moon, when planet on epicycle 
is at P, arc UP = are AA’ (angles are equal). EP 
cuts the orbit at P’ which is position of planet after 
manda correction which is equal to arc A’P’. 


Now with P’ as centre, second epicycle - 
sighra paridhi is drawn whose radius is called 
sighra antyaphala jya. EP’P cuts it at U’ and N’ 
which are Sighrocca and Sighra nica. P’F is drawn 
parallel to EC, then F is position of planet on 
epicycle. EF is joined cutting orbit in P”, which is 
true position of planet. The correction P’P” is‘called 
sighraphala. 

To find P’P”, we draw P’G, P’K and FH 
perpendiculars on EF, EC and EU’ 

Arc P’C is distance between sighrocca and 
corrected planet and is called sighra kendra. 

P’K is Sighra kendra jya and EK, sighra kendra 
kotijya. From similar triangles FP’H and. P’EK

PP’ is applied to planet corrected with mandaphala, 
we get the true planet. 

(3) Epicentric method - In figure 5 (a), APB 
is orbit of mean planet with centre at E, the earth. 
AEP is the apse line (ucca-nica line). EF is taken 
equal to radius. of first epicycle (mandaparidhi). 
With centre at F, another circle A’B/P’ is drawn 
equal to circle ABP. Then A’B’P’ is manda-prati 
vrtta of planet. Let A’ be apogee or mandoca and 
P’ be perigee or manda nica on the eccentric. 


1002 Siddhanta Darpana 


As sun or moon, when mean planet is at M, 
then planet on eccentric is at M1 so that arc AM 
= arc A’M’. EMi cuts the concentric in M2. Then 
M2 is the planet corrected by mandaphala. Correc- ° 
tion i.e. mandaphala is equal to arc MM2 which 
can be found like moon. 


Now from ES, EG is cut off equal to radius 
of sighra paridhi or sighra antya phalajya. With G 
as centre another circle equal to concentric is 
drawn. This is called éighra prativrtta. ES is 
produced to meet it in S’. Then S’ is sighrocca in 
eccentric. M3 is planet in second eccentric such 
that arc S’M3 = arc SM2. If E M3 meets the 
concentric in M4, then M4 is true position of planet. 
Sighra phala is arc M2Ma. 

To find the arc M2M4, this part of the diagram 
is drawn separately in figure 5(b).

Now M3M2 = GE = Sighra antya phalajya. 
Arc SM2 is angle between Sighrocca and once 
corrected planet and SM = Sighra kendra. 

Thus its’ jya EH is sighra kendrajya and M2

Verses 143-146 - Revised methods 


Thus the tara grahas are made true by half 
Sighra phala, half. mandaphala, mandaphala and 
Sighra phala. But in case of mangala budha and 
Sani, some errors were noticed. For correcting that 
error, (143) 

I have done -parocca sanskara in these correc- 
tions. The corrections in moon like tungantara etc 
also should all be considered on the authority of 
sages. (144) 

To find the observed positions of planets, 
’ whatever corrections are made to traditional values, 
all are called bija samskara. (145) 


(From Varttika) Good astronomers have done 
bija corrections to planet positions found as per 
texts. From these corrected planets only, tithi, 
eclipse etc are decided and good or bad results are 
told. (146) 


Verse 147-151 : Manda and sighra according 
to Bhaskara (Siddhanta Siromani). Manda sphuta 
planet moves in manda prativrtta and sphuta 
moves in Siighra .prativrtta. Hence manda sphuta 
planet should be considered mean planet before 
doing sighra corrections. (147) 


The planets are moving. in their -prativrtta 
(eccentric), then their position in nakSatra orbit is 


Remaining Explainations 1005 


the sphuta (true) planet at that time. To know the 
position of this true planet, ancient scholars have 
assumed ucca. (148) 


The point on eccentric farthest from earth is 
called ucca. Since this position also is moving, 
scientists have calculated its motion also. (149) 


At 6 rasi from ucca, the point of eccentric 
nearest to earth is called nica. At these positions, 
mean and true planets are in same line with earth, 
hence mean and true planets are same and there 
is no bhujaphala. (150) 


Planet is farthest at ucca position, hence it 
looks smallest there. At nica it is nearest and looks 
largest. (151) 


Verse 152 : Ecliptic direction 


From shadow of sanku, observation through 
instruments and ayana considerations, I have found 
fhe diffenence between maximum north and south 
kranti to be 47° only. Hence, I have asumed 23°30’ 
maximum kranti instead of 24° assumed in old 
texts. 


Verses 153-163 - Nati and larhbana 


- Lunar eclipse has already been explained fully 
(in chapter 8). Now reason of lambana and its 
variation is being explained. (153) 

When moon and sun are 6 rasi from each 
other and their degrees minutes etc are equal, then, 
if its Sara is less than manaikyardha (sum of 
semidiameters of. covered and coverer - earth 
shadow) - - - (154): 

...earth shadow covers disc of moon. Thus 
moon and: shadow of earth both are in same orbit 


1006 Siddhanta Darpana 


(moon’s orbit). Hence there is no nati on lambana 
between them - they will be seen together from 
all directions. (155) 


In solar eclipse sun is covered and moon is 
coverer - both are not in same place (i.e. sun is 
not in moon orbit). Due to their positions far from 
each other, their angular separation varies and only 
in that line they are seen together. This is reason 
of lambana or nati. (56) 


Drg mandala has centre at earth’s centre. 
Hence on earth’s surface, a planet in drg mandala 
is seen in lesser than half area of drg mandala by 
radius of earth. (157) 


When at the end of amavasya (sun and moon 
in same direction), sun is on east horizon, then 
from earth centre, sun and moon are in one line. 
(158) 


But from earth’s ‘surface, moon is seen lower. 
Its deviation is maximum as it is in perpendicular 
direction to sun’s direction. Hence, this apparent 
deviation is parama lambana or nati (maximum 
parallax). (159) 

When planet is in zenith, it is seen in same 
line from earth’s centre or surface. Hence, there is 
no nati. At any other place between zenith and 
horizon, the difference between direction of planet 
seen from surface and direction from centre is 
called nati. (160) 

When sun is in zenith, drg mandala will be 
ecliptic, hence there will be no nati. Maximum 
lambana will be at horizon. (161) 


When a planet is in drkkSepa vrtta (north 
south direction) the deviation is called nati. It is 


Remaining Explainations 1007 


always less than parama lambana (as planet is never 
on south point of horizon). Hence, in drk-mandala 
and ecliptic... (162) 

if there is difference of kranti of sun and 
moon, their east west difference also increases. At 
zenith, ecliptic and drkmandala are same, hence 
there is no nati or larnbana. (163) 


Verses 164-173 : Vitribha lagna 


Perpendicular to ecliptic at tribhona lagna (i.e. 
lagna - 90°) passes through zenith. At mid day 
also, moon is away from ecliptic at distance of its 
Sara. (164) 

Hence due to lambana, moon doesn’t remain 
in same line with sun at end of amavasya 
(moon-sun=0"). Hence, vitribha lagna is needed to 
calculate lambana or nati. (165) 

Natyajya of vitribha is in meridian line. If 
vitribha is inclined towards east or west from 
meridian, it increases. (166) 

Natarnéa of vitribha is in its drk mandala 
which is great circle through kadamba (pole of 
ecliptic), and always perpendicular to ecliptic. 
Natyajya of vitribha thus increases in proportion 
to its kranti (distance from equator). (167) 

When north kranti of vitribha is equal to north 
latitude of a place, then at the tifne of rising of 
sayana mesa 0°.... (168) 


... Madhya lagna (ecliptic point at meridian) 
and vitribha lagna are same. They are different 
otherwise. The jya of difference between vitribha 
and madhyalagna natamfa.... (169) 


1008 Siddhanta Darpana 


...iS considered as Sara (north south distance) 
between them. At Sara distance from ecliptic, moon 
has sphuta (changed) zenith angle. (170) 


Hence to find correct drkksepa (north south 
distance from zenith), sum or difference of Sara 
and akséaméa is taken and it is further corrected 
with kranti of vitribha. (171) 

When sphuta parvanta (sun - moon = 0° or 
180°) is corrected with lambana, moon and sun are 
exactly in north south circle as seen from surface 
of earth. (172) 


With increase in kranti of tribhona lagna, 
change in grasa and sparSa time of eclipse due to 
Sara of moon will increase. (173) 


Notes : This has already been explaiend in 
chapter 9 on solar eclipse. 


Verses 174-189 : Eclipse duration through 
diagram. 


In diagram of eclipse (chapter 10), the 
‘chadaka’ (coverer) will be moved on grahaka path 
as explained earlier. Then duration of eclipse will 
become clear. (174) 


_ When at the time of sphuta amanta (sun-moon 
= 0°), sayana mesa 0° is rising, then this itself will 
be mid time of eclipse. No addition or substraction 
will be needed. (175) 


This is because lagna will not have kranti then 
(séyana mesa 0° is at equator). At other times, 
mean amanta time will be different from sphuta 
amanta. When mesa 0° is rising, sparsa and moksa 
times also will remain same. Their mean times need 
correction for kranti of lagna and direction of Sara. 
(176) 


Remaining Explainations 1009 


When moon is on horizon, its distance is same 
from earth’s furface and earth’s centre. (177) 


As moon rises above horizon, its distance from 
earth surface gets smaller compared to distance 
from earth center. Hence, apparent diameter of 
moon (angular) increases and its shadow cone 
(Sanku means cone here, not gnomon) becomes 
wider. (178) 

As sun and moon are in different orbits, the 
shadow cones will be bigger on earth surface and 
the time of eclipse and total covering will increase. 
(179) 

In lunar eclipse, covered planet (moon) and 
coverer (earth shadow) both are in one orbit, hence 
even with increase in Sanku, time of eclipse and 
maximum covering doesn’t increase on being 
viewed from surface. (180) 

At the end of purnima, moon motion in 
vimandala is oblique to ecliptic. (It is more oblique 
for relative motion of moon). Hence motion of Sara 
also is oblique (inclined to perpendicular to 
ecliptic.) Oblique speed is 1/12 of Sara. (181) 


Hence the time of sparSa, mid eclipse etc. will 
before or after the calculated time by the time 
arising out of 1/12th of sara. (182) 


(In lunar eclipse), Sara of covered moon is in 
different direction from coverer (earth shadow). 
Hence direction of eclipse and Sara are different. 
(183) 


In solar eclipse, moon is coverer whose sara 
is in direciton of coverer. Hence eclipse and sara 
_are in same direction. (184) 


1010 Siddhanta Darpana 


In both eclipses, only moon has valana (due 
to its Sara). Hence in lunar eclipse, at the time of 
contact (sparsa) true valana will be given in its 
own direction from east point. (185) 


At the time of mokSa, it will be given in 
opposite direciton from west point. In solar eclipse, 
moka is in east, hence valana at mokSa time will 
be in its own direction and at sparsa time in 
opposite direction from west point. (186) 


At equator, planet is in its own direction at 
time of rising, midday or setting. At other places 
valana due to akSam§a occurs. (187) 


As the disc of planet appears shifted towards 
pole, the eastern point bends towards north. (188) 


The disc in west sky is deviated towards 
south. Since disc direction is changed due to aka 
valana, the true ayana valana is changed. (189) 


Verses 190-192 : Ayana valana 


(Siddhanta Siromani) Yasti is square root of 
the difference of squares of trijya and ayana valana 
jya. Yasti is multiplied by Sara (latudude) of planet 
(moon) and divided by trijya to give Sara for kranti 
correction. Otherwise 3 raSis are added to graha 
and its bhujajya is found. That is multiplied by 
§ara and divided by trijya to give the Sara for 
kranti. (190) 

In this, Bhaskaracarya has taken Sara along 
dhruva prota less than kadamba prota which cannot 
be proper for ayana karma. (191) 

After ayana drkkarma, graha, nakSatra and 
their conjunctions are in dhruva prota line. After 
drkkarma correction, the planet in kranti vrtta is 
called bhuja. (192) 


Remaining Explatnations 1011 


Mean Sara in kadamba prota and koti of Sara— 
squares of both are added and their square root 
is karna. This will be the sphuta Sara in curection 
of dhruva. This karna will be greater than Sara (in 
kadamba direction). (193) 

Notes : These formula have already been 
discussed. Dhruva prota Sara has been ap- 
proximately considered equal to kadamba prota 
§ara, which is not strictly correct (See chapter 8). 


Verses 194-196 : Rising of planets at poles 

There is night for six months in meru (polar 
region). Moon and other planets rise and set there 
(north pole) when they are in north kranti. (194) 

When planets are within two rasis of sun, 
their heliacal rising and setting will be considered. 
(195) 

When the difference in kranti of sun and 
another planet is equal to the kalarmSa for rising 
and setting, their rising setting will start. (106) 

Verse 197 : As the north aksamSa increase, 
kranti vrtta will be more inclined towards south, 
from drk mandala of moon. Hence, north horn of 
moon will be upper. (197) 


Verse 198 - Vaidhrti and vyatipata are called 
mahapata. Even when there is big difference in 
orbits of sun and moon, their rays meet due to 
equal kranti. 


Verses 199-206 - Importance of star circle 


A straight line from centre of earth to moon 
and other planets crosses kranti vrtta and goes 
upto stars circle. (199) 


1012 Siddhanta Darpana 


This line is called ‘bhagana’ line (revolution 
is measured from its point of intersection with 
nakSatra circle). Calculation of planets starts from 
bhagana only. Hence this line is very useful to the 
world. All seasons occur due to sun and there is 
development of moving and non-moving beings 
(200) 

Sun removes darkness also, thus it has many 
virtues. Similarly moon has many virtues like 
‘ahlad’ (happines) (201) 

From work (result) we know the reason 
(origin). Similarly people compare the terrible and 
comfortable qualities of the creator by seeing sun 
and moon. (202) 

(In astrology), we know about results of deeds 
in past life from position of planets. (203) 

From motion of planets; we also know about 
length of orbit and their linear diameters. From 
their Sara, we know that earth is fixed, (204) 

From star circle, we can imagine the great job 
done by the Creator. It also gives some light. (205) 

Sailors know direction from stars and do not 
lose their way. Thus star circle (bha-cakra) is very 
useful to people. (206) 


Verses 207-213 : Reason of seasons 

Time has three main indicators - summer 
(hot), rains and cold. Each has two parts, thus 
making six seasons. (207) 

In Bharata varsa (India) all six seasons have 
their full duration. With change of place, the effect 
of seasons vary. (208) 


Remaining Explainations 1013 


First half of hot season is vasanta (spring) 
which is pleasant. Second half is very hot. First 
half of rains is varsa (rainy season) and second 
half is Sarat (autumn). (209) 


First and second halves of cold season are 
‘hemanta’ (winter) and Sisira (cold winter). Due to 
change of place (akSamSa) and change in kranti of 
sun, seasons change. (210) 


When sun rays fall oblique on earth, heat is 
reduced and cold increases. (211) 


Where sun rays fall perpendicular, heat is 
more and it starts summer. (212) 


In summer, straight rays: of sun, evaporate 
the water of oceans. The vapour goes up and cools. 
Then due to attraction of earth, it falls. Hence rains 
start after summer. (213) 


Verses 214-224 - Season zones 


Region from equator to 8° latitude is very hot 
and hence there is no hemanta or Sisira there. 
Summer and rains are more (214). After rains it is 
Sarat. In beginning of summer, it is spring. Between 
sarat and spring, there is mild cold due to heavy 
rains, (215) 

From 8° to 16° latitude, cold (Sita) is for two 
months pausa and magha (Dec. January) only and 
in remaining ten months there are 4 seasons only. 
(216) 

From latitude 16-24° (most part of India), cold 
is for four months from méargasira (around 15th 
November) and in remaining eight months starting 
with caitra (about 15th March) there are 4 seasons. 


1014 Siddhanta Darpana 


Upto 24° aksam$a (from equator), it is tropics. 
At 24° latitude, all six seasons are of 2 months 
each. Region from 24° to 40° latitude is called sama 
mandala (sub-tropical) (218) 

From 24 to 32° latitude, it is cold for six 
months starting with karttika (15th Oct.). Remain- 
ing six months are hot and have other 4 seasons. 
(219) 

From 32° to 40° latitude, it is cold for eight 
months starting from asvina (15th Sept.). Remain- 
ing 4 seasons are in 4 months starting with Jyestha. 
(220) 

From 40 to 50° latitude, it is temperate region 
(cold area). From 40 to 48° latitude, it is cold for 
the months from bhadrapada (15th August) and 
for very short period of two months other seasons 
come. Thus the season zones change from equator 
at intervals of 8° latitude each. (221-222) 


From 48° north to meru (90° north) - 42° 
latitude zone is mostly covered with ice. This is 
for north hemispehre. In south hemisphere, also 
there are similar zones, but seasons are correspond- 
ing to opposite raSis. (223) 

For counting of seasons, we should count the 
months from vaisakha when sayana sun enters 
mesa. (224) 

Verses 225-231 : In spring time, forest land 
is covered with fall of dry leaves. Due to friction 
among bamboos, the spark ignites dry leaves and 
whole forest burns. (225) 

Due to that, dense black smoke rises upwards 
with hot surface air. This layer of smoke covers 
the sky and hangs in air. (226) 


Remaining Explainations 1015 


In summer season, due to hot sun rays, water 
from oceans is evaporated and goes up. This mixes 
with smoke and forms cloud. Thus cloud contains 
smoke, water, air and lightning. (227) 


As an elephant draws water with its trunk, 
or a man in his cloth bag, similarly sun also draws 
up ocean water through its rays and mixes it with 
clouds. Thus cloud looks dense and heavy. (228) 


Clouds are situated 1/4 to 1/2 kosa high from 
surface and are attracted by earth. When they 
become heavy, are not distant from surface, they 
fall in form of water. (229) 


Fate in controlled by the creator, who acts 
through time and place. Same fate gets rains from 
clouds. Varahamihira has written about clouds, 
thunder and lighting. This is not discussed here. 
(230) 

Ocean contains salt water, but due to sun 
rays, only small particles of water evaporate and 
rise. Salt particles do not rise. Hence rain water is 
sweet. Now I describe some patiganita (arithmetics) 
for recreation. (231) 


Verses 232-239 - Cube root method 


Product of three equal numbers is called cube 
(ghana). To find the root of this cube, formula is 
being stated. We give a point at the last digit 
towards right (unit place). Then on fourth digit 
from unit, another point is given. (232) 


Thus points are given on every fourth digit 
towards left. The number before left end dot up 
to left end is taken. From that, we substract the 
maximum possible cube root. The number, whose 


1016 Siddhanta Darpana 


cube was deducted, is treated as labdhi (quotient). 
(233) 

To find second labdhi, first labdhi is squared 
and multiplied by 300. Result is kept separately. 
(234) 

By that we divide the number remaining upto 
second point from left. Result is taken as second 
labdhi. (235) 

If labdhi is more than 9, it is taken as 9 only. 
Below the result kept separately, we write the result 
found by multiplying square of second labdhi, with 
first labdhi and 30. (236) 


Below it we write cube of second labdhi. Sum 
of these three digits is substracted from dividend. 
If remainder is very small, second labdhi is reduced 
by one and again the three numbers are written 
one below the other. (237) 


Sum of these three digits is substracted from 
dividend. Digits till next (third) point are joined 
with the remainder. The two labdhi numbers 
obtained so far, are treated as first labdhi. From 
that, we find next labdhi as before, and sum of 3 
numbers is substracted from dividend. This process 
is continued till digits remain in dividend. This 
labdhi is cube root. (238) 

Cube root has same number of digits, as there 
are points on the cube. When cube is less than 
1000, its cube root is of single digit and found in 
one step without above process. (239) 


Verses 240-242 - Method for cube 


These are stated by Bhaskaracarya II in 
Lilavati. Product of three equal numbers is called 


Remaining Explainations 1017 


ghana (cube) (second method). Cube of last digit 
is written of number whose cube is to be found. 
Then square of last digit is multiplied by 3 and 
by the remaining digits. Then the square of 
remaining digits is multiplied by 3 and last digit. 
Then cube of remaining digits. (240) 

These three numbers are written one below 
other and shifting them to one place left. Their 
sum will be cube of whole number. 

(Third method) The number is divided into 
two parts and same method is used. (241) 

Fourth method : The number whose cube is 
to be found is divided into sum of two parts. Three 
times the number is multiplied by both parts. To 
that, we add cubes of both parts. Result is cube 
of the number. 

Fifth method : If cube of a square number is 
to be found, then cube of its square root is found. 
_ Then we find square of the result. (242) 

Verses 243-244 : Two verses about cube root 
(Lilavati) (Same method is given by Aryabhata). 

(1) Unit place is called ‘ghana’, 10 place is 
‘first aghana’ and 107 place the ‘second aghana’. 
We take groups of 3 digits starting from night. 
(ghana is marked with sign (I) and aghana places 
with other marked with - ) 

(2) Greatest possible cube is substracted from 
last ghana place. 

(3) Second aghana place (right to last ghana 
place) is divided by thrice the square of cube root 
already obtained in (2) (243) 


1018 Siddhanta Darpana 


(4) From first aghana place (right to second 
aghana place) substract square of quotient multi- 
plied by 3 times previous cube root. 

(5) From the ghana place (right of first aghana 
place) we substract the cube of quotient. 

(6) The process is repeated till all digits are 
exhausted.

2 = 3 X 10’.a* b. To find b we have to divide it 
by 3 X 10? a® = 300a? 

We may ommit two digits to right at this 
step. Taking 2nd aghana only, the digits are 3a*b 
only. So in Aryabhata method this is divided by 
3a? only. However, the remaining numbers also, 


1020 Siddhanta Darpana 


are multiplies of b and if we don’t have sufficient 
remainder equal to those multiples, cube of result 
will be more than given number. Hence b is 
_ reduced by 1. 


Thus the remainder is equal to (300a* b + 30 
ab*+b*) or in decimal notation 3a*b at second 
aghana, 3 ab® at Ist aghana and b® at ghana as 
recommended by Aryabhata.

Verses 245-248 - Cube root of component num- 
bers 


To find the cube root of a number expressed 
in two components (of degree or minute or other 
sexagesimal components), we substract the maxi- 
mum cube from first components (degrees), cube 
of the first root is substracted from cube of next 
higher integer. Result -is called ‘antya-hara’ or 
divisor. (245) 

If root of first component is more than 30, 
then remainder of first components is multiplied 
by 60 and added to second component. Sum will 
be divided by antya hara (divisor) to get the 
minute component of the cube root. (246) 

If root of first components is less than 30, 
then we correct the divisor by ‘gunya’ and ‘guraka’ 
(first and second factors). From divisor we substract 


1022 Siddhanta Darpana 


the remainder of first component to get gunya. 
Gunaka is found by dividing the divisor (antya 
hara) by first component of root increased by one, 
(247) 

Gunya and gunaka are multiplied together 
and divided by antya hara. Result is substracted 
from antya hara to get sphuta antya hara (correct 
divisor). Remainder of first components is multi- 
plied by 60 and added with second component as 
before. Sum is divided by revised divisor to get 
the second component of cube root in minutes. 


Note : (1) Examples will clarify the method. 
First we take a number bigger than 30 degrees say 


(32° 20')° = 33,802° 42° approx. 


33,802° 42’ (32° 19 6

30 x 3x 2° = 360

33° - 32° = 3169

Thus the root 32° 19 .6 is approximately 
correct. accuracy will increase if root is much bigger 
than 30°

Thus the answer is 2° 20’.1 which is ap-

(2) Proof of the formula : The formula for 
approximate roots is based on linear interpolation. 
Correction of divisor is based on second order 
interpolation. This is based on concept of differen- 
tial coefficient which is proportional to rate of 
change of dependant variable (Rolle’s therem in

Differential calculus). Second order correction is 
based on Taylor’s theorem upto second differential. 

. We consider variation of function y = x in 
figure 6. Point P is the cube of x= a, ie. y 
coordinate is a*. The next cube is (a+1)? at point 
Q. Real value lies between a and at+1 which may 
be written as a+b where b is less than 1

Verses 249-252 - Conclusion and end 


Method to find square. root has already been 
stated. Method for cube root has been stated, 
because it is needed in calculations. These methods 
have been stated in a general way. Other techni- 
ques can be known by scholars by themselves (from 
other books on mathematics). (249) 


(Siddhanta Siromani) : Due to fear of bulk, I 
give only a little bit of logic and proceed. Intelligent 
men will understand from that only. The subject 
can be understood only by knowledge of gola 
(spherics). (250) 

Yogis win over their enemies like moha 
(illusion), krodha (anger) and kama (desires) etc. 
for control over mana (mind), prana (life force or 
breath). With that they are free from five troubles 
like vidya (informaiton), asmita (pride), anuraga 
(result of raga - obsession), dvesa (enemity) and 
abhinivesa (fixation). Even then yogis are unable 
to see the supreme truth even for a moment. That 
supreme truth or realisation is given by Lord 
Jagannatha very easily to his devotees. May that 
Lord free us from our troubles. (251) 

Thus ends the twenty-first chapter in 
siddhanta darpana describing rationale of 
astronomy, written as a text book and accurate 
calculations by Sri Candrasekhara, born in a famous 
royal family of Orissa. (252) 


Chapter - 22 
SAMVATSARAS 


Kaladhikara - Samvatsaras etc. 


Verse 1 - Scope : Lord Krsna is Kala (time 
or death) himself and the rod of death god merges 
into him. He is shjning like blue lotus. His feet 
‘are worshipped by Siva who is subject of Parvati’s 
plays. He is in form of Jagannatha at Nilacala. He 
controlled the tyrant Kaliya but took mercy on him 
after hearing weeping of women. After worship- 
ping him I start Kaladhikara. 

Notes : This is the fifth part (adhikara), 
describing time (kala). This starts with chapter 22 
which describes units of time like sarnvatsara 

- (different types of years). 


Verses 2-15 - Kala as god. 

Kala is of two types - ‘nitya’ (eternal) and 
‘janya’ (changing) Eternal Kala is god himself. God 
is eternal hence his other name is kala. (2) 

Since god measures time (through periodic 
events), he is ‘janyg’ kala also. Hence for welfare, 
people remember god before starting all works. (3) 

(Karma purana) God is without. beginning and 
end. he doesn’t diminish. He is within every point 
and beyond every thing. He is great lord, all 
pervading, independent and soul of everybody. (4) 


Samvatsaras 1027 


Kala itself is the supereme Brahma, Vasudeo and 
Sankara. World is created by Kala only, and is 
destroyed by that. (5) 

(Smrti) At every place and in every event, 
god only is the lord. He is in all forms and without 
beginning. May he increase my happiness (6). | 
pray Acyuta (indestructible) by whose memory, all 
defects are destroyed in tapa (penance), yajana 
(worship) etc. 


If Supreme lord is without form, how he can 
be imagined? Answering this, yoga vasistha has 
stated about his appearing in human body, which 
is being quoted here. (8) 

(Vasistha Ramayana) Kala is of two types 
-nitya (eternal) and janya (created or changing). 
First (nitya) kala is supreme lord himself. He cannot 
be imagined by speech or mind. But to grace the 
devotees he takes body (9) God holds sword 
(khadga) and noose (pa$a) and is adorned with 
armour (kavaca) and rings (kundala). He has 6 
mouths in form of six seasons (10). Valour of his 
12 hands are 12 months. He is attended by persons 
in his own form. (11) 


Lord of LakSmi (wealth goddess) is thus a 
form of kala but takes various forms for the sake 
of devotees. Hence, devotees meditate on any of 
his forms, according to their desire. (12) 

From god as eternal time, the other type of 
changing time has also been created. This is told 
in vedas and by Svayambhuva manu also (in 
Manusmrti) (13) 


1028 Siddhanta Darpana 


(Manusmrti) God as form of time for the 
purpose of creation, has created divisions of time, 
nakSatra, planets and this world. (14) 


In hora skandha (Brhat-samhita of 
Varahamihira), Sun has been called soul of kala. 
It is not correct to interprate this as opposite to 
siddhanta version. (15) 


Verses 16-24 - Time units from sun and moon 


Sun is origin of creation and in that sense, 
he is epitom of kala. Main division of time from 
truti till prdlaya is year. Components of year are 
- ayana, month, pakSa and day etc. Another name 
of year is sarnvatsara. (16-17) 


Sun moves northward for 3 seasons (6 
months) and then moves south wards for other 3 
seasons. These periods are called ‘ayana’. This is 
according to kranti motion, ‘ay’ verb means ‘to 
move’. (18) 

In two months period when aSoka tree has 
special signs like flowers etc, first season vasanta 
(spring) occurs. (19) 

The time, which is measured is called masa 
(month, masa = to measure). The time, which 
measures changes in moon phase is called lunar 
month. Measure of sun’s passage in one ra&i is 
called solar month. (20) 

Periods 30 civil days and 30 sidereal days are 
called civil (Savana) month and nakSatra (sidereal) 
month respectively. (21) 


Periods of increasing or decreasing phase of 
moon are called Sukla pakSa (bright half) and krsna 


Samvatsaras 1029 


pak&a respectively. These pakSas are used for pitr 
functions. (22) 


Measure of fractional increase of decrease of 
moon’s phase is indicated by tithi. (23) 

Similarly time has other divisions like ‘yama’ 
muhtrtta etc. Due to lack of space derivation of 
all have not been stated. (24) 


Verses 25-26 - Nine fold divison 

Time -is divided in nine ways - Candra, 
nakSatra, savana, barhaspatya, saura, manava, 
paitra, daiva and brahma. (25) 

Among these, only the first five are used by 
human beings. Others starting with manava are 
used in their context only. (26) 


Verses 27-34 - Candra divisions 


Movement of moon 12° ahead of sun as 
measured from earth’s centre is called candra mana 
(tithi). (27) 

When difference between moon and sun 
becomes one full revolution, it is called candra 
masa (lunar month). Half the lunar month is called 
pakSa. 1/15" part of pakéa is tithi and half of tithi 
is called karana. (28) 

Extra‘ or lapsed tithi or month, fast, festivals, 
and sacred ceremonies, auspicious or bad times, 
and rites for deceased - all are decided according 
to candra mana (tithi) only. (29) 

Months (lunar) are named according to the 
_Names of nakSatras joined by moon on pirnima 
of that month. Similarly, at start of jovian year 
(Barhaspatya year), the nakSatra in which jupiter 
enters, is name of that jovian year, acording to 


1030 Siddhanta Darpana 


surya siddhanta. But due to fear of lengthening, 
all details are not described. (30-31) 


Krttika and rohini, both nakSatra can be 
assumed Krttika and due to conjunction with any 
of them at pirnima, month is named Karttika. (32) 


Then we could as well tell the karttika and 
margagirsa months as rohini and bharani respec- 
tively, when moon joins their neighbouring 
nakSatras bharani and rohini at purnima. (33) 

Due to this difficulty, karttika and margaSirsa 
etc. are counted as per the old tradition (without 
frequent changing of names. The said conjunction 
at purnima also occurs frequently. (34) 


Verses 35-36 - NakéSatra time 


Time taken by nakSatra in one complete 
revolution in west direction is called 1 nakéatra 
day. Ghati and pala are subdivisions of this time 
only (60 divisions at each step). Life period of 
Brahma also is as per this time only. (35) 


Life in nakSatra units is multiplied by kalpa 
solar days (15,52,00,00,00,000) and divided by kalpa 
nakSatra days (15,82,23,78,28,28,000) to get sphuta 
solar years etc. (36) 


Verses 37-46 - Solar time 


As stated before, period between one rising 
time of a graha or nakSatra to its next rising time 
is called its savana dina. (37) 


Still for calculation of mean planet, period 
taken by mean sun in crossing (21,600) kala i.e. 
one revolution with respect to earth, is called 
savana dina whose value is (21,659/8) asu. (38) 


Sarnvatsaras 1031 


Difference between two sphuta sun rises is 
sphuta savana dina. Generally this is used as a 
savana dina. According to this savana dina only, 
yajna, purification, counting of days, lords of year 
and month etc are decided. (39) 

According to Jovian years, sarnvatsaras start- 
ing with prabhava, lost years, extra years, years 
stated in svara Sastra and hora etc are counted. 
This is described in Brhatsamhita. (40) 


The time taken by sun to move 1° is called 
1 solar day. 30 such days make one solar month 
12 solar months make one solar year. (41) 


According to solar months, we observe 
sankranti, ayana, seasons etc. Day and night of 
deva and asura, yuga and manvantara etc are 
counted by solar time only. (42) 


In some places, marriage, festivals, sacred 
thread ceremony, house construction etc are done 
by solar time also. (43) 

(Strya siddhanta) From tula beginning to 86°, 
movement of sun is called “sadasiti mukha’ period 
(i.e. eighty six day period). There are 4 such 
periods in a year. This ends with duplicate rasis 
only (3,6,9,12 ragis). (44) 

When sun enters 27° of dhanu, 23° of mina, 
19° of mithuna and 15° of kanya, the periods 
ending with that are called Sadasiti mukha as they 
come after intervals of 86° each (i.e. 86 solar days). 
(45-46) 

Notes : These are periods of 86 solar days 
each, which are slightly bigger than civil days. 
They are unequal depending on speed of sun. 
Solar days frorn 15° of kanya to tula 0° ie. 16 


1032 Siddhanta Darpana 


solar days are out of these 4 periods. 4 divisions 
of year approximately correspond ot equinox and 
solstice days but reason for deducting 4 solar days 
from each is not understood. 


Verses 47-60 : Sankrantis - 


Entry of sun in two movable (cara) raSis at 
beginning of odd quadrants - i.e. mesa and tula 
are called visuva sankranti. Entry of sun in two 
cara raSis at beginning of even quadrants (karka 
and makara) are called south and north ayana 
sankrantis. (47) 

Entry of sun in 4 rasis between moving and 
double (i.e. 4 fixed raSis) - vrscika, kumbha, vrsa 
and sirnha is called visnupadi sankranti. (48) 

Last point of a ragi is beginning point of next 
rasi. When disc of sun touches that point, sankranti 
(crossing over from one rasi to next) starts. From 
beginning of sankranti till the end, when last point 
of sun’s disc is in contact with border point, it 
takes 33 dandas (as diameter of sun is 33 kala). 
Hence 33 danda is the sacred period of sankranti. 
(49) 

In ten sankrantis, the whole sankranti period 
of 33 danda from beginning to end is sacred period. 
In dakSinayana (karka) samkranti, last 16/30 dandas 
(2nd half) and in uttarayana (makara) sanskranti 
first half of 16/30 danda are sacred. (50) 

Sankranti is the period when parts of sun 
disc are in both the rasis. When sankranti falls in 
day time, bath, charities etc are done. (51) 

When sankranti falls in first half of night, 2nd 
half of previous day is observed. When it (mid 


Samvatsaras 1033 


point) falls is second half of night, then first half 
of next day is observed as sankranti day. (52) 


When sankranti falls exactly at mid night, the. 
day on which its greater portion falls (when sun 
is slower) is observed as sankranti. This is not 
considered in ayana sankranti. (53) 


South or karka ayana, falling in night makes 
second half of previous day as sankranti. North 
or makara sankranti falling in night makes the first 
half of next day as sacred. (54) 

When sankranti is in day time, whole day is 
sacred. Though this is smartta view, the period 
near sankranti is definitely very fruitful. (55) 

As sankranti is a sacred day, above good 
works are prescribed but non-vegetarian food is 
prohibited. Restriction of non veg food is from 30 
danda before sankranti' and upto 30 dandas after 
it, ie. for total of 60 dandas. (56) 


Last degree of a raéi is masanta and first 
degree is called niramSa. When ‘sun is in two 
degrees, it is masanta or niramsa kala. In this 
period auspicious works like journey, marriage 
should not be done. (57) 

Sankranti (crossing) period of centre of sun 
(purusa) is thousandth part of a truti. It is not 
possible for human beings to know this. (58) 

(Surya siddhanta) Two equinoxes (visuva 
samkranti) and two ayana sankrdantis (solstice) are 
‘nabhi’ i.e. dividing points of ecliptic - hence they 
are very important, sdyana karka and makara also 
are equidistant from equator, as séyana mesa and 
sayana tula are equidistant from meru. (59) 


1034 Siddhanta Darpana 


From north ayana (i.e. makara sayana 
sankrantis) there are 3 seasons starting with Sita 
for two months each similarly from sayana karka 
sankranti (south ayana) 3 seasons starting with 
varsa (rains) 2 months each. (60) 


Verses 61-70 - Measure of different years 


Number of mean savana days in five types 
of years is being stated according to mean sun 
motion. (61) 


Candra varsa 354/22 days 
NakSatra varsa 359/1 days 
Savana varsa 360/0. days 
Barhaspatya varsa 361/15 days 


Saura (solar) varsa 365/15/31/31/24 days 

12 lunar revolutions 327/52 days (62-65) 

Manus starting with svayambhuva, rule for 
their periods called manu (or manvantara). For 
that, there is no separate count of days, months 
etc. (66) 

One lunar month is day night of pitars. 360 
such days (i.e. 360 lunar months) constitute a pitar 
year. There are (10,631) savana days in a pitr varsa. 
(67) 

Time scale for deva and asuras is same, but 
their day and night are in reverse order. When 
one has day time (for 6 months), the other will 
have night. (68) 


360 daiva (or asura) days i.e. 360 solar years 


make divya varsa, which contains (1,31,493/9) 
savana ,days. (69) 


Sarhvatsaras : 1035 


In one. year of Brahma there are 
(31,10,40,00,00,00,000) solar years (43,20,000 years 
of yuga X1000 yuga in a kalpa X 720 day nights 
in a year) Day of Brahma (kalpa) has sa been 
described. (70) 


Verses 71-74 - Other opinions 

Harivamga purana has given different value 
of manu which cannot be derived from solar 
motion. That is mentioned here out of respect for 
declaration of sages. (71) 

(HarivamSa purana) 10 divya varsa make one 
day-night of manu. 10 day-night of manu make 1 
pakSa. (72) 

10 .manu pakSas are 1 manu month end 12 
manu months is one manu season - as stated by | 
_ seers who know the truth. (73) 
For vaidika and smartta functions there are 
‘many types of time scales. This arrangement of 
time has been discussed in smrtis. Hence proper 
time for marriage etc are not being discussed here. 
(74) 

' Notes : Manvantara of Harivamésa 
Manu year = 10 seasons (suppose)

Verses 75-76 : Moon motion 


According to motion of moon, ocean water 
rises. Hence waters of Ganga and other rivers also 
must be rising. But this doesn’t appear reasonable, 
hence it is not being described. (75) 


Hemisphere of moon facing sun is lighted 
with sun rays and opposite part remains in shadow. 
In front of half shadow, people on earth see, that 
phase of moon (bright portion). This increases as 
moon moves away -from sun. In other direction 
when moon approaches sun, its phases decreases. 
Do the pitars living on moon see the west ward 
motion of sun for a month ? (76) 


Note : It is held that soles of deceased (pitars) 
live on moon surface opposite to earth. For them 
sun will rise in east and set in west after 15 days. 


Verses 76-77 - End

Before closing this book, I, will describe many

that basis. (2)

Verses 4-13 - Tithi, naksatra and yoga 

When sun is in odd quadrants from mandoc- 
ca, savana dinas in an year will be 358/18/16. In 
this period, there would be exactly 364 tithis. (4) 

In 358/13/3 savana dinas there are 354 nakéatra 
dinas. Hence manda kendra from sun is not 
needed. (5) 

In 358/14/30 savana dinas there are exactly 380 
1/2 yogas. This happens when sun is at. end of 
odd quadrants from mandakendra. (6) 

Karana in a particular tithi ardha will be 
repeated after one year in same tithi ardha. If 
nakSatra (13°20’) is divided into 4 quadrants (3°20’ 
- each), there are nine quadrants in a ra&i. (7) 

In these sdévana days (358/18/16), moon will 
complete its 12 lunar months (synodic) and there 
will be exactly 4 tithis more. There are 3 nak§atras 
more than a complete revolution. (8) 

From complete cycle of yogas, there are 2-1/2 
yogas more. After this additions to tithi etc of 
previous year, the tithis etc of present year are 
called ista or accepted tithi etc. In ista tithi (starting 
time) we add 18/16 nadi (danda), in ista nakSatra 
13/3 danda and in ista yoga 14/30 dandas are added. 
(9) 

If after these additions, the sum is less than 
60 danda, then in ista days 1 vara is added. If 
result is more than 60 then 2 varas are added. (10)

In tithis of previous (grahya) year, we add 4 
tithis, in grahya nakSatra 4 nakSatras and in grahya 
yoga 2-1/2 yogas are added. Then we get ista tithi 
etc. (11) 

The questions such as these can be raised - 
what will be ista tithi in a given month and pakSa? 
What will be nakéatra or yoga on that ista tithi ? 
(12) 

Since tithi is the main thing in a pancanga, 
the day on which ista tithi is over or the nakSatra 
or yoga will be completed on that tithi, all will be 
taken as ista tithi etc. According to this ista tithi, 
wé add or deduct 1 day to grahya day. (13) 

Notes : (1) Selection of this period for new 
calender. 

A synodic lunar year ends after 354.367 days 
after which tithis are exactly repeated. 

However, lunar nakSatras are repeated after 
355.816 days after completing 13 exact revolutions 
round earth. Since we count the days from tithi, 
convenient tithi after completion of lunar years are 
searched, when other elements are slightly dif- 
ferent, from previous year. 

Calculations are based on these modern figures 

Sidereal period of moon = 27.321161+43-7/2 hours 

Synodic period of moon = 29.5305881 + 7 hours 

Tropical solar year = 365.2421 9879 days 

Sidereal year = 365.256362 days = 365/15/22/54/12 

Indian year = 365.2587564 days = 365/15/31/31/24 


Daily speed of moon = 13°.176358° = 13°/10/34/53 
Daily speed of sun = 0°.9856091 = 0/59/8/11.57 


1040 Siddhanta Darpana 


(Sun + moon) speed = 14°.161967 
1 cycle of 27 yogas = 25.420197 days 
14 cycles of 27 yogas = 355.88275 days 


Tithi NakSatra Yoga day 
Tithi 1 0.970187 1.045528 0.98435 
NakSatra 1.030729 1 1.014601 
Yoga 0.95645 1 0.94149 


Karana is entirely decided by tithi, hence we 
consider other pancanga elements for each tithi 
following completion of lunar year. When fraction 
of day and addition remains within 1 day, vara 
(week day) is same as day number, for more than 
1 day, next week day is taken. After 354 day of 
lunar year, week day number is 354 + 7 = 
remainder 4 i.e. week day will be added 4 or 
substracted 3, we write - 3.

6 360.27315 3 5.01832 4.66328 


We see that on completion of 3rd and 4th 
tithis, we have most convenient times to calculate 
nak§Satra and yogas. After 3rd tithi, week day will 
be same, nakSatra will be 2.108 more and yoga will 


1041 


be 1.527 more. After 4th tithi, week day wil be 1 
more, nakSatra will be 3.078 more and yoga will 
be 2.572 more. Before that, week days and 
nakSatras deviate more from round numbers. After 
4 tithi the addition to nakSatra and yoga will be 
more and yoga will be neither complete number 
nor round number. 

(2) Correction terms : Third and fourth tithis 
are both convenient, rather third is slightly better. 
However, CandraSekhara has selected the comple- 
tion of 4th tithi after ud of a lunar year for 
correction of previous year elements. 

At the end of 4th tithi, completed days are 
358.30445 = 358/18/16 as given. (From above chart) 


Week day is 1 more, if after adding 18/16 
danda extra at end of tithi, the tithi ending is 
within 60 danda. If it is more than 60 danda, 2 is - 
added to week day number. 


NakSatras after 13 complete cycles, are 3.07794 
more. Fraction of 0.07794 nakSatras = .079078 = 
4/45 danda. Here 5/3 danda have been deducted 
so that after 358/13/3 days 13 X an 354 nakSatras 
are completed. 


2.57222 yogas are completed after 4th tithi. 
Thus after 14 cycle of 27 yogas and approximately 
2.5 yogas, the lapsed. yogas are 14 X 27+2-1/2 = 
380-1/2 yogas. Fraction above 2.5 yogas is 0.07222 
yoga = 0.07222 X 0.94149 days = .06799 days = 4/5 
danda. 

Here 3/16 danda have been substracted from 
358/18/16 to get 358/14/30 days for 380-1/2 yogas. 

(The slight difference is due to difference in 
sidereal solar year and siddhanta year as written 
above. 


1042 Siddhanta Darpana 


(3) Example : Suppose we have to calculate 
new year elements ista from old year (grahya) 


Old Year New Year Additional 

Elements 

(Grahya) elements time to be added 
(Ista) (danda/pala) 

Tithi = t t + 4 18/16. 

NakSatra = n n+3 13/3 

Yoga = y y + 2-1/2 14/30 


If grahya element is for vaisakha sukla 5, in 
next year’s calender we get the value for vaisakha 
-sukla 9. That tithi will end 18/16 dandas after Sth 
tithi had ended previous year. NakSatra on that 
day will be 3 more and this 4th ista nakSatra will 
end 13/3 danda after previous year value. Similarly 
2-1/2 will be added to yoga. That will end 14/10 
yoga after grahya yoga had ended previous year. 
Then we add 1/2 duration of that yoga, then y+3 
yoga will end. 


Verses 14-16 : Correction in tithi 


In solar months from mesa to simha, we add 
to ista tithi 38, 68, 78, 68, 38 palas respectively. 
(14) 

But these will be substracted from ista tithi 
in five solar months starting with tula. When sun 
is in 18° of the rasi, this addition or deduction 
amount will be calculated in proportion to the 
difference of sun degrees. These palas are not 
added or substracted for endings of nakSatras. (15) 


The times of increase or decrease in tithi 
duration for solar months starting with dhanu are 


Upasanhara Varnana 1043 


dhanu (15), makara (14), kumbha (13), mina (12) 
mena (11), vrsa (10), mithuna (9), karka (10), sirnha 
(11) kanya (12), tula (13), vrScika (14) . . . (16) 

Verse 17 : These amounts will be reduced or 
added to the time of tithi endings. These amounts 
reduced by 1/12 will be reduced or added to 
nakSatra times. 


Notes : Compared to lunar year, this calendar 
period is 4 tithis more. Compared to solar year, it 
is about seven days less. Its value being between 
both, minor adjustments in both types of values 
wil be needed. 


Difference from solar year is 
365.256362 (Siddhanta value 365.258756) 
- 358.30445 days 

6.951912 days (6.954306) 

6.85187 degrees (6.85423) 


These periods for calculation are calculated 
' with reference to mandocca 78° of sun. Present 
year position of 78° for sun will not have any 
correction for mandaphala. But last years position 
will be corresponding to 78°+7° = 85° position of 
mean sun. For that true sun will be less by r sin 
7° = 16 kala approximately, where r is parama 
mandaphala. Thus tithi, calculated from (moon- 
sun) will be more corresponding to 16 kala 
difference. For 12° difference, tithi extends to 60 
danda approximately. 


H 


60 
For 16 kala the correction will be D* 16 = 


80 pala approximately. By accurate calculation this 
comes to 78 pala for 78° sun position i.e. mithuna 
(18°). 


1044 Siddhanta Darpana 


Increase in value of sine is proprotional to its 
cosine which is maximum for 0° difference (from 
78° position) and minimum for 90° difference. It 
is positive in Ist and last quadrants. Thus correction 
is positive for two signs more and 2 less than 
mithuna with decreasing values. In third rasis from 
mithuna (168° or -12°) correction is zero and for 
others it is negative. These values are based on 
difference of sines of 18° and 25° for mesa, 48° 
and 55° for vréa etc. For remaining days, correction 
is found by proportion. 


Speed of tithi is speed of (moon-sun) which 
is 12/13 of moon speed. Speed of change of nakSatra 
is moon speed only. Since nakSatra changes 1/12 
earlier, its time correction will be 1/12 less than 
that for tithis. 

End of tithis increases progressively, hence its 
duration also will increase. For example, suppose 
3rd tithi ends after 20 pala, 4th tithi after 25 pala 
more time. Then duration of 4th tithi will by 25-20 
= 5 pala more. This is like correction of time for 
difference between true and mean: sun (equation 
of time or velantara) sanskara. Roughly it is seen 
to be 2/5 of that value. Velantara sanskara becomes 
zero after every 3 months. If this interval is taken 
as 180° when sin function becomes zero at the 
ends, then 7 days are less than 1/6 of 3 months. 
Sin 180°/6 = 1/2. Hence, it is less than 1/2 of 
velantara. These are approximate values based on 
observations and mathematical derivation will be 
very complicated, but still approximate. 

Verses 18-19 : Half day for 7 days less than 
grahya day will be the half day for ista day in 
present year. Hence, difference for 7 days in half 


Upasanhara Varnana 1045 


day will have to be added ot tithi, nakSatra and 
yoga for south kranti and deducted for north 
kranti. (18) 

This will make the tithi etc sphuta according 
to old theories like stirya siddhanta etc. From these 
rough tithis, we can find accurate tithis according 
to mandocca etc. (19) 

Notes : We are taking the interval 7 days less 
than the solar year. Hence in south ayana, when 
day length is decreasing, this will be half day of 
7 days earlier in previous year i.e. more than the 
value. Hence, sunrise will be earlier and the time 
of tithis etc, after sunrise will increase. This increase 
or decrease will be corresponding to difference in 
half day length. for 7 days earlier in grahya tithi. 


Verses 20-24 : Correction of tithis 

If grahya tithis (of previous year) are accurate, 
then they should be made rough (because these 
calculation are based on rough method only). 
Tungantara and pakSika etc. corrections are calcu- 
lated and applied to accurate tithis in reverse 
manner. (20) 

In tithis from Ist to 7th we add 68, 125, 159, 
166, 145, 98 and 35 kalas respectively and deduct 
from tithis from 8th to 14th in reverse order. (21) 


In half paksa, tungantara bhuja kala is divided 
by 225. Result will be bhuja khanda of tungantara. 
(22) 

According to these results, mandaphala of 
jupiter in kala is multiplied by 5 and divided by 
2. That will be para etc for mid pakSa. These results 


1046 Siddhanta Darpana 


in para for Ist to 7 are multiplied by 13, 25, 35, 
45, 52, 57, 60. From 8th to 14th they are multiplied 
in reverse order - 60, 57, 52, 45, 35, 25, 13. In all 
results we divide by 66 and correct in reverse way 
as done for tungantara. Then accurate tithi will 
become rough. (23-24) 


Verses 25-27 : Correction of nakSatras 


Similarly at the end of tithi also, the nakSatra 
to be completed, will be used after deducting 1/13 
parts less than the correction of that tithi. If by 
end of tithi, nakSatra is not completed, then the 
time between tithi and nakSatra endings is multi- 
plied by the difference of correction times of two 
tithis in which nakSatra falls. Product will be 
divided by 60 and added to the lapsed part of 
nakSatra or deducted from remaining part. Then 
the grahya (base years) nakSatra will become rough. 
(25-26) 

We deduct from grahya nakSatras (of base 
year), the following kala (palas) in solar months of 
makara (26), kumbha (46), mina, mesa (53), mesa 
(46) and vrsa (26). These are added to months 
beginning with karka. There is no change in dhanu 
and mithuna months. (27) 


Notes : Correction for tithis are clear. Due to 
tungantara and pakSika correction, tithis had been 
revised. But the present calculations are for 
pre-revision tithis, hence reverse corrections are 
needed. 

NakSatra correction depends solely on moon 
motion. Same difference is caused in tithi which 
depends on sun motion also. Since moon is 13 


Upasanhara Varnana 1047 


times faster than sun, nakSatra change will be 13/12 
times faster. Corection ratio will be 12/13 times the 
ratio for tithi. 


Verses 28-29 : Yoga correction 


For yoga starting with viskumbha etc, the 
correction is 1/7th less than that of naksatras. Like 
lapsed and remaining parts of nakSatra, here also 
proportionate correction time will be found. By this 
method we get rough tithis from base year 
accurate values (28) 


To make the rough tithi’s etc. accurate, we 
make corrections.for tungantara and paksika both 
results in order opposite to that explained above. 
For tithi, nakSatras, this correction will be positive 
for 5 months starting with solar karka month and 
negative for 5 months, starting with solar makara 
month. (29) 

Notes : Speed of yoga will be still faster hence 
the difference from tithi correction will be double 
of nakéatra correction. Difference for nakSatra is 
1/13.36, hence difference here will be 2/13.36 = 1/7 
approximately. 


Above were correction for making accurate 
values (for which tungantara and paksika correc- 
tions have been made to moon) to rough values. 
For changing rough values to accurate, we have 
to make opposite corrections. 


Verse 30 : Adhimiasa 


- If there is an adhimasa between grahya (base 
year) month and ista (next year) month, then we 
take the month next to the grahya month. Because 
there are 371 + 1/16 = 371/3/45 tithis in a solar 
year. 


1048 Siddhanta Darpana 


Notes : There are 365.256362 days in a sidereal 
solar year and 1 tithi = 0.98435 days (verse 13) 


Hence no. of tithis in 1 year are 
365.256362 
0.98435 
= 371+1/16 approx. (371/3/48) 

Here it is given 371/3/45 


Verses 31-35 - NakSatra and rasi of ‘sun. 

In one revolution of stin or a solar year, there 
are 365/15/32 savana (civil days) dina. Vara of 
nakSatra is that vara (week: day) on which sun 
enters that nakSatra. (31) 


= 371.0635 


Vara of nakéatra in present year will be one 
more than vara of naksatra in previous year. In 
addition we have to add 15/32 danda also. Because 
solar year days etc divided by 7 leave a remainder 
of (1/15/32) days. If sum of base year danda of 
nakSatra and 15/32 added for present year is more 
than 60 danda, then two days are added to vara 
for sun’s entry in a nakSatra or rasi (samkranti). 
(32) 

In base year sphuta sun is for some days after 
a particular Sankranti. In present year, for same 
days interval after Sankranti, we deduct 15/18 kala 
to -get sphuta sun. (33) 

Sankranti of a month will be 15/32 danda after 
previous years safikranti. We take the previous 
week day in base year and from sphuta sun of 
that day we get the sphuta sun of this year (by 
substracting 15/18 kalas as before). (34) 


But here it is asked to deduct 15/18 kalas. 
This can be made sphuta (more. accurate) by 


Upasanhara Varnana , 1049 
multiplying with sphuta gati of sun and dividing 
by 60. That sphuta kala etc. should be substracted 
from previous year’s sun of corresponding day (365 
days before). (35) 

Notes : Adding 1 week day and 15/32 dandas 
have already been explained in the text. Civil days 
in a solar year divided by 7 give. 

365/15/32 

7 

With average speed of 59/8 sun will move 
15/32 X 59/8 = 15/18 kala, hence 15/18 kalas are 
deducted, because sun’s position will match after 
15/32 danda. Its position of same time will be less 
by motioa in 15/32 danda 

More accurately, the movement is 

15/32_X_sphuta gati 

60 


Verse 36 : Sun gati. 


Sphuta gati of sun is obtained by substracting 
sun of grahya dina (day of base year) from sun 
of next day. 


= 52 + remainder 1/15/32 


If safikranti of sun falls after end of amavasya, 
then the month will be extra (adhimasa). 


Verses 37-38 : Moon gati 


Lapsed portion of a nakSatra is found by 
multiplying period in danda etc by 800 and dividing 
it by total duration of nakSatra. Result will be in 
kala etc. 

‘The number of previous nakSatra will be 
multiplied by 800 and the kalas of present nakSatra 
are added to it. This gives kala of sphuta moon. 


1050 Siddhanta Darpana 


By dividing it with 60 we get the degrees and 
degrees divided by 30 give raSis. (37) 

We divide (28,80,000) by total duration of 
nakgatra in palas. Result will be sphuta gati of 
moon. By this method, learned astronomers can 
know tithi and gati of moon for many years in 
advance, (38) 

Notes : Motion of moon is considered constant 
within a small period of nakSatra of approximately 


one day. , 
Kala of past poriton —_—‘800 kala of full nakSatra 
period of past portion ~ Period of full nakgatra 


Each nakSatra is of 13°20’ = 800’. So we add 
the completed nakSatras and their value is found 
by multiplying with 800’ kala. Adding the covered 
portion of present nakSatra will give positon of 


true moon. 

Since moon moves in 

d palas — 800 kala of nakSatra 

Hence in 3600 pala (= 60 X 60 pala of a day), it 
800 x 3600, |. 

moves 7 kala 
_ 28,80,000_ __ 

Thus: the speed is age kala 


Remaining convensions are based on definitions 

1 rasi = 30°, 1° = 60 kala 
Verses 39-45 : Possibility of eclipse 

To know the posibility of lunar or solar 
eclipse, sphuta position of moon and sun are to 
be calculated. For that, we find the ahargana (count 
of days from a particular standard) for parnima 
(for solar eclipse) or for amavasya (in lunar eclipse). 


Upasanhara Varnana 1051 


It will be checked by comparing with vara 
(week day). (39) 

This ahargana is multiplied by = 3/10/48 kala 
daily speed of rahu (candra pAta) to get the position 
of pata. At pirnimda end, if distance between moon 
and its pata is less then 13° then solar eclipse is 
probable. For lunar eclipse, distance between moon 
and pata should be less than 9° (as stated earlier) 
when moon and shadow (i.e. sun + 6 raSi) are in 
one position, (40) - 

We calculate the amanta period (when sun = 
moon) and it is corrected for lambana. For larnbana 
corrected period, moon and its Sara are calculated. 
Drkksepa (south-north distance from’ zenith) is 
calculated from nataméa of vitribha lagna etc. (41) 


Sara and drkkSepa are added or difference is 
taken to find sphuta Sara. If this sphuta Sara is 
less than 32 kala (sum of semi diameters of sun 
and moon). then solar eclipse is probable. Then 
method of finding grasa, mokSa etc has already 
been stated. (42) 


For ista (current) year, we find the interval 
of civil days from sankranti of sun to amavasya or 
purnima day. In previous year, we calculate the 
gati of sun or moon for same days after that 
sankranti. Motion for that period is added to the 
positions at previous year sankranti to get the 
present position. Degrees and minutes are made 
equal by gati on current day to find true time of 
amavasya etc. (43) 

In a lunar year, after one eclipse (of any type), 
next eclipse is possible after 15, 165, 180, 195, 345 
or 360 tithis. (44) 


1052 Siddhanta Darpana 


After 10 years (lunar) again, the grahana are 
probable at these intervals. (45) 

Notes : We have already discussed the interval 
between eclipses while discussing maximum num- 
ber of eclipses in a solar year. Repetition of this 
cycle is after 19 year’s vedic yuga or saros cycle 
of Chaldea, because the revolution of rahu is 
approximately in that period. In this period, solar 
year also matches lunar year with extra lunar 
months, as explained in calender (introduction to 
chapter 6) 

19 solar years = 6939.6018 days (Tropical) 


235 lunar months = 6939.688 days (synodic 
months) 

235 lunar months = 19X12+7 = 19 years with 
7 extra months. 

Saros cycle is of 223 synodic months = 242 
months of solar year relative ot rahu (dragon year 
- dracontic months). Sun completes 1 revolution 
relative to rahu in 346.62005 days. Thus 

223 synodic months = 6585.321 days 

242 draconitic months = 6585.357 days 

This period of 242 draconitic months is equal 
to 18 years 11-1/3 days or (18 years 10-1/3 days if 
5 leap years come). 

Half of this period is 111 synodic months 15 
tithis (3339 tithis - ViSvamitra figure). This is 
mentioned as 10 lunar years approximately. 
Verses 46-49 - Mangala position 


Tara graha like mangala do not make complete 
revolutions in an year. To calculate their positions, 


Upasanhara Varnana 1053 


we need calenders (paficanga) of many years. From 
these ephemeries, many uses can be found. (46) 

Position of mangala at present day and month 
of current solar year will be exactly same as position 
32 years ago or 32 years after on same day and 
month of solar year. When it is 12 ragis more than 
sun, 180 kala is to be added. (47) 

When mangala is 1, 2, 3 rasis ahead of sun, 
we have to add 210, 270, 360, 480, 630 and 810 
kala to mangala. (48) 

When mangala is in five rasis (ahead of sun) 
beginning with dhanu, we substract the kala (last 
five figures above), increased by 1/15th value, 8th 
part, 5th part, 8th and 15th parts respectively. 
Then -mangala will become sphuta after 32 years. 

Notes : 32 solar years = 11,688.203 days 


17 revolutions of mangala = 17 X 686.97982 = 
11,678.656 days. 


Thus after 17 revolutions of mangala, sun will 
be 9.547 days behind its complete 32 revolutions. 
Thus mars will be ahead by 9.547 X‘0/31/25.52 kala 
daily speed = about 300 kala. 


Thus at the time of 32 complete revolutions 
of sun, mars will move 300 kala ahead. According 
to siddhanta figures, this difference will be about 
180 kala.(= 3°) 

This difference arises when 32 years ago, mars 
was in same position as sun. When mars was 1 
rasi ahead of sun its true speed will be more than 
mean speed corresponding to Ssighra phala for 1 
ragi. 


1054 Siddhanta Darpana 


Then correction will be 180 kala + Sighra phala 
for 1 raSi = 210 kala. (actually it will be difference 
of Ssighra phala for 30° and 33°). Similarly other 
corrections are made. 

From dhanu, Sighra phala will be negative 
but sighra paridhi will. increase. Hence the correc- 
tions will be proportionately more, but negative. 


Verses 50-51 : Budha positoin 

Position of budha for a particular day of a 
solar month will be same as its position 13 years 
ago on same day of same solar month. There are 
many other calculations involved in it. Speed 
difference of spasta budha and mean sun is 
multiplied by 8 and divided by 3. (50) 

If budha gati is more than (59/8) mean sun 
gati, then this result will be added ot budha raéi, 
otherwise substracted (if budha gati is less). If 
budha is vakri, then sum of sphuta budha and 
mean sun gati is multiplied by 8 and divided by 
3. Result will be substracted from vakri budha. (51) 

Notes : 13 solar years 
4748.3326 days (Sidereal) 

4748.3638 days (siddhanta) 

54 revolutions of budha = 13 X 87.96926 

= 4750.34 days 

41 conjunctions of budha = 41 X 115.878 

= 4750.998 days 

Mean speed of budha is same as mean speed 


of sun as it moves around sun in a much smaller 
orbit. 


Upasanhara Varnana 1055 


41 conjunction time - 13 solar years = 4750.998 
~ 4748.333 = 2.665 = 8/3 days approx. 

Hence, change from mean position of sun is 
the movement of budha relative to sun in 8/3 days. 

Relative speed of budha = budha gati - sun 
gati (mean). 

It is positive, if budha gati is more than mean 
sun gati (59/8) and negative if less. 

If budha is vakri , relative speed = - (budha- 
gati + sun gati) 

Thus the corection to budha positon is 8/3 X 
relative speed. 


Verses 52-53 - Guru position 

Guru position will be almost same as its 
position 12 years ago. Difference of guru and sun - 
in kala is divided by 120 and result is added to 
210 kala. Sum is added to guru. (52) 

Again when guru is ahead of sun by 5 raégis 
starting with karka, then difference of sun and 
guru is divided by 33, 17, 11, 17, 33 Result is 
substracted from previous diffrence and remainder 
is added ot guru. When guru is in 5 ra&is starting 
with makara, this difference is added to 210 kala 
and the sum is added to guru to find its sphuta 
(ue) position. (53) 

Notes : 12 solar years = 4383.0763 days 

1 Guru year = 4332.5891 days 

Thus at end of 12 solar years, guru will move 
ahead of complete revolution by 50.487 days. In 
this period guru will move ahead with mean speed 
by 50.487 X 4/59.13 kala = 251.703 kala. 


1056 Siddhanta Darpana 


Thus, corresponding to difference of 251.7 
kala sighra kendra of guru, Sighra phala is to be 
substracted. Since guru is on average 5.2 times 
farther from sun compared to earth, it is about 6.2 
times farther from earth at Ssighra kendra zero. At 
252 kala it will be about 6 times farther. Then 
Sighra phala correction will be 252/6 = 42 kala. 
Hence, change in guru for 0° Ssighra kendra (at 
base year) will be 252-42 = 210 kala. 

Difference in sighra phala correction decreases 
with increase in Sighra kendra. Hence reduction 
from 252 kala mean difference will be less. Thus 
corresponding addition to 210 kalas is made 
according to sighra kendra. 


Verses 54-55 - Sukra position 

On a particular day and month of solar year, 
position of Sukra will be same, as it was on same 
month and day, exactly eight years ago. Difference 
of Sukra sphuta gati and mean sun gati is multiplied 
by 5 and divided by 2. (54) 

If sphuta Sukra gati is more than mean sun 
gati (59/8), then this will be added to sphuta Sukra 
of base year (8 years back). That will give sphuta 
Sukra of current year. When éukra is vakri , sum 
of gatis of sphuta Sukra and mean sun is multiplied 
by 5 and divided by two. Result is deducted from 
vakri Sukra to get the sphuta position. (55) 


Notes : 8 solar years = 2922.0508 days 

13 revolutions of sukra = 13 X 224.7008 = 
2921.1104 days 

5 conjunctions of Sukra = 5 X 583.921 
2919.605 days. 


Upasanhara Varnana ; 1057 


Thus after 8 solar years, Sukra will move 
ahead of its conjunction for 


2922.051 - 2919.605 = 2.446 days 
This is approximately 2.5 = 5/2 days. 


In 5/2 days Sukra will move ahead of sun, 
corresponding to its relative motion in that period. 


As in case of budha, 


relative speed of Sukra = speed of sphuta 
Sukra - mean sun speed 


When sphuta Sukra has more speed than 
mean sun speed (59/8) the correction is positive. 
Otherwise it is negative. For vakri-Sukra, the 
relative speed of Sukra is sum of the speeds. 


Verses 56-57 : Sani position 


Sani will be almost in same position on a 
particular solar month and day in which it was 
exactly 30 years ago on same solar month and day. 
Difference between mean sun and sphuta Sani in 
kala is divided by 120 and added to 375 kala. Sum 
will be added toesphuta Sani (of base year). (56) 

When Sani is in 5 rasis beginning with mesa 
from sun, the difference between sphuta Sani and 
mean sun in kala is divided by 20, 10, 7, 10, 20 
respectively, and the result is added to corrected 
sphuta Sani. Sani (its Sighra kendra) being in 5 
raSis beginning with tula, these qualities will be 
deducted. (57) 

Notes : 30 solar years = 10,957.69 days 

1 revolution of Sani = 10,759.2262 days 


29 conjunctions of Sani = 29 X 378.092 = 
10964.668 days. Correction to Sani can be calculated 
in two ways. 


1058 Siddhanta Darpana 


After 30 solar years, Sani is before conjunction 
position by 6.978 days. In this period sun will be 
faster and it will cover more period, hence after 
30 years sun will be behind Sani. Sun will cover 
this difference in 6.978 days with relative speed of 
(59/8.19-2/0.45) = (57/7.74). Thus the difference will 
be 6.978X57/7.74 kala = 398.646 kala. 


Another method will be to calculate the extra 
movement of Sani in 198.464 days with mean 
motion. 


This is correciton corresponding to mean 
motion. The correction for sighra phala corres- 
ponding to 398.6 kala is 398.6/10.55, as Sani is on 
average 9.55 times éarth distance away from sun. 
This will be about 36 kala, which will be substracted 
for first quadrant. 


Thus for zero Sighra kendra in base year, the 
correction will be 398.6 - 36 = 363 approx. Here it 
has been given as 375 kala corresponding to 
siddhanta figures of solar year, and saturn revolu- 
tion. 

The further correction for other Sighra kendra 
is difference between Sighra phalas of 400 kala and 
30°+400 kala, 60°+400 kala etc. for mesa, vrsa raSsis 
etc. 


Verses 58-60 - Pata and mandocca 

Mangala, guru and Sani will never be more 
than 6 raSis ahead of sun. After 6 rasis, same kala 
difference will be added in next half of Sighra 
kendra. (58) 

Ahargana between grahya and ista day is 
found. It is divided by 143 and result is added to 


1059 


ahargana. Sum is divided by 19. Quotient is 
substracted from candra pata (rahu) if ista day is 
after grahya day. (59) 

Ahargana is added with its 1/440 part and 
divided by 9. Result is added to moon mandocca 
when ista day is after desired day. (60) 


Notes : Calculation of other planets is already 
explained. Pata and ucca of moon have uniform 
motion, hence they are directly calculated from no. 
of .days lapsed since the base day. Pata moves in 
reverse direction hence, its extra motion is 
deducted. 


Pata of moon (rahu) comple? 1 revolution

Verses 61-62 : Approximate complete revolu- 
tions of planets 


Mean mangala increases by 64 kala in 79 solar 
years. Budha decreases (101) kala in 64 solar years. 
Guru decreases 74 kalas in 83 solar years. (61) 


Mean éukra increases 43 kala in 243 solar 
years. Sani increases 57 kala in 59 solar years. Rahu 
decreases 20 kala in 93 solar. years. Sighrocca of 
budha and sukra and mean values of other planets 
come almost correct by this calculation. (62)

Budha and éukra positions cannot be calcu- 
lated from their revolutions, as it will indicate their 
distance from sun only. For earth, their difference 
from sun will be r sin? / R, where r is radius of 
budha orbit, R is radius of earth orbit and @ is 
angle (budha-sun). R is more correctly R + r cosé 
= manda karna approximately. 


‘ revolutions = 5.0002269 revs 


Budha figures here are not correct, hence, 
parocca correction was made by the author. 


Verse 63 : Solar dates 


For tithi and nakSatra of solar year, whatever 
time interval has been said for adding or deducting 
will be kept separately (it will be used for every 
tithi). Now grahya tithi of (previous year) and 
corresponding tithi of present year will be 7 dyas 
before completion of solar year. We take the 
difference of sun between grahya tithi and 8 tithis 
before it. Sun position at ista tithi of present year 


1062 Siddhanta Darpana 


will be less by that amount. For accuracy we take 
average of differences of 8th day before and 8th 
day after grahya tithi. This figure and earlier figure 
kept separately, added to sun rasi will give the 
solar date (equal to current degres in rdéi). 


Verses 64-65 - Use of Kautuka panji 

There may be error in degrees of tara graha 
like mangala etc, in kautuka panjika of next year. 
There will be difference of minutes in moon and 
sun from their true positions. Correspondingly, 
errors in palas in tithi, yoga or nakSatra will be 
considered negligible by the learned. (64) 

No body had constructed kautuka panjika 
earlier. People can know the auspicious moments 
of pilgrimage, bath etc much in advance. Hence, 
this kautuka panjika is very useful, even though 
it is rough. (65) 

Verses 66-92 : Topics in various chapters. 

Siddhanta darpana has described many topics 
in detail with examples. Still the topics are 


enumerated chapter wise, so that contents of the 
book are easily known. (66) 


Topics of first chapter are - time measures 
from truti to pralaya, criteria of siddhanta text, 
period of creation, parts of vedas, and its impor- 
tance. (67) 


Subjects in second chapter are - revolution 
numbers of graha, ucca, and their pata etc, number 
of years, months and days in a kalpa, daily mean 
motions of graha, their ucca and pata and methods 
to find them, times of complete revolution. (68) 


Upasanhara Varnana 1063 


Topics in third chapter are - method to find 
count of civil days, lords of day, month and year 
etc, mean planet, jovian year, dhruva (constants) 
of graha, ucca and pata, hara (divisor) for ucca 
and pata. (69) 

Topics in fourth chapter are - circumference 
.of earth, longitude difference, difference in start 
of days, corrections for longitude, bhujantara, 
udayantara, cara kala and dhruva padaka (position) 
at end of dvdpara. (70) 


Thus madhyamadhikara of planets is com- 
pleted in first four chapters. In next two chapters, 
method to find true planets have been described. 
(71) 

Fifth chapter describes - value of east and 
west motion of planets, difference is motion of 
planets due to ucca and pata, sines and versines, 
gati-khandas for bhujaphala, paridhi and its manda 
and Sighra paridhis, elements of paficanga like tithi 
and nakSatra etc. (72) 


Sixth chapter describes accurate position of, 
moon and elements of panjika, junction of tithi, 
naksatra and raési, circle and eccentric circles, 
ayanam$sa, Sighra phala, kranti jya, dyujya and 
bhujya, cara and lagna for any place. (73) 

Seventh chapter gives - Cardinal directions, 
bhuja, koti and karna, lambajya, akSajya and agra, 
sama mandala and other circles, finding direction, 
place and time, sphuta sun, karani and kona Sanku 
etc. (74). 

Eighth chapter describes diameters of sun, 


moon and shadow of earth, manda karna of sun 
and moon, position of Sara, periods of sthiti and 


1064 Siddhanta Darpana 


marda in an eclipse, lunar and solar eclipse, valana 
(bending) due to ayana and 4k$a, lunar day and 
extent of grasa. (75) 

Nirth chapter describes nati, Sanku and 
vitribha lagna two types of larnbana for sun and 
moon, difference in shadow length due to Sanku, 
and solar eclipse. (76) 

Tenth chapter describes variation in visible 
disc due to change in nata or unnata time, 3 circles 
according to Sara and diagram for eclipse. (77) 

Eleventh chapter describes - finding equal 
position of sphuta graha, correction for ayana and 
ak$a drkkarma, conjunction of planets, types of 
discs of planet, types of conjunction, observation 
through a tube. (78) 

Twelfth chapter descrbies conjunction of 
nakSatra and a graha, dhruva of nakSatra, south 
and north sara, shape of nakSatras, numbers of 
stars in them, size of stars, yogatara, saptarsi, stars 
like Agastya, lubdhaka etc. (79) 


Thirteenth chapter describes rising and set- 
tings of planets in east and west, degrees of kSetra, 
kala and mana, brightness of sun, moon and venus. 
(80) 

Fourteenth chapter gives rising and setting of 
moon from difference of time degrees between sun 
and moon, diagram of moon phases, elevation of 
lunar horns and horns of budha and Sukra. (81) 


Fifteenth chapter describes two mahapatas 
vaidhrti and vyatipata. Thus triprasnadhikéra ex- 
tends for nine chapters. Here ends the first half 
of the book. (82) 


Upasanhara Varnana 1065 


Sixteenth chapter describes various opinions, 
and raises questions about motion of earth and 
creation etc. (83) 


Seventeenth chapter gives answers to those 
questions, refutation of Bauddha views, location of 
earth in space, rotation around it of moon and sun 
with other planets. (84) 


Eighteenth chapter describes creation, nature 
of planets like sun, height of hills, dimensions of 
earth and its oceans, area of circle and earth surface 
etc. (85) 


Ninteenth chapter gives dimensions of orbits 
of planets, stars and sky and its explaination, 
distance of planets and stars, order of lords of 
year, month, day and hora, limit of visible distance 
of Sariku, extent of reach of sun rays. (86) 


Twentieth chapter describes two types of gola 
yantra, time from instruments like hemisphere, 
cakra etc, finding planet positions by instruments, 
construction of automatic wheel. (87) 


Twenty-first chapter explains duration of day, 
night of deva and asura, explaination of lagna, 
alternative revolution numbers of planets, seasons 
and method to find cube root. (88). 


Thus goladhikara extends upto 6 chapters. 
Now, last three chapters are described. Twenty 
second chapter tells about years and their meaning, 
months tithi, different periods of lunar, sidereal 
years etc. and solar sankranti etc. (89) 

Twenty third chapter describes Jagannatha 
temple of Puri, and prayer hymns of Lord 
Jagannatha which are also prayer of his forms like 
sky, oceans and other gods. (90) 


1066 Siddhanta Darpana 


Last, twenty fourth chapter describes kautuka 
panjika and list of topics in this book. Thus 
kaladhikara ends in three chapters. Book is over 
in two halves ganita and gola. (91) 


Some persons don’t read whole text and go 
through the summary only. In conclusion, all topics 
are mentioned briefly so that rich and easy going 
can quickly glance through the topic of astronomy 
and its results which is like eyes of vedas.’ (92) 


Verses 93-139 : Longitude and latitude of 109 
places. 


In seventh chapter, the topics of time, place 
and direciton have been described in detail. Still 
location of famous places of world is not known 
to the astrologers. Hence, they are unable to 
calculate eclipse etc at different places. (93) 


Hencé, the longitude of places from assumed 
prime meridian (through Juinagarha of Gujarata 
here) and. distances from equator are given here 
in kala (minutes of angle). With help of that, an 
astronomer can prepare ephemeries of any country 
by making slight changes in a standard ephemeries 
of a particular place. 


- Notes : At present, the distance of longitude 
is expressed from standard longitude O° of 
Greenwich, London. In India, since long, Ujjain 
has been taken as prime meridian, from which east 
and west longitudes were measured. Ujjain was 
central place of India from which all places of India 
and even outside in Asia, Africa were named 
according to direction from Ujjain. It is probable 
that the prime meridian in Asura kingdoms was 
between Cairo and Alexandria of Egypt, where 


Upasafihara Varnana 1067 


great pyramid was constructed to mark O° lon- 
gitude. Reasons for giving this distance from 
Janagarha of Gujrat is not known. There is 
however, one significance of that meridian. On sea 
coast at that meridian Samanatha temple was 
constructed from where south meridian will not 
meet any island till south pole. However, the chart 
here appears to be copied from some Gujarati text 
book for purpose of naval records. Source may be 
a nautical almanc or Jaina jyotisa book.

Verses 140-141 : Distance between two places. 

Difference between akSakala of two places is 
multiplied by (5026) and divided by (21,600). Result 
will be squared. (140) 

East west longitude difference in minutes is 
multiplied by 5026 and divided by 360. Result will 
be multiplied by half the sum of sine of colatitude 
of two places and divided by trijya (3438). Result 
will be squared and added to the previous square. 
Square root of the sum will be straight distance 
between two palces. 

Notes : North south distance is proportional . 
to difference between latitudes. For difference of 
21,600 kala, we get the circumference 5026 yojana. 

Hence for given difference, north south 
distance is 

Akéa kala x 5026 

21,600 

East west difference depends on sphuta 
paridhi which changes with latitude and is propor- 
tional to sine of colatitude. Hence we have taken 
average of sines of colatitudes of two places. This 
multiplied by 5026 and divided by trijya gives 
sphuta paridhi.

East west difference in degrees (not mentioned 
in text) is multiplied by sphuta paridhi and divided 
by 360 to give result in yojanas. 

From A to C, AB is east west distance and 
BC is north west distance as shown in figure 1. 
Then ABC is a right angled triangle. Hence AC = 
VAB? + BC? 

Verses 142-143 - I have not accepted without 
evidence anything written by earlier astronomers 
about maximum latitude of planets, oscillation of 
ayana, valana etc. I have verified everything with 
observations. (142) 


In dark room we make a small hole at the 
roof. At mid day, we keep a water pot at place 
where sun light. falls on ground. The incident rays 
of sun will be reflected at same angle to the vertical. 
This angle will be spasta (apparent) declination of. 
sun at that place. By adding or substracting north 
or south kranti, we get latitude of the place. (143) 


Verse 144 : Reasons for writing the book 

In many ways learned men have inspired me 
to write this book. Old calculation methods do not 
give correct positions of planets as observed, so 
that, religion can be protected. This will refute the 
arguments of those who accept the rotation of 
earth. My stray talks were laughed at in gathering 
of the learned. For all these inspirations, I pray to 
these learned men. (144) 


Verses 145-147 : Family of author 

In Khandapara of Puri district (Orissa, India), 
a king named Vairagi was born, who contained 
the elements of eight lokapalas (protector of eight 


Upasanhara Varnana 1075 


directions and angles) - Varuna, Indra, Rudra, 
Yama, Kubera, Nairrti, Agni and Pavana. For his 
achivements, king Vairagi, had been given titles of 
Marddaraja and ‘Bhramara vara’ by king of Puri 
himself. He was like moon of Khandapara, the 
brightness of whose knowledge and greatness was 
spread all around. (145) 


Due to grace of Lord Krsna, his devotee king 
Vairagi got a son named Sri Niladri Singh, who 
defeated his enemies with his fierce prowess like 
Bhistha, son of Ganga. Son of Sri Niladri was Sri 
Nrsimha, who excelled sun and moon with his 
fame and influence. He got his family titles (mardda 
raja and bhramaravara) and, by meditating. upon 
the feet of the undefeated (Lord Visnu), he was 
freed of three troubles (of body, mind and world). 
(146) 

Family of Baghela KSatriyas is as spotless as 
ocean of milk where goddess of wealth (Laksmi) 
resides. In this family itself, Sri Nrsimha had risen 
like a full moon. His own son Sri Syama-Bandhu 
was very learned, and destroyed his ignorance and 
darkness through feet nails of ‘Dinabandhu’ (Lord 
Visnu, friend of poor). He belonged to Orissa, was 
called a Simha (Lion) and was like a sun for 
Bharadvaja family (gotra) as a lotus. (147) 


Verses 148-149 : Author 


I am son of the same Sri Sydma Bandhu 
Simha. I have been blessed by my guru Sri 
Madhustidana Mahapatra. Kadgaraya (wielder of 
sword - a title) Sri Ananda Migra taught me 
(astronomy). My only shelter is feet of Lord in 
three forms - Brahma, Visnu and Mahe§a. I have 


1076 Siddhanta Darpana 


always erred in following my duties according to 
demand of the times, Still I could complete this 
siddhanta by grace of god. It is offered in the feet 
of the same lord. (148) 


I was born in Kali year 4936. It took me 34 
years to complete this text. No man has the 
complete knowledge. Hence, the learned are 
requested, only to accept the truth in this text and 
ignore the errors. (149) 


Verses 150-166 : Conclusion of chapter 


The learned are requested not to criticise the 
innovations in this book only because they are 
new. For tallying the calculations with observations 
Lalla, Bhaskara, Satananda and Aryabhata etc also 
have writter’ many new things in their texts, and 
people accept them. What is the fault, if I too have 
done the same? (150) 


Even before a formal education of siddhanta 
texts, I developed intense curiosity about limit of 
sky, motion of graha and nakSatras. Then, I was 
engaged in their research. With completion of this 
second half, famous as gola ganita consisting of 
two out of nine adhikara (i:e. goladhikara and 
kaladhikara), siddhanta darpana is complete. (151) 


Siddhanta darpana is specially famous and 
respected for its true calculation of planets as they 
are observed. This contains 24 chapters in 5 
adhikaras. This text is over. I wish that this should 
remain useful for long. (152) 


I pray to Lord Krsna, who controls time 
divisions starting with truti to the end of pralaya, 
who subdues the king of dead, Yama, being the 
blackest, always blissful, who is crest jewel of 
Nilacala hill and death of death itself. (153) 


Upasanhara Varnana 1077 


Lord of my heart may always reside in 
Nilacala (i) who makes the planets move as per 
astronomical calculations so that people timely obey 
the duties described in vedas and smrtis written 
by direction of god, (ii) who takes care of the 
whole moving and non-moving world (iii) who is 
ever ready with his raised hands to protect fallen 
like me, (iv) and whose blue colour is bright as 
Indranila (blue emerald). (154) 

Thus ends the concluding 24th chapter of 
siddhanta darpata written as a text bok for true 
calculation of plaents by sri Candragekhara born 
in famous royal family of Orissa. (155) 

This book contains a total of 2,500 verses out 
of which 2,284 are written by me and the rest 216 
are quoted from others. May these beautiful verses 
give good results. (156) 

Sometimes the great warrior Bhima also was 
defeated in war. What can be spoken about a 
pandita will little knowledge like me ? Hence, the 
learned are requested to correct the errors and 
repeatitions, wherever they occur. (157) 

Siddhanta darpana is essence of astronomy, 
which is most important of the three parts of 
jyotisa, and is difficult to understand. This text has 
come out like a lion from cave mouth of the family 
of Niladri Simhha (Alternate meaning - This is 
pronouncement of lord Krsna himself who is lion 
of Nilacala Puri). Like a lion, this may vanquish 
the power of England scholars like elephant tusks, 
who reject the theory that earth is fixed in the 
infinite sky and think it as moving. (158) 


1078 Siddhanta Darpana 


Nilacala is on coast of ocean which is king of 
holy places. This is like a pot of verses made by 
Indra and other gods through which Lord 
Jaganatha is worshipped. My body may fall in the 
same PuruSsottama (The great being) region. (159) 

Note : Sri ChandraSekhara had really expired 
while praying to Lord Jagannatha in Puri temple. 

In 914th year of Mukundadeva or Saka year 
1814, margSirsa krsna 9th, saturday, compilation of 
the book was over. (160)

In western astronomy, these rasis of 30° 
intervals are measured from point of ecliptic which 
meets equator (equinox) after which it rises north. 
of equator. This point moves west wards relative 
to’ fixed stars called ‘ayana gati’ at speed of 50.7” 
seconds per year. In India, this rasi measurement 
from equinox point is called sayana, because the 
movement of equinox is west wards, and _ its 
negative motion is added to position with respect 
to fixed stars. 


There are two other systems of rasi measure- 
ment Rasi without any prefix means position from 


1084 Siddhanta Darpana 


fixed stars (citra 179.9° or Revati 0.0°). This is also 
called nirayana. The distance of planets from their 
mandocca or Sighrocca also is expressed by names 
of these rasis. This distance is called manda or 
sighra kendra.

There is system of unequal divisions also in 
which 28th nakSatra is inserted between uttara 
asadha and Sravana. In both systems a$vini_ starts 
with start of mesa and revati ends with end of 
mina raSi. In unequal divisions, extent of nakSatras 
are generally the distance covered by mean moon 
in one day i.e. (790'35”), where as, in equal division 
all are of 13°20’ = 800’. 

In unequal divison extra duration of moon’s 
revolution period (254'18”35”’) is allotted to abhijit. 
Three uttara nakSatra (12, 21 and 26), Rohini (4), 


Appendix 1085 


punarvasu (7) and anuradha (17) have double the 
length (1185’52"18”’) To compensate, six nakSatras 
have half duration, (2) bharani, (6) ardra (9) aSslesa 
(15) svati (18) jyestha (24) Satabhisaj 

Length units 

1 yojana = Distance travelled by light in 1 
truti i.e. 1/1,12,500 sec. 

- 1/1600 of earth’s diameter according to stirya 
siddhanta = 5 miles or 7.9 Kms approximately. 

- or 1/3200 of earth’s circumference according 
to Varahamihira and Aryabhata = 7.52 miles. 

- yojana or maha yojana for stellar measure- 
‘ments is 5 terrestrial yojana = 40 miles (8 yojanas 
of surya siddhanta 

- 16000 hands (1 hand = 1-1/2 ft.) according 
ot surya siddhanta or 32000 hands according to 
Jaina measures. 

Hand or hasta = about 1-1/2 feet. 

1 angula = 1/24 hand = 3/4 inch approx. 


- any measure of length, which is subdivided 
into 60 units. All measurements will be same angula 
measures. This indicates dimension of length. 


5. Terms used in planetary motion 


KakSa or kakSa vrtta - Approximate circular 
orbit of a planet’s motion. 

Mandaparidhi - Small circular orbit around 
mean planet in which true planet moves with same 
angular speed in opposite direction. With varying 
radius this becomes equivalent to an elliptical orbit. 


1086 , Siddhanta Darpana 


Prati vrtta or Prati mandala - Eccentric circle 
of same size as kakéa paridhi, but centre removed 
towards mandocca or gighrocca by distance equal 
to maximum value of correction to mean planet. 

Sighra paridhi - To convert the heliocentric 
position of a planet to geocentric position, planet 
corrected for elliptical orbit has another small orbit 
around it on which true planet moves. This 
corresponds to smaller orbit between planetary 
orbit or earth’s orbit. ° 

Mandocca - Apogee or farthest point of 
elliptical orbit where plaent is farthest (ucca) and 
hence slowest (manda) 

Sighrocca - Position of planet moving in 
‘slower orbit around earth. For outer planets ‘it is 
position of sun itself. For inner planets, it is that 
planet, i.e. budha éighrocca is budha itself. 

Kendra - Centre of a circle 


- Distance of planet from apogee or sighrocca. 
They are called manda and sighra kendra. Manda 
kendra is like anomaly, which is distance from 
perigee (180° from apogee). Thus manda kendra = 
anomaly + 180°. 

Karna - Hypotenus of a right angled triangle 

- Radius of a circle 

- Distance of a planet from centre of orbit 

Manda and Sighra karna - True distance of a 
planet after calculating manda (elliptical) correction 
is manda karna. Geocentric position is Sighra karna. 

Capa - Arc, part of a circumference measuring 
angle. Its length is measured in kala units where 


Appendix 1087 


whole circumference is 21,600 kala, or degree when 
circle is 360° 

Jya - Chord of arc, straight line joining end 
points of a capa. This is also measured in kala. 

Cakra - Circle 

- 1 revolution of 360° or 21,600 kala (lipta) 

Jya - Jya is short form of Jyardha (half chord). 
It is half the chord of double the arc. In radius of 
unit circle it is equal to sine ratio of trigonomentry. 
This-is measured in kala, for circumference of 21600 
kala or radius 3438 kala. Thus jya in kala = 3438 
sine i.e. radius X sine. 

Trijya = Jya of 3 rasi. Since sine of 3 raéi is 
1, trijya is equal to radius 3438 kala. 

Vyasa - Diameter 

Vyasardha - half of diameter. This is more 
used for radius of any other circle. In main orbit 
under consideration trijya = 3438 only. 


Kotijya - Distance of Jya from centre or 
equivalent to Jya of the koti angle i.e. difference 
of angle and 3 rasis. This is trijya X cosine 

Utkrama jya - Distance of Jya from circum- 
ference along perpendicualr radius. This ratio is 
not used in modern trigonometry. This may be 
called verse-sine or versine. Versine of angle? is 
versO = R (1-cos@ ) where R is radius 


Bhuja - Base of a right angled triangle 


- Angle from starting point in first and third 
quadrant and the complement in that quadrant in 
2nd and fourth quadrants. 


1088 Siddhanta Darpana 

Bhuja jya - Jya of bhuja of that angle. Bhuja 
of angle @ in differnt quadrants is 0°, 180° - 6, @ - 
180° and 360° - @ in Ist to 4th quadrants. 

Koti - Perpendicular of a right angled triangle 

- Complement of bhuja angle 

Bhujaphala - Correction to mean planet for 
manda or sighra motions which is proportional to 
Jya of main of kendra (manda or Sighra) measured 
in main orbit. 

Dohphala - Bhujajya of radius of manda or 
Sighra circle. This distance measured at circum- 
ference of main circle is bhujaphala. 

Kotiphala - Kotijya for radius of manda or 
Sighra circle. This is component of change in 
distance of planet in direction of mean planet. 

Mandaphala - bhujaphala of mandaparidhi 

Manda kotiphala - Kotiphala in mandaparidhi 

Sighra phala - Bhujaphala in’ sighra paridhi 

Sighra koti phala - Koti phala in sighra paridhi 

Khanda - Parts of angle at which calculation 
of variables is done. For jya, khanda is of length 
3°45’ = 225’ i.e. 1/24 of a right angle. Rising times 
are calculated at 1 rasi intervals and kranti at 
interval a half rasi. Within the interval, variation 
is considered proprotional. 

Margi - Planet moving forward i.e. east ward 

Vakri - Planet moving west ward, le. 
retrograde motion 

Calakarna = same as Sighra karna 


Appendix 1089 


Paksika phala - Corection in moon’s position 
which varies fortnightly (panei): It is called 
variation. 


Tungantara correction - Correction in moon’s 
motion due to attraction of mandocca (Tunga = 
top, antara = difference) by sun. It is called 
evection. The equation combines second order 
correction of elliptic orbit also. 


DigamSa correction - This is annual variation | 
in correction ot moon due to vaying distance from 
sun.It equals 1/10 of sun’s mandaphala, hence is 
called diagamSa (dig = directions ie. 10, amSa = 
part). . 
6. Calender Elements 


Pancanga = A calendar with 5 limbs (afga) - 
Vara, tithi, nakSatra, karana and yoga 

Vara = Weekdays 

Tithi - Lunar day depending on its phase. 
These are 30 tithi in a synodic revolution of moon 
i.e. 1 revolution ahead of moon. Hence tithi 

moon — sun 
Karana - Half part of a tithi is called karana 


Thus karana = ao ed From 14th tithi 
2nd half in krsna pak§a to first half of Sula paksa 
Ist tithi, 4 .kararas are fixed - Sakuni (hawk), 
catuspada (quadruped), naga (serpent), kinstughna 
is an animal. In remaining 56 half tithis 7 movable 
kararas rotate 8 times 1. Bava (= lion, Babara in 
Hindi), 2. Balava (=tiger, powerful), 3. Kaulava 
(kola = boar), 4 Taitila (-donkey), 5 Gara or gaja 


1090 Siddhanta Darpana 


(elephant), 6. Vanija (=Trader) and 7. Visti or 
Bhadra (=cow). 

Yoga = Sum of longitudes of moon and sun. 
At 13°20’ interval equal to a nakéatra divison, 1 
yoga changes. Thus there is a cycle of 27 yogas 
in about 25.42 days 


NakSatra - The nakSatra division in which 
moon is located. 

Pakéa = Literally means wings. This is two 
halves of a lunar month. Fortnight 

Sukla paksa - Bright half of lunar month or 
bright fortnight 


Krsna paksa - Dark half of a lunar month or 
dark fortnight. 


Amavasya - Last day (tithi of dark half). 

Amanta - Ending point of amavasya or 
beginnig of bright half, new moon (when moon = 
sun) 

Purnima = Full moon or last tithi of bright 
half. 

Purnima - Ending point of purnima when 
moon-sun = 180°. 


Names of lunar months 


Lunar months are named according to 
nakSatra near which moon goes On pirnima day. 
Amanta months ends with amavasya and purnima 
is in middle. This is generally followed. Pirnanta 
month ends with purnima. NakSatra numbers are 
given in bracket after the month name. 

1. Caitra (14) 2. Vaisakha (16) 


3. Jyestha (18) 4. Asadha (20, 21) .

At present Caitra month starts in which sun, 
enters mesa raSi with mean motion. Solar months 
also are given the same names. 


Ayanas 


Ayana is movement of sun north or south of 
equator. Kranti is position north of south of 
equator. When sun kranti is southern most, it starts 
its northward motion called uttarayana. 

When sun is in northern most point it starts 
southward motion called daksinayana. 

Two ayana make one ‘hayana’ (full year). 
Earlier solar year started with Margésirsa month 
(9th) hence it was called agra-hayana (first of year). 
Since it was having longest nights it was called 
Krsnamasa (Ref. Gita), which has become 
‘Christmas’. 

As it was start of ‘divya dina’ of 1 solar year 
it is called ‘badd dina’ (great day). 

Seasons 

Two months make a season. Thus there are 
six seasons which start with year, covering two 
month each 

1 Vasanta (spring) 2 Grisma (summer) 
3 Varsa (rains) 4 Sarat (autumn) 
5 Hemanta (cold) 6 Sigira {very cold). 


1092 Siddhanta Darpana 


Tithi names 


Tithi names are same and given same numbers 
also in each fortnight. Only last tithis are named 
and numbered differently. Parnima is 15th and 
amavasya is 30th as it is last tithi.of month.
