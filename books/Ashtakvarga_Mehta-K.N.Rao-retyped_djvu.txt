ABOUT THE BOOK 


The Ashtakvarga system of 
Astrology is unique. It gives 
at a glance the complete 
picture of a person's health, 
wealth, finances, spiritual 
development, profession and 
the strength and weakness of 
the horoscope; No other 
system can predict as 
accurately the result of 
transit of planets as 
Ashtakvarga does. A mere 
look at the Ashtakvarga 
Table shows the height a 
person can rise to in his 
profession and gives an 
exact picture of the dasha 
scheme. Without 
Ashtakvarga it is not 
possible to know as to why 
persons like Gulzari Lai 
Nanda and Charan Singh 
were Prime Ministers for a 
short period only as against 
J. L. Nehru or Indira Gandhi 
who stayed in power for a 
much longer duration. 

The results of dreaded Saade 
Satican be predicted with great accuracy. It shows the circumstances under 
which period of Saade Sati instead of producing sorrow and disappointment can 
be a source of strength if the rasis concerned contain requisite number of bindus 
as calculated according to Ashtakvarga. 

The system can also be used in forecasting exact Muhurta under which a person 
should be married or which direction would one get success or from where to 
seek a bride. The time to fight an election, give interviews, take medicine,

perform auspicious ceremonies or launch a satellite can be accurately forecast 
under this system. This can also be used for matching horoscope or to find which

confusing details. The present book gives a step by step and easy approach to 
make Ashtakvarga chart and comprehend predictive techniques. This is the only 
book of its kind that gives plenty of solved examples for practice and makes one 
proficient in the subject in no time.

Introduction

"THE Great Rishis of the ancient times speak very high of the system of 
Ashtakvarga in determining the effect of transit of planets through various signs 
of the Zodiac," so says Phaladeepika, the great ancient classic of Astrology. 

Even Parashara himself underlined the importance of this system, and 
revealed this for the benefit of humanity especially for the people of Kaliyuga 
whose comprehension is low. 

Ashtaka, literally means eight. The eight are Ascendant, and the seven 
planets. These planets are in transit all the time and change their position with 
respect to each other. Certain positions have been defined as benefic while others 
are malefic. Ashtakvarga system lays down principles in details as to when a 
planet in transit is going to give beneficial or malefic results. 

The importance of Ashtakvarga in depicting results of dasha/antar dasha 
of planets assumes great importance as it has been proved beyond doubt that 
even an exalted planet in its dasha is not able to give good result if it is not 
associated with higher benefic points. Conversely, a planet transiting in a 
binduless rasi in its own Ashtakvarga gives extremely bad results. Malefic Saturn 
in these circumstances could even cause death. It should be clearly understood 
that planets in exaltation, own sign, in kendra, trikona or in Upchaya houses or 
powerful by position in benefic vargas are not effective if associated with less 
than 25 benefic points. 

This book has been particularly written for the students to explain step by 
step approach to intricacies of Ashtakvarga. Teaching Astrology to a large 
number of well placed and intellectually mature students have given enough 
experience to the authors to keep the demands of students in view. In addition to 
the beginners this book also gives important principles of delineating the 
horoscopes which even experienced astrologers may find useful. Towards the 
end large number of example horoscopes have been given for practice and 
achieving perfection. 

This book has been written under the guidance of Shri K. N. Rao who in 
a series of articles had highlighted the importance of Ashtakvarga, by calling 
them 'Dots of Destiny». Here is what he has to say about achievement of name 
and fame in this world. 


"There are three ways by which a man achieves success in this world, 
number one Raj Yogas and Dhanna Yogas must exist in the horoscope. 
Secondly, dasha period must come at the right time. And lastly the extent of such 
attainment could only be determined with the help of Ashtakvarga synthesized 
with the transit of Saturn and Jupiter with the main Mahadasha." 

A great deal of hard work has been put in the preparation of this book by 
study of all the available literature on the subject. The authors are amenable to 
suggestions which would be gratefully received and incorporated in the next 
edition. 


Introduction to Second Edition 


It is very heartening to know that first edition of this book was sold in no time. 
This has encouraged the author to enlarge and revise the present edition. Many 
new rules have been added and K.N. Rao's classical articles 'Dots on Destiny' has 
been packed in ashtakvarga system as a predictive tool. The students of 
Astrology will find this article of immense use and interest. 
Special thanks are due to our Guru K.N.Rao for guidance and encouragement at 
all stages. I am also indebted to Vinay Gupta for taking the trouble of reading the 
book at proof stage and offering valuable guidance and advice. As Controller of 
Examination in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan School of Astrology he is responsible 
for setting a very high standard in examination and education of Astrology. His 
knowledge and comprehension of the subject is deep and commendable. 
Thanks are also due to Amrit Lai Jain of Alpha Publications for bringing a new 
and revised edition of the book promptly and in an efficient manner.

Acknowledgment 


THIS book would not have been possible if the knowledge and inspiration was not 
provided by our Guru K.N. Rao. It was he, who through his own example of 
spirituality and plain life inspired us to do things noble and good. His linking of 
Astrology with Karma and to Spiritualism is the greatest contribution ever made 
in the realm of thought of modern India. 

To my father and mother who had prophesised that one day I will tread the 
path of righteousness. 

To my wife who never objected to my working day and night, and never 
complained that she is being neglected.As a matter of fact my pursuit of Astrology 
and her daily worship started at the same time. Both of us became partners of a 
cause higher than ourselves. 

To my colleagues Shiv Raj and C.B. Prasad who without hesitation lent a 
willing hand in compiling this book. 

To Yogesh Sandhalaya, but for whose assistance in setting this book on the 
pagemaker, these efforts would not have seen the light of the day, and would 
have remained confined to note books. 


And above all to Abhilash for translating and setting this book in Hindi. 


We are all indebted to Shri Amrit Lai Jain in providing us support 
for publishing of the book.

Journal of Astrology 
Guide and Editor : ICN. Rao 
(In association with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, New Delhi) 


IN the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, New Delhi, we have been running successfully 
Astrology classes since 1987. As years rolled on, we discovered the need to 
introduce small books on different subjects. It should be a self contained and 
comprehensive book which can help students learn a new subject and, the 
advanced astrologer to revise his half forgotten lessons. 
The advantage of teachers writing the book is that unlike other writers, here the 
communication is direct, lucid and easy. 
That is what this book on Ashtakvarga does. Being the first in the series of many 
such books to come, the value of this work on Ashtakvarga, will be realised by 
the astrological community and beginners in astrology because small, direct and 
lucid books on different branches of astrology are few. 
The book planned and written by M.S. Mehta with the cooperation of Shiv Raj 
Sharma and C.B. Prasad is the beginning of a new era in astrological writing. 
The Hindi translation, being done by Abhilash Chandra, with the help of his 
father C.B. Prasad, who teaches astrology in the Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan, will 
be coming out simultaneously. 
It is also necessary to master astakvarga manually as some of computer 
programmes are very erratic and wrong.

only do. We beseech you, O Mother ! Make our life meaningful ! 


Chapter I 


Ashtakvarga 


' ASHT' in Sanskrit means eight—Ashtakvarga denotes eight types of 
energies, which every planet in a horoscope generates with reference to itself, 
lagna and six other planets (Rahu and Ketu excluded). The energies released can 
be benefic or malefic. In this book, we will use the word 'bindus' for benefic 
points and 'rekhas' for those which are malefic. 


Origin 

Ashtakvarga system is part of the ancient system of 'Hindu Astrology' and 
is referred to by Maharishi Parashar in his monumental work 'Brihat Parashara 
Hora Shastra’. This system is unique to the Indian system and is not found any 
where else in the world, as such it confirms convincingly that astrology or 
Jyotish took its birth in the holy land of India. 

Ashtakvarga, though by itself, an independent system is an offshoot of 
Parashari system. It is easy to comprehend and gives snapshot, accurate and 
correct predictions by pinpointing the main events in a horoscope. It gives a clear 
and concise picture of the strength of planets and rasis, without which precise 
prediction cannot be made. Its main strength is in timing of events by assessment 
of results of planets in transit. 

It is the basic principle of astrology that only strong planets in strong rasis 
give excellent results. Weak planets and weak rasis spoil the significations 
ofplanets and houses and cause misery and trouble in life. Ashtakvarga system 
pin points the strength and weaknesses of planets and rasis and leads to accurate 
forecast of events. 

Mr. K.N, Rao ina series of articles in 'Astrological Magazine' has 
highlighted the usefulness of this system and has called Ashtakvarga as 'Dots of 
Destiny’. On the basis of this system he gave stunningly accurate predictions 
about India's victory over Pakistan in Indo-Pakistan wars. 


Concept of Ashtakvarga 

Leaving aside Rahu and Ketu (which we are going to ignore for 
calculations of Ashtakvarga in this book), there are seven planets. Together with 
lagna these are eight in number. So, every planet with reference to lagna, itself 
and six other planets releases energies of eight type for good or for bad. The 


benefic points released are called bindus, while malefic ones are known as 


rekhas. 


Note: In Northern India the benefic points are called rekhas or vertical lines 
while malefic points are known as bindus. It is the reverse of the terminology 
used in South India. In this book we will use bindus for benefic points and rekhas 


for malefic points as done in South India. 


ie Bhinnashtakvarga or Ashtakvarga of individual planets which 
are seven in number (leaving aside Rahu and Ketu). 
2. Saravashtakvarga or total Ashtakvarga chart which is also 


called 'Samudayashtakvarga' It is the sum totalof bindus in each Bhava 
received by aplanet from eight sources, itself, six planets and is shown at page

Other terms that we will be using in this book are

In Nehru's horoscope, Saturn is in Leo, therefore, put an asterisk mark in the 
relevant horizontal column under rasi Leo against vertical column Saturn. This 
asterisk mark would show the first position from where countingwould 
begin. Similarly ,make an asterisk mark for Jupiter in the column under Sagittarius 
against planet Jupiter. In the same way asterisk marks should be put for Mars under 
column Virgo against planet Mars, for Sun under column Scorpio against Sun, 
for Venus under Libra against Venus, forMercuryjinderLibraagainstMercury; 
andMoon under Cancer against Moon. Asterisk for Ascendant would be under 
Rasi Cancer against column Ascendant. This will take shape as shown in Table A given on 
page 15. Now start placing bindus in the relevant columns with the help of Table II of Sun 
at page 11. 


Sun's Prastharashtakvarga—Table III -1 


In the form above, and with the help of consolidated Table II - Sun, atpage 11, 
whichshows the benefic position of Sun withreference to itself and 7 other planets 
including lagna, mark bindus in the relevant columns. Remember that counting would 
start from asterisk mark in each column, as this is the first position from where 
counting would begin. Sun as per Table IT has benefic bindus in places 1,2,4,7,8,9,10 and 
11 from Saturn. As Saturn is in Leo the counting would start from this sign i.e. the 
first bindu would be put under sign Leo, second bindu under sign Virgo, 3rd under 
sign Scorpio as this is in 4th place from Leo, then under sign Aquarius as this is 7th from 
Leo, next under sign Pisces, next under sign Aries and last under Gemini as it is 11 th 
place from Leo where Saturn is placed. Now continue with the Sun's position with 
reference to Jupiter in the next column. Sun with reference to Jupiter is benefic in 
places 5,6,9 and 11. Start counting from asterisk under Sagittarius where Jupiter is 
located. 1 st bindu would start from Aries, 5th from Sagittarius. Next bindu would 
be under sign Taurus 6th from Sagittarius, next under Leo and last under Libra. In 
similar way continue with other planets, Mars, Sun (itself), Venus, Mercury and Moon. 
Total bindus in all the twelve rasis. The final picture that will emerge is shown in table III-1 
-Sun's Parastharashtakvarga on page 16. 

Chart 2 — Prastharashtakvarga of Moon Table III - 2, Page 17 
Use Table II at Page 11 

Follow the same procedure as above. Table II shows the benefic positions of 
Moon with respect to itself and other 6 planets and lagna. 

Before planting the bindus in the chart, make an asterisk mark of all the planets and 
lagna, because this is the position from where the counting would start. 


12 


1st column Saturn: Moon is benefic in 3,5,6 and 11 places from Saturn. The first 
bindu would be in third sign from Leo where Saturn is located. The second bindu 
would be in the 5th from Saturn i.e. Sagittarius. The third bindu would be in the 6th 
from Saturn i.e. Capricorn and last would be in the 11th from Saturn i.e. in Gemini. 

Column of Jupiter : First bindu starts from Sagittartus where Jupiter is located i.e. in 
sign Sagittarius itself. Next in 4th from Jupiter i.e. Pisces and so on in Gemini, Cancer, 
Virgo, Libra and Scorpio. 

Column of Mars: Bindus would be in 2,3,5,6,9,10 & 11 from Mars or from 
sign Virgo. 

Column of Sun : Bindus would be in 3, 6, 7, 8, 10 & 11 from Scorpio, the 
position of Sun. 

Column of Venus: Bindus would be in 3,4,5,7,9, lO&llfrom sign Libra or 
sign occupied by Venus. 

Column ofMercury: Binduswouldbeinl,3,4,5,7,8,10&11 from Mercury or 
from sign Libra. 

Column of Moon: Bindus would be in 1,3,6,7,10 & 11 from Moon or sign 
Cancer. 

Column of Lagna: Bindus would be in 3,6,10 & 11 from Lagna or sign Cancer. 

Continue in this manner for rest of planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and 
Saturn. 
This would be as in Table III - (3,4,5,6 and 7). 

Construct rest of the charts for planets Mars, Mercrury, Jupiter, Venus and 
Saturn, as in the charts Table III-3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. 

Now total all the figures from Table III-1 to 7 rasi wise and put in the chart of 
Sarvashtakvarga as Table III-8, Page 23.

Jupiter is located in Sagittarius as such it is the 1 st house. This gets as per Table C-I, 2 
bindus inthe | st house 1.e. in Sagittarius, 2nd or Capricorn gets 1 bindu. Aquarius gets 
1, Pisces 2 and so on. 

Venus is located in Libra, therefore, Libra becomes the | st house. This gets 2 bindus. 
The next house is Scorpio which gets 3 bindus, 3rd is Sagittarius and gets again 3 
bindus and so on. 


Saturn is the last planet. Since it is placed in Leo, this becomes the 1 st house. Place 
bindus as explained above. 


Total the figures. This will take shape as in Table C-II, Page 27. 


Totals in Table Il]-8 and Table C-II are same. However, individual bindus in rasis 
would differ. 


Important Note: This chart should only be used for arriving at the total. For 


It would be observed that Sun with reference to 1 st bhava (place) from itself individual benefic point of each planet (Bhinnashtakvarga) earlier separate charts will

bhava 5 bindus; in 11 th 7 and 12th bhava 2 bindus. Similarly this chart shows 
benefic positions with reference to other 
planets and so on. 

Now take a blank chart in the form C-II Page No,. 27 and put asterisk mark at 
position of planets as these exist in birth horoscope. 

With the help of Chart C-I (onPage 26) start filling up the columns with number 
ofbindus. Remember that counting in each case should start from the asterisk mark i.e. 
the rasi where each planet is located in the birth chart. 


In the case of Moon, which is located in Cancer, the 1st house would be Cancer itself. 
Therefore, as per chart above Cancer would have 2 bindus, 2nd or Leo would 

have 3 bindus, 3 rd or Virgo would have 5 bindus, 4th or Libra would have 2 bindus, 5 
th or Scorpio would have 2 bindus, 6th or Sagittartus would have 5 bindus and so on. 
Repeat the exercisein case of rest of planets. Mars is located in Virgo, therefore

J.L. Nehru 


Twelve rasis of a horoscope are divided into four trinal types: 


1. Fiery — Aries, Leo and Sagittarius or signs 1, 5 and 9. 
2. Earthy — Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn or signs 2,6 and 10. 


3. Airy — Gemini, Libra and Aquarius or signs 3,7 and 11. 


Counting to start from * sign as this would be first house 


4. Watery — Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces or signs 4, 8 and 12. 


17 


Reduction is to be carried out separately in each type. 
Rules 


1. If the figures in three signs are unequal deduct lowest from all the three and 
retain the remainder. 


Example: We are required to carry out reductions in the Bhinashtak of Sun. 
Suppose the bindus in signs Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are 4,5 and 7 respectively. 
These figures are unequal, therefore, subtract the lowest figure 1.e. 4 from all the 
three. After this subtraction we will get the figures 0,1 and 3. That means Aries will 
have 0 after reduction, Leo | and Sagittarius will be left with 3. Remember one of the 
figures after reduction would always be 0. 


2. No reduction is to be carried out if one of the figures in any one of the three signs 
is 0. 


3. If there are no figures in two of the signs make third also zero i.e. eliminate the 
third. 


4. If figures in all the three signs are equal then eliminate all or make them equal to 
zero. 


Note: There are also other views regarding values | and 3. But we are following 
here the most accepted methods. 


Example: Let us take the chart of bhinashtak of Sun in the horoscope of J.L. Nehru, 
and make Trikona or Ist Reduction.

2nd or Ekadhipatya reduction 


After Trikona reduction has been carried out, the next reduction would be Ekadhipatya 


reduction or 2nd Reduction. 


Rules 


1. 


3. 


Ekadhipatya means reduction because of ownership of two signs by a planet. Sun and 
Moon own one sign each, Cancer and Leo.Therefore,no reduction is to be carried 
out in these two rasis. 


In other cases five other planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn own two 
signs each. In these cases the reduction is to be carried out as follows: 


No reduction is done in case there are planets (excluding Rahu and Ketu) in both 
the rasis owned by a planet. It means if both signs are occupied no reduction is to be 
made. For example take the case of rasis Aries and Scorpio owned by Mars. In 
case there are planets in these two rasis no reduction is called for. Rahu and Ketu 
are not taken into consideration as planets for this purpose. Remember the sign 
with planets becomes strong and is not to be disturbed. On this basis proceed as 
follows. 


No reduction is also to be made if one of the signs belonging to same planet has zero 
figure, whether occupied or not. 


If one of the two signs is occupied by a planet and the other is not, proceed as 
follows : 


Keeping the figures in sign occupied as they are; there are three different 
possibilities: 


eal 


Saturn’s 
Ashtakvarga

Reduction 


(a) Figure in the sign not occupied by a planet are more than the sign occupied. In 3 


such cases make figures equal to those of occupied one. Remember earlier formula that 


sign with a planet is strong and is not to be disturbed. 


Note : In some books the method of reduction is slightly different. Here we are 


following the most accepted one. 


Now in the light of these observations let us make 2nd or Ekadhipatya reduction in 


case of Ashtakavarga of Sun in the horoscope of J.L. Nehru. (Figures after 1st reduction 


are shown above) 


1. Signs Cancer and Leo are not to be disturbed as Sun and Moon are owners of one 


R#si each — Rule I, Page 34. 


2. The signs of Mars are Aries and Scorpio. The number of bindus are 2 in Aries and 
0 in Scorpio. Since one of the signs, (whether occupied or not), has no bindu, there 


is no reduction — Rule 3.

The signs of Venus are Taurus and Libra. The number of bindus are 2 in Taurus 
and 0 in Libra. Since one of the signs has again 0 figure, no reduction is to be 


(b) & (c) Figures in non occupied are equal to or less than those of occupied. In 4. Signs of Mercury are Gemini and Virgo with bindus 2 and 7 respectivly. Virgo is 
occupied, unoccupiedGemini has 2 bindus which should be eliminated. Reduced- 


such cases remove figures in non occupied.

4. Signs of Mercury : Gemini and Virgo One of the signs has 0 figure, therefore no

5. Signs of Jupiter: Sagittarius is occupied and Pisces is not. Since one of the signs has 
no bindu hence no change. 


6. Signs of Saturn : Capricorn and Aquarius. Both are unoccupied, and since one sign 
has no bindu, there is no reduction.

AFTER two reductions have been carried out the following two processes are applied. 


1. Rasi Gunakara or rasi multiplier and 
2. Graha Gunakara 


Rasi Gunakara 


Each rasi has a fixed number allotted to it. This is constant and cannot be changed. 
These are RASI GUNAKARA. 


ne

Similarly each planet has a constant planetary factor which also cannot be changed, 
and bindus after second reduction have to be multiplied witn these factors. These factors 
are GRAHA GUNAKARA.

In each horoscope the number of bindus left in each rasi after two reductions is to 
be multiplied by the above two factors. First by rasi gunakar and then separately by graha

Pinda.

Reduction in Sarvashtaka Chakra or Sarvashtakvarga 

THE total number of bindus in Savashtakchakra undergo reduction of two kinds 
1. ReductionNo. One—Trikona Reduction 
2. ReductionNo. Two—Ekadhipatya Reduction 


Before these reductions are undertaken, following first important step should be taken: 
DIVIDE THE BINDUS IN THE RASHIS BY 12, TAKING PRECAUTION Cokpaujenne no Tpukonam (N21) 
THAT THE REMAINDER LEFT IS NOT 0. It means that if a rasi has 12,24 or 36 anakn 
bindus then if we divide these by 12 normally we should have the balance 0. But in this

of the figures is zero) 


3. Sign of Venus, Taurus and Libra figures are Taurus unoccupied 5, occupied Libra

4. Signs of Mercury, Gemini and Virgo figures are 0, and 3. One of the signs is

5. Signs of Jupiter, Sagittarius and Pisces, Sagittarius is occupied while Pisces is not. 
Since one of the signs is 0 no change. 

6. Signs of Saturn, Capricorn and Aquarius. Both are unoccupied, one of the signs is 
zero, hence no change. 


The end position would be as follows:

The reduced figures are multiplied by rasi gunakara and graha gunakara separately and 
total obtained to get Shodhya Pinda (or Shudha Pinda). These calculations are used for 
prediction of events of each bhava as also determination of longevity.

Chapter VI 


Interpretation of Horoscope through 
Ashtakvarga 


WHILE giving predictions in Ashtakvarga we have to see the bindus contributed by 
the planet as well as bindus contained in the rasi. If a planet has more than 5 bindus in 
its ashtakvarga and rasi has more than 28 bindus, in Sarvashtakvarga it gives 
excellent results by the house concerned. More bindus the planet has, better are the 
results. Therefore, if we have to judge the level of wealth inahoroscope, we will 
see bindus contained in the 2nd houses as well as the bindus of 2nd lord in its own 
Ashtkavarga together with bindus contained in arasi where 2nd lord is located. If 
2nd lord has more than 5 bindus in arasi and rasi with more than 28 bindus 
person is bound to be rich. 

Remember that a planet even though it might be exalted or in its own house, cannot 
confer full benefits unless it has requisite number ofbindus in the Ashtakvarga. 

A planet is strong if it has more than 5 bindus and gives good results in proportion 
to the greater number ofbindus it has. The planet like Sun, Moon or Mars with 6,7 or 
8 bindus will confer a high rank on an individual. 

Similarly, the lessernumberofbindusaplanet has the greater mischief it would 
create. 

Karakatwas or significations of the planet should be taken into account while 
interpreting the horoscope e.g. following things would be judged from: 

1. Sun: Position and status of father, condition of health, spiritual maturity, high 
rank and influence in society. 


2 Moon : Health and prosperity of mother, intelligence, interaction and general 
attitude towards society, condition of mind. 


3 Mars : Lands, houses, brothers and sisters, high rank, energy, dash and drive and 
sexual prowess. 


4 Mercury : Speech, intellect, ability to comprehend to discriminate, level of 
education etc. 


5. Jupiter: Wisdom, wealth, children, fame, knowledge of higher things, high status and 
general prosperity. 


6 Venus : Married life, artistic bent of mind, conveyances, popularity with other sex, 
good and beautiful looks and wealth etc. 


7. Saturn: Ability for hard work and concentration of mind, longevity, causes of 
sorrow and suffering, land and influence over masses. 


In interpret! ng the houses, the normal rules of astrology would apply e.g. Bhava 
flourishes if it contains its own lord or is aspected by it, as also if benefic 
planets influence it by aspect orposition. Strength of the lords of houses is also important. 


With this background in view we will summarise the results of each planets in 
relation to its bindus. In plain terms the location of a planet in a horoscope together with 
bindus it contains in its own Ashtakvarga will portray the shape of things to come. 


Sun 


Sun would be considered strong in a horoscope if it contains 5 to 8 bindus. A 
strong Sun in a horoscope assures high status, excellent health, great respect in society, 
spiritual maturity, general prosperity and wealth etc. while a weak Sun having | to 4 
bindus gives the opposite results. Less the number ofbindus the greater harmful 
would be the results. Normally with 4 bindus Sun gives average results, neither 
very good nor very bad. Mischief is caused only if it contains | to 3 bindus. 
General results in such cases would be proneness to diseases, greedy and 
quarrelsome 
nature, inability to interact in society and generally a low status in life with pessimistic 
attitude. 


Please note that in addition to having large number of bindus, if a planet is exalted, 
in its own /friendly house and is aspected by benefics it would give excellent results. 


Moon 


31 


Moon with 4 bindus in a horoscope is considered as giving average results, more 
towards beneficial side. 

But if it has 5 to 8 bindus, then being a royal planet it confers high status, wealth, 
prosperity, happy altitude of mind with great influence in society, romantic and kind 
dispositions with good fortune and long life to mother. 

If it has 1 to 3 bindus then the person concerned has dark and dull mind, suffers 
from neurocism, melancholia and pessimistic mind. Mother of the person wil | also suffer 
accordingly. 

Moon in Kendra associated with 6 to 8 bindus makes a person very intelligent, rich 
and prosperous. 


Mars

Chapter VII 


Ashtakvarga of Sun 


THERE are three important pillars of horoscope, Lagna, Moon and Sun.. If all the three are 
strong in the horoscope, a person gets name, fame and wealth. 


Sun, being the most important planet, the giver of light, energy and sustainer of all life 
should be strong in the horoscope. 


A weH placed Sun gives health, will power, character, intelligence, drive, leadership 
qualities, stamina and courage to endure. 

On the contrary a weak Sun means lack of will power, vacillating character, low 
energy, lethargy, cowardice, dishonest and dependant on others without wealth and 
happiness. 


It has been mentioned in classical books that transit of Sun in its own Ashtakvarga 
gives following results: 


Transitting over a Rasi with— 

0 Bindu— death 

1 Bindu —Sickness, worries, miseries. 

2 Bindu— Sinful deeds, disappointment, quarrel with government, theft 
3 Bindu —Wandering, body trouble, worried mind 

4 Bindu— Mixed results, wealth, expenditure 

5 Bindu— Learning, wealth, company of good people 

6 Bindu— Wealth, fame, vehicle, success 

7 Bindu— Happiness, success through women, valour 

8 Bindu— Wealth, glory, royal honour 


To sum up the transit of Sun in the bhavas in its own Ashtakvarga containing various 
bindus is as follows: 


1. 1 to 3 bindus—mental anxiety, i!! health, sorrow, aimless wandering, enmity with 
government etc. 


2. 4bindus — average results, neither good nor bad. 


3. 5 to 8 bindus — The Sun here becomes strong and gives excellent results, which 
could be lots of fame, prosperity, high status, recognition in society, excellent 
health and vibrant personality. 


Same results should also be expected if natal Sun is having more or less than normal 4 
bindus in the birth horoscope. 


Sun in Lagna 


Sun in lagna, debilitated or in inimical sign gives bad health, not a good personality, 
hindrances and problems in life. But if Sun is exalted, or in its own sign, and has more than 
5 bindus then it gives excellent results. The person has a radiant personality, has a high 
status, and generally successful in life. More the bindus Sun has, better are the results. 
Well placed Sun in lagna with more than 6 bindus also shows eminence and leadership 
in public life. According to classical texts such a person becomes a king of kings. 


These principles may be extended to other bhavas also. The Sun in the 10th house 
gets directional strength. If in addition it is also placed in its own sign or is exalted and has 
more than 5 to 6 bindus a high status in life is assured. 


Sun as Lagna Lord 


One will have an impressive personality and high status if Sun as lagna lord has more 
than 5 bindus. This gives better results if Sun is exalted or in its own house. 


Sun gives excellent results in 3,6,10 and 11 houses. It is still better if it is in its own 
sign, or exalted and has 4 or more bindus. In the 3rd it gives excellent stamina, and 
perseverance. In the 6 it is good for victory over enemies. In the 10th it gets directional 
strength and is good for high rank and status. In the 11th it gives powerful friends, and 
brings riches and wealth. 


It has also been observed that strong Sun with good number of bindus in the Sth gives 
either a high diplomatic rank or makes one a Minister. Weak Sun here is not good for 
children. It takes children away from you in one form or the other. 


Death of Father 

Word of Caution : Before predicting death of father, it is necessary to examine the 
birth chart, and the dasha scheme. Unless the death of 
father is visible in the birth chart and is supported by appropriate dasha, fatality should not 
be predicted. Keeping this precaution in mind one should interpret the rule in classical 
books that Sun in trine or Kendras with 5 or 6 bindus kills the father at the age of 30th or 
36th of the native, with little bit of caution.

Predicting Death of Father from Shodhya Pinda and Transit of Saturn 
(Sun's Ashtakvarga before reduction) 

Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Sun with figures in the 9th from Sun in the Ashtakvarga 
of Sun before reduction. Divide the product by 27 and get the remainder. This 


remainder counted from Ashvini or from the Nakshatra where Saturn is located gives you a 
Nakshatra, the transit of Saturn over which or its trines could prove fatal to father. 


In case of J.L. Nehru horoscope, the Shodhya Pinda of Sun is 205, (Page 41). 
Bindus in 9th from Sun = 3: (Page 29), 205 *3 =615, 615/27 gives remainder equal 


to 21. The transit of Saturn over Nakshatra 21, Uttarashada, of Sun or its trines 3 (Krittika), 
and 12, Uttarphalgiini can prove fatal to father. 


The father of J.L.Nehru, Motilal Nehru died on 6.2.1931. The Saturn was about to 
enter this nakshatra, when this event happened. 


2. Death of Father from Transit of Jupiter 
Use of Shodhya Pinda of Sun and figures in 7th from Jupiter. 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Sun with figures in the 7th from Jupiter in the 
Ashtakvarga of Sun before reduction. Divide the product by 27 and obtain the remainder. 
This will give you a figure which counted from Ashvini or from the Nakshatra where Jupiter 
is located gives you the Nakshatra the transit of Jupiter over which or whose trines could 
give death to father. 


Example 

J.L. Nehru's horoscope 
Shodhya Pinda of Sun 
Bindus in 7th from Jupiter =5 — Page 29 


205*5=1025,1025/27 gives remainder = 26 

The 26th Nakshatra is Uttarbhadra of Saturn. Its trines are Anuradha (17th Nakshatra) 
and Pushyami (Nakshatra 8). 

If counting is done from Nakshatra of Jupiter at time of birth, we get|Nakshatra 18 
of Mercury. Its trine 27 is close to Nakshatra 26 when father of Nehru died. 
Death of Father from Transit of Sun 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Sun with figures in the 7th from Sun in tite Ashtakvarga 
of Sun before reduction. Obtain the remainder by dividing it with 27. 


= 205 —Page 41 


This gives you number of Nakshatra which counted from Ashvini of where Sun is 
located gives you Nakshatra the transit of Sun over which may prove fatal tp father. 


Example: 


Shodhya Pinda of Sun = 205 
Bindus in 7th from Sun = 6 — Page 29 
205 *6 = 1230, 1230/27 gives remainder 15. This is Swati Nakshatra of Rahu. Its 


trines are Nakshatra 6, and 24 of Rahu. Sun was about to enter Rahu's Nakshtra from Mars 
Nakshatra to kill Motilal Nehru. 


One's Own Death 

Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Sun with figures in 8th from the Sun in the Ashtakvarga 
of Sun before reduction. Divide the figure by 27. This gives you a nakshatra the transit 
of Saturn over which may prove fatal. 

Example: J.L. Nehru 

Shodhya Pinda of Sun = 205 

Bindus in 8 from Sun in Ashakavarga of Sun before reduction = 5 

205 *5 = 1025 1025 / 27 gives remainder 26, Uttarbhadra, Nakshatra of Saturn. Its 
trines are Nakshatras numbers 17 and 8 . 

When Nehru was bom on 14 November, 1889, Saturn was in Magha Nakshatra 
number 10. Count 26 from it and you get Nakshatra number 8, Pushyami of Saturn. Nehru 
died when Saturn was transitting in the Nakshatra of Saturn. 

Calculating Death of Father without use of Shodhya Pinda 

Here we use the total number of Bindus in the Ashtakvarga of Sun AFTER 
reduction. Multiply this by the figure in the 9th from Sun and divide the product by 27. The 
remainder gives you a figure which when counted 
from Ashvini gives you a nakshatra, the transit of Saturn over which may prove fatal to 
father. 

Predicting Death through Transit of Jupiter/Sun over Rasi 

Take the Shodhya Pinda of the Sun. Multiply it by bindus in the 9th sign from Sun 
in Sun's Ashtakvarga before reduction. Divide the product by 12. Get the remainder. 
Count this from the sign Aries, the transit of Jupiter/Sun over this rasi proves fatal for 
father. 

Note: To obtain result of transit of a planet over Nakshatra the product is divided 
by 27. For result of transit over 3Haxu the product is divided byri@ remainder obtained. 

Auspicious Time—when Sun is transitting in a rasi having 5 or more bindus in its 
ashtakvarga, or when a signwith 5 or more bindus in ashtakvarga of Sun is rising is good time 
for performance of: 

(i) marriage, religious, charitable and other auspicious ceremonies. 


(ii) journey to distant place or pilgrimage. 


34 


(iii) starting new ventures, 


(iv) Deity of Shiva should be installed in the direction indicated by a sign which 
has maximum bindus in Ashtakvarga of Sun. 

Direction can also be obtained by adding the total number of bindus in the three 
trikonaVasis representing a particular direction. For example Aries, Leo and Sagittarius 
3Haku represent Eastern direction, signs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn represent 
Southern direction, the signs Gemini, Libra and Aquarius represent Western direction 
while signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces represent Northern direction. Add the total in each 
group. Choose the direction which is represented by the group which has maximum bindus 
in Sun's Ashtakvarga for all auspicious functions and service with the government as well 
as worship of deities. 

(v) While transitting a kakshya having no bindus in the Ashtakvarga of Sun it will cause 
mental tension, misery, sickness and displeasure of the government. 

Calculating part of the day when auspicious work can be started. 

(i) 1 st part of the day is indicated by the house where Sun is located in the horoscope 
and three subsequent houses. 


(ii) 2nd part of the day is represented by the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th house from position of 
Sun. 


(iii) 3rd part of the day is represented by 9th to 12th house from Sun. 


Chapter VIII 


Ashtakvarga of Moon 


MOON represents mind (intelligence), mother, wealth. Since Moon is also treated as 
lagna, it has a great importance in the horoscope. A strong Moon represents well developed 
brain, high emotions full of feelings and sentiments. 


When Moon transits a sign in Ashtakvarga of Moon having: 
0 to 3 Bindus — it leads to mental anxiety, cause for worry on account of relatives, ill 
health of mother, sorrow, disease, poverty, and litigation. 


4 bindus — give average results, neither good nor bad. 


5to 8 bindus — give public popularity, wealth, romance, great imagination, 
comforts and in some cases high status. In the horoscope of Swami Vivekanand Moon 
has 6 bindus in the most powerful kendra, the 10th house, which gave him much

In the horoscope of Rukmini Arundale, Moon is third (lord of Art) in its own house 
with 6 bindus. 


popularity. 

A strong Moon with large bindus is a great asset to poets, writers, artists, and 
musicians. These results will vary in case Moon is exalted or debilitated, in its own rasi 
or that of an enemy. In the horoscope of Lata Mangeshkar, the Moon is in its own rasi, 
the third house of artistic abilities and golden voice with 5 bindus. Venus another 
artistic planet is in kendra the 4th house with six bindus. Mercury, again connected 
with art and music is exalted in the Sth house and is with 4th lord Sun aspected by 
yogakarka planet Saturn from the kodanda rasi Sagittarius. 


Again in the horoscope of Pt. Jawahar Lai Nehru, Moon is in lagna in its own sign, 
unafflicted by malefics and has 5 bindus. The strong Moon made him a great 
humanitarian and gave him such a popular base. 


A strong Moon bestows great popularity, it is no wonder that in the horoscope of 
Mahatma Gandhi it is placed in the strongest kendra, the IQth house in its own sign with 7 
bindus. 14-11-1889

Moon and Wealth 


Large number of bindus in a horoscope possessed by Moon are good in a horoscope 
for prosperity,wealth and high status. More the bindus higher the prosperity. Lesser the 
number of bindus, greater is the trouble from enemies and other sources. 

But equally important is wealth giving yogas in the main horoscope. The Jupiter, 
and Mars aspect on Moon gives wealth. Moon's position in a kendra and trikona is 
good, provided it is not debilitated and has good aspects of benefics. 


36 


A waning, debilitated Moon with 0_to 3 bindus destroys the house it is in. If it is 
in lagna it spoils the health, in the 2nd it will destroy the wealth. 


Moon in 6,9 and 11 having six and more bindus is stated to generate immense 
wealth. 


One born with Moon in kendra or trikona and associated with 7 to 8 bindus 
becomes highly learned, powerful, and wealthy. 


Separation from Mother 


Moon is karka for mother, and 4th from Moon also represents mother. Mars in 4 or 
8 from Moon with less bindus separates one from the mother. Here the condition of 
Moon should also be taken into consideration. In the horoscope of Dr. Balamurali 
Krishna, Moon is debilitated in the 12th house with 3 bindus aspected by Mars from 
the 6th. In navamsa again Moon is aspected by Mars and 3rd and 8th lord Mercury. 
He lost his mother after one month of birth.

Health of Mother 


Rahu in the 2nd and Moon with 1 to 3 bindus in 7 or 8 gives bad health to mother. 
Timing Death of Mother 


1 Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Moon by number of bindus in the 


4. 


The bindus in the 4th from Moon in Moon's Ashtakvarga are 4 


Multiply 158 with 4= 632 


Divide by 27, the remainder is 11. The 11th Nakshtra from Ashvini is Poorva 
phalguni ruled by Venus.The transit of Saturn over Nakshatra, 11,20 or 2 i.e. 
Poorva phalguni, poorvasharda or Bharni couid prove fatal to mother. The death 
of mother should not be predicted unless it is also visible in the birth chart. 
Sometimes the counting is done from the Nakshatra where Saturn is located. 


The figure in 7th from Jupiter in the Ashtakvarga of Moon is 5. 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Moon i.e. 158 by 5. This is equal to 790. Divide 790 
by 27 Remainder is 7. This is Nakshatra Punarvasu and its trines, the transit of 
Jupiter over these Nakshatras could prove fatal to mother. Counting is sometimes 
done from the Nakshatra where Jupiter is located. 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Moon with figures in 7th from Sun 
in Moon's Ashtakvarga before reduction Divide the product by 27 
and obtain a remainder. In the case above the figures in 7 from Sun 
are again 5. The remainder in this case again would be 7, the 
Nakshatra Punrvasu or its trines 


Death through transit over 3Haxu : Instead of dividing the above 
figures by 27, divide the product by 12; you obtain a rasi the transit 
of Jupiter or Sun over which may prove fatal to father. 


Ashtakvarga of Moon and Muhurta 


1. 


Ceremonies like tonsure and betrothal should be done when Moon is passing 
through a sign having a maximum bindus. 


Ascertain the sign in which Moon has maximum bindus. The people who have their 
lagna or Chander lagna in these sign will be more helpful to native. Hence it is 
better to avoid people who are born under your weak signs. 


4th from Moon (before reduction in the Ashtakvarga of Moon). Match Making 


Divide the product by 27. The transit of Saturn over the Nakshatra 
represented by the remainder or its trines would prove harmful to 
the mother. Example: 


In the horoscope of Nehru the Shodhya Pinda of Moon is 158 


Choose a partner whose Moon sign or lagna corresponds to signs having maximum 
number of bindus in native's horoscope. 


The marriage will be happy if the bridegroom's Janam rasi (Moon sign) happens 
to be one in which bride has maximum bindus and vice versa. 


37 


See in whose Kakshaya Moon of the native is posited. Supposing it is in the 
Kakshaya of Jupiter. Then choose a partner from one of those Moon signs in 
which Jupiter has contributed a bindu. 


Example : 

Nehru's Moon is of degrees 17°51' minute. Hence it is in kakshaya of Venus. In 
Moon Prastharachanva Venus has contributed bindu in the signs, Aries, Gemini, 
Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius. Partner can be chosen who has 
Moon in any of these signs. 


Number of mother's brothers and sisters 


Number of brothers and sisters of mother can be found from bindus in fourth from Moon 
in the Ashtakvarga of Moon. Male planets give brother while female planets give 
sisters. 


Mental Distress 
Find out Nakshtatra in which 8th lord from Moon in located. The transit of Moon over 
this Nakshatra is not good for mental/physical health. 


Chapter [X 


Ashtakvarga of Mars 


TRANSIT of Mars in its own Ashtakvarga gives following results 


5 to 8 bindus — is very auspicious. It gives wealth, victory, land, with the government, 
good relation and wealth from brothers. 


4 bindus — the results are mixed, both good and bad. 


0 to 3 bindus — results are not good — sickness, quarrels with brothers, loss of wealth, 
accidents, death, wounds and operation. 
Transit in Kakshaya 
The transit of Mars in a binduless kakshaya is not good for health and personal safety. 
On the contrary its transit in a kakshaya where it has contributed a bindu is good for 
wealth and purchase of land. 
Strength in the birth chart 
Placed in its own sign or exalted leads to high status. If it is placed in a kendra also 
from Moon or Lagna generates Mahapurush Yoga, called Ruchaka Yoga for giving name, 
fame and wealth. It gives a person courage, initiative, qualities of leadership, 
determination, decisiveness, oblivious to obstacles and will power to act. If in addition it 
has more than 5 bindus it makes a person rich also and gives landed property in 
abundance. 
Combinations for prosperity 
1. Mars in 1,4,9 and 10 with 8 bindus gives prosperity. According to Maharishi 
Parashara Mars in the ascendant in its own sign conjunct with or aspected by 
Mercury, Venus and Saturn, makes one very rich. 
2. Inthe ninth Mars should be in its own house or exalted and associated with many 


bindus to be effective. 


38 


3. Mars gives best results in 3,6, and 11. If it is powerful 1.e in its own house, exalted and 
so on and has high number of bindus then it makes one famous, courageous and 
victorious Over enemies. 


Example : In J.L. Nehru's horoscope Mars is in the 3rd with 6 bindus, aspecting its 
own 10th house. During the dasha of Mars it catapulted him to fame and made him 
first Prime Minister of Independent India in 1947. 


Mars-Saturn combination 


Mars with 5 bindus, and conjunct or aspected by Saturn gives a Raja Yoga. 


In the horoscope of President Franklin Roosevelt, Mars is in the 11 with Moon and is 
aspected by Saturn. Both Moon and Mars have 5 bindus. If we treat Moon as Lagna, then 
immediately the importance of this yoga becomes clear. It gave him courage, initiative, 
decisiveness to lead America in the great crisis of World War II and achieve victory. 


if Mars is associated with 1 to 3 
bindus it gives poverty and sorrow. It also gives a break in education 


4. Mars-Mercury combination: 


or leads to change of subjects. However, if Mercury has 5 or more 
bindus then one is very intelligent. 


In 2nd from Mercury it gives a break in education or leads to change of subject. 


5. Mars in the 10th gets directional strength. If it is also in its own house or exalted 
and is with 4 or more bindus and aspected by Saturn, it gives Raja Yoga. 


6. Mars in 4th identical with its own sign with more than 4 bindus is also capable of 
giving same results. 
7. Similarly, Mars with 5 or more bindus aspected by Moon is a combination for 
prosperity. 
Number of brothers/sisters 
Find the number of bindus in the third house from Mars in the Ashtakvarga of Mars 
before reduction. Omit the number of bindus contributed by inimical and debilitated 


planets. The remaining figures will represent number of brothers/sisters. The male planets 
will represent brothers while female planets will indicate sisters. 


According to some authorities, the number of brothers is equal to dumber of bindus 
in third from Mars and those associated with 3rd lord. 


Denial of brothers 


Mars placed in 3, 6, 8, 11 and 12 and associated with 6 and more bindus deny 
brbthers.This prediction should not be given if there are benefic aspects. 


Mars is in the 3rd in J.L. Nehru's horoscope with 6 bindus and he had no brother. 
Sickness or death of brother 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Mars with the figures in the 3rd from Mars (before 
reduction). Divide the product by 27. The remainder gives a Nakshatra the transit of 
Saturn over which or its trines, may prove fatal to the brother. 


ii In the same way multiply Shodhya Pinda of Mars with the figure in 7th from 
Jupiter and 7th from Sun and divide the product by 27. The remainder will give 
the number of Nakshatra (*Counting may also be done from the Nakshatra 
where Mars is placed in birth horoscope) the transit of Jupiter and Sun respectively 
over which or its trines will be troublesome to brother, 


Example: [Horoscope of Franklin Roosevelt] 


In this horoscope, Shodhya Pinda of Mars = 305. Bindus in 3rd from Mars= 5; 
305 * 5 = 1525,1525 divided by 27 give a balance of 13. This is Hasta Nakshtra, and its 
trines are Rohini and Shravan. The transit of Saturn over it would cause problems for 


Franklin 
Roosevelt 


brother. 


Transit of Jupiter 


39 


Shodhya Pinda of Mars = 305; Figures in 7th from Jupiter = 5. 

305 * 5 =1525, divided by 27 it gives the same results as above i.e. Hasta 
Nakshatra, the transit of Jupiter would cause problems for the brother of native. 
Transit of Sun 

Shodhya Pinda of Mars = 305. Bindus in 7th from Sun = 3. 


305*3 = 915; 


915 divided by 27 gives remainder of 24. This is Satabhish nakshatra of Rahu, with 
its trines Ardra and Swati, the transit of Sun over which could be fatal for brothers. 


Transit over 3Hakn 


Instead of dividing the above product by 27, divide it by 12. The remainder gives 
you a rasi, the transit of Jupiter or Sun over which may prove fatal to brother. 


Period of Prosperity for Brothers 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Mars with the figure in 3rd from it and divide the 
product by 12. The resultant figure will denote a rasi counted from Aries, the transit of 
Jupiter over which will prove beneficial to brothers. 


No indication has been given as to which number of brother is going to suffer or 
prosper. In this we have to fall back on the horoscopes of brothers and scrutinize the dasha 
scheme. 

Mars 
The best time to buy land, property is when Mars is transitting in sign having 
maximum number of bindus in its own nakshatra. 


2. If Mars is exalted or is in his own house at birth and has 8 bindus in 1,4,9 and 10, the 
native becomes a millionaire. 


3. With 8 bindus in Aries, Scorpio or Capricorn as Lagna or 10th house the native 
becomes a king. 


4. If Mars is in lagna with 8 bindus one becomes a big landlord. 


5. Jatak adesha Marga says that when Mars transits a sign in which it has 8 or 
maximum bindus, native gains land, wealth, gold and the like. He performs auspicious 
functions. The direction is indicated by the rasi having maximum bindus. 


6. In the Ashtakvarga of Mars 


(i) count the bindus from lagna to natal position of Mars. 
(ii) again count the bindus from Mars to lagna. 
(iii) add the two. 


In each case you get a figure which gives you number of year in which native 
suffers troubles from accidents, weapons and fire. 


Please note the period will be bad if Vimshottari dasha also shows it. 
Sickness or Death of Brothers without use of Shodhya Pinda 


Total the number of bindus in theAshtakvarga of Mars after two reductions. 
Multiply this by figure in 3rd from Mars and divide the product by 27. The remainder gives 
you a figure which when counted from Ashwini gives you a Nakshatra, over which or 
the relative trines, the transit by Saturn may prove fatal to brothers.

Mercury's Ashtakvarga 


Mercury and Bindus 


Transit of Mercury in its own Ashtakvarga through houses containing 0 to 8 bindus

With less than 3 bindus it leads to dull intellect, loss of wealth, undasiness and 


enmity all round. 


With 4 bindus it gives average results. 


Mahapurusha (Bhadra) Yoga

Mercury posited in a kendra from lagna or Moon in its own |house gives 
Mahapursha Yoga. If in addition it has more than 5 bindus one b¢comes rich,

4. One becomes a literary figure if Mercury with 4 or more bindus is in signjof Mars and 


Navamsa of Venus aspected by Jupiter. 

5. If there are 4 and more bindus in 2nd from Mercury, one becomes a great speaker. 

6. Seven or 8 bindus in 2nd from Mercury makes one a poet and a great orator. It 
will be necessary to judge the type of speaker one is by looking at the bindus 
contributed by the type of planets. The maleflcs make one boastful who makes 
false promises. Influence of Jupiter gives ennbling and spiritual talks, Venus 
artistic and idealistic 'Mercury witty and humorous, Moon romantic 
and delightful, Saturn falsehood and obscure and Sun could be boastful or 
enlightened depending upon its placement in the horoscope. Mars is basically full of 
braggadocio and is provocative. 


7. The literary achievements should be seen from the 5th from Mercury. In Swami 
Vivekananda's horoscope, Mercury has 7 bindus in the 5th from Mercury in the 
Ashtakvarga of Mercury. 


8. Mercury with 4 and more bindus with maleflcs and debilitated in Navamsa gives 
proficiency in dance, drama and music. 


Dispositor of Mercury 


Lord of the sign in which Mercury is placed, if posited in Kendra or trikona with 
many bindus is capable of bestowing fame, education and learning. 


However, if such a lord is in 6,8 and 12 there will be break in education. 
Combination for an Astrologer 
1. (a) Aspect of Jupiter on the 2nd. 


(ii) Mercury with 5 bindus in 4th, 10th or 6th from Saturn. 


2. Ketu with 3 bindus in the Ashtakvarga of Mercury in the Sth house 
or with lord of 5th. 


Setback in Career 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Mercury by figures in 10th from Mercury (before 
reduction) and divide the product by 27. The remainder gives a Nakshatra the transit of 
Saturn over which or its trines gives the period of setbacks and disappointments in 
career. 


If in the horoscope the Shodhya Pinda of Mercury = 175 
Multiply with bindus in 10th from Mercury i.e. 175x5=875 
Divide 875 by 27 Remainder = 11 


41 


This is Nakshatra Poorva Phalguni. The transit of Saturn over this Nakshatra can (iv) Propitiation should be done toVishnu, at the time when sign with maximum bindus 
cause set-back in career. in Ashtakvarga of Mercury is rising. 


Benefic period for education and friendship 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Mercury with figures in 2nd from Mercury in the 
Ashtakvarga of Mercury before reduction. Pivide the product by 12. The remainder gives a 
rasi over which the transit of Jupiter gives benefic results. 


Shodya Pinda of Mercury = 175 
bindus in 2nd from Mercury = 2 
175*2=350 


Divide 350 by 12; Remainder = 2, this is rasi Taurus over which the transit of Jupiter 
is auspicious for education. 


Period of Mental Agony 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Mercury with figures in 4th from Mercury in the 
Ashtakvarga of Mercury before reduction. Divide the product by 27, the remainder gives 
you the number of nakshatra over which or its trines, the transit of Saturn gives a 
period of mental agony. 


Example: 
Shodhyapinda of Mercury = 175 


bindus in 4th from Mercury = 7 


175 * 7 =1225 , divide 1225 by 27 . Remainder = 10. This is Magha Nakshatra the 
transit of Saturn over it would cause mental agony to the native. He may also lose his 
relations. Similarly see the period of mental agony in (i) 7th from Jupiter and the transit 
of Jupiter over it. Bindus in the 7th from Jupiter in the Ashtakvarga of Mercury (ii) 7th 
from Sun and transit of Sun. 

(i) Mercury with 4 bindus in signs of Mars and navamsa of Venus aspected by Jupiter 
makes a person writer, poet or dramatist. 


(ii) Mercury in kendra or trikona with 5 or more bindus with aspect etc. of Jupiter or 
Saturn makes one learned in scriptures. 


(ii1) In Mercury's Ashtakvarga find out signs having more than 4 bindus and aspected by 
Jupiter. Education should be started at the time when Mercury is transitting over such a 
sign.

Chapter XI 


Jupiter's Ashtakvarga 


IF Jupiter is transitting through a sign in its own Ashtakvarga having 0 to 3 bindus; it will not 
give good results. This will lead to loss of wealth, health trouble for relatives, and problem 
with government etc. 


4 bindus : results would be average, neither good nor bad. 
5to6bindus : success, destruction of enemies, gain of wealth. 
7to8bindus : fame, happiness and riches. 


The same results could be applied to birth chart also. Jupiter with more bindus will 
give excellent results. In the horoscope of Swami Vivekananda Jupiter has 7 bindus in 
the 11th house. He had a mission to fulfill and to achieve immortality. 


Jupiter in Kendra or Trikona 


1. Jupiter in a kendra is a great benefactor according to Parashara, so is the case if it 
is in trikona. In case it is also exalted, in its own house, not debilitated nor combust 
not in enemy's sign and is associated with 6 to 8 bindus, it makes one a ruler, 
meaning high position, status or prosperity. In a nutshell this constitutes a 
powerful Raj Yoga. In RabindraNath Tagore's horoscope exalted Jupiter is in the 
5th house with 6 bindus. Same would be the result, though with less intensity if it 
is placed elsewhere exalted etc. and endowed with 6 to 8 bindus. With 5 bindus 
results would be same though to a lesser degree. 

2. Ifin addition Jupiter also gets good lordship of 9th or 10th, the rise in life is indeed 
very high. 


3. Even though Jupiter may be in 6, 8, or 12, it would give excellent results if it is in 
its own house etc. and is associated with 6 to 8 bindus. 


Dispositor of Jupiter 


The dispositor of the planet is also powerful factor in bestowing good or bad results. If 
lord of the sign in which Jupiter is posited, is exalted, in its own house, free from 
combustion, and is placed in a kendra or trikona and has 4 or more bindus it gives 
plenty of riches and wealth. 


In case this dispositor is in 6 and 8 from Jupiter and has 3 or less bindus it makes 
one poor. 


Gaj Kesari Yoga 


Gaj Kesari Yoga will give still better results, if Jupiter has 5 or more bindus and is in 
Moon' navamsa. If in addition Venus is also in a kendra from Jupiter, and Venus and 
Jupiter are in mutual association it makes one highly fortunate. 


SakataYoga 


This is considered to be an unfortunate yoga, and is formed if Jupiter and Moon are in 
6 and 8 or 2, 12 from each other. The results would be particularly bad if Moon has 0 to 3 
bindus, and the planets are otherwise 


WCdk. 


Daridra Yoga 


If Sun occupies a bhava which in Jupiter's Ashtakvarga contains 
least number of bindus at the time of birth, a person becomes very unlucky. 


Eminent Father 
Father attains eminent position through son if lagna lord is in 2 or 9 and Jupiter is in a 


kendra with 5 or more bindus. 


Birth of a Worthy Son 


A worthy son and beacon to the family is born if dispositor of the lord of 5th is 
associated with 5 or more bindus and has the aspect, association etc. of Jupiter. 


In contrast if lord of 5th is afflicted, and Jupiter with | to 3 bindus is in "pap kartari 
yoga", a sinful son is born. 


43 


Virtuous Son 


If dispositor of 5th lord is associated with Jupiter having 4 or more bindus a worthy 
son is born. 


Yogas for ungrateful children and grand children 
1. Sth lord having connection with 8th lord without any aspect of Jupiter. 


2.5th house/lord afflicted by malefics, Jupiter with less than three bindus and Jupiter in 
pap kartari yoga. 


Number of Children 
5th from Jupiter and 5th from 5th lord give a clue to number of children. 


1. The number of bindus, after reduction, contained in the rasi occupied by the lord of 
5th from Jupiter, denote number of children. Conduct and nature of children 
will be similar to bindu lords. 


2. The figures after reduction do not give as good results as figures before 
reduction.The figures in 5th from Jupiter before reduction give better results. Take 
the number of bindus in the 5th from Jupiter before reduction. Deduct the bindus 
donated by planets in combustion, debilitation or in enemy's rasi. Increase 
bindus by planets in exaltation, retrogression and own house. The number so 
arrived at gives number of children.The number of males and females will 
correspond to number contributed by male or female children. 


3. While judging number of children care must be taken to ascertain whether 
children are promised in the horoscope or not. 


Timing Birth of Children 


1. Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Jupiter by the number of bindus (before reduction) 
in the Sth house from Jupiter in the Ashtakvarga of Jupiter. Divide the product by 
27 and find the remainder. This represents the nakshatra counted from Ashwini 
transit of Jupiter over which will give birth to a child. 


) 


Example J.L. Nehru 


Shodhyapinda of Jupiter 162 

Bindus in 5th from Jupiter 2 

162*2 = 324, 

324 divided by 27 give remainder = 0 or 27 


This gives Revati Nakshatra. In February 1917, when mother of Indira Gandhi 
conceived, the Jupiter had crossed this Nakshatra. 


2. Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Jupiter by figures in 7th from Jupiter in Jupiter's 
Ashtakvarga. Divide the product by 27. The remainder counted from Ashwini will 
give a nakshatra, the transit of Jupiter over which will give birth to a child. In 
case Jupiter is stronger in Navamsa, the counting should be made from Dhanishta 
(Nakshatra no. 23) and not Ashwini. 


Shodhya Pinda of Jupiter 162 
Bindus in 7th from Jupiter 5 


162 x 5 = 810; this divided by 27 give remainder 0 or 27. The_27th Nakshatra is 
Revati, the transit of Jupiter over this is auspicious for birth of children. 


Month of birth of child 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Jupiter by 4 and divide the product by 12. This will 
give a remainder, which will be the number of rasi the transit of Sun over which will give 
birth to a child. 


Timing Birth of Children II 


Conception take place during transit of Jupiter 

1. Over a sign carrying high number of bindus. 

2. Over Rasi or navamsa of 5th lord from lagna, Moon or Jupiter. 

3. Over Rasi or Navamsa of Gulika. 

4. Conception also takes place when Sun is transitting in a sign having maximum 
number of bindus in Jupiter's Ashtakvarga. 

5. Consummation done when the sign having maximum number of bindus in Jupiter's 
Ashtakvarga is rising, is good for conception and birth of a son. 


Chapter XII

Ashtakvarga of Venus 


0 to 3 bindus — Venus associated with 0 to 3 bindus, debilitated, combust, placed in 
6,8, and 12 and aspected by malefics, causes all kinds of troubles, calamities, phlegmatic 
disease, enmities with bosses, hostility of neighbours etc. Similarly transit of Venus in its 
own Ashtakvarga with 0 to 3 bindus gives the same unhappy results. 

4 bindus — Associated with 4 bindus or transit in a sign with 4 bindus give mixed 
results both good and bad. 


5to 8 bindus — With 5 bindus it gives friends and with 6 to 8 bindus wealth, 
prosperity, women, conveyance, jewellery and all kinds of happiness. Similarly, transit 
of Venus in signs with 5 to 8 bindus is auspicious and gives happy results. 


Conveyance and Women 


Venus placed in kendras, trikonas, exalted, in its own house, aspected by benefics 
gives many conveyances. Same could also be said with respect to ones popularity with 
other sex. This could also lead to an early marriage. 


The connection with Mars will lead to liaison with many women. 
An unafflicted Venus is a great asset to a happy married life. 


While predicting time of marriage other normal principles of astrology should be kept in 
view. Even though Venus may be in kendra with many bindus, malefics in the 2nd house 
will delay marriage. 


Dispositor of Venus 


While giving judgment on a horoscope, the importance of dispositor should not be 
overlooked. If lord of the sign occupied by Venus is associated with 5 or more bindus 
one gets all kinds of wealth, comforts and happiness. 


Wealth and Property 


Venus in the signs of Mars with 5 or more bindus aspected by benefics leads to 
acquisition of wealth and property. 


Loose Character—combinations 
1. Venus in 6, 8, and 12, with 2 or 3 bindus, with lord of the seven debilitated. 
Venus, with 5 or more bindus, exalted in navamsa and aspected by Mars. 


Venus with 5 or more bindus, in the navamsa of Mars, and Mars in its own sign. 


FF Ye N 


Mars or Saturn with 5 or more bindus in 7 and lord of 7th in the navamsa of Mars 
or Saturn or aspected by either of two, the character of wife is questionable. 


5. Venus, with 8 bindus in kendras or trikonas, makes one a commander in the army. He 
has conveyances and is rich. 


According to Jatakadeshmarga, Venus transitting a sign having highest number of 
bindus gives furnishing for bed chamber, knowledge of music, performance of marriages, 
sensual enjoyments and much prosperity. 


Happy Married Life 


Wife/Husband should be from a direction represented by the sign having maximum 
number of bindus in the Ashtakvarga of Venus. Unhappiness will result if wife/husband is 
from the direction representing least number of bindus. 


When one of the bindus in 7th house from Venus is contributed by lord of birth 
nakshatra, or its trines, husband and wife will love each other. In case these happen to 
be Rahu or Ketu, Saturn should be taken for Rahu, and Mars should be treated as Ketu. 


Transit of Venus 


Transit of Venus through a bhava containing highest number of bindus, is an auspicious 
time for learning music, enjoyment of sex, purchase of jewellery performance of 


marriage etc. 


Transit of Venus through a kakshaya having bindu in her Ashtakvarga, gives one 
elevation in status, birth of a daughter, wealth, popularity with other sex, participation in 
sports etc. 


45 


While transitting through a kakshaya void of a bindu, loss of wealth affliction to wife 
and other material unhappiness results. 
Timing of Marriage 


Multiply the Shodya Pinda of Venus by the number of bindus in the 7th from Venus 
in his own Ashtakvarga before reduction. Divide the product by 27. When Jupiter transits the 
Nakshatra represented by the remainder, marriage is likely. 


J.L.Nehru— Ashtakvrga of VENUS 
Shodhya Pindaof Venus 156. 
Bindus in 7th from Venus 2 


156 * 2 =312. This divided by 27 gives a remainder of 15 which is Swati Nakshatra 
of Rahu. Its trines are Satabhisha and Ardra which are auspicious for marriage during 
transit of Jupiter. 


Marriage is also likely when the Jupiter transits through the dasha of the lord of rasi or 
rasi itself represented by the remainder figure when the above product is divided by 12. 


Divide 312 by 12 : this gives a remainder of 0 or 12 which is Pisces rasi. Jupiter was 
in Pisces rasi when Nehru was married on 8.2.1916. 


Month of Marriage 


Multiply the Shodya Pinda of Venus by the number of bindus in 7" from the Sun. Divide 
the product by 12. When the Sun transits the sign represented by the remainder 
marriage is likely. 


Death of Partner 
Multiply the Shodya Pinda of Venus by bindus in the 7th from Venus (before 
reduction) in his own Ashtakvarga. Divide the product by 27. Obtain the remainder; when 


Saturn transits the Nakshatra represented by this remainder or its trines ill health, bad 
luck and even death of partner may occur. 


Example 


Nehru's horoscope 


Shodhyapinda of Venus 156; Bindus in 7th from Venus 2 


156x2 =312; Divide by 27; Remainder 15. This represents Swati nakshatra ruled 
by Rahu. Its trines are Satabhisha and Ardra. Nehru's wife Kamla died on 28.2.1936 
when Saturn was in Satabhisha. 


Venus and Charming Personality 


It has been observed that Venus in Kendra from Lagna or Chandralagna gives beautiful 
looks and impressive personality. If Venus is exalted or in its own sign it is known as 
Malavya Yoga, a Mahapurusha Yoga, which besides giving prosperity also gives good 
looks. Venus in lagna or in 7th house (as it aspects lagna), is good for beautiful looks, the 
more bindus it has the more impressive the personality is. In the Second House with 
more bindus the speech is sweet. 


Also observe the number of bindus in the first house in the Ashtakvarga of Venus. More 
the bindus, more charming is the personality.

Chapter XIII 


Ashtakvarga of Saturn 


SATURN is Karaka for death, disease and sorrow. It causes delays, hindrances, 
poverty, separation, jealousy and perversion. 


A strong Saturn on the other hand is good for hard work, concentration, endurance and 
spiritual life. It also is a karaka for land, fixed assets and property. 


Result of Transit of Saturn in its Ashtakvarga 


Transit of Saturn in a Bhava with 0 to 3 bindus causes disease, loss of wealth and 
property, trouble to wife and children. 


In a Bhava with 4 bindus it give neutral results. However, since Saturn has only 
maximum of 39 points, therefore, the observations have shown that 4 bindus give 
adequate strength. 


In a Bhava with 5 to 8 bindus makes one leader of masses, gives wealth and 
dominance over others. 


Same results have been attributed by some writers to a natal Saturn with different 
number of Bindus that is not found to be a reliable interpretation. Obviously much more 
research will have to be done before arriving at sound conclusions. 


While analyzing the result of transit, the basic pjles of astrology should be meticulously 
observed. The transit of Saturn in 3,6 and 11 Bhavas from Moon gives good results. The 
period of Sade Saati could be period of trouble and anxiety, if dasha is also bad. So is the 
case of transit of Saturn in 4th house or 8th house from Lagna/Moon. If the relevant 
Bhavas in Sarvashtakvarga have more than 28 Bindus, the transit of Saturn may not give 
bad results. 


Transit of Saturn in Kakshaya 


The transit of Saturn in a binduless kakshaya causes loss of health and wealth, misery 
and sorrow and may lead to death. 


The transit of Saturn in a kakshaya having bindu in his Ashtakvarga gives 
inheritance, victory, agricultural products, land and contracts with the government. It is 
good time to fight election or launch a satellite. 


Good time to start agricultural works 


The good time to acquire servants and start agricultural works etc. would be when 
Saturn is transitting over a Bhava having maximum number of bindus. But since 
Saturn is a slow moving planet, this rule is not of much use in practical application, as 
Satum would be transitting in strongest BHAVA ONCE IN 30 YEARS. 


Servant quarters, places for firewood, toilets should be located in the direction 
represented by rasi having highest number of bindus in the ashtakvarga or Saturn. 


Short Life 


It has been stated in the text books that exalted Saturn placed in a kendra and having 
1 to 4 bindus gives short life. It has also been stated that a strong Saturn having 5 or 6 
bindus and located in the first bhava causes much misery and short life and loss of 
wealth. However, a debilitated Saturn or when it is placed in enemy house, if associated 
with 5 or more bindus give good results provided Moon is well placed. 

We have not found this principle to be valid. The basic rule that Saturn placed ina 
kendra in its own house or in exaltation gives rise to Mahapurusha Yoga (Sasoa Yoga) is 
more valid. The more the number of bindus the better are the results. 

If the Saturn in lagna or in the 4th is not exalted or placed in its own house, and is 
associated with less bindus it is not conducive to long life. Being karaka for 'Ayu' and 
being weak, as also having malefic aspect at lagna, it could be partly true, but for short 
life other factors like absence of benefics in kendra, weak lagna lord, Moon and Jupiter, 
as also afflicted 8th and 10th lords are important factors which must be taken into 
account before judgement on short life is pronounced. 


It has also been stated in the texts that debilitated Saturn in lagna or in an inimical 
house with more than 4 bindus and aspected by benefics give long life. 


Combinations for Prosperity 


1 Mahapurusha Yoga (Sasa Yoga): Saturn in kendra from lagna or Moon, exalted 
or in its own sign gives plenty of power and wealth. 


2. Benefics in the 8th from lagna or Saturn and lord of that house powerful 
bestows immense riches and happiness. 


3. In Taurus lagna where Saturn is a yogakaraka, being lord of 9th and 10th, if placed 
in 3, 6, and 11, associated with 3 bindus gives rise to a powerful Rajyoga. 


47 


4. A combust Saturn when debilitated or in enemy's house in lagna or 5th house, 
in some cases other houses also and associated with 4 or 5 bindus gives plenty of 
wealth.The more the number of bindus greater the amount of prosperity and 
accompanying paraphernalia like many servants, concubines etc. 


5. Saturn and Moon in Lagna having more man 4 bindus is combination for jpoverty but 
in other kendras it gives prosperity and Rajyoga, as also quest for spiritualism. 


Adverse Combinations 
1. Saturn in 2nd or 12 in its own house (Capricorn or Aquarius lagna), and other 
malefics in Trikona give poverty, provided Saturn is with 4 bindus. 


2. Lord of 8 from Saturn or Lagna combust or in enemy's house with no benefic 
aspects. 


3. Debilitated Saturn, Mars exalted, each with 4 bindus in Saturn's Ashtakvarga and 
lord of 8th house weak. 


Timing of Death 


Transit of Saturn 


I. Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Saturn with figures in the 8th from Saturn (in some texts 
figures in 7 from Saturn are also taken) in the Ashtakvarga of Saturn before reduction. 
Divide the product by 27, the remainder gives a Nakshatra over which or its trines, the 
transit of Saturn could be fatal for the person. 


Example : Nehru's horoscope 

Shodhya Pinda of Saturn =15 8 (page 47) 

Bindus in 8 from Saturn before reduction = 2 (page 34) 

158*2 = 316; Divide 316 by 27. This gives a remainder of 19. 


Saturn at birth was in Magha Nakshatra , a Nakshatra of Ketu. Counting 19 from 
Magha gives you Nakshatra Ashwini, again a Nakshatra of Ketu. 


II. Shodhya Pinda of Saturn and figures in the sign occupied by Saturn 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Saturn by number of bindus in the sign occupied by 
Saturn. Divide the product by 27. The remainder represents the Nakshatra the transit of 
Saturn over which or whose trines could prove fatal. 


Shodhya Pinda of Saturn and transit of Jupiter 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Saturn by figures in the sign occupied by Jupiter. 
Divide the product by 12, this gives number of rasi the transit of Jupiter over which'or 
whose trines could prove fatal. 


Example: 


In J.L. Nehru's horoscope, Jupiter has 4 bidus in the Ashtakvarga of Saturn before 
reduction, (page 34) 


Multiply this with Shodhya Pinda of Saturn which is 158. 158x4 = 632 


Divide 632 by 12. This gives a remainder of 8 or Scorpio. Its trine 3Hakn are 
Cancer, and Pisces. Nehru was seriously sick when Jupiter was in Pisces and died with 
Jupiter in Aries. 


Shodhya Pinda of Saturn and transit of Sun 


Multiply the Shodhya Pinda of Saturn by figures in the sign occupied by Sun. 
Divide the product by 12, the remainder gives number of rasi the transit of Sun over 
which or its trines could prove fatal (take Ashatakvarga of Saturn before reduction) 


Example: 

Nehru's, horoscope — (Saturn's Ashtakvarga) 

Number of bindus in the rasi occupied by Sun 3 - page 34 
158 

158 * 3 =474 


ShodhyaPinda of Saturn 


Divide by 12; remainder =6 


Remarks : Sun was in Taurus, a trine of Virgo, at the time of death of Nehru.

Chapter XIV 


Sarvashtakvarga 


General Principles 


THE total benefic points in a horoscope are 337. In all there are 12 bhavas. Therefore, 
average for each bhava is 28. Hence the Bhava which has more than 28 bindus become 
strong and less than that is considered weak. The transit of a planet in a rasi or Bhava 
containing more than average bindus i.e. 28 give good results, whereas when it is 
transitting through a weak rasi/ bhava gives adverse results. It has been observed that 
planets transitting in a sign with more than 30 bindus give very good results. 


Strong planets i.e. planets in exaltation, in their own houses, in kendra or trikonas do 
not give favourable results if transitting through a house having less than 28 bindus. 
Conversely, planets in 6th, 8th or 12th, in debilitation, combust or in enemy's house do not 
give so bad results if associated with more than 28 bindus. Bhavas with less than 25 
bindus are weak. 


This rule has to be interpreted in the light of Prashna Marga that allots mimimum 
number of bindus for each bhava, below which, a house becomes weak. 


The minimum bindus allotted are: 
Lagna —25 Second house —22 Third house —29 Fourth house —24 


Fifth house —25 Sixthhouse —34 Seventh house—19 Eighth house — 24 
Ninth house —29 Tenth house —36 Eleventh house —54 Twelevth house—16 


Planets with more than 5 bindus in their ashtakvargas give good results, 
Financial Prosperity 
1. If 1st, 9th, 10th and 11th houses have more than 30 bindus each then the Goddess of 
Wealth smiles and person is rich. In the Horoscope No. B Page No. 96, bindus in 
lagna, 10th and 11th are more than 30.9th has 27 and 2nd 19. Therefore, the 
person though not very rich, is still quite well off. Less than these benefic 
points makes one poor, weak and ill. Conversely houses 9,10 and 11 having less than 25 


bindus each entail poverty. 


If 11 th house has more bindus than the 10th house and 12th has less than 11th and 
lagna has more bindus than 12th, a person is rich and well off. Here we have noticed 
that 12th house of expenditure should have less bindus than house of gains i.e. 11 
th. This is a principle of general application and gives excellent results. However, 
only in some cases we have seen that if income is from foreign sources then 12th 
house gains strength and has more bindus than 11th. 


Add the bindus in Ist, 2nd, 4th, 9th, 10th and 11th house from lagna. If this total is 
more than 164, the person will be prosperous. The figure of 164 is known 
as Vittaya for financial prosperity. In the horoscope No. B, the total of 6 above 
houses is 177, as such the person is of considerable means. 


The twelve houses are divided in four groups or "khandas". These are: 


Bandhu Ist 5th and Oth 
Sevaka 2nd 6th and 10th 
Poshaka 3rd 7th and 11th 
Ghatak 4th 8th and 12th 


Add the figures in each group. If Bandhu total is higher than that of Sevaka, then the 
person has independant means of livelihood. He may set up his own business. 


If Sevaka total is more than Bandhu, the person will be subservient to others. 


If Poshaka figures are higher than Ghatak, the person is wealthy. 


The interchange between lagna and 4th lord is a major Raj 
Yoga.lIf Ist and 4th houses have more than 32 points the person 
would be a multimillionaire. 


If number of bindus in lagna and 11th house are identical and each has more than 30 
bindus, than at or after that age one will get special honour from king and also be 
very rich. 


Planets, if associated with 6 to 8 bindus in their own Ashtakvarga bestow plenty of 
wealth to the individual. The results are accentuated if planets are exalted (with the 
exception of Saturn in lagna), or are in own or mooltrikona houses, and occupying 
kendra or trikona houses. 


Dispositor of Jupiter, if well placed in kendras or trikonas and has more than 4 
bindus in Jupiter's Ashtakvarga bestows great riches. 


If Jupiter is having more than 4 bindus and is associated with Venus in a kendra or 


49 


trikona the native becomes highly prosperous. 


10. Venus with 5 bindus in Aries or Scorpio and aspected by benefics gives wealth, 


property and vehicles. Position in kendra or trikona gives better results. 


11. Iflagna has more than 30 bindus and there are planets in 9th and 10th house, life 


will be comfortable and happy. 


12. Wealth,academic distinction, royal vehicle, will be attained after the age represented 
by the number of bindus in the lagna. This will only happen if requisite yogas are 


there in the horoscope, otherwise not. 


13. If there are more than 30 bindus in the 4th and benefic planets aspect this house, 


the person has wealth and many conveyances. 


14. When Saturn from a rasi having more than 30 bindus aspect the 4th house and lord of 


that house is in kendra from lagna one has plenty of wealth. 


15. When Lord of lagna is in fourth with more than 30 bindus, one becomes a king, 


prosperous and happy. 


16. A vargottam planet associated with 30 or more bindus advances happiness of that 


bhava to maximum extent. 


When the 10th bhava has more than 36 bindus and has no connection with malefics, 
person will lead a happy life with wealth earned by his own effort. 
When the 11th bhava has 54 bindus and has no connection with malefics, wealth 
comes without effort. 


17. 


18. 


19. When lagna has more than 25 bindus or 9th house has more than 29 bindus and each 


has no connection with malefics, one will acquire hidden wealth (treasure and in 
modern days money through lottery, sweepstakes, competition) 


20. 
21. 


Good effects will come after age represented by number of bindus in lagna. 


One becomes a Minister or gets royal assignment with more than 30 bindus in 
lagna as also in 3rd house. See Nehru's horoscope (page 48) Lagna has 30 
bindus and 3rd house has 33. 


Ancestral Wealth 


If the 4th house has more than 24 bindus and is not aspected or occupied by malefics or if 
the 2nd house is free from aspect or occupation by malefics and has more than 22 bindus in 
either of these conditions person will inherit ancestral property. 


Conversely if these two bhavas are aspected or occupied by malefics and bindus are 
less than 24 and 22 each, the person will not inherit ancestral property. 


Poverty 


If number of bindus are less than 25 in lagna, 9th, 10th and 1 Ith houses, it is not 
good for financial prosperity. Mixed results will be obtained if bindus are more than 
30 in some houses and less than 25 in other bhavas. If malefics are also in trikona house one 
becomes extremely poor. 


Find out the total of bindus in 6, 8 and 12 bhavas. If the total is less than 76, income 
is greater than expenditure. If the total is more than 76, income is less and expenditure 
is more. 


Periods for Prosperity 


The horoscope has been divided in three sections : 


7 July, 1961 


5:45 A.M, 
Horoscope B 


1. Pisces to Gemini — representing Childhood. 
2. Cancer to Libra — representing Youth. 
3. Scorpio to Acquarius — representing Old age. 


Add the figures in each Section. The section which has higher number of bindus is 
more prosperous than the other. 


In the horoscope B Page No. 96 Bindus in Pisces to Gemini are 32 + 36 + 24 + 
33 =125, bindus in Cancer to Libra are 106, and Scorpio to Aquarius are also 106. First has 
more bindus than the rest. As the Khanda of childhood has more benefic points than 
other periods, and has more benefic planets also, this was the best period of his life. 


50 


Since there are not much fluctuations in other khandas, the life on the whole was good to 
him. This is the thumb rule applied by old Jyotishis. 


According to some astrologers the sections of life should start from lagna. 
Also see which section of life has benefics and more bindus, that section of life 
will be happier. In this case the three sections will be: 
(i) Lagna to 4th house — representing childhood. 
(ii) Sth to 8th house — representing youth. 
(iii) 9th to 12th house— representing old age. 
Period of Sorrow and Agony 

1. Total the bindus from Lagna to the sign occupied by Saturn. Multiply the total by 
7 and divide it by 27. The quotient represents the age which could bring sorrow, 
misery and unhappiness. 

2. Sometime the counting is done from sign occupied by Saturn to lagna—both signs 
included and above results obtained. 

3. The counting is also done from lagna to other malefics, Mars and Rahu or from 
Rahu/Mars to Lagna. The year of agony is obtained by following above 
calculations. 

4. Total the bindus from lagna to sign occupied by Saturn as also Mars and Rahu. 
Multiply the figure by 7 and divide it by 27. Obtain the remainder in each case. 
This represents a Nakshatra and its trines, the transit of malefics over which 
could cause agony and distress. 

Periods of Happiness 


1. Similar calculations could be done in case of benefics to determine years and 
periods of happiness and auspicious moments. The benefics to be used are 
Jupiter and Venus and their transit. 


Directions 
The directions represented by various signs are : 
Aries, Leo and Sagittarius —- East 
Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn — South 
Gemini, Libra and Aquarius — West 
Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces — Nerm 


Total the bindus in 4 different set of signs. The prosperity will come from the 
direction which has the highest number of bindus and will be still more if benefics are also 
located in that direction. 


In the case of Indira Gandhi's horoscope the bindus in various directions are as 
follows 


East (signs 1, 5 and 9) 33 + 27+ 23 =83 
South (signs 2,6 and 10) 32 + 36+ 22=90 
West (signs 3,7 and 11) 24 + 30+ 25=79 
North (signs 4, 8 and 12) 24 + 28 + 33 =85 


The southern direction has the maximum bindus. No wonder Mrs Gandhi had her 
biggest support in the South which never deserted her even in her darkest hour. 


Quantum Jump 


The bindus in various 3Haku are sometimes evenly distributed that is thisraot much 
difference in Bindus in one house and the other. If the difference between one house and 
the other is moderate, this shows life is smooth and there is not much fluctuations in fate. 
However, if there is a big quantum jump between one house or the other, that will show 
that at the time of transit of slow planets like Saturn or Jupiter the destiny will fluctuate 
considerably. If the transit is from low to high figures, the luck will take a turning for 
the better and vice-versa. 


Indira Gandhi 
19 Nov. 1917 


If there is considerable gap in figures in 10th and 1 Ith; and 11th has less figures than 
10th then it could mean that career is stagnating and opportunities have been wasted. 
Bi 


Happiness and Good Deeds 

Four kendras houses (1,4,7 and 10) and two trikonas (5 and 9) represent inner 
self. If the total of bindus in them is greater than remaining 6 bhavas (2, 3, 6, 8, 11 and 12) 
which represent outer self the person is contended, has learning, knowledge, does pious 
deeds and is charitable. Conversely he has worries and will be deceitful. 


Political Power 


1. Lagna having less than 30 bindus and 3rd house more than 30 bindus confer royal 
authority in Parliament. (Nehru had this combination) 

2, If Lagna, Chander Lagna, 1 Oth and 11 th houses, have more than 30 
bindus and Lagna is aspected by Jupiter, person becomes a king or a minister. 


3. More than 30 bindus in 2, 9, 10 and 11 makes one ruler of many 
states. 


Bad Health 


1. If Moon is in the third house aspected by Sun and Mars aspects 8th house person is 
afflicted with sores. 


2. If there are malefics in the third with midling bindus (25 to 30), person suffers 
from disorder of watery humours, fatigue from travel etc. 


3. New Moon, and dispositor of Moon with few bindus (less than 25) with aspect from 
Saturn, gives mental illness.

Chapter XV 


Ashtakvarga and Transit 


It should be remembered that results of transit cannot take precedence over those 
promised in the birth chart. The birth horoscope is the main important chart containing 
the dasha scheme binding us all in the grand design of Karma. The whole scheme of 
destiny is nothing else but the unfolding of Karmas. The good or bad events that occur 
in our life are the fruits of our Karmas. 


For example if children are not promised in the horoscope then howsoever results 
may be good in transit (Jupiter and Saturns aspect on 1/5 axis), birth of children must 
not be predicted. In fact transits should be given secondary importance to main events 
promised in dasha scheme. 


While primary importance is given to transit of planets from Moon, the transit should 
also be considered from lagna. However, all the great ancient ' Acharyas' emphasize 
that transits should be considered from Moon only. 


In judging the results of transit following factors should be considered. 


1 — Transit of planets in good and bad houses 


In considering whether a transit is good or bad, the position of planets from Moon at 
the time of birth is taken into consideration in Vedic Astrology. Mantreswar states in the book 
Phaladeepika that among all the lagnas the Moon's Lagna is the most important for 
assessing the effects of transits. The sign where Moon is posited at birth is important and 
is called the radical sign of Moon, which is also known as Chandra Lagna or sometimes 
as 


Rasi. In the horoscope above the Lagna or rising sign is Gemini, while Rasi is Taurus as 
Moon is located here. 


Es) 


Good Position for transit of planets with respect to radical Moon 


Sun: gives good results while transitting 3,6,10 and 11 positions from radical Moon. 
In other houses it gives malefic results. 


Mars : gives good results while transitting in 3, 6, and 11. In other houses it is 
bad. 


Saturn : Also gives good results while transitting 3, 6 and 11 houses from radical 
Moon while it is bad in other houses. 


It will thus be observed that malefics Sun, Mars and Saturn give benefic results while 
transitting 3, 6 and 11 from radical Moon. In addition Sun is good in 10 also as it gets 
directional strength there. 


Moon is also good in 3, 6 and 11 from her radical position as also in 7 and 10th. 
Benefics Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are good in 2 and 11 and in addition; 
Mercury is good in 4, 6, and 8 and 10. 

Jupiter is good in 5, 7 and 9 in addition to 2 and 11. 

Venus is good in all houses except 6, 7 and 10. 

Rahu and Ketu : Rahu in transit acts like Saturn except in 10th from radical Moon 


where it gives great gains. Ketu gives results like Mars. 


They are good in 3, 6, 10 and 11 from Moon. 


II — Good and bad results of Planets 


Sun 


Good results with strong bindus — In addition to results due to lordship of a 
particular house Sun gives cheerful mood, victory over enemies, high status, health and 


wealth. 


Bad Results : weak bindus — Loss of wealth (houses 2 and 12), diseases due to 
affliction of Sun (blood pressure, heart disease, chest ache, eye disease, stomach ache

calamities, grief, windy and phlegmatic diseases, rheumatism, dyspepsia, deformity, 
chronic diseases. 


Till — Points of Obstruction or Vedha 


When a planet transits through a sign whether favourable or not, if there is another planet 
moving at vedha point the effects of transit will not be felt. 


Following are the benefic and Vedha points of each planet. Suppose Sun is 
transitting over the third house, it is bound to give good results, but if a planet is 
simultaneously also transitting the 9th house no good results would be produced. 
Conversely if a planet is transitting over 9th house and simultaneously another planet is 
transitting on the third house, the evil results will not be felt.

It may be noted that there is no Vedha between Sun and Saturn, as Sun is father of 
Saturn. Similarly there is no vedha between Moon and Mercury as Moon is father of 
Mercury. 


IV—A planet when transitting in a Rasi with more than 30 bindus 
gives excellent results. Similarly, a planet transitting in a Rasi which in its 
own Bhinnashtakavarga has more than 4 bindus gives auspicious results. 


V— A planet while transitting a Rasi of its exaltation or in its own 

house behaves good, whereas while transitting in its Rasi of debilitation is 
destructive. Saturn entered its rasi of debilitation on 17 April, 1998. The results had been 
disastrous on a global scale. Fires, floods earthquake wreaked havoc all around. 
Economies of South East Asia tumbled. Floods submerged the whole country of 
Bangladesh. NATO bombarded Yugoslavia on an unprecedented scale. The exodus of 
refugees from Kosova reminded one of barbaric middle ages of murder, arson and loot. 


In India the stability of the government was threatened by withdrawal of support by 
Jayalalitha, and a vote for confidence in government of Bajpai was tabled on the floor of the 
house on 15.4. 1999, which BJP lost by one vote. There were other causes also - the 
entry of Venus, lagna lord of horoscope of independent India, in Taurus /Gemini and its 
affliction which has been discussed in detail in my article in Journal of Astrology. In the 
sign Mithun, in the Bhinnashtak of Moon representing mind, in the independent 
horoscope of India, there is nobindu. 


VI —SadeSaati 


'Sade- Saati’, is a Hindi word meaning seven and a half. In astrological term it means a 
seven and half years period of transit of Saturn in the 12th, 1 st and second place from 
the location of Moon in the birth horoscope. Since normally Saturn stays in a Rasi for two 
and a half years, this covers a total period of 714 years. 


Let us illustrate this with an example : In J.L. Nehru, horoscope Moon is located in 
Cancer. His period of Sade Saati would start when transitting Saturn enters Gemini,which 
is the 12th house from Cancer. Here it stays for TA years, it then moves over to Cancer 
the 1st house from Moon, and later on after again 214 years sojourn in Cancer goes to 
Leo. This 7A years would end when Saturn completes its stay in Leo. Saturn stays in 
Gemini, Cancer, and Leo for a total period of TA years in the three crucial 3Haxu 12th, 1 
st and 2nd from Nehru's Chandra Lagna. This is the period known as 'Sade Saati. 


Mr. Katwe's definition 


A Maharashtrian astrologer, late Shri Katwe states that when Saturn is within 45 
degrees from natal Moon, Sade Saati would begin and would end when it moves again 45 
degrees away from Moon. There is some substance in this theory, as suppose Moon is 
located in Aries at 27 degrees, then would the period of Sade Saati start when Saturn 
enters Pisces, the 12th sign from Aries, or would it be more appropriate for it to start 
when it reaches 12 degrees Pisces or 45 degrees before Moon? According to Katwe period of 
Sade Saati starts at the time Saturn enters at 12 degree Pisces and ends when Saturn 
completes 12 degree Gemini and not when it enters Gemini. 


Result of Transit of Saturn in 12,1 and 2nd house from Moon 


56 


There is no mention of word Sade Saati in classical books of Astrology, yet the very (i) J. L. Nehru had his Moon in Cancer. In 1947 when he became the first Prime 
mention of this word sends the jitters through the spines of millions of naive people. It is

While there is no mention of word Sade Saati in any of the classical books yet 


mention has been made of ill effects of Saturn during transit through 12,1 and 2nd houses In Journal of Astrology, April—June 1999 issue a brilliant deep study of results of Sade 


of Moon. Let us see what these books have to say about this transit. Saati has been done under guidance of KN Rao.This proves beyond doubt that the

(ii) Indira Gandhi lost her mother in her first Sade Saati, and her husband and father in her Natal Star: The natal star is the Nakshatra in which Moon is located at the time of 
second Sade Saati. She also became a Minister in the cabinet of Lai Bahadur itth. In the horoscope of Nehru the Moon is in Cancer rasi at 17 degrees, 51 minutes, in 
Shastri during the same period. Ashlesha Nakshatra of Mercury (number 9).This is his birth Nakshatra or natal star. 


As against this: PHALADEEFPIKA has given in details the results of transits of various planets in 
different Nakshatras. This view is at variance with that given by other authorities." 
According to them the transit of planets in 3rd, 5th and 7th Nakshatra from the birth 


Df 


Nakshatra and their trines (12 and 21; 14 and 23 and 16 and 25) cause misery in life. 
The 3rd Nakshatra is known as Vipat tara (star), whereas 5th is known as Pratyari and 
7th is called as Vadha tara.When benefic planets transit these Nakshatra the results are 
not good, but when malefic planets move over these stars the results are very 
bad, specially when these are associated or aspected by malefics, or are in retrograde 
motion or become combust. 


The results of transit of various planets, as given in various classical works are as 
follows : 


Sunis malefic in Ist, 14th, 16th, 19th, 21st and 23rd Nakshatra from birth 
Nakshatra.|t is good in others. 


Moon is malefic in Ist, 19th, 21st and 23rd Nakshatra from birth Nakshatra, in 
others it is benefic. 
Mars is malefic in Ist, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 12th, 14th, 19th and 21st Nakshatra from Janam 
Nakshatra, in other places it is good. 


Mercury, Venus and Jupiter are bad in | st, 3rd, 7th, 1 Oth, 12th, and 27th star from 
birth Nakshatra. They are good in other places. 


Saturn, Rahu and Ketu : Their transit in 1st, 7th, 10th, and 27th Nakshatra from 
birth Naksnatra is evil. It is good in others. 


According to Mantresbwar the transit of Saturn, Rahu and Ketu in Ist, 9th, 1 Oth, 
11 th,26th and 27th Nakshatra from Janam Nakshatra is bad. 


Vili—Transit in Kakshaya 


This is an important concept in Ashtakvarga and because of its importance has 
been dealt in a separate chapter. Each rasi of 30 degrees is divided into eight equal parts 
of 3°45\ The lords of these kakshayas are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, 
Moon and Lagna in that order. A planet while transitting in a kakshaya whose lord has 
contributed a bindu (this can be ascertained from Prasthar chakra of each planet worked 
out earlier) gives good results, while in transitting in a binduless kakshaya evil results are 
manifested. 


There is another concept of interpretation of results. Suppose Saturn in transit 
reaches the kakshaya of Mars, and Mars has contributed one bindu, then the result of 


transit in this kakshaya will not only be good, but Saturn here will give the results of its 
own signification as also that of Mars. This has been illustrated with examples in the 
chapter on kakshaya. 


IX — Temporal Benefic and Malefic for different Lagnas 


While judging the result of transit of a planet, its lordship must be taken into 
account whether it is benefic or malefic for a particular lagna. This concept is peculiar 
to Vedic Astrology and has been elaborated by Maharishi Parashar in Brihat Prasara 
Hora Sastra. In this connection following principles should be memorized: 


(i) Lagna Lord is always benefic i.e. Mars for Aries and Scorpio lagnas 
and Saturn for Capricorn and Aquarius are benefics. 


(ii) Lord of 5th house and lords of 9th house are always auspicious. 


(iii) Mars for Cancer and Leo lagnas, Saturn for Taurus and Libra, and Venus for, 
Capricorn and Aquarius are Yogakarkas, being lords of kendra and trikona. 


(iv) Malefic lords of Kendras cease to be malefics and benefic lords of kendras have 
kendraadhipati dosha and do not give benefic results. 


X—Aspects 


The aspects during transit are also important. Benefic aspects on a transitting 
planets give good results, while malefic aspects may prove disastrous. 


XI — Retrograde Planets 


A retrograde natural benefic planet transitting a favourable house enhances the 
signification of the house, while transitting in an unfavourable house the results will be less 
destructive. 


A retrograde natural malefic becomes more destructive. If it is transitting through 
a good house, meaning 3,6, and 11 etc., its good effects are decreased. If it is transitting 
through an unfavourable house its results become more malefic. 


XII—Dasha in Operation 


58 


(i) Dasha of a benefic planet — A benefic planet whose dasha is running, while in 
transit, passing through a favorable house gives benefic effects to the 
maximum. In evil houses the benefic effects are reduced. 


(11) Dasha and transit of malefic — Transit in malefic houses make the results worse, 
whereas the transit through benefic houses reduce the harmful effects. 


XII — Effect of Combustion 


Planets when transitting through favourable position from Moon if 


become combust ( get obstructed by Sun' rays), or get eclipsed by Rahu/ Ketu cannot give 
good results, whereas they give bad results in transitting through unfavourable houses 
in similar circumstances. 


The planets get combust in their nearness to Sun within certain specified degrees. 


XIV—Pap Kartari Yoga 
If a planet, while transitting, gets hemmed in 'Pap Kartari Yoga’, its good effects 


are diluted in favourable houses, and in unfavourable houses its evil effects gets 
accentuated. 


XV—Shubh Kartari Yoga 
In Shubh Kartari Yoga the results are opposite. 


XVI— While transitting, the position of other planets should also be 
taken into account.The placement of benefic planets in 4th, 8th, and 5th and 
9th from its position are good,whereas malefic planets cause evil.These 
rules are similar to what have been prescribed by Parashar in judgement of 
dasha/antar dasha. 


XVII — In passing through the fyst 10 degrees of a sign, Mars and 
Sun give immediate results. Transits of slow moving planets Saturn and 
Jupiter are held to be most powerful. 


The two and a half year results should be judged from Saturn, the yearly results 
from Jupiter, the monthly from other planets and daily results from Moon. 


XVIII — Treating each planet as Lagna for transit results 
Phaladeepika, a respected old treatise on Hindu astrology has propounded 
the principle that for assessment of transit results the placement of each 


planet in the birth horoscope be treated as lagnas and results of various 
houses assessed accordingly. This will be clear from following example. 


To assess results of transit of Mars inTaurus, treat Taurus as lagna and predict the 
results accordingly. For example in 7th from Taurus, Scorpio sign if there are no bindus, the 
Mars transit over this sign will harm the house of marriage and will create marriage 
related problems. Similarly, if there are 6 bindus in house 5th from Taurus (Virgo), the 
transit of Mars 
over this house will give excellent results with regard to signification of this house 
1.e.education, children, romance etc. 


XIX — While transitting over a sign having no bindus in its 
Ashtakvarga, a planet will give very bad results which may even entail loss 
of life, but while transitting over a house with 7 or 8 bindus excellent results 
would be forthcoming like high government job or substantial profit in business. 


XX — Timing result of Transit 

According to Phaladeepika the good or bad results will occur only when a planet 
crosses the degree of its longitude in the birth horoscope. For example if in the birth chart 
Jupiter is at 15 degrees in Aries and it is transitting in Scorpio having 8 bindus, then the good 
effects of this house will be forthcoming only when Jupiter reaches 15 degrees. 


XXI— The effect of the house will be promoted even when a malefic 
occupies his own house. If a planet be in his sign of debilitation or in his 
enemy's house, the house occupied will be damaged. 


XXII — If a benefic happens to own a dusthana (6, 8 or 12), it will 
destroy the house occupied by him even when he may be occupying his sign 
of exaltation. "A malefic in exaltation will do good to the house occupied by 
him if it owns a good house." Phaladeepika. 


XXII — Importnat 


The transit of planets in houses containing more bindus is productive of good. This 
rule does not apply to houses 6, 8 and 12, for performance of auspicious functions.

Chapter XVI 


Kakshaya 


AS Ashtakvarga means eight types of energies released by 7 planets and one lagna, so 
forming this the basis, each rasi of 30 degrees has been divided into 8 parts of 3°45' (30 
divided by 8). These parts are known as kakshayas, each kakshaya has a lord in the 
following order: 


No, Extent in Rasi Its Lord 
1. 0° to 3° 45' Saturn 
2 3° 45' to 7° 30! Jupiter 
3. 7° 30' to 11°!" Mars 
4. 11° 15'to 15“ Sun 
5. 15° to 18° 45' Venus 
6. 18° 45" to 22° 30' Mercury 
7. 22° 30' to 26° 15' Moon 
8. 26° 15' to 30° Lagna 


It would thus be observed that the lordship of kakshaya has been allotted on the 
basis of distance of planets from earth. The farthest planet is Saturn, nearest to this is 
Jupiter, then Mars and so on. The order of planets also follows as per their motion, the 
slowest Saturn comes first, then Jupiter, then Mars and so on. 


Each planet when it enters a rasi first enters kakshaya of Saturn, then of Jupiter, Mars, 


The stay of each planet in a kakshaya is approximately as follows: 


Satum 112 days 
Jupiter 45 days 
Mars 7 days 
Sun 3.8 days 
Venus 2.3 days 
Mercury 22 Hours 
Moon 6.9 Hours 


How the concept works? 


The basic idea is that when a planet transits in a rasi whose lord has contributed a 
bindu, the results given are good irrespective of the fact whether a planet on the whole 
gives good or bad results as per normal transit rules. 


How to know whether a planet has contributed a bindu or not ? 


This is known from the chart of Prasthar ashtakvarga of a planet. See the 
horoscope oFJ.L. Nehru. The Chart of Prasthara ashtakvarga of Jupiter as calculated earlier 
is as per table II-5—Jupiter (page 20) 


From this it will be seen that in prastharchakra of Jupiter, in rasi Aries there are two 
bindus only, one contributed by Mars other by lagna. So that when Jupiter transits in Aries 
it will give good results when traversing kakshaya of Mars 7°30' to 11°15', and lagna 
26°15* to 30° as these lords have contributed a bindu each. Similarly in Taurus there are 
3 bindus contributed by Sun, Moon and Lagna, the transit of Jupiter over which will give 
benefic results. In other kakshaya results will be as per standard rules. 


Rules of Interpretation 


1. A planet transiting in a kakshaya whose lord has contributed a bindu gives benefic 
results. Simultaneously if many planets are transiting at the same times in this 
kakshaya the results are bound to be excellent. 


Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon and Lagna. It is easy to know from ephimeris a planet's2: 2- If, however, planets are travelling in binduless kakshaya, results will be evil. 


longitude and hence in which kakshaya it is and who is the lord of the kakshaya. 


60 


Ven Mer 


planet transiting in a sign gives results because of its lordship, its signification, as also 
the signification of lord of the kakshaya who has contributed a bindu over which a 
planet is transiting. 


Example : In this horoscope K we have to assess the result of transit of Jupiter in Pisces. 


Jupiter entered Pisces on 12.1.99. It was in the kakshya of Saturn from 12.1.1999 
to 31.1.1999. Jupiter is lord of 4th and 7th; four represent land, mother, agriculture 
and 7th is partnership, marriage etc. Pisces is 10th from Moon and 7th from Lagna, 
hence it is not a good position for it to transit. However, it will be transitting in its own 
house. This sign has 27 bindus in Sarvashtakvarga. Jupiter in its Ashtakavarga has 
5 bindus in Pisces. As Jupiter is transitting in Kakshya of Saturn which has 
contributed a bindu, therefore, it will give excellent result during this transit. 


If the transitting planet and kakshaya lords are friends the results will be 
much better. If they are enemies evil will be the results. 


Interpreting Dashas: Results of the dasha/antar dasha should be done in the 
same way. If dasha lord/antar dasha lord is in a kakshaya whose lord has contributed a 
benefic point the result of dasha / antardasha is bound to be good. 


Result of transit in a binduless kakshaya 


Saturn : leads to accidents, disease, loss of wealth, honour and even death. 
Jupiter : expenditure, mental worry. 
Mercury, nervous disease, loss of wealth, quarrels. 


Note: Saturn gives legacy, inheritance in kakshaya having a bindu. 


Chapter X VII 


Indu Lagna and Financial Prosperity 


ANCIENT Books on Hindu Astrology mention frequently the word 'Indu Lagna’ or Dhana 
Lagna. It is also called Visesha Chandra Yoga by Parashara. Indu means Moon, and this 
special lagna is made use of in assessing the level of wealth. However, experience has 
shown that this lagna can also be used for predicting happy events of life and 
acquisition of property etc.

How to calculate Indu Lagna 


Seven planets excluding (Rahu/Ketu) have been allotted kalas or units as follows: 


@ Sn 30 
(b) = Moon 

© Mars 6 

@ = Mercury 8 

© Jupiter D 
ti) Venus Q 
@ Satun 1 


Add kalas allotted to lord of nine from lagna as well as Moon. 
Expunge multiples of 12 and get the remainder. If the remainder is 0 make it 12. 
Count from Moon (that is why it is called Indu) as many houses as the remainder is. 


This particular house so arrived at is known as Indu Lagna’. 


61 


Example: 


(1) In the horoscope of Queen Elizabeth, lord of 9 from lagna is Mercury. It has been 
allotted 8 kalas.The lord of nine from Moon is Jupiter who gets 10 kalas. Add 8 and 
10 together, and you get 18 kalas. 


(ii) Divide 18 by 12 and you get a remainder of 6. 


(iii) Count 6 from Moon. This is Sagittarius, the 12th house which in this particular 
horoscope is Indu Lagna. 


Some of the astrologers use Jaimini system for computing Indu lagna, and make use of 
Jaimini aspects. In this kalas (rays) or units are the same. But the method of counting 
nine is different in odd and even signs. If lagna / Moon are in the odd signs counting is 
direct, if in even signs counting is indirect. Aspects used are Jaimini and not Prashari. In 
Jaimini system, movable 3Haku (Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) aspect fixed 
3Haku (Taurus,Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius) excepting adjacent ones and vice versa. 
The dual 3Haxu (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces) aspect one another. ect of 
3Haku include planets in it. 


Queen 
Elizabeth 


21-4-1926 


The more planets aspect Indu Lagna, the better are the results for wealth. 


Example: 


In the above horoscope, lagna is even sign so the counting would start in the reverse 
direction from lagna. Counting nine in this way from lagna, you get sign Taurus 
whose lord is Venus. Venus gets 12 kalas. 


Moon is also in even sign, so counting would be again in reverse direction.Nine 
counting in this way brings us to Scorpio, whose lord is Mars. Mars gets 6 kalas. Add 12 and 
6 we get 18. Divide 18 by 12 and you get a remainder of 6. Since Moon is in the even 
sign counting 6 in reverse direction brings us to Aquarius which is Indu Lagna as per 
Jaimini rule. Aquarius is fixed sign. It has the aspect of Aries,which has exalted Sun, 
and Cancer having Moon. The sign Capricorn being adjacent to Aquarius does not 
aspect it. Two powerful luminaries aspect Indu Lagna. 


How to interpret Indu Lagna 


1. Combination for immense Riches 
(1) Indu Lagna occupied or aspected by many benefic planets give lot of wealth in 
their dasha. Even aspect of one benefic is good for this purpose. This is known as 
Koteeshwar Yoga. 

(11) Exalted malefic (Saturn, Sun and Mars) planets in Indu lagna give immense riches 
towards the end — Koteeshwar Yoga. Even malefics in this lagna give wealth, 
though not so much. 

(iii) Even one benefic planet aspected by benefic or malefic gives plenty of wealth. 

(iv) Occupied by pure malefics it gives moderate wealth. 

(v) All planets situated in it or aspecting this lagna give wealth during their dashas. 

(vi) Also planets situated in trines or quadrants (trikona and kendras), from this lagna 
give wealth during their dasha/antardashas. 

(vii) It has been observed that Jupiter in transit, when it comes in kendras from this lagna, 

gives property, wealth and happiness. 

(viii) The planets situated in 3,6,8 and 12 from this lagna destroy wealth. 

(ix) Indu Lagna aspected by debilitated malefics is not good for finances. Similarly, Indu 
Lagna neither aspected nor occupied by planets is not good. 

(x) While making a judgement of Indu lagna see the condition of 2nd and 11th 
house/lord from this lagna. This will give a good idea of the level of prosperity. 

(ix) Treating Indu Lagna as the first house form an estimate of Dhana Yogas, which 
are formed by the combinations of 2nd, Sth, 9th, 11th and 10th houses/lords. 

(x) Use of Sarvashtakvarga may be made effectively in determining the strength of 
the relevant houses/lords.

Method II — Based on Bhinnashtakvarga 
Example : Horoscope—J.L. Nehru. 
Work out Shodhya Pinda of each planet as detailed in earlier chapters II, HI & IV. 


This involves following steps: 


Make bhinnashtakvarga (ashtakvarga of individual planet) of the seven planets, 
Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn. In the case of J.L. Nehru we 
have already worked this out in chapter II. 


Make reduction I and reduction If — Trikona reduction and ekadhipatya 
reduction. 

Multiply the reduced figures of benefic points after two reductions by planetary 
and Zodiacal factor to get Grah Pinda and Rasi Pinda. 

Add Grah Pinda and Rasi Pinda to get Shodhya Pinda of each planet. In the 
case of Nehru the Shodhya Pinda of planets already worked out in Chapter IV 
are

Chapter XIX 


Words of Wisdom— 
Important Principles of 
Ashtakvarga 


SOME important principles relating to Ashtakvarga as taught by K.N. Rao in the classes are 
given below: 


Principles relating to profession or career 


1. 1 Otn and 11 th houses from Lagna, Sun, Pada Lagna and Karakamsa Lagna should be 
seen; 10th for the nature of rise and 11th for the extent of rise. 


(a) If 11 has more benefic points than 10, rise in life is great. Greater the difference 
greater is the rise. 


(b) If the 10th house is strong (28 or more bindus), but 11 is weak, at some stage there 
has been a stagnation in career. 


(c) | Avery weak 10th house should not be interpreted as bad if 11 is strong enough as 
it is capable of lifting the native. 


Variation 


67 


Bhinnashtakvarga of Ascendant 
In our previous lessons we have highlighted the importance of Ascendant and 
Ascendant lord. Following principles from the bhinnashtak of lagna lord should be 
observed. 
(3) When Jupiter transits in a binduless sign, the person has little happiness. 
(ii) The transit of Saturn in signs with less bidus 0, 1, 2 or 3 leads to sickness, agony, 
quarrels, obstructions etc. 
(iii) | Person earns much wealth during transit of benefics in 3Haxu wattnforebindus. 
(iv) 


Even transit of malefics in 3Haxu with 5 or more bindus brings wealtfortune and 
good luck. 


Bhinnashtakvarga of Dasha Lord 


To ascertain the results of Dasha lord following steps should be observed. 
From the Dasha Lord i.e. the location of Dasha lord in the birth horoscope. 
1. | Examine whether dasha lord is functional benefic or malefic from lagna and Moon 


2. Examine rasbis having more or less bindus in houses as from dasha lord. 2nd and 11 
houses should have more than 5 bindus to increase prospects of wealth. If 12 has 


more bindus expenditure is more and person is extravagant. 


3. Kendras and trikonas should have more than 4 bindus for period to bring happiness 
and prosperity. 
Some Observations 
1. If there are more bindus in Sth house as compared to 7th, the native would be 
aggressive spouse. More bindus in 7 than 5 show henpecked husband. 
2. If4th has more bindus than 6, help comes from relatives. 


3. Ifthere are more-bindus in 11th than in 10th, the earning is more with less effort. 
More bindus in 10th house than 11th shows less earning as compared to effort. 


4. More bindus in 11 th than in 12th show acquisition of landed property, and amassing of 
wealth. 


10. 


11. 


If 10th house has maximum number of bindus, it may show person having an 
independent vocation. 


Maximum bindus in Sth house show a person is learned and intellectually sharp. 


More bindus in lagna mean person with reputation, impressive personality and 
sound health. Similarly Moon sign having maximum bindus ensure sound health and 
long life. 


More bindus in 12th than 11 th show more expenses than income on worldly 
pleasures. 


Maximum bindus in 6th show person will serve under someone throughout his 
life. 


Maximum in 8th connote loss of reputation, ill health and loss of prestige in 
middle age. 


Maximum in 2nd make one a good orator. 


68 


II Rahu's Ashtakvarga 


Most of the ancient books on astrology ignore Rahu's Ashtakvarga. It is only Shambhu 
Hora Prakasa which makes a mention pf Rahu's Ashtakvarga. Most of the authorities 
agree that the total number of bindus are 337. Since Rahu is only a shadowy planet, it has 
Chapter XX __ been excluded from the above scheme. 


According to the book mentioned above the benefic position of Rahu with reference to 
other planets are as follows :- 


; From Sun 1,2, 3,5, 7, 8 and 10 
Miscellaneous From Moon 1,3, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 


From Mars 2,3,5, 7 and 12 
From Mercury | 2,4, 7, 8 and 12 


Rekha Sarvashtakvarga 

THE total number of benefic and malefic points in a rasi contributed by all planets and lagna are From Jupiter 1,3, 4, 6 and 8 
always 56. Therefore, if Bindus (benefic points) are reduced from 56, we get remainder From Venus 6,7,11, and 12 
malefic units or rekhas. In the horoscope of Nehru, the Sarvashtakchakra of benefic bindus 

sastollaaes From Saturn 3,5,7, 10, 11 and 12 


If we deduct figures in each sign from 56, the resultant figures would show the sarvashtak pron baeie 3,4, 5,9 and 12 


of Rekhas or malefic points. This works out as follows: Total 44 
1. There is nobenefic place of Rahu from Rahu himself, as it is only 
shadowy planet. Hence there is no need to do reduction I or II. 


2. While transit results of Rahu through other kakshaya can be given in the normal 
way, no kakshaya has been allotted to Rahu. 


Sarvashtakvarga Sarvashtakvarga 


Br a — 3. |The movement of Rahu is in reverse, therefore, the transit through kakshaya would 
eee be as follows : Lagna, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Satum. It stays in 
a kakshaya for two and a quarter months. 


4. Result of Transit— Like other malefics the result or transit of Rahu in 3,6, and 11 
from Moon are good. They are bad in other houses. 


These rekhas are subject to normal reduction 1.e., Reduction I and Reduction II, after 
expunging multiples as was done earlier. Similarly maximum bindus and rekhas in 
Bhinashtakvarga of a planet are eight. If bindus in a rasi in Bhinastakvarga of any 
planet are 5, then rekhas in this rasi would be eight minus five or three. If Bindus are 8, Some of the authorities on Ashtakvarga are of the opinion that the Bhva chart is more 
then it means it has no rekha.* important than the rasi chart. A planet in a horoscope may be in a particular house in 


*For computations we calculate bindus only. Rekhas can be got by deducting bindus from eight. the rasi chart but in a Bhava Chart it might be in a different house because of the 
69 


III. Bhava Chart Vs. Rasi Chart 


conception of Bhava Madhya. This use of Bhava Madhya was popularized by Sripathi. 
Because of this if aplanet were in a different Bhava it would give different 
results.Therefore, it has been suggested that Ashtakvarga should be calculated on the 
basis of Bhava Chart and not rasi chart. 


2. 


In general predictive astrology it is recognized that Bhava chart is as important as a 
rasi chart. It is for this reason that both rasi and Bhava chart are scrutinized for 
sound predictions. 


Certain yogas like Gaja Kesari Yogas are formed only on the basis of bhavas, and 
not on basis of 3Haxu such as Gaja kesari yoga, whichis formed when Moon and 
Jupiter are in kendra from each other. 


As against this the authorities who believe that it is rashi that is more important have 


following things to say. 


1. 


The proper place for a planet' is a rasi and not bhava. It is on this basis that planets 
get exalted and debilitated at certain specified degrees. 


All divisional charts, navamsa, dashamsa, saptamsa etc. are based on the basis of 
3Haku. 


Jaimini astrology uses only 3Haku and not bhavas. 


Ownership of planets is based on the basis of 3Haxu only. For exampenus owns 
3naxu Taurus and Libra, while Jupiter is lord of Sagittarius and Pisces. For this 
purpose Bhavas do not come into the picture. 


The concept of Kakshaya divides 3Haku into eight parts. For thissurpose Bhavas 
do not come into the picture. 


Temporary friendship/enmity is based on 3xaku alone. 
Trikona and Ekadhipatya reductions are done on the basis of 3Hadmne. 


The laws relating to rasi gunakara are based on 3xaku alone. 


IV. Bindus 337 or 386 - Lagna Ashtak 


The total number of bindus in sarvashtakvarga are 337. Some authorities state that bindus 


of lagnashtak, which are 49, should also be included to make it to 386. Their reasoning is 
as follows : 


1. 


Parashara has given the Ashtakvarga of Lagna also to make it ashtak (eight). He 


has allotted total of 49 bindus for it. 
2. | Lagna ashtak is essential factor for calculating longevity. 
3. While lagna is fixed its lord has effects in transit. 
As Against this majority is of the opinion that only 337 bindus should be used. 
Following reasons are assigned for this : 


1. In the bhinnashtak of different planets the auspicious places from lagna have 
already been taken into consideration. There is no use adding this twice. 


2. Lagnaisa fixed entity and has no transit. 


3. Iflagna ashtak is added to total of sarvashtak becomes 386, which divided by 12 
give us a quotient of 32, but all authorities on ashtakvarga use 28 bindus as 
average strength for 3Haku. 


V. Trikona Shodhana 


In trikona shodhana we are using the principle set by Parashara. 
In a trikona group when the number of bindus is not equal, substract the lowest from the 
rest. This view is prevalent in North India. There is another group, which states that when 
the number of bindus is not equal in a trinal group makes them all equal to smallest one. 
This is used in South India and is made popular by Balbhadra of Hora Ratna. However 
both agree on the principle that if one figure is zero no reduction should be made. This is 
not consistent with second view.

Chapter XXI 


Use of Benefic points in Ashtakvarga 


THE results of the karma of the past, manifest in the shape of success, achievements, joys 
are present in the horoscope and are spread in the form of bindus or benefic points. They 
have great importance in prediction and in South India some of the astrologers do not 
give predictions without scrutiny of Ashtakvarga. 


(a) The success one attains in the world can be found astrologically in three ways: first 
Rajyogas and Dhanayogas must exist in the horoscope; secondly right dasha 
period shuld come at the right time and thirdly extent and limit of such attainment 
can be found accurately through the help of ashtakvarga. 


(b) 


Transit of Saturn and Jupiter inAshtakvarga should be synthesized with the main 
dasha for accurate forecasting results of nation's hour of glory and ignominy. 


(c) Use of Shodya Pinda is a potent factor forecasting events. 


Rules : For career prospects 10th ad 11th houses from Lagna, the Sun, Pada lagna 
and karakamsa must be seen-the 10th house for the nature of the rise and the 11th for the 
extent of rise. 


Following rules can be applied to sarvashtakvarga 


(a) See the benefic points from lagna in the 10th and 11th houses. If the 11th house has 
more points the rise will be greater : the greater the difference the higher the rise. 

(b) Ifthe 10th house is quite strong (28 or more) but the 1 1th weak at some stage there 
is stagnation in one's career. 


(c) Avery weak 10th house should not be predicted as bad if 11 th house is strong enough 
as it will lift the native. 


(d) Correlate all this to major period results. 


Variation 


Saturn being the significator for profession apply all these rules by judging the 10th 
and 11th from Saturn. In the case of politicians it is a must. In the case of bureaucrats 
having political godfathers, it is absolutely necessary. 


Tenth and 11th from Sun: in case of persons who belong to bureaucratic set up with 
father and in laws in high administrative positions and in right places of life. Example 
Sanjay Gandhi. 


Case Study (1) Gulzari Lai Nanda 
Bindus from Lagna in 10th house 31 and in 11th 38. 
Bindus from Saturn in 10th house 26 and in 11th 28. 


He was a saintly and simple figure who held important cabinet posts and became 
Prime Minister only for a brief period and could never become regular prime minister as 
his horosocpe does not have promise of higher rise,and his best yogakaraka Dasa was 
over in 1968. In his horoscope but for Mars in Lagna in Aries its own house andVenus in 
the 4th house there are no planets in kendras and 10th lord is retrograde in the 8th 
house with 8th lord. This has prevented his spectacular rise. 


(ID Morarji Desai 
Bindus from Lagna in 10th house 26 and 11th 28. 
Bindus from Saturn in 10th house 20 and in 11th 27. 


He has three retrograde planets with Mahabhagya yoga. Jupiter the 10th lord 
retrograde is aspected by 3 planets from 8th giving him spectacular rise and fall. 


(If) Charan Singh 


Bindus from Lagna in 10th house 31 and in 11th 43. 
Bindus from Saturn in 10th house 43 and in 11th 29. 


With the exception of Saturn and Jupiter all planets are in kendras from lagna, Sun 
and Moon but also from each other. But these are in dual 3Haxu because of which 
Hardeo Shastri Trivedi had told him that he would reach pinnacle of power but would 
never stay long enough. In the dasha of 10th lord Mercury he became Prime Minister 
without even being member of parliament. 


11th house is stronger from Lagna but from Saturn reverses the picture as far as 
stability of the government is concerned. 


71 


(IV) Indira Gandhi 


Bindus from Lagna in 10th house 32 and in 11th 32. 


Bindus from Saturn in 10th house 32 and in 11th 32. 
She became Prime Minister in the dasha of vargottam Jupiter 9th lord inthellth. 


(V) N.T. Rama Rao 


Bindus from Lagna in 10th house 35 and in 11th 34. Bindus from Saturn in 
10th house 21 and in 11th 35. From Saturn 10th house gets lifted by a strong 
11th house. His 6th house with 41 bindus gave him strength to fight. 


(VI) Sanjay Gandhi 
Bindus from Lagna in 10th house 31 and in 11th 25. Bindus 
from Saturn in 10th house 27 and in 11th 26. 


Here too there is no promise of a great rise either from lagna or from Saturn.But 
from Sun he has 33 bindus in the 10th house and 36 in the eleventh from Sun. He was 
the best connected young man of India, son and grandson of most powerful Prime 
Ministers.

Transit of Saturn and Jupiter 


Timing of events is done through dasha and transit. For transit full use of ashtakvarga 
should be made. Many secrets are hidden in the use of Shodhya Pinda (Suddha pinda). 


1. Good transit of Jupiter is dignity enhancement whereas weak transit of Jupiter gives 
frustration and humilitation. 


2. Good Saturn's transit is power giving whereas weak transit is period for 
contemplation about life, things and god. 


3. Take double transit of Jupiter and Saturn. When both are favourable it is dawn of a 
new era. 


4. When one is favourable and other not the strength and weakness should be 
judged from Shodya pinda. 


Jupiter's Transit : 


A prediction is the synthesis of many factors one of which is the ashtakvarga and 
Jupiter is the planet that gives dignity and protection and fame which survives the 
person. One of Dr. Raman's memorable predictions during the Second World War was 
about why King George VI will be finally victorious and Hitler would perish. Jupiter 
protected the 10th house of the British monarch while Saturn indicated Hitler's fall. 


Two contrasting instances are being given here to show how Jupiter enhances dignity 
and how when, he is weak, he causes frustration. Such a transit of Jupiter must be judged 
exclusively in Ashtakvarga ignoring whether he is yogakaraka for a particular horoscope or 
not. In September 1984 Mr. "X" whose horoscope is given below told me that: 


(a) Inspite of best, objective and conscientious work something was blocking his 
selection for one of the two or three top and prestigious jobs in his life. 


(b) He therefore thought it best to take voluntary retirement and concentrate on 
something better. What was my astrological advice ? 


My answer was that those who blocked his rise may not be there on the national 
scene at the end of 1984 and that by May 1985 he should get. if not the topmost job in his 
line, at any rate something equivalent to that as his horoscope, I insisted, was extraordinarily 
strong for rise in career. 


He got the job after death of Indira Gandhi and during times of Rajiv Gandhi in 1985. 


So, as it had to happen, the first person to know about an important 
leak in the last week of April 1985 was my young friend who came to me 


that very night after he had met and asked Mr. "X" whether it was all true- 
that he was being given the topmost job in....... well. Mr. "X" had expressed 


annoyance and surprise how top-secrets leaked so easily. 


Given below is the horoscope of Mr. "X" with only some planets and full 


Sarvashtaka. (full horoscope not given) 
Jupiter 24 Moon 26 


ee 


2 
Sun Mars 25 


Now see the analysis : 


(a) A yogakaraka Dasa and sub-period of the same Dasa was on. 


(b) Saturn, in transit, in Scorpio on the 1 Oth lord and Jupiter in Sagittarus aspecting the 
Moon completes the double transit phenomenon. 


Transit of Jupiter-The Dignity Giver 


1. Nehru died on May 27, 1964 without nominating a successor. Normally there 
would have been confusion and squabble for power. But this did not happen. Lai 
Bahadur Shastri had a smooth succession. Jupiter at that time was in Taurus, 
India's strongest house. 


2. Indira Gandhi, faced problem when Lai Bahdur Shastri died and 
Morarji Desai was a strong opponent when Jupiter was in Gemini, 
but when Jupiter retrograded into Taurus, again India's strong house, 
Kamraj had Indira Gandhi elected Prime Minister. 


3.In Nehru's best years as Prime Minister, Jupiter transited Aquarius, 
Pisces, Aries and Taurus, all strong houses of India. 


4. After Indira's death, Rajiv was able to succeed to the premiership without much 
effort as he was running good sub-period and Jupiter again was transiting in 
Sagittarius a well-balanced house in India's horoscope. 


5. Jupiter was in Aquarius (29 points) when India exploded at Pokhran on May 
18,1974 her underground nuclear device, but weak Saturn in Gemini did not help 


73 


Mrs. Gandhi create a 'wave' in then agitation-tormented nation. 


6. In India's history the period of humiliation was when Jupiter was transited in 
weak 3xHaxku having less than normal bindus. 


The weak houses in the horoscope of India as far as Sarvashtak is concerned are 
Gemini (19), Capricorn (20), Scorpio (23) Libra (25), Cancer (27) and Leo (27) are 
houses of shakiness disallowing or impeding consideration of good results. 


Before the results of double transit of Saturn and Jupiter on the sarvashtak of the 
national horoscope are applied, it must be clarified that it is nowhere suggested that 
mundane predictions should be made only from 
Sarvashtak.Only it is emphasized that sarvashtakvarga is a major factor fof qualitative 
better prediction after analyzing the horoscope with Mahadasha and relevant divisional 
charts. 

The transit of Saturn and Jupiter in Gemini has been the weakest 


transit as far as India is concerned. It has been the cause of mental agony 
of the nation as in Moon's bhinnashtak this is a weak house having zero 


bindus.....
