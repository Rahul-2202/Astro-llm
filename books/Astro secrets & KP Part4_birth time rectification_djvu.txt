PREFACE 


This book Astro Secrets and Krishnamurti Padhdhati, 
Part IV has been published with many authors articles on 
Rectification of birth time. Students of Astrology following the 
system : Krishnamurti Padhdhati which has been handed over 
to us by our Guruji Jyothish Marthand, Sothida Mannan Prof. 
K.S. Krishnamurti has been verified earlier, with many 
horoscopes for rectifying birth time as the querists were not 
sure about the correctness of birth time. They have given many 
examples with the method of calculating, birth in various places 
to arrive at the correct chart and offer results clearly to the 
pinpoint and satisfy the Querist. 


Articles selection of muhurtham as per sub lords are 
written, explaining how to choose favourable days, stars, 
lagnas, subs for any chart to start any work to buy lands jewels 
to start business, to join service etc. which are really a boon 
for those who read them. 


Moreover different methods of Dasas, Bukthis are also 
explained in length i e Vims hod an Dasa, Astothari Dasa 
system Kalachaktra Dasa system, Lagna Dasa system etc. 


Articles on Nakshathra Ganitham, timing of marriage etc 
are also dealt with in length. If the readers go through these 
articles written in simple, lucid manners it can be understood 
easily and implement for predicting purposes without any 
doubt. 


It is really worth investing and possessing this book as a 
treasure in your book collection and professional works. 


| pray the Almighty Lord Uchchishta Maha Ganapathy to 
bless the Editor and Publisher of this book K. Subramaniam, 
S/o. Prof. K.S, Krishnamurti for a Healthy long, peaceful life 
for many more years so that he can publish many more books 
on different heads and help K.P. followers & readers. 


Best of Luck.

RECTIFICATION METHOD 
birthtime and its exact meaning 


Before we start to cast a horoscope, we must be able 
to ascertain the correct time of birth. 


Generally, no birth is recorded correctly with the 
particulars to Hour, minute and second. No two watches 
agree, the birth time is noted with the help of a wrist watch 
or the wall clock in Hospitals and many of them do not 
show correct time! Then what is the remedy? The 
rectification method, in K.P. System, gives you a helping 
hand. First of all we should know what is a birth time. 


As soon as the child is separated from the mother, with 
the umbilical chord still connecting the two, the nose, ear, 
mouth of the child, are cleared by cotton, and now the 
umbilical chord is severed, the child is denied of oxidized 
blood, its gets a suffocation, and the child cries for its life! 
The air enters its mouth, fills up the lungs with air, and the 
sudden rush of air gives a kick to the diaphragm below, 
and it starts functioning till the end of life!! Hence, by its 
first cry; the child takes oxygen (Pranan) and announces 
to the world that it is an independent soul and does not 
need the help of the mother any more and can like on any 
goates or cow's milk. Till the child cries, it is the part and 
parcel of the mother, just like any other limb of hers and 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 1 


now, it is an individual soul and life. This moment of getting 
its life, is the right time of the birth of the child. How many 
of us are aware of this and how many of the Doctors and 
nurses record such correct timings! After separation from 
the mother, the will take five or ten minutes child to cry. 
Sometime, the child will forget to cry, and the doctors give 
a beating to the child and make it cry, otherwise, it will die! 
And one good friend, a doctor, asked me about the 
caesarian birth, and what time should be taken as the birth 
time, where the operation lasts for some hours. | told him it 
is as usual as the mother gets her labour pain for many 
hours, and whatever may be the process, the first cry of 
the child should be recknoned as the correct time of birth!! 
The doctor again, interrupted me, and said that could it not 
be possible, to make a child born at an auspicious moment 
by a caesarian birth? | told the doctor what will happen if 
a child forgets to cry at all? And how do the doctors know 
as to when will the child cry and how long the surgery will 
take place? And in K.P. System, even 30 or 40 seconds of 
difference in birth times, will give a wide difference, in 
their life! 


Therefore, it is quite essential that all birth time is rectified 
by applying K.P. method, a unique technique of rectification. 
The ruling planets at the time of casting a horoscope, the 
right clue, to ascertain the birth time gives. How? To-day it 
is 22nd March 1984, and you are getting a horoscope 
born at 7.00 a.m. on 10.5.1948 at Tanjore for casting. Itis 


* - R.B.T. - 2 


10.30 a.m. now, at Madras. The ruling planets are hereunder :- 


Day Lord Thursday..... JUP 
Moon sign & Star Lord 
(Anusham in Scorpio sign) 
React Mars-Sat 
Asc sign star lord 
(Rohiniin TAURUS)... 
VEN-Moon 


These planets should be inserted into the lagna to be cast 
for 10.5.1984 at 7.00 a.m. Ifyou insert these planets this 
will give (he right time of birth as noted below :- 


Sign lord, Star lord Sub lord, Sub, Sub lord 
VEN...MOON...MARS.. JUP 


(Saturn omitted as it is retograde to day) i.e. TARUS 11°16" 
23") 

This is the nirayana lagna cusp of the horoscope. Add 
Ayanamsa of 1948 to the lagna cusp and work out the 
corresponding sayana houses from the table of houses and 
also the Sidereal time. The difference of time between 
sidereal time (given for 5.30 A.M. in the ephemeris for 
10.5.1948) and the sidereal time of birth added to 5.30 A.M. 
is the correct time of birth. 


Note : The process of 10 sec correction per hour and 
L.M.T. should be employed, as per procedure)

RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME 


When one is doubtful about his exact time of birth, but 
says that it may be around 15 minutes this way or that is 
there any method by which one can find out the exact 
moment of birth? 


Answer: 


| shall give some of the methods which are available. 
How far you can rely on then, is left entirely to you, to the 
readers and to the research scholars. 


(1) Convert the approximate time of birth given in |.S.T. 
to Vighatis after Sunrise. (Sunrise will be given in L.M.T. 
convert to !.S.7.). Multiply by 4 and divide by 9. The 
remainder is the number of the star counted from Aswini, 
Makham or Moolam. Suppose Sun rises at 6 A.M. Birth is 
at 8 A.M. That is, the birth took place 2 hours after Sunrise. 


1 Day - 60 Ghatis = 3600 Vighatis 
1 Hour = 2% Ghatis = 150 Vighatis 
1Ghats = 24" Min = 60 Vighatis 
1 Minute = 2 _ Vighatis 


1 Vighatis = 24 Seconds 


If the birth is 2 hours after Sunrise then it means it is 5 
Ghatis=300 Vighatis. 


Multiply by 4 and divide by9 . 
Then 300x4_1200=4 443 
0x4 1200 = 1 33 ¢ 


- R.B.T. - 


Remainder is 3. It means that Moon at the time of birth 
should be in the nakshathra which is the 3rd from Aswini 
or Makham or Moolam i.e., it may be Karthikai or 
Uthrapalguni or Uthrashada. 


But, suppose the star is Chithra, then one is to find out 
that Vighati, next to the number of Vighatis given by 
consultant 


He mentioned 8 a.m. =300 Vighatis after sunrise. So 
you should add or subtract 1 Vighatis or 2 or and so on till 
you get the remainder 5 which shows the three stars 
Mrigasirisha, Chithra and Dhanishta. 


Therefore if one gets 305 Vighatis or 296 Vighatis the 
remainder after multiply by 4 and dividing by 9 will be only 
5. But the person says that it may err to a maximum of 
fifteen minutes either way. Then find how many Vighatis 
will yield the same result. 


The following Vighatis will give the remainder 5. 
278; 287; 296; 305; 314; 323; 332; 341 and soon. 
278 Vighatis is after 7.45 A.M. and 

241 Vighatis is before 8.15A.M. 

Which will you give? 

(2) Another method mentioned is as under- 


Note where Mand i was at the time of birth. The lagna 
sign will be either 5 or 7 or 9 or 1 when counted from the 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 


sign occupied by Mandi-(Then alternatives are given-either 
to Moon or lagna, either in rasi or navamsa). 


If Mandi and Lagna are to be in 1 ,5,7 or 9 the consultant 
asks, why then the same author gives the results of Mandi 
occupying any house from lagna, i.e., the first, second, 
third, fourth etc., up to 12. 


How to reconcile? 


If the sign is to be either 5 or 9, (for example) it can be 
useful to find the lagna, correct to 30°. 


If navamsa is taken, the position of Lagna is correct to 
3° 20°. A s the navamsa lagna changes roughly once in 13 
to 14 minutes, how far will this calculation give a precise 
answer? 


(3) In Uthra Kalamrita, it is said that the interval between 
Sunrise and the time of birth is to be converted into Vighatis. 


Divide by 225. 


Then males are born if the remainder is between 0 and 
15; or 45 and 90; or between 150 and 225. Females are 
born if the remainder is between 15 and 45 or between 90 
and 150. 


According to this method, we have to multiply 53% Ghatis 
by 60 (he has taken the time of birth as 53% Ghatis) to 
convert them to Vighatis, thus=53*4x60 or215x15. This has 
to be divided by 225. Thus, 215x15+225= 14”. This falls within 
the first group of 15 which shows that the sex is male. The 


- R.B.T. - 


mistake is that when 215x715 is divided 225, it goes 14 times 
and the remainder is '75,. Luckily 75 remainder also shows 
‘male. 


In the first example taken, when a first principle is applied 
the birth may be between 278 and 341 Vighatis. So the 
remainder may be 53 or 62 or 71 or 80, or 89 or 98 or 106 
or 115. So if the consultant is a male (presuming that the 
horoscope belongs to the consultant) then 55;62;71 ;80 will 
be one of the timings. If the consultant is a lady, then the 
number of Vighatis will be 98 or 106 or 115 when both the 
rules 1 and 3 will be satisfied. 


(0) Pre-natal-Epoch. 


Much is said aboutthis. Very briefly let me state how it 
is not useful to one and all. Suppose two persons are born 
with the ascendant and Moon as shown below, say, they 
are born at an interval of 30 minutes on the same day. 


ChartA 


-- ASTRO SECRETS & KR - 7 


According to the rules, find where lagna and Moon at 
the time of Epoch ta A and B are. Moon is passing 10° 17° 
in Aquarius, on the same day, which is the position of 
Moon on the day of Epoch. 


What is the rule, find out the exact time on the day of 
epoch when lagna for A will be Gemini 6° and for B lagna 
will be Gemini 6° 15". 


It can be only one minute. 


If the lagna of Epoch were to be, say, 2 P.M. to A, then 
for ‘B’ it will be only 2-01 P.M. 


Now we have to calculate where Moon would be, on the 
day of epoch, for A at 2 P.M. and for B at 2-01 P.M. 


Itis more or less the same position : probably it moves 
by 0-5 minute. 


-RBI.- 8 


So, in the Epoch chart it is worked out and found that 
when Gemini 6° rises, on the day of Epoch, Moon was 
actually in 13° 15'40". 


Whereas for B, when the ascendant is in 6° 15, Moon 
was in 13° 1620”. 


Now, we have to take that, for A’ in his horoscope, the 
lagna should be 13° 15'40” and for the chart B, lagna is 
13° 1620". 


Think, a while. If one's lagna on a particular day is 
13° 15'40" and the other's lagna on the same day in 13° 
16'20", what should be the intervl between one's birth and 
the other. Itcan only be 2 minutes. But what is the actual 
interval-30 mts. Then how far we can boldly declare this to 
be a method for rectification is to be judged by the readers. 


Let us take two births actuals. 


In a hospital on 8-11-1945 there were two births. One 
child was born at 5.30 p.m. The same nurse went to the 
next room and attended upon another lady and another 
child was born at 6 P.M. on 8-11-1945, Both want to find 
out the correct time of birth by applying Prenatal Epoch. 


The horoscope of the child born at 5.30 P.M. on 
8-11-1945 at 25° 19'N and 12° 30’E and that of the other 
at 6 P.M. in the same hospital are as under :

A couple may have pleasant time every night. Yet, one 
cannot say which night function would have been fruitful. 


The day itself is not definite. Further, the male spermatozoa . 
can enter into female ova at any time after copulation within 


- R.B.T. - 10 


a period of 38 hours. Therefore at which moment, the epoch 
commences, nobody can say, even though one knows the 
few minutes of pleasure. 


Generally, from the time of epoch, the growth commences 
and the intrauterine life will be found nine months, i.e., 
nine solar months or ten lunar months. 


1. There may be an increase or decrease in this period. 
It is found that it depends upon fourfactors :i.e., (a) whether 
Moon was waxing-Sukla Paksha, increasing in light or the 
longitude between Sun and Moon is increasing from the 
New Moon; or (b) Moon was waning-Krishna Paksha, 
decreasing in light or the longitute between Sun and Moon 
decreasing from the time of Full Moon; (c) whether Moon 
is found above the horizon, anywhere tn the houses 12, 
11, 10, 9.8 or 7; (d) or Moon is found below the horizon, 
anywhere in the houses 6,5,4,3,2 or 1. 


Then, the period of intea-uterine life in above nine solar 
months is (a) Waxing Moon, is below horizon (houses 1 to 
6) or (b) Waning Moon is above horizon (houses 7 to 12) 
and it is less than nine solar months if (a) the Waxing 
Moon is above horizon (houses 7 to 12), or (b) the Waning 
Moon is below horizon houses 1 to 6). 


Il. To find out which sign would have been occupied by 
Moon on the day of Epoch and which part of the Zodiac 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 11 


will be rising at the time of Epoch one is to follow the 
following rules. 


Suppose, at the time of birth, it was Sukia Paksha, i.e., 
Waxing Moon, then the ascendant at the time of Epoch will 
be the sign and the position of Moon at the time of birth. 
The day of Epoch is that day on which (around 9 months 
prior to birth) Moon transited in that sign and around the 
degree of the lagna at the time of birth. 


In the above examples, Moon gets separated from Sun. 
New Moon was over. It is increasing in light. It is called 
Waxing Moon. As the Lagna in the first example is 21 °6'. 
Taurus, 7th cusp will be 21° 6' Scorpio. Taurus, 7th cusp 
will be 21° 6' Scorpio. Therefore Aries, Pisces. Aquarius 
Capricorn, Sagittarius and the portion between 30° Scorpio 
and 21° 6' Scorpio are above the horizon. 


Hence the portion of lagna at the moment of Epoch 
should be 24° 11’ Sagittarius (which was the position of 
Waxing Moon at the time of birth). Further the day of Epoch 
will be 18th February 1945 (9 months before the birth time) 
when Moon was transiting around 21 ° 6’ Taurus. 


In the second example, the position of lagna at the time 
of Epoch will be 24° 26' in Sagittarius (which was the position 
of Waxing Moon at the time of birth) and the day of Epoch 
will be 19-2-1945when Moon transits 29° 29’ Taurus. 


-R.B.T. - 12 


Ill. Find the exact time on the day of Epoch when that 
part of the Zodiac will rise in the East on the day of Epoch 
which is the position of Moon at the time of birth. 


For this, one is to take the Table of Houses for the 
Latitude at which the mother stayed during those pleasant 
days. Here in these examples, the mother was during the 
pleasant days and the painful day, all along, in the same 
place. So from the Table of Houses for Latitude 25° 19”, 
look down the column “Ascendant-when you come to the 
7th line on the right side page, you will find Asc, 24° 15' 
Sagittarius when the sidereal time would be 12 hours 22 
mts. and 2 secs. If you calculate, you will find that 24° 11' 
Sagittarius would have risen when the sidereal time was 
12 hours 21 minutes 44 seconds. Suppose a child is born 
on 18-2-1945 and you find the sidereal time at the time of 
birth of a child is 12 hours 21 min. 44 seconds, then what 
is the actual time of birth.

- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 43 


lf you calculate deducting rectification for the interval of 
10 secs. per hour, you will get figure 14 hours 27 mts. as 
the interval between previous noon and the time of birth 
Le., 2-27 a.m. on 19-2-1945. 


Find out the position of Moon at 2-27 a.m. on 
19-2-1945 Moon at 2-27 a.m. on 19-2-1945 will be 23° 36 
In Taurus. 


Similarly if one works for the time on 15-2-1945 when 
Asc 24° 26’ Sagittarius rises, it will be found that the 
sidereal time would be 12 hours 22 mts. 50 secs. and the 
time of birth will be 14 hours 30 mts. 30 secs. added to 
previous noon i.e., 2-28-5 A.M. on 19-2-1945. 


Calculate the position of Moon for this time 2 hours 28 
mts. 5 secs. a.m. on 19-2-1945. It is 23° 36' in Taurus. 
Therefore the lagna at the time of birth for one born at 
5-30 p.m. is arrived at as 20° 30' in Taurus and the other 
born at 6 p.m. is found to be 20° 36' 1", as the Position of 
Moon ai the time of Epoch is the Position of lagna at the 
time of birth, if Moon at birth was waxing. 


Will this method of rectification be useful? 


According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati and the simplest 
method of multiplying the number of Vighatis from sunrise 
to the time of birth by 4, dividing the product by 9 and 
counting the star from Aswini trine will give the exact Vigati. 


-R.B.T.- . 44 


This method gives confidence, convinces one and 
proves to be correct. 


in Brihat Jataka, written by Varaha Mihira In Chapter 
26, there are 17 stanzas to cast the horoscope of a person 
whose time of epoch (impregnation) and also the time of 
birth is not known. He gives the method to erect a horoscope 
from the time of query. 


From this, one can understand that the time of birth and 
the urge to work out and erect the horoscope of native 
from the moment of query has a direct bearing. They are 
inter-linked. There can be no second opinion. 


Therefore, one is to follow the following method : 
(1) Note the lord of the day when the query is answered. 


(2) Note the star at that time i.e. the lord of the constellation 
in which Moon transits. 


(3) Find the lord of the sign in which Moon is 
(4) Whois the lord of the lagna. 


These planets will be same who govern the sign in which 
the lagna is, the constellation in it, the sub and the sub-sub 


Examples - 


(a} A person wanted to know whether his lagnais Taurus 
last degree of Gemini first degree, so that he may know 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 15 


whether Venus or Mercury is the lord of the lagna. This 
person visited at 9-5 a.m. on 27-4-1966. The lagna at the 
time of query was Gemini owned by Mercury. The day is 
Wednesday governed by Mercury. Moon is in Punarvasu 
star ruled by Jupiter. It is in its own sign and is aspectea 
by Mars. Hence Mercury, Jupiter, Moon and Mars are the 
ruling planets at the time of query. 


The doubt is whether it is Venus sign, Mars star, Saturn 
sub i.e. between 2 7°-53'-20" and 30° Taurus or between 
0° and 1°-53'-20" which is jointly ruled by Mercury lord of 
the sign, Mars, the lord of the constellation and Mercury, 
lord of the sub. 


The ruling planets at the time of query have nothing to 
do with Venus and Saturn. But Mercury and Mars agree. 
Then what about Jupiter and Moon. As Jupiter is inlagna 
at the time of query take as Jupiter sub sub. 


Calculate the time when sub sub of Jupiter will rise on 
the day of the birth of the native. That is the time of his 
birth. His lagna is Gemini and its lord is Mercury. Venus is 
not the lord. No other rule can catgorically eliminate one 
and correctly give the true lagna. Is not this method 
convening? 32 of my students who are very intelligent tried 
to put this method to test. They tested on their horoscopes 
and they published for the readers to use this method and 
be benefited. 


-R.B.T.- 16 


(2) Another person on 3-5-66 asked whether he is bom 
is Scorpio or Sagittarius. The day is Tuesday ruled by 
Mars. Moon is in Virgo owned by Mercury, the constellation 
is Chitra governed by Mars. Moon is aspected by Saturn, 
Mercury and Venus. 


The doubt is whether the lord of the sign is Jupiter or 
Mars. Actually the birth will be in Mars sign Scorpio, 
Mercury Star Jyeshta, Saturn Sub between 27°-53’-29" 
and 30° Scorpio. It cannot be Sagittarius as the time of 
query has nothing to do with Jupiter. 


Next after finding out the sub, one is to calculate when 
that sign, constellation and sub will rise in the East on the 
day of birth and when it will be over. 


In the first case, Gemini sign rose in the East 5 Ghatis 
16 Vigatis after sunrise Le. 316 Vigatis after sunrise. 
Multiply 316 by 4 and divide by 9. 4 is the remainder. 
Count from Aswini trine. His star in which Moon transited 
at the time of birth should be, according to this calculation. 
Rohini or Hastham or Sravanam. But his star is Jyehta. 
The remainder should be 9. Then to add or deduct one. 
Vigati from the time of birth. The nearest one shows the 
actual Vigati of birth. If you add one more, balance is 12 
or 3. If you add one more and do the process remainder 
is 7 and so deduct one from 316. You get 315. Multiply by 
4. The product is 1260. Divide by 9. It goes 140 times 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 17 


which may be taken as 139 times and that remainder is 9. 
When you count from Aswini trine, it agree. Therefore, 
declare that his time of birth was 315 Vigatis after sunrise 
on that day, to that locality. 


The above method alone can clearly fix the position of 
lagna, give the correct time of birth and convince the 
consultant. 


(An Astrologer has to pray; gain the Divine Grace; 
develop irtuition; but treat this science scientifically; God 
never fails to guide. He gives the tip to correctly eliminate 
the incorrect one and select the right one accurately) 


Another example to decide time to birth : 


During war time, the clocks showed one hour in advance 
of actual time. A native born in 1942 has got his horoscope 
correctly erected for his time of birth. But has got the doubt, 
whether the time taken for erection of horoscope was actual 
time of birth from the clock time. His horoscope is given 
below. According to this, the time taken for calculation was 
4-26 a.m. (correct time). The clock time might have been 
5-26 at the time of birth. The problem is to find out whether 
the chart below is correct: 


8-11-42 


Time of birth. 4-26 A.M. 
of bir on 91442 


R.B.T. - 18 


On 7-4-66 at 7-35 a.m. the ruling planets are as below :- 
1. Jupiter : Lord of the day-Thursday 
2. Rahu : Lord of the day-Swathi. 


3. Venus : Lord of Libra-Thulam (Rasi) in which Moon 
was transiting. 


4. Mars : Lord of the lagna Aries-Mesha. 


5. Venus : Lord of the star Bharani rising in the east at 
7-35 a.m. 


Rahu, unaspected by any planet represents lord of the 
sign Taurus-Rishaba in which it is posited. Lord of Taurus- 
Rishaba is Venus. Rahu represents Sun, since it is in the 
constellation Karthik ruled by Sun on 7-4-66. 


Hence, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Venus should have ruled 
native's time of birth. The native was born on Saturday 
ruled by Sun. At 4-26 a.m. on 9-11 -1942 (birth day) exact 
time, the lagna was Libra-Thulam. Star rising was Chitrai. 
The sign Libra-Thulam is ruled by Venus. The constellation 
rising is ruled by Mars. Moon was transiting in Visakam 
star ruled by Jupiter at the time of birth. Hence at 4-26 
a.m. exact time on 8-11-1942 the ruling planets were Sun, 
Mars, Jupiter and Venus. 

lf the birth were to be at 3-26 a.m. (exact time) lagna 
would have been in Virgo-Kanni ruled by Mercury, the star 
rising in the east would have been Hastham ruled by Moon. 
Since Mercury and Moon do not rule the moment of 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 19 


analysis, the native could not have been born at 3-26 a.m. 
exact time. 

Let us find out whether 5-26 a.m. exact time 
corresponding to clock time of 6-26 a.m. might have been 
the birth time. At 5-26 a.m. (exact) the star rising was Swathi 
ruled by Rahu in the sign Libra-Thulam ruled by Venus. 
Since Rahu and Venus rule the present moment this could 
have been the birth time. 


Now how to select? Was it 4-26 a.m. or 5-26 a.m. (both) 
time exact time, when the birth took place? 

(1) Find out the lord of the lagna at the moment of 
analysis. This should have been the sub sub lord rising in 
the east at the time of birth. 

(2) At 4-26 a.m. on 9-11-1942 find out lord of star rising, 
lord of the sub rising and lord of the sub sub rising. Lord of 
the sub sub should be Mars (lord of lagna at the moment of 
analysis) if 4-26 a.m. exact time were to be correct. At 
5-26 a.m. on 8-11-1942 (exact time) sub sub lord of the 
star rising in east was not Mars. Hence the native should 
have been born at 4-26 a.m. on 9-11-1942 corresponding 
to the clock time 5-25 a.m. since the clock showed one 
hour in advance of actual of exact time.

HORA AND ITS USE 


The ecliptic is the apparent pathway of the Sun in the 
Heavens. The planets and the other luminary Moon, follow 
their own individual tracks with he along the ecliptic on 
north and south of it. This width on either side is about 77° 
and hence the pathway of the planets is around 75° in 
width having the ecliptic in its centre. This is called the 
Zodiac. 


If one observes, it will appear that the whole Zodiac goes 
round the earth once a day, i.e., once in 24 hours and the 
same portion of the Zodiac rises in the east in 23 hours 56 
minutes and a few seconds. 


As the Zodiac is divided into 12 equal parts called Solar 
mansion (sign or rasi) (Mesha-Aries to Meena-Pisces), 
each division win be appearing in the east, roughly for a 
duration of 2 hrs. In other words, the previous sign will 
appear to rise up in the heavens and the next sign will 
commence to rise nearly two hours after the previous sign 
began to rise. Hence the 12 signs rise in the east, roughly 
at an interval of 2 hours. 


The Hindu astrologers have subdivided each sign into 
two halves and called such a division as a Hora. Hence 
roughly one hour is needed for each Hora to rise in the 
east or pass through the Meridian. But the Hindu astrologers, 
in olden days, did not calculate the time in hours and 


_-R.BT- 22 


minute!!. They used to measure in Ghatis and Vigatis or 
Naligai and Vinadi. Hence a day is of 60 Ghatis. Hence 
each sign is approximately 5 Ghatis and half of a sign or a 
Hora will be about 2’2 Ghatis. 


Pharos in Chaldean star lord says: In remote and ancient 
Chaldean the knowledge of the stars and the framing of 
the Zodiac were the results of the Divinely Inspired Gifts to 
the wise men. The book of Genesis. the Mosaic Era, the 
Baby-lonic and Hindu Empires were non-existent when the 
Chaldean sages laid down the axiom that 'Obstral spheres 
exert 'Obtinual influence on terrestrial life. ‘Chaldeans 
followed the Hora and found out the influence of the planets 
over the affairs. of the people. Also it was said that certain 
hours are advantageous for certain matters and certain 
hours are unfortunate for. some affairs. This method of 
prediction is called ‘Hora’. 


The ‘Hindus’ also were aware that certain matters thrive 
in some hours (i.e., 2i Ghatis periods) and some fail in 
certain hours (21 Ghatis periods). 


Both the Hindus and the Chaldeans do not follow the 
same calculations to find out which planet rules a particular 
time-though the order of the planets is the same. 


First, let us know something about the days and then 
about the hour or otherwise called ‘Hora’. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 23 


Sunday Tamil Nyayiru, Telugu Adhivaram, others- 
Bhanu-varam, Ravivaram etc., in India.

Friday Sukra, Brigu, Velli; English-Verus, Italian-Venerdi 
(Venus). French- Vendredi (Venus). 


Saturday Sani, Mancha, English-Saturn, Dutch-Zaterdag 
(Saturn). 


The results signified by the planets do predominate in 
the above order. Hence the names of these days are arrived 
at according to the effects agreeing with the particular 
planet. 


- R.B.T. - 24 


Probably, the same effects repeat once in 7 days and 
hence only seven days in the week are fixed; e.g., on 
Sunday some matters flourish; on Monday some other 
affairs thrive and after 7 days, the same matters have 
advantage on Sundays, Mondays etc. 


As regards the Hora division, the Hindus do not take the 
time of sunrise for their calculations. They follow strictly 
according to the time mentioned below:

From the table it may be observed that the planets 
rule the hours in an order which is the alternate days in the 
reverse order. Suppose Sun rules a particular hour. Then 
note. in the reverse order, the days of the week. The 
alternate one is Friday ruled by Venus. Hence Venus rules 
the hour, after that of the Sun. Similarly, Thursday is before 
Friday and Wednesday is the alternate one in the reverse 
order to Friday. Wednesday is ruled by Mercury. Hence 
Mercury rules the hour after Venus. Thus the order of the 
hours is worked out. 


It will be a pleasant surprise to note that after 24 hrs., 
that planet which rules between 6 and 7 A.M. is the same 

planet which governs the day. Therefore, irrespective 
of sunrise, the locality and the part of the year in which 
one wants" to find the planet ruling a particular. time. simply 
refer to the above table. 


But Westerners and Chaldeans calculate in a different 
manner. They divide the interval between the time of sunrise 
and noon into 6 equal parts and each will be little more or 
less than an hour depending upon the interval between 
sunrise and noon. Similarly the interval between Moon and 
sunset is divided into 6 equal parts. Likewise, the time from 
sunset to midinight and from midnight to sunrise is worked 


-R.B.T.- - 26 


Suppose one wants to note the time when Saturn will 
rule its hour on Wednesday, so that one can avoid (a) to 
sign an agreement in that period or (b) to fix the marriage 
during that time or (c)to meet a person to negotiate any 
transaction etc. Adopt the following principle: 


(1) What is the Indian Standard Time of Sunrise in 
that locality on that day? Let it be 5-10 A. M. 


(2) What is the Indian Standard Time at noon in that 
locality on that day? Let it be 11-59 A. M. 


(3) Therefore, the difference between Sunrise and 
noon will be 6 hrs. 49 min. 


(4) Divide this by 6. Then you get 1 hour 7 min. for 
each division. 


(5) The day selected is a Wednesday. Hence from 
sunrise 5-10 a.m. to 6-17 a.m. Mercury rules the time. The 
next is governed by Moon. Hence 6 .17 a.m. to 7-24 a.m. 
is ruled by Moon. The next belongs to Saturn; i.e. Saturn is 
the lord for the duration from 7 -24 a.m. to 8-31 a.m..,. 


Therefore this period is governed by Saturn on a 
Wednesday ruled by Mercury. Therefore this conjoined 
period of Saturn and Mercury are to be avoided for such 
action- as mentioned above. When this conjoined period 
operates in the night and one spends his pleasant time. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 27 


with his wife, he can avoid birth of children. This is an 
effective method of ‘birth' contro!' as both Saturn and 
Mercury are effeminate planets. But people, planting 
fruitbearing trees in such conjoined planetary hours, will 
have very poor yield: the loss will be not only due to locust, 
pest, rats, etc. but also due to the scarcity of water-supply 
and fertiliser. Hence for every action, one is to note which 
planets will contribute for peace, prosperity, success, etc.., 
and which planets are detrimental. Accordingly one can 
make a selection and enjoy the fruits. 


(Now the question arises, whether one can come out 
successful by selecting such periods, even though he runs 
a very bad period according to dasa or according to 
progression, people running bad time (a) will never follow 
this, or (b) even if he tries to follow he will do in the evil 
sub-division of the planetary hour. What is the sub division?) 


The planetary hour is sub-divided among the 7 planets 
Uustas, a dasa is divided among 9 planets as bhuktis and 
each bhukti is again subdivided among the same 9 planets 
called antharams.) 


The first subdivision belongs to the planet which rules 
the hour and then the sub divisions are governed by the 
other planetsin the same order. Suppose the hora hour is ° 
ruled by Venus; then the first subdivision belongs to Venus 


a 


- R.B.T. - 28 


and the’ other 6 subdivisions will be governed by Mercury, 
Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and Sun. 


What is the use of this sub-division? 


(1) Just as on a Wednesday, the hora of Saturn is to be 
avoided for some actions and transactions, so also, in the 
few minutes of the conjoined periods of Saturn sub-division 
in the Mercury hora ahd Mercury sub-division in Saturn's 
hora are to be avoided. 


(2) Ifa person enjoys Jupiter dasa, Moon bhukti, he 
can undertake to do any important work during the hora of 
Jupiter and sub of Moon. 


(3) If Mars dasa, Jupiter bhukti operates to one, and if 

the judge announces the judgement favourable to one, 
then the time at wtlich he pasess it, will be during Mars 
hora, Jupiter sub or Jupiter hora Mars sub or Mars day 
(Tuesday) and Jupiter hora or Jupiter day (Thursday) and 
Mars hora. Inthe latter case the sub will be ruled by either 
ofthe two or any other significator contributing to his 
Success. 


14) If one wants to construct a building, he prefers the 
conjoined hora of Mercury and Mars. 


(5) One desiring to get married, will select the conjoined 
planetary hour of Venus and Jupiter. 


The above is general. Further while selecting a Hora 
the most important factor has seen omitted which is a 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 29 


serious mistake i.e., (a) one does not take into 
consideration which part of the Zodiac rises in the East 
and what the lagna is (b) nor does one consider the 
position of planets at the time and their relative position 
to the ascendant. to the cusp of that house which signifies 
the particular matter and to the karaka planet which also 
rules the same matter. 


Indeed, these three are the important investigations to 
be made while electing a muhurtha. 


But for common undertakings and the usual daily 
business Hora will be helpful to offer confidence, peace 
of mind and mostly success. 


Sun-Hora: 


Sun is the lord of Sunday. The Hora of Sun will be 
most potent whenever Sun is strong i.e., whenever Sun

scorpio-Vrischika. It is the lord of the stars Mrigasirisha, 
Chitra and Danishta. It gets exalted in Capricorn -Makara. 


Hence the Hora of Mars will be most potent whenever 
Mars is strong by transiting in its own or exalted signs or in 
its stars and on Tuesday, Suppose on a Tuesday, when 
Mars is in 23° 20' to, 24°-06-40' in Capricorn in exaltation,

The Government has to choose Jupiter Hora if they 
lay foundation for hospitals (on Sundays), shipping (on 
Mondays); buildings for Police, Military, Magistrate court, 
law courts, 


Industry etc. (on Tuesdays); for educational Institution, 
postal departments, communication, All India radio,

and difficulty in completing the project. (b) expansion 
and improvement, (c) co-operation from the public and 
their wholehearted support, and (d) fulfilment of the 
desire of the Government and benefit to the subjects. 


Venus- Hora: 


Itis otherwise called Sukra, Brigu, Velli, etc. It governs 
Friday. 


The Hora of Venus is very strong for Venusian matters 
(a) on Fridays, (b) on the days when Moon transits in 


- RB.T. - 42 


Bharani, Poorvapalguni and Poorvashada constellations and 
(c) when Moon transits in Taurus or Libra or or Pisces 
which is its exalted sign. If on a Friday, during Venus Hora, 
when Moon transits in its own star. one comences to do 
any of the matters signified by Venus knowingly or 
unknowingly, success is sure. Peace and prosperity are 
promised. Harmony and happiness can be had. 


Prefer Venus Hora if you want to meet an officer who is 
generally impatient, who is a hard task-master and who is 
moody. You will find that he is calm and co-operating. Even 
militant type of person, arrogant, foolhardy and rash will 
give a patient hearing and will be helpful, The temper gets 
softened during this hour. A cobra may be ferocious due 
to Mars. But if it takes its food, which is shown byVenus, it 
is harmless. The fiery nature of Mars will be toned down by 
Venus. 


If you have to look at the girl or at the boy before fixing 
up your marriage, you select Venus Hora if you want to 
select this "partner, but if you do not like the alliance, you 
select Mars or Sa turn Hora when the negotiation will fall 
through and you can be happy. Venus Hora promises 
harmony and happiness. If you feel/that you are exhausted 


and you have lost much of your vitality, take medicine, 
especially Ayurvedic (especially from, Badhana Ayurveda 
ashramam at Calcutta) on Thursday or Friday during Venus 
Hora, it will rejuvinate you. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 43 


Write love letters during- Venus Hora. You start writing 
after this hour starts and finish it before this hour is over. 
Even though you may not normally have command of 
language to give expression to your love, during Venus 
Hora, appropriate words will be used by you which will 
appeal to the partner. If you receive a reply during other 
Horas, do not be impatient. Wait till Venus Hora starts. 
Then open the sealed cover and read. You will be very 
happy. 


Now you may ask, "she had already written and posted 
the letter. How can the Hora change the contents of the 
letter?" 


The answer is this. Knowingly or unknowingly you can 
open the letter at any Hora. According to the Hora, you will 
find the letter. If it is Saturn Hora, then the partner would 
have mentioned the inability to meet you and she will fix 
up-some other time. If it is Mars Hora, the tone of the letter 
will upset you. So, why should you take a chance? Venus 
Hora will arrange for tea, dinner, cinema, music party, 
meeting in an unfrequented place, etc. Those who would 
desire to cultivate love, must prefer Venus Hora. 


Buy jewels, silk sarees, costly dress, diamond and costly 
gems, sandalwood, glass, powder, scented oils and scents, 
eyelass, lipstick etc., during Venus Hora. It will add beauty 
by moderate use. 


-RBLT.- 


Sow the seed-bulbs, potato, tapioca or groundnut or 
sesame in this Hora. 


If you want to sever connection with anybody, this hour 
win help you. 


For illegal intimacy this is the best hour. 


Start petrol, oil, coal, skin, leather and hide business in 
Saturn Hora. Lay foundation for such business then. 


If you find It Impossible to lead your life with your wife, 
do not tell her your programme but disappear during Saturn 
Hora. If you tell her, she will come to the secluded place 
selected by you and continue to give trouble. Pray for Lord 
Venkateswara, lyyappa during Saturn Hora. Prefer this 
hora to become a sanyasi.

RECTI. CHART RECTIFIED BY KP. 


ANALYSIS 
A Chart drawn according to traditional astrology is as 


follows : 
Rahu | Mars |%eI2331 Sun 
450 | 26-27 | 58292? | 97-54 


Merc 


= 
cs 


Jup {Moon = 
19-16R) 2-11 4-50 


The time of birth is said to be between 8 to 8-20 p.m. 
L.M.T. The native is born on 13th July, 1913, Sunday at 
24° 01'N. Lat. and 89° 16’E. Long. 


Question : How to rectify the position of Moon? 


Answer : According to the Chart supplied, Moon is at 
2° 11’in Scorpio. Is it correct? 


Let us rectify it by the ruling planets at the time of 
judgment. 


This Chart is judged at 5-48 p.m. on 12-12-1967. Moon, 
at this time, falls at 7° 35'in Sagittarius, The sign, in which 


the Moon transits, is ruled by Jupiter. Further Moon falls in 
the constellation of Kethu, inthe SUB & SUB SUB of Jupiter. 
Hence Jupiter is very prominent. — 


-R.B.T. - 46 


Let us take the Ascendant for this time, which falls at 
8° 32' in Gemini. Here the sign transitted by Ascendant is 
ruled by Mercury and the Ascendant falls in the constellation 
and SUB of Rahu. Hence Rahu is also equally porminent. 


Therefore Jupiter, Rahu and Mercury are the 
significators. Rahu does not own any sign. It is in Aries 
owned by Mars. So Rahu is an agent of Mars which is the 
lordof Aries and Scorpio. 


Now let us pin-point the exact degree position of the Moon 
according to these significators. In the sign Scorpio, Moon 
falls in the constellation of Jupiter, SUB of Rahu and SUB 
SUB of Mercury at 2° 21'. Hence this is the exact position 
of Moon at the time of birth. The corresponding time of 
birth should be 8-30 p.m. L.M.T. 


Question No 2 :- The native is running the Dasa of 
Venus at present and Venus is lord of 5 and 10, a 
Rajyogakaraka according to the traditional texts. 


Further, Venus, is posited in its own sign along with his 
fast friend Saturn, thus very strong. 


It is interesting to note that if we disregard the Cusps 
drawn according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, Moon is 
occupant of 11, whose results Venus is to give, being posited 
in its constellation. Moon is further lord of 7, a kendrasthana, 
Saturn in association with Venus has to give similar results. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KR - 47 


But why is it that in Venus Dasa ,the native has suffered 
a lot in finance, health and mental condition, especially 
during Rahu Bhukti who is occupant of 3rd, an Upachaya 
or favourable' sthana’ according to the traditional astrology. 


Answer :-KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI can solve this 
PUZZLE. 


The Ascendant according to the rectified time of.birth 


falls at 25°38' in Capricorn and the revised chart according 
to Krishnaimurtt Padhdhati is as under :-

According to this new Chart, Venus is occupant of 4th 
Bhava, and lord of 4 and 9, both unfavourable houses from 
the point of view of addition to income. 4th house is 10th to 
7th and Sth is 3rd to 7th, hence favourable for the opposite 
party and unfavourable for him. (Krishnamurti Padhdhati, 


Vol. |.) 


-ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 


49 


Further both Venus and Saturn have to give the effect of 
Moon, as they are posited in its constellation. Moon is 
occupant of 9th Bhava, which is 12th from 10th. 10th house 
denotes business and as Moon is occupant of 9th, it will 
give set-backs in business. This is what has actually 
happened. Further Venus is posited in the SUB of Rahu- 
and Rahu has to give the effect of Satum prominently, 
because it is posited in the constellation and SUB of Saturn. 
Saturn is occupant of 4th and lord of 1, both unfavourable 
houses from money point of view. This is why the native 
has suffered loss during this period. Saturn is posited in 
the SUB of Venus. Venus is occupant of 4th and lord of 4 
and 9, again all unfavourable house.s from point of income. 


When the native ran Venus Dasa Rahu Bhukti, he 
suffered a lot in his business, because both of these planets 
are unfavourable for him. 


Thus it is fully confirmed that the Charts erected in the 
traditional way cannot give sound results unless they are 
rectified,and corrected, according to Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati. KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI is a solid answer 
to the confusions, contradictions and desperations born 
out of traditional texts in astrology. 


Let this Science bloom and give light to the entire world ! 


[Normally new students will take Moon as in 11th 
house.Hindu astrologers, will take as 10th house- 
Krishnamurti and the whole world except traditional Hindu 
astrologers will, take as 9th house, if they follow strictly the 
rules and dicta given by our sages and other savants. 


- R.B.T. - 50 


RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME 


As every K. P. follower knows that the sub division in 
K. P. system plays a vital role in all respects and that the 
cuspal sub lord is more important that the sub lord of a 
planet.Except Moon, all other planets remain in a sub for 
longer number of hours, and a few minutes this way or that 
way do not matter. But, the ascendant, the fastest of all is 
very much disturbed by a difference of few seconds and 
causes a change of sub. 


The cuspal subs, are the frame of the horoscope. 
That the cuspal sub remains there, to give a precise results 
throughout his life. For example, if the 7th cuspal sublord 
occupies the 6th houses or signifies the 6th house, the 
native remains unmamied. The position denies the marriage. 
This is the result. In such cases, what is the use of taking 
effort of looking for a bride every year for boy? There will 
be significators of 2,7, 11 houses But what does the 7th 
cusp sub lord say? It denies the marriage. 


It is therefore evident that the planets operates through 
the sub lords of houses with which they are connected and 
the cuspal sub lords have a definite say in the matter. For 
marriage the 7th house of a horoscope is analysed. For 
example, the significator of 7th house, is Jupiter and the 
cuspal sub lord is Moon. The cuspal sub lord Moon is the 
Significator of 6th house, thus denying the marriage. 
Suppose the person, runs Jupiter dasa, will it give marriage? 


- ASTRO SECRETS & K-P. - 51 


No. Why? Though the Jupiter signifies 7th house, the 
cuspal sub lord Moon signifies 6th house. Here the 
significater of 7th house, Jupiter, holding the portfolio of 
7th house, approaches the 7th cuspal sublord Moon who 
stands at the gates of the 7th cusp and allows the Jupiter to 
do the. 6th house matter, and poor Jupiter is stripped off 
its 7th house matters. Therefore a planet for whatever 
houses it has got a link, it has to operate through the cuspal 
sub lords of concerned houses. 


Suppose Venus signifies 3, 10, 11 houses and the cuspa 
sub of 3, viz. Rahu signifies 11th house then, Venus will 
operate for, 11th house, and 3, 10 to a lesser extent. 
Because 3 and 10 are improving houses, Rahu do not 
stand in the way of Venus, operating for 3 and 10 houses, 
alongwith the 11th house. Trouble arises only with respect 
to the non-improving houses. Take for example, the 2nd 
cuspal sub lora, is the significator of 12th house.This is an 
indication that the financial aspect of the person is at stake 
throughout his life. What else, if he runs the dasa of a 2nd 
significator? The financial strain will be lessened to a very 
meagre. level but the strain will be there for the person. 


Therefore a K.P. follower should always be careful to 
cast, a rectified horoscope, by applying the ruling Planets 
Consultants, naturally will say that their birth time was 
“correctly noted, by his father or grand father who were 


expert astrologers and who knew the in importance of a 
birth time. And we do not know. whether the father or grand 


-R.B.T. - 52 


father had precise watches and noted the correct "time" 
of birth, not knowing, the meaning of "birth time". 


The birth time is that time of the first cry of the child, 
when the child takes its first breath which means that the 


child is now an individual and can no longer needs the help 
of the mother, for its existance. The time of its getting the 
‘first oxygen’ or the pranan is the time of birth of the child. 
This time can be arrived at only by the application of the 
ruling planets and not by so many watches worn by father, 
grand father or the nurse who attended the delivery. 

Mostly in all cases, the ruling planet will guide to fix the 
right time of birth. But in certain cases, they do not guide 
directly. The procedure for rectification of birth time should 
be followed as detailed below : 


a) Work out the ruling planets at the time of casting the 
horoscope. 


Day Lord 
Moon sign lord-Moon star lord 


Lagna sign tord-Lagna star lord 
b) Calculate the lagna degree for the given birth time 
and findout the following : 


i) Lagna lord 

ii) Lagna star lord 

iii) Lagna sub lord 

iv) Lagna sub sub lord 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 53 


Cc) 


d) 


e) 


There may not be any problem in fixing b (i) and b (ii 
and find out the nearest planet for b (ii) and the 
commencing point of b (iv) and the sub sub of lagna 
degree is fixed now. b (ili) is the sub and b (iv) is the 
sub sub. The exact degree of lagna is arrived now. 


Add Ayanamsa to the degree arrived in '‘c' for the 
concerned year and the sayana position is obtained 
now. The other proportionate sayana cusps are found 
from the table of houses and the corresponding 
sidereal time is noted. 


Take the sidereal time of the birth date as found from 
the ephemeris. Findout the difference of time spent 
between sidereal time of ephemeris and sidereal time 
of birth. This time difference, includes the 10 seconds 
correction per hour. Therefore deduct correction at 
the rate of 10 seconds per hou r. . 


Difference of time................ 


Local Mean time difference........ 


Standard time of birth......... 


The time arrived this way is the right time of birth for the 


child.

EASY WAY OF RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME 


Rectification of birth time is a difficult task in Astrology. 
When we erect chart according to K.P. System, the correct 
time of birth is necessary as it change the sub lords of the 
cusps in few minutes difference. As the cuspal sublords the 
vital key for preduction in K.P. System, the accurate time 
of birth is esential. 


Though ther are many method of rectification of birth 
time, we have confusion as which method is correct. | give 
below some hints for rectification of birth time blending with 
numerology. 


This method is simple and accurate and tested in large 
number of charts. This formula depends upon the status of 
one's hier archg in that family, as first second, third issue in 
family, suppose if one is been on first issue in a family,the 
lagna cusp sublordmust be either ketu or mars or sun 


Secondissue * Ven, Moon, Merc. 


Third issue -  Jup 
Forth issue -  Rahu 
Fifth issue - Mercury 
Sixth issue - Venus 
Seventhissue i  Kelu 
Eight issue - Saturn 
Nineth issue - Mars 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 55 


There are some rules for fixing up the lagna cuspsub 
lord. Suppose if the cusp sub lord is in retrogession, reject 
it and take the star lord of the 1 st cusp Is also in retrofression 
take the sign lord of the 1st cusp. 


The first cusp sub lord and its star lord also taken into 
consideration. Reptconjunction of the sub lord of the first 
cusp with some other planet may also be the sub lord. For 
example if the sub lord of the 1 st cusp is mars and it rapty 
conjoined with Jupiter, he may be third issue in his family 
as Jupiter indicates 3 here mars gives his power to Jupiter. 


The dispositor of Rahu or Ketu is also not to be over 
looked. For example, if the 1 st cusp sub lord is Rahu who 
is posited in the sign leo. Here he may be first issue, as 
the dispositor of Ragu is sun. 


After we fix up the sub lord of the first cusp, we can 
easily adjust the birth time. Accordingly we can predict 
the issue status of your spouse also, from the esential. 7th 
cusp sub lord.

‘CHILD BIRTH 


On 22nd December1985 my neighbour enfeterd my room 
and placed a horoscope of his daughter who was in the 
family way had crossed the date indicated by the Doctor 
and wanted to know when she will deliver a child .As the 
horoscope presented by him did not contain planetary 
degrees and cusps, 


which ephemeries and what Ayanamsa was followed, 
| did not wish to go wrong by judging on that basis. 
| remembered our 


Day-Sunday - Day lord Sun 
Lagna Sign - Capricorn 
Lagna lord - Saturn 

Moon sign - Aries 

Moon signlord - Mars 

Star - Aswini 

Star lord - Ketu 


The moon sign at birth being Sagittarius, Rahu a strong 
node transiting in the fifth and Mars transiting in the 11 th 
clearly signified the query in the consultant's mind. 


The thing that occurred to me was that Jupiter'was in 
Moon's star till 24th December 1985 and then only he 
transits in Sun's star. Sun as lord of 9th is a bhagyathipathi 
and also a significator. So | first declared the till Jupiter 
changes the constellation transited by him, it is not likely to

materialise. Singature the event was to take place within a 
few days as per the teachings of our late Guruji | took into 
account Moon's transit. The significators caters being Saturn, 
Mars, ketu and Sun | looked into K.P. Ephemeries as to 
when Moon will transit Sun star Saturn sub. This was approx. 
5-30 a.m, on 25th December 1985. Our Guruji has stressed 
that a rode gives the result of the planet with which its 
conjoined. Here Ketu was conjoined with Mars which was a 
significator of the event per ruling planets, Moreover Moon 
will transit Taurus which sign Saturn the occurs. | thererfore 
predicted that on the midnight of 24th she will be' taken to 
the Hospital and delivery will take place before sunrise on 
25th morning. When neighbour contacted the doctor in the 
Maternity Hospital with this prediction the doctor is reported 
to have said that according to "Medical Science" delivery will 
not take place for another eight days. On the night of 24th at 
about 11-45 p.m. the lady was admitted in the Maternity 
Hospital and she delivered a male child on 25th morning at 
5-45 a.m. and | was congratulated for my scientific prediction. 


| owe the credit to our late Guruji K.S.Krisnnamurti for 
enlightening us on how to make use of Ruling Planets and 
further forgiving us the Krishnamurti Ayanamsa according to 
which this prediction, was made and came out correctly.

ASCENDANT & ASSESSMENT OF TIME OF 
BIRTH |S VERY EASY IN KP. 


Suppose one has doubt in his mind about several points", 
says Mr.N.D. Kedari B. E. (Civil), “such as, the exact degree 
and sign or Lagna, Longevity...always the,first important 
question is answered by the Ruling Planets at the moment of 
Judgment." (ref : A &A. 4/70-25). Mr. Kedari has very carefully 
followed the teachings of our Gurujee. |n fact a consultant of 
mine had doubts in regard to the correctness of his Lagna 
and consequently, of the exact time of birth. He wanted a 
solution. 


Details furnised by him are as urtder :- 

(a) Date of birth 28.11.1945, Wednesday 

(b) Time of birth between 4 p.m. and Sun set and 
c) Place of birth on 87.36 East/22:39 North. 


Nirayana Lagna rising at 5/30 p.m. on 28.11.1945 is Taurus 
22.53 i.e. Venus sign, Moon star and Sun sub. "According to 
the K.R", says Mr. Kedari "the Ruling Plants at the moment of 
query are the significators of the matter to be judged, confimed 
or ascertained". The Ruling Planets at Cuttack (place of 
judgment) on 4 4 1975 at 13.05 hrs. were :- 


Lagna - Cancer 12.54-Sign . >*d Moon. Star Lord Saturn 
and sub lord Rahu. 


-ASTRO SECRETS & K-P. - 59 


Moon in Sagittarius 29.26 i.e. in Jupiter's sign, Sun star 
and Rahu sub. 


Day lord for Friday is Venus. 


Therefore the Ruling Planets are : 


Lagna Star lord - Satum 
Sign lord : Moon 
Moon Starlord = - Sun 
Moon Sign lord - — Jupiter 
Day lord - Venus 


It may be noted here that Rahu is the sub lord of both 
the ascendant and of the Moon. Thus Rahu is a strong 
significator here. These apart, Saturn is in Rahu star. Moon 
Sub (Ref: Transit of planets in April in Astrology & Athrishta). 
Therefore the Nirayana Lagna rising at birth must be :- 


(a) in Venus sign - Taurus 
(b) inthe constellation : of Rohini of Moon and in 


(c) Rahu Subi.e. Taurus 11.53.20to 13.53.20. 


So far Saturn has not come into the picture although it 
is the strongest of the Ruling Planets being the Lagna Star 
lord. It is the sub sub lord of the Lagna whose longitude as 
such is from 12°27'46,20" . 


-R.B.T.- 60 


Something strange here. My correspondent writes to 
say that this very Ascendant was found by Mr. B.N. Nayak 
who is very well known to the readers of Astrology and 
Atheishta. Truth lies in KP. 


The next point is to find out the time of the day when this 
point of the zodiac rose in the heavens for the sprcified 
place of birth. | have followed the lines of Mr. K.M. 
Subramaniam as outlined in his article in A& A4/70-32. It 
works out to read 16-50 hours on 28-11-1945. 


A word here as to why | quote the K.P. enthusiasts instead 
of our Gurujee, well, Guruji loved us all. It would be a pleasure 
to him in his heavenly abode that we cooperate with one 
another. A familiar example may be taken, water belongs to 
the ocean from where it goes up in the form of vapour and 
again comes down to soothe the earth, help the crop and 
give to the ocean its wealth of pearls. Great glory to our 
Gurujee. May K-P. family expand.

THE EFFECTIVE METHOD OF BIRTH TIME 
RECTIFICATION 


The question is to rectify birth tfme and prepare the 
correct horoscope of the native. A concrete example is 
given here. The particulars given about a male native are 
the fallowing : 


Date of Birth : 13th January . 1939. 
Week Day _ : Friday 

Time of Birth : 9-O0A.M. (1ST) 
Place of Birth : Bombay 


He is a Government official in a high post. 
The time given is obviously approximate. 


Further, if taken or assured to be accurate, it gives the 
ascendant near the end of Capricorn. Of course, after 
knowing the natives interest in researches, the traditional 
astrologer will not hesitate to exercise his licentious intuition 
and take the beginning of Aquarius as the rising point The 
present question is whether there is a method by which 
one can arrive at a clear rectified ascendant through sheer 
calculations without having recourse to the so called power 
of intuition which is used in orthodox, astrology as a mere 
rationalizing bogey and as a ready source of excuse for 
vague and ambiguous predictions. The first test for any 


-R.B.T.- . 62 


theory to be scientific is that it is clearly verifiable and not 
that it is rigidly deterministic. If the study of astrology as 


dictated by facts and varified through scientific hypotheses 
is to be recommended, Krishnamurti Padhchati must rate 
high among the existing theories in the subject. Rectification 
of birth-time is a crucial or even starting point in practical 
astrology. We shall apply Krishnamurti Padhchati in the 
above Instance and see the extent to which it comes true. 
Of course, this is only illustrative but. the point is that it is 
sufficiently indicative and as such recommends the itself 
for an objective and impartial study. 


For the above particulars we must first find out the ruling 
planets of the native. According to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, 
the ruling planets are the ones ruling the day, the Moon 
sign the Moon star, and the Ascendant sign. All these planets 
are the significators of major events in one's life. If this is 
so, the ascendant point and the meridian, both of which 
are the most sensitive points in one's horoscope, must also 
have significant operative connection with the ruling planets. 
This should particularly apply to the ascendant cusp which 
is Supposed to constitute one's personality which then 
determines the course of events for one to a great extent. 
This gives a clue to the problem of rectification of the time 
of birth. The problem mainly wolves the finding of the 
approximately acurate and fairly restricted are in the zodiac 
as the cusp of the ascendant. In a great majority of actual 


* ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 63 


cases the doubt does not apply to the ascertainment of the 
day, the Moon sign and the Moon star. We have to have a 
practical solution. Then, the planets ruling these three must 
be our guide in rectification. Let us apply this ruling to the 
above case. 


Venus rules the birthday as the date of birth falls on 
Friday. Venus again rules the sign which is Libra in the 
present case. Mars rules the Moon star, which is Chitra 
here. Saturn must rule the ascendant because 9-00 A.M. 
gives the end of Capricorn and the next sign. Aquarius is 
also ruled by Saturn. But one is standard here, not knowing 
what to do and which degree to take. Here is our 
Krishnamurti Padhdhati starts operating in the real practical 
sense. What we have to do is to restrict and define an 
arch which must contain the rising point. The first step 
towards this is the determination of the ascendant star. 


Capricorn has Sun, Moon and Mars while Aquarius has 
Mars, Rahu and Jupiter to rule their stars. One's choice is 
restricted to these five planets. From the available ruling 
planets that is, Venus, Mars and Saturn one must recur as 
the ascendant star. Since Rahu represents Venus and 
Kethu represents Mars by being in their signs Libra and 
Aries at the time of the birth Rahu and Kethu should also 
be taken.From Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu and Jupiter, that 
are available, we have to choose one pertaining to Venus, 
Mars, Saturn Rahu and Kethu. Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. 


-R.B.T.- 64 


are obviously rejected Mars and Rahu remain. Rahu 
represents Venus which has .occurred twice among the 
ruling planets as the day lord and the sign lord. So let Mars 
be given a chance. This. also tallies with 9-0Q A.M. for itis 
exactly around that time. So it is Mars. Then Ascendant 
ranges from 9-23-20 to 10-6-40. 


Still, the sign itself remains uncertain.The next step 
according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati is to select the sub 
through the same process of elimination and selection. All 
nine are available in this order Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, 
Mercury, Kethu Venus, Sun and Moon. Sun, Moon and 
Jupiter go out immediately for, obvious reasons. Venus 
has occurred twice as the day lord and the sign lord. So 
Venus also goes, and it goes along with Rahu, its 
representative. Mars has also occurred twice now as the 
Moon star lord and the ascendant star lord. It also goes 
with its representative Kethu. Saturn and Mercury remain. 
Saturn has occurred only once as the ascendant sign lord. 
Mercury appears quite a stronger. But one should be 
careful At the time of the birth saturn is in Mercury's star 
Revathi. Lord of ascendant in Mercurys star is no in 
significant matter. But the decision seems to have become 
Involved here. In matters of doubt the number will decide, 
according to the Padhdhati. | asked for a number which 
happens to be 69. It gives Mars' sign and Mercury's stae. 
This is amazing Mars star lordship is confirmed and in its 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 65 


background or generally Mercury emerges. No doubt 
should remain. A method has to be judged by application 
and verification and not by airy theoretical faultfinding. 
Hypothesis should follow experience and not dictate it. So, 
Mercury's sub in Mar's star is to be taken. Then the span 
of the ascendant is restricted to 10-0° OO" to10-1°-53'-20". 


The further step is Still minute. It is to decide the sub- 
sub. Then it is also time to see if any planet is in the 
ascendant according to this fairly restricted point of 
ascendant. Jupiter is in the first house. Take Jupiter as the 
sub-sub. Or, throw a number also (This has to be done in 
good faith and without prejudice either way-sceptical 
cynicism does not help the problem at all, and one has at 
least to verify a method which claims and promises actual 
results as it seems to be the case with the Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati). | throw number 25. It gives Mercury's sign 
and Jupiter's star. The extent of recurrence and verification 
is the practical and ready proof. Jupiter emerges now in 
Mercury's generality or background. There is absolute 
clarity. Jupiter is certain as the sub-sub. This gives the 
further restriction. Now the ascendant's span will be 
10-1°-20'-16/236 " to 10-1°-35'-231/3Accordingly, 
meridian's span will be from about 7-10°-23'-486 to about 
7-10°-36'-8". This gives saturn s star and Sun's sub. With 
the ascendant in Mercury's sub the meridian ranges from 
7-9°-18'-17" to-7-10°-50'-49" with Saturn’s’star Venus's 


-R.B.T.- — 66 


sub changing to Saturn's star Sun's sub at 7-10°-20°-'0". 


Hence the' ascendant should be between 10-1 °-20’°-16- 
2/3" and 10-1 °-35'-231/3" and the merdian should be 
between 7-10°-23'-48' and7-10°-36'~8". 


No more fineness needs to be pursued. The required 
Sidereal Time calculated backwards will be about 16 hours 
5 minutes, accordingly. Birth time, similarly recalculated, 
will be about 16 A.M. (I.S.T.).This is fairly accurate and 
quite workable for the most of the astrological 
calculations. One may take the mean of the rectified range 
(about 10-1°-20° to about 10-1°-35'), that is,10-1°-28' 
approximately. 


This may be useful in taking a fairly exact position for 
calculating the precise dasa balance. This way, this birth 
time would be about 9.16-35 A.M. (I.S.T.). 


The above confirms the native's tendency towards 
research. Jupiter in Aquarius ascendant is sufficient for 
this. Again, the Government service is also confirmed by 
the meridian being in the Sun's sub. All this acquired without 
recours to either a wishful ationalization or an intuitive 
exercise in retrospective "wisdom". 


As already mentioned above the purpose of the above 
discussion is to recommend the Krishnamurti Padhdhati 
as one which is workable enough apparently to deserve 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 67 


a series attempt at scientific verification. Apart from the 
point of being scientific objective and impartial, the first 
premise of the human civilization dictates that a normal 
human being shall not doubt the bonafides of another 
just as his staffing point and without caring to verify it. 
Such an attitude smacks of cynicism which does not are 
to base itself on reason or even to offer an alternative. 
One must also guard against another extreme.One does 
not need astrology for fifty percent accuracy for which, 
broadly,the toss ota coin will suffice and common sense 
will even be more than sufficient. Then a lack of intellectuall 
adventurism is not conductive for great progress or starting 
discoveries. Let our judgment on Krishnamurti Pachdhati 
be based on same understanding. 


GOOD LUCK!

RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH CHART 


BY KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 


Whenever an Astrologer get a chart for any kind of 
astrological advice or prediction, the astrologer must first 
check up whether the horoscope given by the consultant is 
correct or reot. This can be done by the method of Rulling 
planets. Ruling Planets are five. They are : 


Lagna Lord, Lagna Star Lord, Moon Rasi .Lord, Moon 
Star Lord and Day Lord. 


At the time of checking or analysing the chart, if the 
ruling Planets are not agreeing, Any K-P. Astrologer can 
boldly reject by telling that the horoscope brought by the 
consultant is not correct. Time, date or place of birth may 
be wrong. K.P. Astrologer can set right horoscope by 
rectifing it througt the KP system. 


In my three decades experience as per the method found 
by our beloved Guruji Sri. K.S.Krishnamurtithe rule is the 
sub or sub sublord of the ascendant of the Ruling Planet 
Le., at the time if judgment by KP Astrologer will be the sub 
or subsub lord of ascedant of the birth time whose 
horoscope we are checking. 


| am herewith discussing a natal chart, whose time of 
birth ij rectified. 


-ASTRO SECRETS & K.P.- 69 


Mr.R. came to me with his Horoscope and requested 
me to give some astrological advice for his problems which 
he was facing. 


The details of his birth given by him are as follows.

The Horoscope was prepared by an Astrologer was for the 
time 9.00 am in_ traditional method and | came to a 
conclusion that the horoscope is not useful as it not in KP 
system. | casted a KP chart for that day to look into the RP 
position and to judge the correctness of the given chart. 


It was taken up for judgement at 7:57am IST on 
2-7 -2000 at Bangalore 77 -38E,12-58N using my KP.

He has informed that he had two marriages.

9.00 am Chart 


Guruji Sri.K.S.Krishnamurti has clearly explained in 
Reader 4 about sublord must be MER and he has to 
signify a dual house for second marriage and also must 
signify 8th house. | am taking here the subsublord 
positions for more accuracy sake. 


7th house subsublord is RAH, he is in the position of 
MER-RAH-MER-SUN and in 9th bhava, he is not 
signifying the 7th,8th house. As he had already two 
marriages the chart of 9.00 am in not correct. 


6.30 am Chart - Rectified 


7th house subsublord is MER, he is in the position if 
SUN-KET-VEN-JUP and KET is in JUP-KET-MER-SAT 
position. Ketu is in dual house and JUP owns 8th house 
and SAT owns 7th house, which shows that he had two 
marriages. 


This analysis shows that he was born at 6.30 am IST 
real time and 7.30 am war time, which is also after SUN 
rise. 


| gave some important prediction based on rectified 
chart which | am not revealing here and my prediction 
came true with in a week time. 


As the article has become very lengthy | end this article 
and leave some exercise to KP students.

1. Workout dasa bhukthi anthara periods in both charts 
of 9 am and 6.30 am IST. You will notice dasa bhukthi 
anthara will tally for his | & Il Marriages in 6.30 am chart. 


2. Child birth, father, mother's death can also be predicted 
taking 9th, 4th houses and their badaka and maraka houses

ON RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME 


Numerous rules and cumbersome calculations are given 
in ancient text books for rectification of birth time. While 
we cannot dismiss all these principles as unworkable in 
practice we have to conclude that each method contradict’s 
the other and finally the astrological student gets vexed 
when he gets different birth times using different methods. 


Krishnamurti Padhdhati on the other and serves, as a 
valid and practical method to determine the correct time of 
birth, when property applied. Much credit goes to the late 
Prof: K.S.K. for untiring efforts and laudable researches 
presenting before the public, his never failing system of 
prediction popularly known as Krishnamurti Padhdhati. 


What was possible to the ancient sages is equally 
possible to those of the present time who take. pains to do 
research of Prof. K.S.K. 


| shall now demonstrate with a practical example and 
explain the method of Birth Rectification as per K.P. for 
the benefit of new students of K.P. 


Birth rectification is done with the help of Ruling 
Planets which are :- 


- R.B.T. - 7E 


(1) Day lord at Judgment 
(2) Moon sign lord 

(3) Moon star lord 

(4) Lagna lord 

(5) Lagna star lord 

(6) Lagna sublord also 


Note : The day lord generally being a week rulling planet 
can well ignored for practical purposes. 


The planet which occupies the lagna or strongly aspects 
the lagna must also be taken into account and planet, will 
generally be the sub lord of lagna at birth. 


The lord of lagna at Judgement, if strong will be generally 
be the sub lord of lagna at birth. 


In the light of the above pinciples let us take as example. 


A native came to me Saying that he was not sure of his 
birth time which was between 4 to 5 a.m. on 20-4-1939 
(19th night 20th moming) at MADRAS. 


| took this case for analysis on 3-3-1977 at 7-37 a.m. 
(1ST) at Madras. 

The Ruling planets were : 

1) Day-ruled by Jupiter 

2) Star-ruled by Saturn. 

3) Rasi (Cancer) ruled by Moon. 

4) Lagna lord -Jupiter (9°32'29") Pisces) 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 79 


5) Lagna star lord-Saturn 
6) Lagna star lord-Ven us 
So Jupiter, Saturn, Venus and Moon are ruling planets. 


Now, when we calculate the Ascendant between 4 and 
5 a.m. on 19/20-4-1939 at Madras, we see that Pisces 
(Meena) rises as Ascendat. Jupiter is a strong ruling 
planet and hence .the lagna is fixed as Meena 330° to 
360°. In Meena we have the stars of Jupiter, Saturn and 
Mercury (Poorvabhadrapada, Uthrabhadrapada and 
Revati). Jupiter happens to be the day lord and hence is 
rejected for the post of Lagna star lord. That leaves us 
only with good old Saturn to be considered as lagna 
starlord and we fix the lagna between 333°20' and 
346°40", 


The map of the heavens at judgment was as follow : 


lagna 
Venus Jupiter 


es 3-3-1977 | _Moon 


Sani (R) 
7-37 a.m. “ 


IST 
Madras 


Now, to elect the lagna sublord. Venus happens to be 
the lagna sublord at query and happens to be posited in 
the ascendant in exaltation.So Venus is to be considered 
as lagna sublord with the rule already given. | 


That leaves us with the Ascendant at birth between 
8°06'40" and 10°2’ of pisces (Meena) 

Even within such a short range we have to find out the 
lagna sub-sub lord at birth. 


Now we are left only with Moon. But we cannot take it as 
the lagna sub-sub lord because : 


1) Itis in the star of Saturn who is retrograde. 


2) It is not so strong as to assume the role of lagna sub- 
sub lord. 


Then who can be the lagna sub-sub lord? 


Mars aspects strongly the two planets, Moon and Saturn. 
Itis also in the sign of Saturn in exaltation. Therefore Mars 
should be the lagna sub-sub lord at birth and the lagna is 
tixed as 8°49’ Pisces at Madras on 19/20-4-1939. This 
point will be on the Ascendant at exactly 4.26.16 a.m. [.S.T. 
at Madras.

A word of advice here. When Tables of Houses" used it is 
necessary to deduct the Ayanamsa given in this said Tables of 
Houses only. 


It is not enough if we rest content with mere rectification 
alone.The past events in life should fully tally along with transit 
also. 


Some of the events in the life of the above native are : 


D Marriage: 
23-6-1961 at Madras. 
2) Son born: = 


{6-4-1962 at Madras. 


The above two events are taken as examples to prove the 
efficacy of the stellar system. 


-RB.T.- 82 


1} The marriage of the native took place on 23-6-1961 
when he was running Sun dasa, Sun bhukthi and Mars 
Anthra as per Vimshothari system. 

'Significators of houses 2,7,11 are: 


Planets in Planets in 
Bhava the star of the star of 
occupants owner 


2 Ketu Mars Sun,Moon Nil 
Zz - Mercury 
11 - Saturn 


: Saturn 
Mercury 

Itis clear that Sun is a strong significator of the second 

house along with Mars who happens to own it 


Mars here becomes strong on account of its position in 
Saturn is sub, Saturn is a very strong significator of the 
7th and 11 th houses. Thus Mars has got control over all the 
houses viz; 2, 7and 11 and therefore denotes the event as 
anthra lord. 


TRANSIT 


Sun, dasa and bhukthi lord, transited Gemini (Mi thuna) 
over Rahu star, Rahu sub. Gemini is ruled by Mercury who 
happens to be a strong significator of houses 7 and 11. 
Rahu is aspected by Sun and Moon both of them are 
strong, significators of the 2nd house. 


Hence transit also agrees.It is significant that on 
23-6-1961 Moon was transiting, Virgo in Chitra star ruled 
by Mars, anthra lord. 


-ASTRO SECRETS & K/P. - 83 


Mars, the anthra lord transited Leo (Simha) in Ketu's 
star. The sign and star are ruled by strong significators. 
Hence transit also agrees completely. 


2) Birth of a son occured on 16-4-62 when he was. 
running Sun dasa Mars bhukthi, Jupiter anthra. Sun has 
already been in addition to his lordship over the 2nd house. 


Jupiter, the bukthi, lord is puthrakaraka and aspects the 
5th house also. It is in turn aspected by Mars lord of 2. 


TRANSIT 

The day was ruled by Moon, lord of 5. Moon was 
transiting the sign of dasanatha.Sun transited Mars’ sign 
Aries (Mesha) in Ketu star. Mars is also the, 
bhukthinatha.Ketu is a strong signficator of 2nd house in 
addition to the fact that he deputises for Mars. Thus even 
here,the transit agrees in full. Like this all the events 
completly tally but | have not touched them here for want of 
space. 

The above discussion goes to demonstrate the truth of 
the practical utility of K.P. and the benefits it would confer 
if properly analysed and applied.

ROLE OF 7TH AND 11 TH CUSPAL 
SUBLORDS IN MARRIED LIFE 


The rising sign on the eastern horizon at a place at the 
time of birth of a child is known as Ascendant. 


While erecting horoscopes, fixing the Ascendant 
assumes prime importance. For fixing the Ascendant 
accurately, the essential factor is the correct time of birth. 


Our learned authors have laid great stress on the correct 
time of birth before proceeding further to erect the 
horoscope and explore the significations of the house or 
Bhavas. They have evolved various methods to arrive at 
the correct time of birth and each method when applied 
gives different time of birth. 


In Krishnamurti Padhdhati rectification of birth time is 
carried out with the aid of "Ruling planets" and they are 
found to give correct results in fixing the exact time of birth 
of persons. 


Unless the time of birth is exactly fixed, the cuspal sublords 
can not be fixed correctly otherwise it will lead to erroneous 
predictions. 


"Ruling planet" is a great boon and contribution to Stellar 
Astrology by our respected Guruji Prof. K. S. Krishnamurti, 
the founder of Stellar Astrological Research Institute. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 85 


Here ! am giving below another novel method for 
verification of birth chart based on cuspal sublords taking 
into account the birth star (or) Janma nakshatra of Father 
mother and members in family.

The birth star of this gentleman's father is Thiruvonam 
(star lord Moon). 


In this chart the IXth cuspal sublord is Moon and the 
star lord of IXth cusp Jupiter is in the star of Moon i.e. 
Hastha Nakshatra. Hence casting the horoscope cast is 
correct and there is no need for rectification of his and 
birth particulars of mother are not available. 


The lagna cuspal star lord and sub lord of this native in 


Jupiter and Saturn respectively. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. -

He is a man of principle and health care. He is also a 
man of strict disciplinarish and scholar in K.P. Astrology. 


The Lagna cuspal star lord and sub lord is Jupiter and 
Saturn respectively and they denotes the characteristics 
of the person as stated above. 


The lagna cuspal sub lord can also be used for 
rectification of birth time. 


Role of 7th Cuspal Sub-lord 


Inthe horoscope No. 1 & 2, note the Vilth cuspal position. 


Cusp Star lord Sub lord 
Chart No. 1 VII Sun Saturn 
ChartNo. 2 Vil Venus Saturn 


In chart Mo. 1 the 7th cuspal sublord is Saturn. It is in 
the star of Kethu and in the sub of Rahu . In her husband's 
birth chart the birth star is ‘Sathayam' in Kumba Rasi. 


In the chart No. 2 the sublord of cusp is Saturn, which is 
in the star of sub and in the sub of Venus. 


The sublord of 7th cusp Satum in the star of Sun denotes 
the birth Rasi of this lady and the same Saturn aspects 
Ketu the star lord of the lady's birth star (Maham) 


While matching for marriage the birth charts according 
to the standard text “Kalaprakasika” Kumba Rasi and Simha 
Rasi, Kataka Rasi and Makara Rasi should not be matched 


-R.B.T.- 90 


sven though they are Samaaptakam, presumably as both 
Satur an Sun are considered as enemies. 


The above formula of Kalaprakasika is to be modified 
yased on Research as the nativities of example horoscopes 
are leading a happy and long wedded life even today. 


In the horoscopes, the 7th Bhava denotes legal bondage 
of marriage and the 11 th Bhava denotes everlasting 
Tiendship. 


In the above given example horoscopes, the 7th cusp 
sub lord of the lady viz Saturn is the sub lord of the 7th 
susp of the gentleman. 


Similarly the X/th cusp sublord of the lady is Rahu which 
is conjoined with Saturn, the 11 th cuspal sublord of the 
gentleman's chart. 


Therefore, it would appear that while matching 
horoscopes we may do so based on the sublords of the 
7th and 11th cusp and significators of the 7th and 11 th 
Bhavas also. 


K-P. followers are requested to experiment on the above 
lines.

BIRTH RECTIFICATION 


In the predictive world of astrology, no system is as 
perfect and accurate as advanced stellar system of 
Krishnamurti Padhdhathi named after late Prof. K.S.K's 
prediction should be analyzed from Bhava/ cusp position 
and not from sign to sign. a zodiac sign signifies the 
qualities, elements,gender etc. whereas the cusp /house 
represents the present environments like education, 
profession, marriage etc. Students following KP. also find 
it very dfficult to select bukthi's for a particular event. Many 
do not evince keen interest in correcting the given time 
since the sub theory is very scientific and methodical. 
Sometimes 5 to 10 minutes error in the recorded birth 
time is likely to alter the sub in the lagna and other cusps. 
A KP follower should read the chart after correcting the 
birth time. 


Some days back one lady approached me for the 
consultation for her daughter. Whenever we get chart casted 
according to traditional principle | request K-P. followers 
to rectify the time with application of RP's. 


So the birth time has been corrected to 16.27.29 |.S.T. 
born on 20.06.1989. The method employed is briefly 
discussed below for KP. followers. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 92 


How to arrive at the correct position of lagna. According 
to the details furnished by the lady is D.O.B. is 
20.06.1 980 at 16-35 IST at Bangalore. The correct position 
of ascendant should be fixed by means of ruling Planets. 
The chart was taken for the calculation 8-8-80 at 14.04 IST 
in Bangalore 12-58'N / 77 -36'E longitude. 


Ruling Planets : 
Lagna lord - Mars 
At 14-04 on Lagna star - Sat 
08/08/00 Moon sign lord - Mars 
Moon star lord : Saturn 
Day lord - Mars. 


The order of preference in the RP is as follows. 


Mars, Saturn. 

Ruling Planets of the native born on 20.06.80 is Scorpio 
at 6-25-37 in sub of Mercury i.e. Mars sign / Saturn star / 
Mercury. 


If we compare RP'’s at birth and at the time of rectification, 
Mars and Saturn appeared and Mercury has not appeared 
as RP on 8-8-80. So | took Saturn a strong RP as sub lord 
and Mars as sub-Sub-lord. Therefore correct position of 
lagna at the time of birth should be Mars sign / Saturn star 
/ Saturn, sub / Mars sub-sub. 


- RB.T. - 93 


This position works to be 4-48 of Nirayana Scorpio or 
214-48’. Add K.S.K. Ayanamsa,for the year 1980. 


Now Sayana position works to be 


214-484+23-29=(238- 17 -25)...(!) | 


Now refer U.T.Q.H or table of houses and record the following

This value is the required sidereal time of birth. 

Now the sidereal time at 05.30 a.m. on 20.06.1980 is

Therefore 1 6H-27m-29sec is the required time of birth. If

SHREE GANESHA NAMAHA 
RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME 


a 


Unless the time of birth is correct, the cuspal sublord 
cannot be calculated conectly which will lead to erroneous 
predictions and this will make the object of astrology 
meaningless as well as useless. Our learned sages have 
invented various methods to arrive at the correct time of 
birth, when it is not correctly known. Out of them one is 
K.P. most scientific method. 


Our beloved Guruji Late Prof.K.S.Krishnamurthi evolved 
K.P. System and the Ruling Planet method for the correction 
of birth time and giving perfect prediction to any chart. 
K.P. is more developed in cormparision to traditional 
astrology. 


Now, we come to the real case study. One of my 
consultant cameto me, who had doubt about the time of his 
birth which was of about1 2 p.m. to 9th July 1956 at Patna 
as recorded. 


The analysis of the birth correction has been made with 
the blessing of our Guruji Late Prof. K.S. Krishnamurti and 
also the blessing and proper guidance of my respected 
Guruii Joytish Samrat Dr. B.K. Singh. 


For correction of birth time the Ruling has been taken 
0n10.7.2001 to at 1.50 p.m. |.S.T. at Gaya, Lat 24 48' N' 


as follows :- 


- R.B.T. - 97 


1.Ascendant in scorpio 20°42' lord - Mars. 

2. Ascendant starlord _ = Mercury 
3. Moon sign lord - Satum 
4. Moon star lord - Rahu 

5. Daylord - Mars 


Mercury was taken as signlord because in chart given, 
Virgo was rising.Mars has appeared twice as ruling planet 
and it is signlord of Ascendant So it was taken as stariord. 
Now come to Rahu which is stariord of Moon. So Rahu 
was taken as sublord. And lastly saturn as sub-sublord. 


This combination is available between 24° 06'40" to 
26° 06'40" in Virgo. So Ascendant came at 24°44"in Virgo.

The marriage of the rative will take place when the 
combined period of the significators of the planet of 2,7, 
11 houses will be running. The marriage took place on 
26.11.92 when the Native was running Major and Sub period 
of Venus and Sub- Sub of Jupiter. Venus is significator of 
Il houses, which denotes the addition of family member. 
Hence a significator for marriage. Jupiter is owner of the 
7th and occupant of 11th hence good significator for 
marriage. 


The Native entered into job in state government on 
2.1 2.1992. At that time major and bhukti of Venus Jupiter 
Anthara 2nd Moon Shookshama was running signifying 
the house 2,6,10,11. 

It is K.P. which can only solve such type of problem.

RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME BY THE 
APPLICATION OF "KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI" 


When intelligently applied, "Krishnamurti Padhdhati" 
gives marvellous accuracy in the rectification of birth time 
or lagna cusp. The method is simple, time-saving,and gives 
sure results. Doubts are relegated to the limbo of oblivion. 
No other to the pre-natal epoch method, primary or 
secondary directions of Western Astrology and some 
others suggested in the traditional Hindu astrology can even 
come very near to this method. Mostof these methods give 
contradictory results and make confusion worse 
confounded. Why? K.P. gives reliable results when 
correctly applied. Genuine urge for the correct results must 
be there, in the mind ofthe person asking the question. 
Then only 100% accuracy can be guaranteed 


The following gives the results of actual rectification of 
three horoscopes of three living persons : 


|. Male born on 20-7-1911 at 5.54. p.m. |.S.T. 
Place :  Tellicherry (Kerala) Star : Bharani 
Date : Thursday. 


Question What is the sub of my lagna in Dhanur Rasi? 
There is a doubt with regard to the birth time. ItL.M.T. or 
|.S.T.,although itis written as I.S.T. The difference between 
the two is 28 minuts. Of course, there is no doubt with 


-R.B.T. - 101 


regard to Dhanur Rasi, as the rising lagna. 
Time-6-33 p.m. I.S.T. on 17-5-1968 (Friday) 
Place-Chottamkara (Kerala). 


Ruling planets at the moment: 
Friday - Sukra 
Rasi rising at Question Time 


Scorpio 30 38' - Kuja(Lord of Sign) 
Star transmitted by Moon 

Thiruyonam - Lord Moon 
Moon Rasi Lord - Sani 


Star rising in the East Anusham - Sani 


On this day Sani is with Rahu in Meena Rasi. Sani 
aspects Mars with special aspect (3rd aspect) unilaterally. 
50 ,Mars is under the control of Sani. Rahu being a node is 
stronger, and represents Sani. 

So, Sukra, (Kuja & Sani) & Moon 

. RAHU 
must influence the lagna point of the person in some way 
or other 


The degree of lagna cusp given Ruling planets at 
in the horoscope 19° 50' Dhanur Question Time 


So, Day Sukra 
Sukra (Star lord) Rahu (Kuja, Sani & Sani) 


Rahu (Sub lord) eee a 


(& Rasi lord) 
Moon * (Sub-sub lord) Moon (Stariord) 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 102 


So, the time recorded is quite correct as the influencing 
planets are practically identical. Guru is not in the picture, 
as there is absolutely no doubt about Dhanur lagna. So 
now it is quite clear that K.P. must be applied in a dexterous 
manner to hit at the correct results. 


Il. Female born on 5-11-1917 at 6-49 A.M.-L.M.T. 
Piace : Manjeri (Kerala), Day-Monday 
Star : Punarvasu 


What ts the correct position of my lagna? 


Can it be Thula Rasi, last quarter or Scorpio Rasi, first 
quarter ? 

Question time :11 A.M. 1.S.T.on 21-5-1968 

Tuesday -Chottanikkara (Kerala) 

Ruling planets at the moment of judgment. 


Tuesday - Mars 
Poorattathi - Guru. 
Kumba Rasi - Sani 

Lagna rising at the time 

16° 10’'Cancer - Moon 


Star rising in the East - Pushya-Sani 

As Sukra is not in the picture, reject Thula Rasi for the 
lagna. Birth can be in Scorpio Rasi only. The cusp can fall 
in Guru star, Rahu sub (as Rahu today is posite in Meena 
Rasi with Sani) and Moon sub-sub. 3°3'-3°13' in Scorpio 
Rasi is the correct lagna position. There is a slight 
difference of some minutes in birth time-about 5 to 6 
minutes. So see how KP works accurately and gives sure 
results. 


- R.B.T - 103 


. Question of Sri K.R.Viswanathan, M.A., Professor 
of Botany, Kerala Varma College, Trichur. 

| was born on 20/21 -8-1931 in Trichur at about 5 A.M. 
{.S.T.Anusham. There are two opinions regarding any birth 
time. According to one version, it is 4-48 to 4-50 A.M. 
|.5.T. According to another version, it sure. Let me see 
how your "Krishnamurti Padhdhatti" will help in fixing the 
correct position of my lagna in Kataka Rasi. 


Time-11.56A.M. I.S.T. 

Place - Trichur 

Planets rulling at the moment of judgement: 
5-5-1968-Sunday - Lord Sun 

Lagna rising at the 

moment 13°10'- Katakam-Moon 

Star rising in the East Pushya - Lord Sani 
Moon transits Pushya star - Lord Sani 

Moon transits Katakam - Lord Moon 


On this day Sani aspects Mars unilaterally by the 3rd 
aspect. So, Sani, Sun, Moon and Mars (indirectly) can 
influence the lagna point. So lagna position is Sani star, 
Mars sub and Sun subsub. 12°47'in Cancer. As Budha is 
not in the picture, the other time 5-50 A.M. can be rejected 
straightaway. The correct time is 4-48 A.M. I.S.T. 


The lagna can be also in the Sani star, Rahu sub and 
Rahu sub sub. But as the former time is nearer the indicated 
time, ithas been taken. Moreover, Sun also must find a 
place, you see. So, we see-, how valuable K-P. is in the 
rectification of birth time. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 104 


CORRECT TIME OF BIRTH 


Mr. D.E. Madhav Rao, from Mangalore desires to know 
the correct time of birth of his friend. He wrote to me that 
his friend was born at about 4 A.M. (IST) on 4 June 1934 
at Mangalore (12°N 53’, 74°E 50). He further mentions that 
"there may be a variation of about 5-8 minutes between 
the time of actual birth and the time as noted by his parents 
(3A.M.) 


Varaha Mihira in his Brihit Jataka has devoted one full 
chapter to cast the horoscope of a person whose birth 
time is not known. He gives the method to erect such 
horoscope from the time of judgment. From this we can 
understand that the time of birth and the urge to erect the 
horoscope of a native has a direct bearing. They are 
interlinked. Prof. K.S.K. also advocates this method. 
According to him, note the ruling planets at the time of 
judgment of erection of the horoscope. |! took this for 
judgment at 9-16 A.M. on Sunday the 20th of May, 1968 at 
Delhi. This moment is ruled by 


(i) Sun - Lord of the day Sunday 

(ii) Mars - Lord of Moon sign, Aries. 

(iii) Sun - Lord of the Constellation, Krithika. 

(iv) Moon - Lord of Lagna Cancer, and finally 

(v) Saturn - Lord of Star Pushyami. rising in the East at 
that moment. 


- R.B.T. - 105 


So the ruling planets are Sun, Mars, Moon and Saturn. 
The position of the zodiac, that would have risen in the 
Easton 3/4th June, 1934. at 3 A.M. (IST) at the place of 
birth is as 
Hr. Mts. Secs. 
(i) Sidereal time at noon 
on 3-6-1934 atthe 
place of birth 4 44 11 


(ii) Add interval between 
the previous noon and 
the time of birth in 
L.M.T.(3A.M. 1.S.T.) 14 29 20 


(iii) Add correction for 
interval at the rate of 


10 secs./hour 0 2 25 
Therefore sidereal time 

atthe place of birth at 

3A.M. I.S.T. 19 15 56 


Therefore according to Rapheal's Table of Houses 
(130N), the Sayana Position of the Ascendant is 
22°44'Aries. Ayanamsa for 1934 is 22° 50'. Therefore 
according to Nirayana system, 29° 54' Pisces was rising 
in the East at3 A.M. (IST) at the place of birth. 


Pisces is ruled by Jupiter. Jupiter is not a rulling planet. 
The next sign that immediately rises is Aries. Mars rules 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 106 


this sign. Mars is a ruling planet. Further the Ascendant 
Aries will rise very shortly after 3 A.M. and the time of birth 
is also very nearto 3 A.M. so it can be safely concluded 
that the Ascendant for this horoscope is Aries and not 
Pisces, or the birth is after 3 A.M. (1.S.T.) 


Which Constellation 


As the actual time of birth is very close to 3 A.M. so 
naturally we will select the star Aswini, in the sign Aries to 
rise in the East. Aswini is ruled by Kethu. No doubt Kethu 
is not ruling planet, but it has got important connection with 
the ruling planets, because. 


(i) itis aspected by Saturn, the ruling planet. 


(ii) it is in the star of Moon and subs of Sun, and both 
Moon and Sun rule the moment of judgment. Thus we can 
safely conclude that birth occured when Aries sign and 
Aswini star was rising in the east. 


Which Sub 


The first sub is ruled by ketu itself, and the next by Venus. 
Here ! may mention that f received the letter on Saturday 
i.e., 5-5-1968, and a Bharani star day. | could notjudge 
the horoscope on the same day, as | had my pre- 
engagements with my friend Harder Singh, from whose 
residence | could return to my house only in the morning 
on Sunday. So sub of Venus, in Aswini star cannot be 


- R.B.T. - 107 


taken. We will take the subs of Sun, as the Sun is a strong 
rulling planet (both day and star are governed by Sun). 
Thus if you refer to page 161 of K.P, Volume 7, you will 
see that the sub of Sun, in Star Aswini, ranges from 3° 
Aries to 3° 40’ Aries. Take the sub sub of Moon, and so the 
lagna for the native should be between 3°3' Aries to 3°5' 
Aries, or say the lagna is 3°4' Aries 


If 3°4' is the Nirayana Position, the Sayana Position will 
be 25°54’ Aries, Ayanamsa being 22°50". 


At the birth place, at the Sidereal time 19 hrs, 26 mts. 34 
secs. 25°94’ Aries (Sayana) or 3°4' Aries (Nirayana) will 
rise in the east.

If we deduct rectification for this interval at 10 seconds 
per hour, we will get the figure of 14 hrs. 40 mts. as the 
interval between previous noon and the birth time in L,M,T, 
Thus the birth occured at 2-40 A.M. (L.M.T.) Longitude of 
the place is 74°E 50°. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 108 


Difference between Standard Time and Local Mean 
Time is (82°30") - 74°50') x 4=30 mts-40 secs. 


So the birth in standard time was at 3 hrs. 10 mts. 40 
secs. A.M. or approximately 3-11 A.M. (I.S.T.) on 4-6- 
1934. 


This discovery of ruling planets , by Sri. K.S.K. is a 
boon to the Students of Astrology. There are other methods 
also for birth rectification, but none comes to the standard. 
The method advocated by Sri. K.S.K. is the best, accurate 
and convincing.

VALIDITY OF KRISHNAMURTI 
PADHDHATI 


It is an established fact that Krishnamurti Padhdhati is 
more predictive than the traditional technique in Astrology. 
There are various dasa systems for timing of events 
Vimshottari dasa system is followed in South India and 
Astottari Dasa System is followed in North India, especially 
in Bengal. Articles dealing with Kalachakra Dasa arid 
Astottari horoscope Dasa by Sri. M. G. Gopalan Nayar 
and Lagna Dasa by Sri. B.N. Nayak were published in 
October 1977, December 1977 and June 1978 Issues of 
this Magazine. These two Krishna murti Padhdhati scholars 
have shown that Krishnamurti Padhdhati can be universally 
applied to all the Dasa Systems. In the above articles 
Sri.Nayar has taken the event of death of a young woman 
of 20 years in his article on Kalachakra Dasa while the 
event of marriage is taken by him in his article on Astottan 
Dasa System. Sri. Nayak has discussed about the death 
of a doctor's wife. Sri. Nayar states that Astottari gives 
accurate results for a birth falling in Sukla Paksha and the 
Kalachakra Dasa gives accurate results if the Moon at birth 
is associated with, or aspected by, the lord of the Dasa at 
birth as per Kalachakra Dasa System. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 110 


Now | take a single natal chart which is suitable to both 
Astottari and Kalachakra Dasa Systems and prove the 
Universal applicability of Krishnamurti Padhdhati by 
applying it to Astottari, Kalachakra and Lagna Dasa Systems 
taking two events namely the native's marriage and the 
birth of his daughter.

ls the horoscope a correct one? 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 112 


Here the sub lord of the Ascendant is Mercury who is in the 
star of Jupiterand sub of Sun Jupiter is aspecting Moon. 
The native is born in the 4th quarter of Punarvasu ruled by 
Jupiter in the sign Cancer (Kataka) ruled by Moon. 


The native's wife is born in the star Uthrabhadra ruled by 
Saturn in the sign Pisces ownd by Jupiter. The sub lord of the 
7th cusp is Saturn in its own star and sub of Ve nus sub. 
Jupiter is aspecting Saturn. 


The native's mother is born in the star Poorvashada ruled 
by Venus in the sign owned by Jupiter. The sub lord of the 9th 
cusp is Saturn who is deposited in its own star and Venus sub. 
Jupiter is aspecting Saturn. 


The native's wife is born in the star Barani owned by Venus 
falling in the sign Aries (Mesha) ruled by Mars. The sub lord of 
the 4th cusp is Moon who is in the star of Jupiter and in own 
sub. Moon is aspecting Venus. Jupiter is associated with Kethu 
who represents Mars by sign. 


The native's daughter is born in the star Sravana owned by 
Moon in the sign Capricorn (Makara) owned by Saturn. The 
sub lord of the 5th cusp is Mercury who is deposited in the star 
of Jupiter and sub of Sun. Jupiter is aspecting both Moon and 
Saturn. 


Thus it is clear that the horoscope is correct. The person, 
Mr. Nagoji Rao, is my son's co-son-in-law. He is an Engineer. 
His marriage took place on Friday 11-5-1959 


-R.BT- 113 


at around 10 a.m. His daughter is born on Thursday, 
10-4-1980, at 6-15 a.m. 


We generally judge the houses 2,7 and 11 of a nativity 
for marriage. The same houses for the would-be life partner 
(wife/husband) are 8, 1, 5, of the native. When we consider 
2, 7 and 11 as essential houses for a person's marriage 
the same houses for the life partner counted from the 7th 
house should equally be treated as essential. Thus the 
Ascendant of a nativity should, not be treated as a negation 
of the 2nd house particularly in the case of first marriage. 
This is my humble submission. 


|. Application on Krishnamurti Padhdhati to 
Vimshottari Dasa System : 
A) Marriage :- 
This is what all of us are regulary following. 


a) The sublord of, the 7th cusp is Saturn who is 
lord of 7, is deposited in own star and sub of Venus, Karaka 
for marriage. Saturn is also aspected by Venus and Jupiter 
lord of 5 and 8 (11 and 2 of wife). So marriage is promised 
to the person. 


b) Moon is in applying conjunction with Saturn in 11 
constituting what is called marriage Punarphoo, i.e., it 
causes delay in marriage. The native's marriage took place 
when he was 38 years of age, surely a late marriage. 


-ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 114 


c) Since Saturn is the sub lord of the 7th cusp, the age 
difference between, the husband and wife should be more 
toan normal. Actually the age difference between the 
husband and wife is 11 years and 8 months (His wife is 
born on 22-11-1958). 


d) The sub lord of the 7th cusp is Saturn who is in the 
11 th house, Friends and relatives are indicated bythe 
11 th house. The native married hissister'sdaughter. 


According to Vimshottari Dasa System, the balance of 
Jupiter Dasa at birth is 3 y-7m-25d. The native's marriage 
took place on 11 -5-1979 which falls in the Dasa of Mercury 
and bhukthi, anthra and sookshamaof Rahu. 


The Dasa Lord Mercury is lord of 2,11 and 7 in the star 
ofJupiter, lord ofSand 8 (11/2ofwife) and subofSun, 
lord of Ascendant (7 of wife) in 7. And Mercury has no 
planets in its stars or Sub. 


The bhukthi, anthra and sookshama lord, Rahu, 
represents Jupiter and Mars by aspect,Moon by star and 
Venus by sign. Jupiter is lord of5/8 (11/2 ofwife) in the 
star and sub of Saturn, lord of 7 in 11. Mars in 6 in own 
star is detrimental, but Mars is in the sub of Moon in 11 and 
is aspecting Ascendant (7 of wife) and 2. As Moon is in 11, 
Rahu is a significator of 11. Moon is in the star of Jupiter 
and in own sub. Venus isthe karaka planet for marriage in 


115 


5 (11 of wife) in the star of Sun, lord of Ascendant (7 of 
wife) in 7, and sub of Saturn, lord of 7 in 11. Thus Mercury 
and Rahu and lords of the Dasa, Bhukthi etc., rightly brought 
about the native's marriage. 


Transit at the time of marriage at 10 a.m. on 11 -5-1979is 
as follows :-The Sun is in Aries (Mesha) Venus star and 
Kethu sub (in the horoscope Kethu is in the star of Saturn 
and so is a significator of 7 and 11. Also Kethu represents 
Jupiter and Mars). 


The Moon is in the star Swathi' ruled by the Bhukthi, 
Anthra and sookshama lord Rahu and sub of Venus. Mercury 
(Dasa lord and lord of houses 2/11) is in the star of Kethu 
in Aries (Mesha) and Rahu sub, Rahu is in Venus star in 
Leo (Simha) and Jupiter sub. The 7th lord and sub lord of 
the 7th, cusp is Saturn who transited in the star and sub of 
Venus in Leo (Simha). Lord of 5/8 (11/2 of wife) Jupiter is 
in Saturn star and Venus sub in Cancer (Kataka). The sub 
lord of the Ascendant (7th of wife is Mercury whose transit 
as Dasa lord has already been seen. The lord of the 
Ascendant (7th of wife) is the Sun himself. Thus the transits, 
with reference to the lords of Dasa, Bhukthi etc., the 
luminaries, sub lord of the essential 7th cusp, lords of 2, 7 
and 11 of the native were as those counted from the 7th 
house agrees in full. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 116 


B) Child Birth : 


Progeny is to be perused from the 11th cusp (5th of 
wife). The sub lord of the 11th cusp is Saturn who is in its 
own star in and sub of Venus in 5. Saturn and Venus are 
not in barren signs. Putrakaraka, Jupiter, is not in a barren 
sign. Jupiter is in the star and sub of Saturn in 11. Even 
the sub lord of the 5th cusp who is Mercury is in the star 
of Jupiter lord of 5 and 8 (11/2 of wife) showing promise of 
child birth. 


The native's daughter was bom on Thursday 
10-4-1980 at 6-15a.m. when he was running Mercury dasa, 
Rahu bhukthi. Saturn anthra and Moon sookshama. Dasa 
lord Mercury is lord of 2 and 11 in the star of Jupiter, lord 
of 5 and & (11 and 2 of wife) and sub of Sun who is in the 
star of Rahu representing Venus (in 5), Jupiter lord of 5 
and 8, Moon (occupant of 11) and Mars aspecting 2. Bhukthi 
lord, Rahu, represents, as we have noted, Jupiter lord of 
5/8; Venus, an occupant of 5 ;Moon, an occupant of 11; 
and Mars aspecting 2. Anthra lord Saturn is in 11, aspecting 
2, in own star and sub of Venus in 5. Saturn is aspected 
by Jupiter, lord of 5 and 8. Sookshama lord Moon, is in 11 
in the star of Jupiter and in own sub. 


Transit on the day of child birth (10-4-1980) the Sun 
transited the star of dasa lord, Mercury, in Pisces (Meena) 
and in Jupiter sub. The sookshama lord, Moon transited its 


-RB.T. - 117 


own star In Capricorn (Makara) and in the sub of the anthra 
lord Saturn. Dasa lord, Mercury, was over the star of Jupiter 
in Pisces (Meena) and sub of the sookshama lord Moon. 
Bhukthi lord, Rahu, was in Leo (Simha) in the star of Kethu 
(a significator of 11 and representative of Jupiter) and sub 
of Sun (in the horoscope Sun is in the star of Rahu who 
represents Jupiter, Venus etc). Anthra lord, Saturn, transited 
the star of Sun and sub of the sookshama lord, Moon. The 
5th lord and ‘Putrakaraka’, Jupiter, moved over Kethu star 
in Leo (Simha) and Rahu sub. 


The sub of the 5th cusp and lord of 2 and 11 is Mercury 
who is the Dasa lord.Jupiter is the ruler of the 2nd and 
11 th for wife, and Mercury is her 5th lord. The sub lord of 
the 5th cusp for wife is Saturn who is the Anthra lord. Thus 
the transits agree in all respects from the native's side as 
well as from his wife's. 


11. Application of Krishnamurti Padhdhati to Astottari 
Dasa System : 


It is said that Astottari Dasa System gives accurate 
results to those who are bornin Sukta Paksha. There are 8 
Dasas in this system and the duration of all the Dasas 
together is 108 years The name of this system itself implies 
that itis Astottara Satham in this system Kethuis eliminated 
from holding the lordship of any star and consequently 
Kethu Dasa is not found in this system. Anew constellation

Abhijit is introduced between Uthrashada and Sravana. The 
longitudinal length 8 of these three Stellar zones are as 
follows. Uthrashada from 266°-40" to 276°-40' Abhijit from 
276°-40' to 280°- 53'-20' and Sravana from 280°-53’'-20' to 
293°-20'.Lordship of planets over different stars, length of 
dasa pf each planet and order of Dasaa in tbe Astottari 
System are given below. 


Arudra, Punarvasu, Pusbyam, Aslesha -Sun-6 years. 
Makha,Puram, Uthram -Moon-15 years. 
Hastham, Chitrai, Swathi, Visakham —-Mars-8 years.

Uthrabhadra, Revathi, Aswini, Bharani -Rahu-12 years. 
Krithigai, Rohini, Mrigaslra -Venus-21 years. 


In the horoscope on hand, Moon,is 131°-14' ahead or 
Sun, which indicates that thebirth is in Sukla Faksha.So 
Astottari System should give correct results.

| may say that for those who are not.in touch with 
Kalachakra Dasa System unless the article of October 
1977 Astrology and Athishta referred to above is a kept 
side by side, the process of this system and the discussion 
made herein will be unintelligible. As a matter of fact. 
Sri.Nayar's illuminating article should be studied thoroughly 
to understand the whole thing. 


Moon at birth is in Punarvasu 4th pada. Punarvasu 
belongs to group A stars. The 4th pada is ruled by Moon. 
So, the lord of the dasa at birth is the Moon. This system 


gives correct results if the Moon in the horoscope is

associated with or aspected by the lord of the dasa at birth 
terms of this system. In the chart under study, Moon is the 
Dasa lord at birth according to the Kalachakra Dasa System. 
So this system should give correct results. .

-~ASTAO SECRETS & KP. - 126 


Thus it can be seen that (Leo) Sun bhukthi runs from 
12-11-1978 to 22-5-1979. 


Anthras In (Leo) Sun bhakthi or 6 months 11 days. 
Leo, Simha, Sagittarius Dhanur and Aries are Mesha trine 
signs. Divisor for Aries trine is 100. Aries is the Chara 
Rasi. So the Anthras commence with (Aries) Mars followed 
by (Taurus) Venus etc. 


The first Anthra of (Aries) Mars is : 
6m 11d x 7 = 13 days 
100 


Since the native's marriage took place towards the end 
of Sun bhukthi, the last anthra will be that of (Sagittarius) 
Jupiter which is: 

6m 11d X10.= 19days. 

100 


This anthra runs between 4-5-79 and 23-5-79. The 
marriage took place in Mercury dasa, Sun bhukthi and 
Jupiter anthra. 


The 7th cusp falls in Sathabisha 2 ruled by (Virgo) 
Mercury who is lord of 2 and 11 in 7. Mercury is in 
poorvabhadra 3 ruled by (Taurus) Venus, the Karaka planet 
for marriage occupying the 5th and aspecting the 
7th lord Saturn..So marriage is Indicated. 


-R.B.T.- 127 


A) Marriage: 


Dasa lord, Mercury, is lord of 2 and 11 in 7 in 
Poorvabhadra 3 ruled by (Taurus) Venus in 5. Bhukthi 
lord, Sun, is lord of the Ascendant (7 of wife) in 7 in 
Sathabisha 4 ruled by (Pisces) Jupiter, lord 1 of 5and 8 
aspecting the 7th lord Saturn. Anthra lord, Jupiter, is lord 
of 5 and 8 (11, 2 of wife) In Anuradha 1 ruled by (Pisces) 
Jupiter. 


At the time of marriage at 10 a.m. on 11.5-79 Sun was 
in Barani 4 (Cancer) of Moon (Moon was an occupant of 
the 11th house in the Horoscope). Moon was in Swathi 3 
(Taurus) of Venus. Dasa lord, Mercury, was in Aswini 3 
(Taurus) of Venus. Bhukthi lord is Sun. 


The anthra lord, Jupiter, is in Pusbyam 2 (Aquarius) 
Saturn, lord of 7. Mercury rules the 7th cuspal 
point while Jupiter rules the cuspal point 7th from the 7th. 
Lord of 2 and 11 is the Dasa lord, Mercury. Lord of 5, 8 
(11, 2 of wife) is the anthra lord, Jupiter, and lord of the 
Ascendant (7 of wife) is the Bhukthi lord Sun. 
Their transit at the time of marriage has just been seen. 
The 7th lord Saturn is in Pubba 1 (Pisces) of Jupiter who 
is the anthra lord. 


Thus the transit agrees in full. 
B) Child Birth :- 
The 5th cusp falls in Moola 4 (Cancer) of Moon who is 


in 11 in the.4th pada of punarvasu (Cancer) Moon. Moon 


-ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 128 


is aspected by Jupiter who is Putrakaraka as well as lord 
of 5 and 8 (11, 2of wife). The 11th,cusp falls in Arudhra 2 
owned by (Virgo) Mercury who is lord of 2 and 11 in 
poorvabhadra 3 owned by (Taurus) Venus, an occupan t 
of 5, so child birth is promised. The native's daughter was 
born on 10-4-1980 at 6-15 a.m. The native runs the Dasa 
of (Virgo) Mercury upto 6.5-1980. As shown in the case 
of the native's marriage, the bhukthis in (Virgo) Mercury 
dasa start with (Capricorn) Saturn and the last bhukthi will 
be that of (Virgo) Mercury and it operates from 22-5-79 to 
6-5-80. The anthra in (Virgo) Mercury bhukthi starts with 
(Capricorn) Saturn and ends with (Virgo) Mercury. The 
last anthra of (Virgo) Mercury runs from 30-3-80 to 
6-5-80. The child birth actually took place during this period 
only. Therefore child birth falls in (Virgo) Mercury dasa 
(Virgo) Mercury bhukthi and (Virgo) Mercury anthra. If 
we proceed in the same manner. It will be seen that 
(Aries) Mars sookshama period in (Virgo) Mercury anthra 
runs from 8-4-80 to 11-4-80 Dasa bhukthi and anthra lord 
Mercury is lord of 11 (5 of wif e) and 2 in the 3rd pada of 


Poorvabhadra ruled by (Taurus) Venus, an occupant of 5 
(11 of wife). 


The sookshama lord, Mars, is in Dhanista 4th7pada 
owned by (Sagittarius) Jupiter, lord of 5 and 8 (11, 2 of 
wife) and putrakaraka. Transit at the time of child birth is 
that the sun is in Revathi 4 (Cancer) Moon, an occupant of 


- R.B.T. - 129 


11 and the star lord of 5. Moon is in Sravana 2 
(Virgo) Mercury who Is the dasa lord. The dasa, bhukthi 
and anthra lord, Mercury who is in Poorvabhadra 4 (Cancer) 
of Moon, Jupiter, lord of the native's 5th and lord of 2 and 
11 of his wife is in Makha 3 (Virgo) Mercury who is the 
dasa lord and lord of 2 and 11. Moon rules the 5th 
cuspal point while Mercury rules the 11 th cuspal point and 
their tansit has been seen. Thus the transit agrees in all 
respects. 


IV. Application of Krishnamurti Padhdhati to the lagna 
dasa 

In this system all the cusps will have the same longitude 
as the 10th cusp. The main characteristic of this system is 
that the dasa balance at birth is obtained from the 
longitude of the Ascendant in the Vimsottari system. In the 
other dasa systems the position of the Moon is used to 
determine the balance of dasa at birth. Here the lagna 
dasa differes from other systems. Another feature of the 
lagna dasa system followed by Sri. B.N.Nayak is that the 
cuspal points are useful only to note down the lords of star 
and sub of the cuspal point but the cpspal point has no 
relevance to a bhava as the cuspal point is not the starting 
point or the end point, or the middle of the bnava. A bhava 
commences with the commencement of a sign and ends 
where the sign ends. For example, if the 2nd cusp falls in 
Aries (Mesba), no matter whatever be the position of the 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 130 


2nd cuspal point, the whole Aries is treated as the 2nd 
bhava. | may say in this connection that the bhava system 
followed by Sri. Nayak differs from the traditional system 
also. In the traditional system, the rasi chart and bhava, 
chart are different. A planet in the 4th sign from the 
Ascendant may go to the 3rd bhava or it may remain in the 
4th bhava in the traditional system. 


Changes observed in this system in the lordship of cuspal 
star and sub are given below : 


Il Moon - Rahu 

Vill Saturn -Moon. 

Dasa balance at birth is to be calculated as if Moon is in 
11 °-54'in Leo (Simha). This gives Kethu dasa balance at 
birth as 0 year, 9 months, 1 day. 


A) Marriage :- . 
The sublord of the 7th cusp is Saturn, who its lord of 7 
aspecting 2 and is aspected by Jupiter lord of 5 and 8,Satum 


-R.B.T. - 131 


Is in its own star and sub of Venus, the chief governer for 

marriage. So marriage is promised. Marriage took place 

in Moon dasa, Saturn bhukthi Rahu anthra and Mercury 

sookshama running from 30-4-79 to 12-5-79, The date was 
11 -5-79 Dasa lord Moon is lord of 12 in 12, but Moon is in 
the star of Jupiter, lord of 5 and 8. Moon is conjoined with 

7th lord, Saturn and is aspccted by Venus and Jupiter. 


Bhukthi lord Saturn is aspecting 2 and is aspected by 
Venus and Jupiter. 


Saturn is lord of 7 in own star and sub of Venus. 


Anthra lord Rahu represents Mars, Jupiter, Moon and 
Venus. Here Jupiter and Venus are significators of the 7th 
house. Mars is in 7 in own star. Sookshama lord, Mercury, 
is lord of 2 and 11 in 7, in the star of Jupiter and sub of 
Sun in 7. So Mercury as the sookshma lord is the strongest 
to bring about the marriage of the native. Transit at the time 
of marriage was that the Sun moved in Venus star, Kethu 
sub. In the chart Kethu represents Jupiter, Mars and Saturn. 
Moon is in Venus sign, in the star of anthra lord, 


Rahu. Bhukthi lord, Saturn, is in the star and sub of 
Venus in Leo. Anthra lord, Rahu, in Leo in Venus star, 
Jupiter sub. Sookshma Iord, Mercury, is in Aries in Kethu 
star, Rahu sub. The 7th sub lord is Saturn and Ascendant 
(7 of wife) sub lord is Mercury who are lords of the dasa 
period. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 13% 


The lord of 5 and 8(11 and 2 of wife). Jupiter, is in 
Saturn star. Venus sub. Thus the transit agrees tn full. 


B) Child Birth :- 


The 5th cusp sub lord is Mercury who is lord of 2 and 
11 in the star of Jupiter lord of 2 and 8 (11, 2 of wife). 
The 11th cusp sub lord is Saturn who is aspecting 2 and is 
aspected by Jupiter, lord of 5 and 8, as well as putrakaraka. 
So child birth is promised. The native's daughter was born 
on 10-4-80 at 6.15 a.m. when the native was undergoing 
Moon dasa, Mercury bhukthi and Moon anthra and 
sookshama. Dasa, Anthra and sookshama lord Moon, is in 
the star of Jupiter, lord of 5 and 8 (11, 2 of wife) and in 
own sub. Also Moon is aspected by Jupiter Bhukthi lord, 
Mercury, is lord of 17 (5 of wife) and 2 and a significator of 
5 and 8 placement in the star of Jupiter. 


Transit at 6-15 a.m. on 10-4-80, the day of birth of the 
child was as follows :- 


The Sun was In the star of the bhukthi lord, Mercury 
and sub of Jupiter. 


Bhukthi lord Mercury transited Jupiter star and the sub 
of the dasa, anthra and sookshma lord, Moon. 


The 5th cusp sub lord is the bhukthi lord Mercury. 


The 11 th cusp sub lord is Saturn who is in the star of 
Sun and sub of Moon. Inthe chart, the Sun is associated 


-R.B.T.- 133 


with Mercury and in the star of Rahu representing 
Jupiter. Thus the transit agrees completely. 


Conclusion : - \tis clear from the foregoing discussion 
that a planet gives the result of its star lord. In other words 
a tenant is stronger than the owner. This is the fundamental 
principle in Krishnamurti Padhdhati and can be universally 
applied to any dasa system. The applicability of 
Krishnamurti Pachdhati to any dasa system is in itself a 
strong proof of its scientific nature.

RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME 


Birth rectification is the most important aspect in 
Astrology. | am appealing to all astrologers that they must 
do birth rectification before casting horoscope. In my 30 
years of experience, the consultants are not giving correct 
birth time. Even in hospitals also the birth time is not 
recorded accurately. If you have not done rectification of 
birth time, how can your predictions come true? This point 
was lurking in my mind for a very long time. Therefore | 
took much pains to arrive at a correct formula for this 
purpose. There are many methods, but none of them are 
very reliable. In my opinion the Krishnamurti Padhdathi is 
very minute and accurate one in Astrology. If Krishnamurti 
Padhdathi followers could not find out correct birth time 
they cannot get correct sublords of the cusps, when they 
cannot get correct sub-lord, their predictions will fail. 
Therefore | sent my findings to the Editor of K.P. & 
Astrology. The Editor of this book published my article 
reg : the three steps of birth rectification in the title of 
Research Study in May '91 issue of Astrology & Athrishta. 
| am very grateful to him for his kindness. 


Now | am receiving letters from the readers of this 
magazine requesting me to write an article regarding 
Nakshatra Ganitha and Tatwa Shodhana with some 
examples. | think they did not understand properly this 


-ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 135 


method. Therefore | am writing this article with two examples 
of horoscopes as to how to apply this method and what 
accuracy we can get. 


First Nakshatra Ganitha for correct birth star and its 
pada and birth time is to be considered. See the example 
horoscopes as how to calculate Nakshthra Ganitha. 
Secondly. Tatwa Shodhana or Kalachakra table for referring 
sex. Kalachakra begins at 5.30 a.m. IST 5.30 a.m. 5.36 
a.m. Prithvi, 5.36 to 5.48 a.m. Jala, 5.48 to 6.06 a.m. Agni, 
6.06 to 6.30 a.m. Vayu, 6.30 to 7.00 a.m. Aakasha. This is 
acendent. Then 7.00 to 7.30 a.m. Aakasha, 7.30 to 7.54 
a.m. Vayu, 7.54 to 8.12 a.m. Agni, 8.12 to 8.24 Jala, 8.24 
to 8.30 Prithwi. This is descendent. According the above, 
prepare table for 24 hours. The 8 ascendants and 8 
descendents will follow each other for 24 hours. Male child 
will be born in Prithwi, Agni and Aakasha tatwas. Female 
child will be born in Jala and Vayu tatwas. Please see 
example horoscopes for confirming sex. Please refer to 
example horoscope for comparing Kalachakra. Finally 
verify the ruling planets of the nearest relatives of the chart 
for confirmation. 4th house Mother, 3rd house brother, 11th 
Elder brother or sister, 9th house Father, 7th house. Wife, 
5th house Children, rasilord. Star-lord. Sub-lord Relatives 
R.P. are Day-lord. Star-lord Rasi-lords. These planets should 
be connected in anyway for that house. 


By following the above methods in my opinion one can 
correctly predict the birth time With relative accuracy which 
is the cornerstone for all further predictions.

BIRTH TIME & BIRTH STAR 
RECTIFICATION AS PER K.P. & RP 


On 30th Jan '91 a lady came with the horoscose of her 
brother to confirm the birth time as the chart was cast for 12- 
40 Night of 22nd June ‘66 and the birth certificate showing the 
time 12-44A.M. IST af 22nd June 1966. 


so, | asked her to give a number within 108 for the birth 
time rectification. She said 90 at 1-24 RM. IST No. 90 will 
come under 26-40 Capricorn i.e., Saturn sign Mars star Jupiter 
sub. Moon was in Moon sign Mercury star Mercury sub. So,| 
fixed his birth must be in Jupiter sign Saturn star Mars sub and 
as Mercury is in the star lord and Sub lord | fixed his birth must 
be Aslesha star. | worked for both the time i.e. for 12-40 & 
12-44 A.M. IST of 22nd June 66. | found Jupiter sign Saturn 
star Mars Sub for the time 12-44.A.M. IST. i.e., the lagna degree 
fall at 12-16-11 in Pisces. 


When | worked planetary positions at that time ! found Moon 
was in 106-14-24 i.e., Moon sign Saturn star Jupiter sub. So, 
| got confusion which made me to rectify the birth star. Once 
again | took a number within 108 for which she had given 96 at 
1-50 p.m. {ST At that time Moon was in Moon sign Mercury 
star and Mercury sub and lagna for the No was Saturn sign 
Rahu star Venus sub. Day lord is Mercury.For the birth time as 
per Mahabala's Ephemeris for 1991 to 2000. Moon was in 
Moon sign Saturn star Jupiter sub which did not coincide with 


- ASTRO SECRETS & K.P. - 


143 


the Birth star rectification as the ruling planets were Saturn, 
Rahu, Venus, Moon, Mercury, Mercury and Mercury. So | fixed 
that the native must have been born in the Moon sign Mercury 
star Mercury sub and Venus sub-sub. Because Mercury is the 
star lord sub lord and day lord. Jupiter didn't appear in the 
ruling planets but for the time 12-44 a.m. IST Moon was in the 
Moon star Saturn sign Jupiter as per Ephemeris. 


From this point we can understand the perfectness of 
RULING PLANETS IN THE KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI. 


Ephemeris may be wrong in giving the planetary positions 
correctly but the RULING PLANETS WILL GIVE THE 
ACCURACY IN RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME AND BIRTH 
STAR.

STELLAR ASTROLOGY AND TIMING 
OF MARRIAGE 


Man, by naiure’, is a gregarious being. His first iearning. as 
a child results from imitation and, as age advances, he tends 
increasingly to bind himself to others in partnership. Human 
beings have a certain chemistry that draws two people to one 
another unalterably and causes them to fulfil a special yearning 
for each other. Man's primary partner is a life mate with whom 
he can function on all the levels of being open to him. 

As we all know, everything in the universe is comprised of 
energy. This energy is polarized between masculine-feminine, 
positive-negative, day-night, etc. In order for creation to take 
place, the energy must be polarized. Marriage is the response 
of human nature to the universal law of polarity. It serves to fulfil 
divine purpose of propagating the species. 


"Marriage", as F. W. Robertson has aptly described, "is not 
a union merely between two creatures it is a union between 
two spirits; and the intention of that bond is to perfect the nature 
of both, by supplementing their deficiencies with the force of 
contrast giving to each sex those excellencies in which it is 
naturally deficient; to the one strength of character and firmness 
of moral will; to the other, sympathy, meekness, 
tenderness........ there is no earthly relationship which has so 
much power to ennoble and to exalt". 


The science of Astrology explains existence and life. Itis a 
unique system of interpretation of the correlation of planetary 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KR - 145 


action in human experience. Its secret lies in the understanding 
of Time. The three most important factors which constitute the 
foundation for all astrological work are the planets, the signs 
and the houses. Each sign is identified by certain 
characteristics whiié each house describes the special 
department of life through which the individual would enter into 
relationship with his environment. The planets represent focal 
points of unconscious energies. Associated with basic life 
principles. For instance, Jupiter governs the principle of 
expansion through growth materially and by understanding. In 
the Hindu literature of yore, he is called 'Brihaspati (Brin means 
expansion). Mars tules the principle of activity through 
enterprise, initiatory force, self-assertion and energetic 
expression. Saturn expresses the principle of control or 
limitation. Venus presides over the principle of unity, 
adaptability and harmony. Mercury's life principle is 
communication through mental and nervous coordination and 
transmission. The Sun's principle is power, vitality and self 
expression, and that of the Moon is fluctuating. 


The planetary principles are not expressed in the same way 
through all the signs. If suppose in a chart, Mercury is posited 
in Rishaba in the 7th house, how will it work? Mercury, as we 
have seen, represents the communication principle. Rishaba 
is an earthy, fixed sign and shows materiality and practicality. 
Mercury in Rishaba would incline the individual to think in 
concrete terms so that he would orient himself towards practical 
goals. The sign is as important to a planet as an adjective is to 
a noun. The effect of a planet in a sign would be further modified 
by other factors. such as the house occupied the constellation 


-R.B.T. - 146 


tenanted and the aspects received. Mercury in the 7th 
house.which rules partnership in life of business as well as all 
those with whom there is any dealing reveals that the 
individual's mental faculties would be used in a concrete or 
practical way in affairs connected with partnership or any matter 
which implies reciprocity of rapport with other people. Mercury 
in the 7th house in the constellation of a signification of the 4th 
house would denote marriage with a relative and in the 
constellation of a significate of the 9th house marriage with an 
unknown person or a stranger. Mercury in the 7th house in the 
constellation of lord of 5 occupying the 11th house shows 
successful culmination of iove in marriage and lasting 
friendship. Mercury in the 7th house in the constellation of lord 
of 5, occupying the 8th or the 12th house shows difficulties by 
association, scandal and hostile criticism. Mercury in the 7th 
house identical with Rishaba generally indicates unsettled 
married life and dissension with the partner but also legacy 
and financial success of the marriage. This is so because in 
such a case. Mercury becomes the lord of the 8th and 11th 
houses. Mercury and the 8th house together show mental 
worries and troubles, and Mercury, the 8th and 11th combined 
denote gains by legacy, partner's money etc. If Mercury in such 
a situation is afflicted by constellational position or aspect it 
may make the individual liable to litigation to defend against 
libel from others or on account of libel committed by himself 
(Mercury indicates writings) or in connection with a legacy left 
to him (the 8th house rules legacy and the 7th litigation). 
Mercury in Rishaba in the 7th in the constellation of a planet 
signifying evil houses shows a domineering nagging partner, 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 147 


a sarcastic untruthful and hasty tempered person. If the same 
Mercury is in the constellation of Venus signifying favourable 
houses, say 2. 5. 7and 11, it indicates a successful marriage 
to a youthful, loving, kind and sympathetic person who is ever 
willing to accommodate. The partner will also have good 
physical features and a graceful countenance. It also denotes 
an early marriage and an increase of prosperity after that event. 
The partner will be artistically inclined and would have the way 
for domestic felicity and happiness. By studying the planets in 
this manner and by noting the inter-relationships between the 
planets (aspects) and between the planets and the various 
houses, a correct planetary picture of the individual can surely 
be reached. 


Venus has traditionally been styled as the planet of unity, 
love, sympathy and harmony. She is ever ready to give wound 
and even to alter her own nature, in order to effect a 
compromise or arrive at a mutual understanding, No wonder 
she has been invested with an important role in affairs 
concerning marriage. She is hailed as the ‘kalathra karaka’, 
the chief governor for matrimony. Of the signs. Thula has 
connection with the principle of union, and this again is ruled 
by Venus. In astrological language, the 7th house bears 
reference to union of partnership of any kind, be it marriage or 
business on trade ties, agreements, etc. This house, more than 
any other, tells us about the prospective spouse of the individual, 
the nature of marriage, the number of marriages that wil! be 
contracted, and the state of married life in general. In the 
traditional system practised in India, the o!d astrologers only 
took Venus and the 7th house into account. Prof. K. S. 


-RBT: 148 


Krishnamurti, the author of the now famous Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati, went a step further. He argued that a marriage is 
after all the strictest tie of perpetual friendship and contributes 
to the expansion of the family the houses 2 and 174 should 
additionally be considered. The 2nd house deals with family 
and its growth, and the 11th with ties of a permanent character. 
Thus the 2nd, 7th and 11th houses should be investigated 
together in ascertaining everything related to marriage, the 
prospects of Married life, the personality of the partner and 
the time of marriage. 


It has been said that marriage comes off out late in life if 
(i) Saturn is posited in houses 1,3, 5, 7 and 10 counted from 
the lagna, especially so when in houses 4, 7 and 11 reckoned 
from Chandra and or Sukra, (ii) malefics occupy the 7th and 
adversely aspected, (iii) Mars is in the 8th, (iv) Moon and Saturn 
conjoin together in houses 2, / and 11 and (v) Chandra, Venus 
and lord of 7 receive evil aspect, especially from Jupiter or 
Uranus, or even when favourably aspected by Saturn. With 
these principles in mind, we shall presently see how effectively 
Krishnamurti Padhdhati answers the delay ia fructification of 
marriage and the exact time of marriage. 


The native was born on 22-3-1944 at 10-10A.M. (1.S.T) at 
19°-18' North Latitude and 84°-51' East Longitude. At the time 
of birth, the balance of Mars Dasa according to the Vimshottari 
system was 0 year, 2 months and 28 days.

Significators of marriage 


The significators are the planets who are placed in the 
constellation of those occupying houses 2, 7, 11,the occupants 
of these houses. the planets tenanted in the constellation of 
lords of these houses, and the lords of 2,7 and 11. 


2np House-Rahu is in the 2nd house. Venus is in Rahu's 
nakshatra. Mercury owns the 2nd. Jupiter is in Mercury's 
nakshatra. 


71H House-Unoccupied. Mars is the lord of the house. Mars 
occupies his own star and Saturn and Moon are also posited 
in Mars' star. 


11™ House-Mercury alone occupies this house. Jupiter is 
stationed in the star of Mercury. Jupiter is lord of 11 and no 
planet is in Jupiter's star. 


So the significators are Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Rahu, 
Moon, Saturn and Mars. Jupiter aspects the 7th and 11th house 
(by the 5th and 9th aspect) as well as Mercury in the 11 th house. 
Jupiter is the dasa lord receiving aspect from Saturn, the 
delaying planet. 


Venus in the constellation of Rahu who occupies the 2nd 
house and also conjoined with Jupiter, lord of 11,and Mercury, 
lord of 2 occupying the 11th house aspected by lord of 11 are 
strong significators by virtue of the conjoint ownership of the 
7th cusp as star and sub lord. 


As Saturn aspects the dasa Jord, Jupiter, the 7th house and 
the kalathra karaka (Venus) the fructification of marriage should 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KR - 151 


be delayed. Also, Saturn is posited in the lagna and in 4th 
reckoned from both Venus and Moon. The 7th house receives 
Saturn's aspect. Mars aspects the 8th house. Venus and Moon 
are in evil aspect with Uranus (square) and Jupiter (quincunx). 
Moon and Venus also receive Saturn's aspect according to 
the Indian system. 


These testimonies favour delayed marriage: As the sub- 
lord of the 7th house is Venus, who is the chief governor for 
matrimony and as Venus is also a significator of the 2nd house, 
the prospect of marriage taking place is confirmed, but as 
Venus is aspected by Saturn, the time of the marriage is 
delayed. 


The native is at present running Jupiter's dasa which 
commenced on 20-6-1862. From 2-5-1970 be ran the bhukti of 
Venus till 2-1-1973. The details are:

-R.B.T. - 152 


Jupiter and Mercury are posited in the sub of Rahu in the 
2nd house. Venus is placed in the sub of Mercury, lord of 2 in 
11. None of the other planets occupy the sub of the occupants 
of houses 2, 7 and 11. 


The anthra of Mercury in Venus bhukti operating between 
20-68-1972 and 6-1|-1972 was therefore selected as the most 
significant period for marriage. During this time, when Sun 
transited in Mercury's sign Mithuna in the star of Rahu, a 
significator not only by virtue of his placement in the 2nd but 
also his conjunction with Jupiter (lord of 11), lord of 7, Mars, 
transited in the 2nd house in dasa lord Jupiter’s star, lord of 2 
and anthra lord, Mercury, transited his own sign in the 2nd house 
in the star of dasa lord, Jupiter, and sub of bhukti lord. Venus, 
Moon transited the star of Jupiter, dasa lord, and sign of Venus, 
bhukti lord, and when Venus herself transited her own sign and 
the star of lord of 7, the betrothal took place. The day was Friday 
the 23rd June 1972. 


The marriage was celebrated on Saturday the 19thAugust 
1972 when (i) lord of 7, Mars, transited in Simha in, aspect to 
the 7th house (4th aspect), bhukti lord Venus. (7th aspect) and 
anthra lord Mercury (8th aspect), (ii) Venus (lord of the bhukti) 
transited exactly in conjunction with the cusp of the 2nd house 
in the radical chart (iii) Mercury transited his own constellation 
Aslesha, (iv) Jupiter and Moon transited in the 7th house, and 
Moon transited the constellation of Mercury in trine aspect with 
dasa lord, Jupiter's natal position.

By ti i system of progression which reckons every day after 
birth as equal to a year of life, the Sun comes to 6° in Mesha in 
sextile (60° degree) aspect with the radial Moon. :?rogressed 
Moon in 20° Kumbha is angular (90° aspect) to ths radial 7th 
house and is in Jupiter's star. Lord of 7, Mars, progresses 
exactly over the cusp of the natal 2rd house. Venus progresses 
in dasa lord’s sign Meena in the constellation of Mercury, anthra 
lord. J 


In Western Astrology, the square aspect has been 
considered as unfavorable by most of the authorities. As far 
as experience goes, the effect of square aspect is not evil in 
the real sense. More aptly it is en aspect of struggle and, 
ultimately, success. The square aspect has been found to excite 
the events in almost all cases. Here Progressed Venus in 18° 
Meena exactly squares progressed Mars in 18°-3]' Mithuna 
as well as Progressed VII cusp in 16°-46' Dhanus. Progressed 
Moon is in exact square aspect to the lagna and the 7th cusps 
at birth. The effects of aspects of progressed Venus and 
progressed Moon in the present case serve to show that we 
cannot lay much store by the so called evil effects of square or 
opposition aspects. On the other hand, they have been 
instrumental in bringing to pass an auspicious event. 


The above illustration amply goes to prove that the system 
of stellar astrology propounded by the late Prof. Krishnamurti 
alone can clearly pinpoint the nature and time of an event 
accurately. Or else, how can the celebration of marriage in 
Jupiter dasa, Venus bhukti, Mercury anthra and Moon 


-ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 155 


sookhama be justified? Jupiter aspects the 7th house, it may 
be argued, but does marriage take place in Jupiter dasa 
whenever it throws such aspect? Is ita uniform rule? Venus is, 
of course. the kalathra karaka but unless she is connected to 
the 7th house in some manner can marriage come about 
according to the traditional rules? Is Venus connected to the 
7th house or of even to 2 or 11 by occupation? In what way 
according to the traditional system, are Mercury and Moon 
concerned with marriage? Do they own the 7th house or occupy 
itor even aspect it? Stellar astrology alone can give us the 
right answer Jupiter by his ownership of the 11th and 
occupation of the constellation of an occupant of the 11th. 
Venus by her occupation of the constellation of a planet in the 
2nd, Mercury by reason of his rulership over the 2nd and 
occupation of the 11th and Moon by the constellations position 
(in the constellation of lord of 7) brought about marriage in 
Jupiter dasa, Venus bhukthi, Mercury anthra and Moon 
sookshama. The day of marriage was a Saturday and Saturn 
was a significator by virtue of his situation in the star of Mars, 
lord of 7, and sub of Jupiter, lord of 11. This is the real 
explanation. The rules of Krishnamurti Padhdhati are simple, 
sound and scientific and do not admit of any ambiguity Those 
who are still sweating by the old system and groping in the 
dark would do well to see the writing on the wall and seek the 
right path of stellar astrology as such to their benefit as to those 
who approach them for astroldgical advice. 


GOOD LUCK !

RECTIFICATION OF BIRTH TIME 


Astrology is an ancient science, the secrets of which have 
been explained by great sages iike Satyacharya, Bhrigu, 
Varahamihira Parasara, Jaimini, Badarayana, Goutama, ada, 
Sounaka, Bharatwaja, Vasishta, Kalidasa, Yavanas and the 
like. Many great works of these sages have been lost and a 
stage has come when people begin to doubt its varacity and 
question its validity. Reasons are obvious. The present-day so- 
called astrologers not being conversant with the established 
principles or not being in a position to devote the time needed 
to work the details in full and give its deserved attention, dabble 
with the help of an error-ridden meagre chart and proceed to 
pronounce emphatically all sorts of yogas and calamities in 
store, in a single breath with the result that consultants. after a 
time finding nothing turning up as predicted, lose faith in 
astrologers and in turn in astrology also. The pitiable plight is 
self explanatory. In order to arrive at correct conclusions, a 
careful preparation of the chart in accordance with the time old 
principles is an inescapable necessity The mighty preparation 
involved would easily take considerable time which indicates 
that Inscientious astrologer could scrutinise only limited charts 
and attend to limited in his life and this is seldom done. In 
consideration of the above and to let the readers of this valuable 
book know the correct approch to astrology | propose to explain 
the basic principles, starting with the correction of birth time 
which is absolutely essential for any to read a chart correctly 
cast. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KR - 157 


Almanacs available in the market are based on Vakya, 
Siddanta and Drigganitha principles of working. As experience 
tells us, no two almanacs agree, even in a single respect. 
Added to this, the eternal doubts on ayanamsa and 
determination of birth time are there. Are we to take the 
commencement of flow or presentation of head or Bhupatana 
or the first breath as the birth time? Deleveries, conducted 
with surgical assistance, pose another problem. In this 
direction, it has been said that Bhupititana should be treated 
as the final word on the matter. To determine this, is also 
another problem as intimation of birth is often given after a 
few minutes, as the first attention is to be given, even in the 
best run hospitals, to the new born and the mother before and 
other matter can be thought of either by the nurse or the doctor 
in attendance. So the need for correcting the time of birth 
before preparing the ohart is indispensible for any astrologer, 
as predictions pronounced without rectification prove to be 
misleading in a majority of the cases seen. In cases of 


deliveries conducted with surgical assistance it is fair to note 
the time of birth as indicated by Bhupatana and subject the 
same to the principles of rectification of birth time enunciated 
by the sages. 


Mutual aspect or conjunction of Moon with Mars results in 
causing the normal monthly periods at regular intervals of 
determing the date of conception from the date of birth. It has 
been stated that the rising sign and Moon should have the 
relation of benefics at the time of conception and the aspect 


-R.B.T. - 15 


of Sun to achieve the fruit of conception, birth of a healthy child. 
It is also stressed that some benefics be posited in 2, 4, 7, 9 
and 10 houses either from lagna or Moon at the time of 
conception. There has been a difference of opinion on the 
aspects of either Sun or Jupiter to lagna or Moon. Majority of 
the Rishis are of opinion that the aspect of Sun is primary 
though the aspect of Jupiter may be present. Varahamihira 
says that when natural benefics transit 1, 2,4, 5, 7, 9,10 houses 
individually or in group with Moon and with malefics in 3 or 11 
or when Jupiter aspects the adhana lagna, conception is sure. 
The birth of a child takes place normally in the tenth month in 
the sign indicated, by knowing the dwadasamsa occupied by 
Moon at conception. Suppose she occupies the 3rd 
dwadasamsa ofa rasi, it is to be known to which rasi the said 
dwadasamsa belongs and the third house from the above rasi 
would be the position of Moon at birth. That goes to say that 
the rasi of moon at birth would be the rasi indicated by equal 
number of dwadasamsa to the rasi indicated by the moon's 
dwadasamsa rasi at conception. When moon is in the 6th 
dwadasamsa of Kataka at conception, the rasi indicated is 
Dhanus. Moon at birth would be in Vrishaba, the 6th from 
Dhanus. Kalyanavarma and Varahamihira do not agree on this 
line of thought. According to Kalyanavarma, the dwadasamsa 
is to be counted from Mesha and the child would be born in 
the tenth month when Moon transits that rasi so indicated by 
the dwadasamsa elapsed at the time of conception counted 
from Mesha. In the above example, the moon at birth would be 


-ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 159 


in Kanya the 6th rasi from Mesha. Thus it is possible to know 
the position of Moon at birth of conception. Then again the 
difficulty is in determining the date of conception or birth as 
the case would be as Moon's transit in any rasi is two and a 
quarter days approximately, and any rasi comprises of 9 
quarters of any three constellations. Each quarter of a 
constellation has 200 kalas and every dwadasamsa is 150 
kalas. When Moon is in the 9th dwadasamsa of Dhanus, she 
would be transisting Kalas between 1200to 1350 indicating 
that the constellation would be Poorvashadha and its 3rd 
quarter. Then the birth of the child would take place in the rasi 
indicated by the position of moon as explained above at the 
time when 1200 Kalas have passed in that rasi. Thus the time 
of either conception or birth can be determined with reasonable 
precision. 


Normally, when moon transits the 7th house of her position 
at adhana navamsa, delivery takes place or it may be when 
the moon transits the rasis of the lord of adharna navamsa 
lagna. Again on this issue as well, Ramadayalu and 
Varahimihira differed. The former states that birth would take 
place in 5th or 7th rasi to adhana lagna while the latter opines 
that birth is sure to take place in the sign with moon which is as 
many rasis distant from the rasi indicated by her dwadasamsa 
position at the time of adhana. Kalyanavarma says that the 
1 0th constellation from that of the-one at conception would be 
the constellation at birth. | would like readers to refer slokas 9 
to 13 of Sapketa | of Sanketauiuhi. The method explained is 


-R.B.T.- 160 


to add 240 days to the exact number of degrees that lapsed in 
lagna at birth plus the Moon's longitude at birth which sum would 
indicate the number of days intenening from the time of 
conception to that of birth. Please note to add one day for the 
leap year if it intervenes. Other versions are that janma lagna 
would correspond to that of moon at adbana and vice versa. 
Note the bhava having planets on either side. Distance 
between the two nearest planets is to be added to the longitude 
of the preceding planet and subtracted from that of the 
succeeding planet. The point so reached indicates the correct 
longitude of the birth lagna. A period to be followed with a 
fruitful conception occurs when Mars aspects Moon in 
anupachayas. Conception takes place when Sun and Venus 
are posited in upachayas in rasi chart and their own navamsa 
chart of the male partner while the female partners Moon and 
Mars should occupy upachayas and be located in their own 
navamsas. Thus importance is given to the navamsa charts 
which help in of the janma lagna, lord of the lagna atthe time of 
sun-set on the previous day, the planet presiding on that part 
of the day, the lord of the hour and the lord of the rasi occupied 
by Sun for day births and Moon for births at night. This should 
be identical with the navamsa, or janma lagna or the 10th from 
above, thus indicating the correct birth time. Another authority 
says that Moon should be ata place equidistant from adhana 
and janma lagnas of the diltance between the chandra lagna 
and janma lagna or adhana lagna should be the centra! point 
of janma and chandra lagnas at birth or between Sun and Moon 
lagnas at birth. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 161 


According to Vaidhyanatha ‘Dikshita, the child conceived 
on all the even nights would be a boy and on odd nights would 
be a girl of which children conceived on 6th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 
14th, 15th and 16th nights after menses would be fortunate. 
He further proceeds to say that Sun in 3 or in trines to adbana 
lagna indicates birth of a boy. The lagna of conception, Sun. 
Moon and Jupiter being powerful at the time of conception. if 
posited in odd rasis and navamsas, indicate birth of a male 
child. If they happen to occupy even signs, the child to be born 
will be a girl. Itis not possible to see agreement of all the four 
factors in any given horoscope. As such, determination of the 
sex of the child to be born can be assessed from the strength 
of Jupiter and Sun for boys and Moon. Mars and Venus for 
girls. The final pointer would be the position of Saturn in odd 
or even signs when birth of boys or girls would take place 
respectively. Note to leave lagna from the odd signs. When 
Moon is posited in one of the male constellations, the 
ascendant being a male rasi with Jupiter in its trine or with like 
relation in amsa, conception takes place leading to the birth 
of a boy When Moon is found to occupy female constellations 
and the female rasi happens to be the lagna or its navamsa 
with a female planet in trine to the lagna, birth of a girl should 
be expected. From adhana lagna Jupiter and Sun should be 
in odd rasis or navamsas or Jupiter with Moon should be in 
lagna in a Jupiter and Venus should be in a kendra to lagna 
being in trine or square to moon with malefics in 2, 3 and 6 
and Mercury in 7 and 9 houses, or Mercury, Venus, Jupiter in 


-R.B.T. - 162 


7, 1,9 houses from lagna or Jupiter and Moon in 2 and 5, or 
Moon. Venus and Jupiter in 9, 5, 1 houses for birth of boys. 


For births in Sukla Paksha, Janma Lagna will be the Moon 
Lagna at adhana while, in case of births in Krishna Paksha. 
Moon will be in the 7th from janma lagna. 


Depending on chandra kalas, the chandra rasi at birth will 
be rising or setting at adhana. 


According to Varahamihira, lagna is 2° 30° plus (Moon 
longitude +12) and that lagna should be the 9th dwadasamsa 
to Moon at conception for births in the dark fortnight. 


According to Sage Bhrigu, having known the date of birth, 
note: 


(a) The distance of Sun at sunrise from the last point of 
father's Moon navamsa. 


(b) the distance of last point of Keth u’s navamsa at 
sunrise from the last point of Venus in mother’s navamsa. 


(c) the distance of Moon's constellation at sunrise from the 
longitude of all the planets that are related to her at that position 
and double them. 


(d) for each issue add 50". 


(e) add all the four factors in a, b, c and d to the longitude of 
Sun at sunrise which gives the correct degree of Janma Lagna. 


In cases where parents charts are not available :- 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 163 


(a) Determine the longitude of Sun at sunrise from the 
last point of the preceeding navamsa and double it. When 
Moon is aspected by, Rahu at sunrise, triple the above 
longitude, 


(b) add 50' for each child in order, 


(t) add the above two and divide the sum by 3°20’. The 
balance would show the correct longitude of Janma Lagna from 
the first point of the navamsa in that rasi at birth. 


Convert the birth time to ghatis and vighatis. Multiply by 4 
and divide by 9. The remainder indicates the janma nakshatra 
when counted from Aswini, Makha or Moola. 


Multiply the Ghatis and vighatis by 2 and add 5, 9 or 7 as 
the lagna is chara, sthira or dwiswabhava respectively Multiply 
the sum by 4 and divide by 27. The quotient is the constellation 
preceeding the birth constellation when counted from Aswini 
or Chitra. The balance would be the longitude elapsed in the 
constellation at birth. 


As in the above, after multiplying by 2 add 5, 10, 15 and 
follow the same process till end. The quotient will be the 
constellation at birth from Aswani for births in the bright fortnight 
and from Chitra for births in the dark fortnight. 


After multiplying the ghatis and vighatis by 4, add the number 
of sign indicated when counted from Mesha to the rasi at birth 
and divide by 8. The quotient, if even, indicates the birth of a 
male child and if odd, the birth of a girl. 


-R.B.T.- 164 


Divide the janana kala vighatis by 225 and note the 
remainder. The remainder falling between 1 to 15, 46to 90, 
151 to 225 indicates birth of a boy and 16 to 45 and 91 to 150 
indicates birth of a girl. 


Multiply the birth ghatis by 4 and divide by 27: Find the 
constellation indicated by the remainder by counting from 
Aswini. The one so indicated or the 10th from it or the 710th 
again from it would be one of the three constellations of the 
Janana kala dasa lord. 


Multiply the birth ghatis by 4 and divide the vighatis by 15. 
Add both the results and, again divide by 12. The remainder 
is the pranapada rasi which indicates Janma Lagna or its trine. 
The remainder obtained in division by 15 when doubled shows 
the mean pranapada. 


Multiply the ghatis from sunrise till birth by 4 and divide 
vighatis by 15. Note the remainder. Add both the above and 
divide by 12. The remainder indicates the lagna at birth from 
Mesha or its trine. Multiply the remainder above noted by 2 
and add the longitude of Sun in the rasi that day, ignoring the 
longitude of the rasi proper This indicates the actual degree 
at time or birth in the rasi indicated above. 


Convert birth time ghatis and vighatis into vighatis and divide 
by 15. The quotient indicates the sign and degrees which, when 
counted from the Sun that day, gives the longitude of 
pranapada. Ifthe, Sun is in chara rasi, take out the degrees 


ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 165 


thereof from the sign in which he is placed. If it is in sthira or 
dwiswabhava rasis, take the 9th or 5th sign respectively from 
the sign in which Sun is posited plus the degrees in the said 
sign of Sun at birth ignoring the sign longitude. 


Divide the longitude of Moon at birth by 13° 20'. Convert 
the remainder into minutes and divide by 9. If the quotient, when 
divided by 13° 20', is more than 9, divide it again by 9 and 
note the remainder. The quotient thus arrived at would indicate 
the constellation when counted from Aswani, Makha or Moola. 
Note the number of the constellation. Multiply the number so 
obtained 1 °-29' and add to the product the quotient obtained 
above by dividing the remainder in minutes by 9 and call this 
the accoutant of Moon. Note the longitudes of Sun and Lagna. 
Subtract Sun's longitude from that of Lagna and divide the 
balance by 13" 20'. Add the above constant of Moon to the 
quetient and to the sum arrived at, add the Sun's longitude. In 
case the resultant is more than 360, subtract 360 from Moon. 
The result indicates the birth degree. 


Kalidasa says that births take place in 6, 7 or 9 rasis from 
the position of Mandi in rasi of navamsa charts prepared for 
the given time of birth. 


Divide janana kala ghatis from sunrise by 2 and add the 
number of the constellation in which Sun is posited at the time 
of birth. The Sun indicate the constellation in which birth takel 
place. | 


-RBT.- 166 


Multiply the janana kala ghatis by 6 and add the days passed 
from the preceding sank,amana: Divide the total by 30. The 
quotient indicates the rasi at birth when counted from Sun at 
birth. The rasi of Sun at birth should not be included for the 
count. 


Birth rasi would be 5, 7,9 Or 11 from Moon rasi, or 5, 7,9 
from the lord of Moon's rasi or the 5th from him. This count 
would prove correct as well from Sun. 


Itis an established fact that births are caused by Solar Lunar 
energy under the influence of the ruling planet of the week day 
and that human births take place only at specified times while, 
at other times, animals and other species are born. It is also 
the unanimous opinion of all the authorities that adhana lagna 
is the guiding factor for the destinies cf living beings. In view of 
the above, the auspicious times for coitus have been 
prescribed to secure maximum benfits. Birth, Water, Fire, Wind 
and Akasa.the five elements that are responsible for the 
composition of the human body have their own say in 
determining the destiny of lives that take birth in them. Their 
qualities are identical with the nature of planets that govern 
them. Prithvi or Earth is governed by Mercury. Vayu or wind is 
governed by Sarurn; Jala or water ia governed by Moon and 
Venus; Agni or Teja is governed by Sun and Mars; and lastly 
Akasa or ether is governed by Jupiter. These five elements or 
their tatwa, rotate in cyclic order with uniform and specific 


durations commencing from the time of sunrise on the week 


- ASTRO SECRETS & K.P. - 167 


days, presided by their governing dieties. Commencing from 
brithvi, whose ruler is Mercury, the tatwa starts on his week 
day. Wednesday and lasts for 6 minutes. This is followed by 
Jala tatwa which duration is doubled and this tatwa commences 
on Mondays and Fridays, the week days of the presiding 
dieties. Similarly Teja tatwa with a duration of 18 minutes starts 
on Sunday and Tuesdays. Vayu tatwa starts on Saturdays with 
the duration of 24 minutes and finally Absa on Thursdays with 
the duration of 30 minutes. Hence each rotation takes one and 
a half hours to be again followed in cyclic order, thus covering 
the 24 minutes of the time of the day, by making 16 equal 
rotations. The female planets, Moon and Venus, are 
responsible forthe birth of female children in the duration of 
their tatwas white male children are born in the duration of other 
tatwas. Children so born exhibit the nature of the lords of the 
tatwas Karakatwas of these tatwas are the same as the 
karakatwas of their presiding planets. The inter-planetary relay 
birth with the help of the tatwas. The factors required are time 
of birth approximately Week day, constellation on the day of 
birth, the rasi of birth if in chara, sthira or dwiswabhava and 
the sex of the child born. The chart in the preface would show 
the principle in working the system and this commences from 


the time of sunrise of the day of birth.

This tatwa rotates in order for 12 minutes and the

Each constellation is to be treated as lasting for a minute. 


On compiling the cyclic order for all the seven days of the 
week, and 24 hours for each day, it would be readily possible 
to locate the time of the birth desired. When an error is noticed, 
that is to say, when the five factors do not agree as stated 


earlier, the only possible method to rectify tbe time of birth is 
to resort to the principles of determination by locating the 
adhana lagna.

In a nativity 3rd house stands for perception, learning and 
intellect, and the IXth house for reasoning and intuition, higher 
mind, transit that is rapid, prophetic awareness, higher brain 
power delving in to mysterious realms and attaining very 
unusual accomplishments. One should lock atthe IXth house 
to find out if there is BHAGY accumulated as a result of his 
poorvapunya. 


Here the IXth cusp Sub Lord is Ketu. Itis in 2nd in the star of 
Moon in 2nd bhavam, in its own star and owns IXth. And Kethu 
is in the Sub of Mercury signifying | & X. So Bhagyamis there 
evident and it will act through his brain power and VAKKU and 
bring him a great name and status. 


-R.B.T. - 171 


Again in this birth chart, the Lagna Cusp Sub Lord is KETHU. 
KETHU isin II, one of material trinity (Il, VI, X), and placed in 
star of Moon in ll owning IX, a house presenting poorvapunya. 
The very fact Moon, the [Xth owner placed in II in own star 
creates a healthy status, for Poorvapunyam to act in high 
beneficial manner and in as much as the planet Moon the IInd 
significator attains the star lord Ketu, Kethu, the Sub Lord of 
the Lagna sub and IXth cusp. 


such a combination detailed above tells a birth as a result 
of high poorvapunya rinneled through IInd, which stands for 
VAKKU (vocal power) of the material dainty, IInd house stands 
for material prospects through his way of expression of matters 
of extrinsic value his ability to press and his VAKKU. 


IXth cusp Sub Lord is also Kethu. Kethu as already 
discussed is in the star of Moon in !| owning IX, and the same 
Kethu signifies 11 & X through its Sub Lord Mereury. 


As IX, the house of higher brain power and as it is imbibed 
naturally with the quality of rapidity, attain very unusual 
accomplishments with quick down pour of matters, when well 
connected to one of the houses of material trinity ie., Il or VI or 
X. Here as Ilnd that stands for VAKKU is well connected to 
IXth he is able to give astonishingly quick mathematical 
answers which an ordinary person cannot dream to rise to that 
standard at all. The owner of the IXth of house is Moon and he 
is called Mathi, the mind. This Moon is in its own star in Il, and 
in the sub of Jupiter in X another material house, owning V, the 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 


172 


house standing for intellect and intelligence (please note no 
planet tenants the stars of Jupiter). This combination tells that 
the boy is endowed with high intelligence and higher brain 
power to attain very unusual accomplishments. Mopn is usually 
very good if we find it in IInd bavam, promising a gifted tongue. 
If one makes a survey of all the planets, he may find that almost 
all are connected to IXth through IInd bhavam, a powerful 
benefic house. 


Let me discuss one by one, cusp-wise. 


1st cusp Sub Lord Kethu is in Ilnd bhavam in the star of 
Moon in IInd owning IXth The same Kethu is in the Sub of 
Mercury in Il & signifies X. 


IInd cusp Sub Lord Mars in II (no planet in Mars stars) in the 
star of Moon in Il in its own star and owning |X. The same Mars 
is in the Sub of Rahu on the tXth cusp, duly signifying II & XI 
(Rahu is in the sub of Kethu and the IXth cusp is also’ formed 
in the Sub of Kethu. Hence Rahu is deemed to be on the IXth 
cusp and as no planet is tenanting its stars, Rahu acquires the 
IXth signification fully). 


{Itrd cusp Sub Lord Mercury in II, in the star of Sun in Il and 
this planet is well connected to |Xth through Sub Lord Mars 
being placed in the star of Moon in II owning IX. 


IVth cusp Sub Lord Jupiter in the star of Moon in I] owning 
IX and also signifying X &V as no planet is in its stars and in V 
and the same Jupiter is in the Sub of Saturn signifying II, IX 
and X also as no planet is tenanting its stars. 


-R.B.T.- 173 


Vth cusp Sub Lord Mars is well connected to II & IX Please 
see the above discussion regarding IInd cusp), 


Vith cusp Sub Lord Saturn in X (no planet in Saturn stars) 
in the star of Moon in Il owning IX. Saturn is in the own Sub 
and so again signifies Il & IX, apart from X. 


Vilth cusp Sub Lord Mercury is in the star of Sun and so 
signifies Il & X and is in the Sub of Mars signifies Il & IX and 
also . 


VIllth cusp Sub Lord-Sun in the star of Venus in | and so 
signifies1, VII, & X!l, and the same Sun is in the Sub of Saturn 
and so signifies X, Ill, Il, & IX. 


IXth cusp Sub Lord is Kethu (as already discussed) and 
it is in the star of Moon in Il in Thiruvonam and so Kethu 
signifes Il & IX. The same Kethu is in the star of Mercury in 
Il, signifying Il. 


Xth cusp Sub Lord is Jupiter is in the star of Moon in Il 
owning |X, and so signifies ll, 1X, X and is in the Sub of 
Saturn signifying X, J 1 & IX. 


Xlth cusp Sub Lord Mars is in II and in the star of Moon in 
!land no planet in Mars stars as such signifies H, |, VI & IX, 
and also in the Sub of Rahu on the IXth cusp (no planet in 
Rahu stars) and signifies Il & XI (for details see discussion 
on IInd cusp.) 


XlIl cusp Sub Lord Saturn is in X and no planet tenanting its 
stars and Saturn is in the star of Moon in Il owning IX and so 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 174 


signifies Il, IX & X. Saturn is in the Sub of Saturn itself and so 
gets the signification of fl, Ill, IX, & X. 


On an overall assessment of the significations of these 12 
cuspal Sub Lords we note that the Sub Lords are under star or 
sub connected to IX & Il, with better emphasis on the IInd, one 
of the material trinity and thus tells his higher brain power 
attaining very unusual accomplishment. 


Now he is under the major period of Mars from 27-9-1988 
to 27-9-1995. Mars is a full significator of I, VI, Il, & IX through. 
Star Lord and under Sub Lord Rahu, signifies IX, Il, & XI (and 
also Il & IX as node Rahu represents Moon), So in this period 
he earns high name and status through his brain power. 


Period of Rahu is from 27-9-1995 and Rahu on the IXth 
cusp, having and planet in its stars, for VRISCHIKA lagna 
natives, is a matter debatable.

-R.B.T. - 179 


To sum up, but for the Saturn's impediments and a quincux aspect 
of the Moon with the IV cusp, the cuspal and planetary positions in 
the horoscope of Kum. Prachi Sardeshmukh are most helpful for 
swimming, which she has started right from her childhood i.e. with 
WS Stan Oi eS Ratu wantauasa vulitusiivnimg wor ice 1u-1 OOn. 
Mahadasa lord Rahu is in Mars Star signifying X. Mars is conjunct 
Moon and in trine with Rahu, all conducive for swimming.

Planetary positions being the same, are incapable of bringing 
out the distinguishing factors between the twin brothers. 


Hence cuspal positions are of help, which are detailed below

It will be seen from the above thatthe cusps 1,11, V1,VIl, VIII 
and XII have the same sublord for both the native “X” and 
“Y”, So, in respect of these twin brothers, the distinguishing 
features in respect of these six house matters cannot be 
ascertained, on the basis of Sublord only. 


-ASTRO SECRETS & K.R -. 182 


Under the circumstances, there is no other alternative than to 
seek the subsublords, then we do this, a clear picture emerges and 
the fourfold significations delineate the havaphala. 


Birth R.P:-Sun, Moon, Guru, Venus and Kethu. 


Status of the horoscope :-Moon, Budha and Rahu are occupying 
Pushya, Bharani and Chitra constellations, whose lords are posited 
in “Trik" i.e., Papasthanas. If, however, we make a deeper probe by 
scrutinising them further, we find that the Saturn, Venus and Mars 
are posited in Aashlesha and Revati constellations, lord of which in 
turn posited in “Bhagyasthan’ relatively a good house. Accordingly, 
we’can take the status of the horoscope as “good” 


Let us now know about their distinguishing features. 


/ "X'stout and “Y” thin subsublords of the “Lagna’, will enable 
us to know about this. 
Astrological Analysis Astrological conclusion 


1) a) Lagna subsublord of "X" is Rahu 1) a) The effect of earthy and watery signs 
cojunct Pluto in earthy sign “Virgo” combined with Guru has been in the form of 
aspected by Guru in X house and by — stoutness 
Sani, Venus, Mars and Kethu tn watery 
signs 
b) Lagna Subsublord of “Yis Budha in —_b) Uranus and Sani aspects make ¥ thin 
Mesha aspected by retrograde Uranus 
in the airy sign libra and Sani i XII 


2) *X’ uses glasses but “Y"” doemot -Subsublords of II and X1# houses will throw light on this 
phenomenon. 


Astrological Analysis Astrological conclusion 


1} a) Il and XIl subsublords of "X" are a) Occupation of "Trik" by subsublord without 
Venus and Sani respectively any redeeming factor give eye defect to “x” 
b) Rahu is the Subsublord of the Il and XII b) Benefic aspect saves eyes 
houses of Y, duly aspected by well 
placed Guru conjuct “Lagnesh” Sun. 
3) “Y" climbed the African elephants 
trunk. while ‘X” declined to do so. 


Subsublords of the house of courage i.e. 
MI can explain this difference 
Astrological Analysis. Astrological conclusion 


1) a) HI House subsublord of °X” is Budhain 2) House of defeat makes "xX withdraw from 
the constellation of "Bharani". lord of the elephant. 
which is tn VIII ie. the house of defeat 


-R.B.T. - 183 


b) Ut House subsublord of Y «§ Sani in 
the Constellation “Ashiesha", whose 
lord Budha is aspected by Uranus from 
the house of courage. 


b} Uranus is famous springing surprises 
who enables “Y” to do trunk climbing

u) Satisfactory Completion of the course 


In short, each of these twin brothers stands by himself and 
are poles apart which is clearly brought out by the 
subsublord of the cuspal points and the planets themselves. 


Let us now turn to the next case study.

Astrological Analysis 


3. Guru's four lord significations 


Birth R.P.-sun, Moon, Venus, Sani, Rahu, Kethu (agent of Guru) 


Status of the Horoscope :- Only Budha and Pluto are in 
Punarvasu constellation, whose lord Guru is in VII. If, however, 
we probe deeper, Guru will be found in “Hast” constellation, the 
lord of which is in VI, lording VII House. Thus all planets will be 
found to signify either improving Houses or good houses. Natural 
and functional malefics Sun, Sani, Uranus signify “Labha’". Status 
of this horoscope therefore will be found "good". 


Health, Hobbies and married life :- The concerned houses 
are |,V and VII. The subsublord of these Houses is Guru. So, let 
us examine these houses. 


Astrological conclusion 


1 Guru though in Vif is conjunct Bhagya; 1. Guru will predominantly give the results 
cusp of Bhagya rather than of the House of 
difficulties-VIII. 
2. Guru makes trine aspects with | and V 2 There can be smooth sailing in these 


while making a near Quintife aspect with departments of fife 
the VII cusp 


Significations results 


1) Guru’s own significations-8.3,12,1.5 i) a} Generally good health. 
(Res-central strength ts for 1X and not a) Fame in the matters of hobbies. 
All} c) Married life happy 
ii) Guru's stariord Moon's significations it) a) Sickness sometimes 
67 b) Service in educational institution 
c) Fononess for herbs, plants etc 
d) Wide range pf plants i.¢.. plant library 


Iti) Guru's sub and sub sub Venus's iii) Regularity, 


significations 3,5,*0 


perseverence and 
achievements in a happy manner. 


Itis worth noting that she has “Vyaghat" Yoga (Sun+Moon) which 
is taken by some astrologers under traditional astrology as marring 
education and or married life. Nothing of the kind and hence KP. 
stands in a better position as for as astrological interpretations are 


concerned. 


-R.B.T. - 187 


To sum up, astro logically Prof. Sulochana Ogale: 1s destined 
to be a plant librarian, as she is Known to Pune city today. 


Let us now turn to a next case study.

-RBT. 189 


Moon Position : Moon is in VI and aspecting the XII, thereby 
showing the anxiety of the querente about her husband, as the 
question purports to da. Moon being in conformity with the question 
under consideration, we can take the horary chart for judgement. 


Status of the horary chart ;1) Venus though the ascendant 
lord of the husband is also the subsublord of his VIII and hence a 
potential threat to life looms. 2) Saturn though a Rajayog karak to 
husband is the subsublord of the Badhak and hence becomes 
worst. 3) The rapt conjunction between Venus and Saturn in the III 
house to the husband i.e. a secondary “Aayusthan” does not augur 
well for longevity. 


Rule :Our Guruji K.S.K. has given a rule in the K.P. Reader V| 
page 160 for dealing with such questions as follows : 


“Take that house which represents the reladonship.......... Ifthe 
sublord of the cusp is in the constellation of the planet who is the 
significator of badhak and Marak sthanas, boldly declare that he 
is dead. 


If the sublord of the cusp of the house representing the relative is 
in the constellation of the lord of that house or. the significators of 
the house representing that relation he is alive...." 


This rule mutatis mutandis, can apply to the subsublord also. 


So let us see the fourfold significations of the Subsublord of the 
ascendant of the husband i.e. VIl Cusp, who is Budha. 


- ASTRO SECRETS & KP. - 190 


Fourfold  significations of Budha Signification results. 


1) Budha's own significations-9, 3, 6 Hazards abroad. 
(le Husbands 3,9 and 12 houses.) 

+ Budhas stariaed Sun ¢ significations 10, 2) 11th house '¢ Badhak hence death, 
5 (ie Husband's 4 and 11 houses) while travelling in vehicle (IV) 

‘1 Budhas sublora Venus s significa- 3) Life and death struggie 
vons-9,7, 2 {ie Husband's 3.1.8 
houses) 

A) Budha's subsublord Guru's 4) Tragic end 17 the battle (ll) 


significations 2,9, 12 (i e Husbands 
8,3,6 Houses) 


Let us try to know the cause of death. At the above mentioned 
page 106 Guruji K. S. K. has indicated the following causes, 


This significator in 1) Watery sign..... drowning. 
2)Fiery Sign........ injuries. 
3)Earthy sign......... natural end. 
4) Airy sign......... No mention’is made. 


Inthe present case, Budha is in Uttarashada whose lord Sun is 
in Acquarius an airy sign. As Guruji K.S. K. has not mentioned airy 
sign while giving the above rule, now we have to find ourselves the 
cause thereof. 


Sun denotes fire and airy sign denotes its communication that is 
firing. So, | take that the husband must have succumbed to gun shots. 


This is the prediction in toto as it is wholly based on astrological 
analysis and conclusions without having any known facts. Since the 
incumbent has not returned even till today it lends support to the 
above prediction. 


-R.B.T. - 191 


Principle available from the case studies :- 
The sublord has limitations. 
The subsubiora orings out tne niaden causes. 


Facts being known, this is notthe prediction. Butthe subsublord is 
a good pointer to actualities. 


This embodies known facts as well as prediction. The subsublord 
explains better. 


This embodies known facts, which are better explained with 


the help of subsublord. 
This is purely a prediction based on the subsublord and is 
confirmed from the facts known so far. 


GOOD LUCK
