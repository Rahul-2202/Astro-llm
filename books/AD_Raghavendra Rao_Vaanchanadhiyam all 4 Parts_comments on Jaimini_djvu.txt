Foreword 


anchinathiyam is a very valuable 
commentary on intricacies of Sage 
Jaimini’s approach to astrology. It 


might interest the readers to know that 
“Krishna Mishra”, a contemporary of the 
great “Vardaha Mihira” (505-587) had said in 
his “Jyotish Phala  Ratnamala’, an 
authoritative text on Jaimini: 


NS ne QO 


NEUSE AA AGATA BSA HIM AMCTINTAM FIT: FATA 
TH Fe: MGA ASAT Be FNM Aer 
TATUEAT APM Hel: TAY FIRTH CI 

Meaning: The Goddess (Bala Tripura 
Sundari) has revealed to me that on account 
of curse of Sage Kanva, a south Indian 
Brahmin by the name VaGnchinatha shall 
elaborate on my text, 3832 years after year of 
Kali (or at the age of nineteen), through a 
text written by him for popularizing it in 
general public.” 


The original Sanskrit text called 
“Vanchinathiyam” was translated to 
Telugu and Published by Shri Kompalli 
Narasimha Sastri of Sastri Jyotishalayam 
Tuni, East Godavari District and printed at 
Lakshmi Printing Works Rajamundri in 1933. 


A copy of this valuable text was given by a 
great Jaimini astrology scholar and a living 
legend Shri Madura Krishnamurthy Sastriji, 
to Shri Ravindra Bhagwat who kindly made 
this available to Saptarishis Astrology 
management for the benefit of astrology 
fraternity. Shri V. Raghavendra Rao who is 
himself a scholar in Indian culture and 
Jyotish, has painstakingly translated this, 
very valuable, text first from Telugu Sanskrit 
lipi to English for the benefit of astrologers at 
large. 


It has not been an easy job since there is a 
difference in the way Telugu, which uses a 
derivative of Brahmi script, is written and 
where some of the letters are pronounced in a 
different manner than Sanskrit which uses 
Devanagari script. All efforts have been 
made to correct any anomaly in the original 
shlokas while retaining the text of the 
definition (Vyakhya) as understood from the 


original Telugu script, as far as possible. 


I trust the readers will appreciate the 
contributions of Raghavendra Rado Madhura 
Krishnamurty Sudhindra Kumar and, in 
bringing out this great astrological work.

Starting from Lagna count number of signs up to where the Lagnadhipati is placed, from that sign 
the same number signs to be counted forward, that sign is fixed as @77e Lagnarudha. 


Example: In a Chart Janma Lagna is Karkataka, Lagnadhipati Chandra is placed in Simha. 
Starting from Karkataka count up to where Lagnadhipati is placed; ie. Chandra is placed in the 
second Rasi from Karkataka; therefore count second Rasi from Simha and you get Kanya Rashi, 


which becomes Arudha Lagna.

Birth time in Ghatis is to be divided with five, treat this as number of rasis, add reminder to the 
quotient Rashi, note it down. Lord of the weekday of birth is to be taken as base, find out the 
weekday lord placed in Navamsa; from this sign count clockwise direction the number of signs 

worked out above. Fix the sign as Bhava Lagna. 
Example: Week day of birth = Saturday, Saturn is placed in Tula Navamsa, Birth time is 42.22 
Ghatis from sunrise, divide it by 5. This comes to 8 as quotient, while the remainder is 2-22. Add 8 
to the navamsa Rasi Tula to get Mithuna Rashi, as the Bhdva lagna. 


Chandrashekhar’s comment: This is a novel approach to calculation of Bhdva lagna. The usual 
method of deriving Bhdva lagna is to divide the time at birth (in ghatis) by five and add the 
product to the degres of Surya to get the Bhdva lagna.

Take the birth time Ghatis after sunrise, divide it with 2 1/2 take the quotient as Rasis add the 
remainder to it - Treat this as ‘base’. Rule: If the Lagna happens to be Odd sign we have to count 
‘base’ number of signs forward starting from Sun’s position. If Lagna happens to be even sign we 


have to count ‘base’ number of signs forward starting from Lagna. 


Chandrashekhar’s comment: I do not think remainder is to be added as one rashi. 


Example: Birth time in terms of Ghati = 42-22, Divide 42-22 with 2 1/2 = 16 quotient remainder is 
1 hence 16+1 = 17 = “base” Here birth lagna is Karkataka, is an even sign so start counting 17 from 
Janma lagna, falls in Vrischika Rasi fix it as Hora Lagna. 


(Note: Since rasis are 12, the number arrived at ‘base’, if it is more than 12, is to be divided with 12 and the 


remainder is to be taken into account for counting forward, in this case “base” is 17 hence 17/12, 5 is reminder so 


count five Rasis forward from Karkataka = Vrichika) 
Chandrashekhar’s comments: Here again a new concept of counting from Lagna in case of an even 
rdshi being lagna is introduced, whereas for an odd rdashi lagna the shloka follows the traditional 


system of calculation of hora lagna.

Starting from Lagna each one Ghati of time is to be treated as a lagna. 
Example: Birth time = 42-22 divide it with 12 comes to 6-22. Since the Birth lagna is Karkataka, 


aN 


starting from Karkataka 7" sign happens to be Ghatika lagna. 
(Explanation - Here Ghati lagna falls 22 vighatis after six signs hence Makara is taken)

Nitya lagna falls in 4" Rasi from Bhagya Rasi in clock wise direction if Bhagya Rasi happens to be 
in odd sign. If Bhagya Rasi falls under even sign it is to be computed vice versa that is 4 Rasi on 
anti clock wise direction from Bhagya Rasi — Nityalagna changes at each 5 Ghatis from the time 

of birth. (This entire para is not in moola as vyakhya to the above Sanskrit vyakhaya) 

“From Lagna or sign is Bhagya Rasi. If that Bhagya Rasi is Odd sign clock wise 

direction if Bhagya Rasi is even sign anti clock wise to be counted based on Chatush 

Kendra Krama (which means based on the trines). Which means from g four Kendras 

clockwise first, if even four Kendras anticlock wise. Five Ghati time period is Nitya 

Lagna. If ninth sign is an Odd sign - starting from sun rise if birth takes before five 

Ghatis Bhagya Rasi itself is Nitya Lagna. If birth takes place in second fifth Ghati 

Starting from Bhagya based on Chatush Kendra Krama Dwadasa is Nitya Lagna (from 

9” a rasi is =12). If birth takes place in 37 fifth Ghati - Starting from Bhagya 34 

Kendra is Saptama is Nitya lagna). If birth takes place in fourth se Ghati - From 

Bhagya fourth Kendra falls in 6 sign from Lagna is Nitya Lagna. 

If Bhagya Rasi from Lagna falls in even sign, then - From sun rise of birth takes 

place in first 5 Ghatis Ninth sign itself is Nitya Lagna. If birth takes place in second 5 

Ghati from Bhagya anti-clock direction 2°" Kendra 6" sign from Lagna is Nitya Lagna. 

If birth takes place in third 5" Ghati from Bhagya 3“ Kendra 3 sign from Lagna is Nitya 

Lagna. If birth takes place in fourth 5 Ghati anti clock wise 10" Kendra 2" Rasi from 

Lagna is Nitya Lagna. Like this if Janana Kala Ghati is more than 20 the same is to be 

repeated, 

Example: Take the earlier example - Birth time is 42-22 Ghatis from Sun rise. If divided 

with 5 = 42.22/8 = 841 = 9" sign. Lagna is Karkataka, since Karkataka is an even sign its 

9" sign is Meena. Translators explanation - (42.22 /5 = 8- 2.22 Ghatis, here 2.22 Vighati is 

more than 8 Rasis that means after 8 signs it has also went 2.22 in gn sign as such one rasi 

is added). 

Chandrashekhar’s comment: The shloka and also the definition given suggests that the count is 

kendras from Bhagya rashi, in direct or reverse fashion depending on the bhagya rdshi being odd 

or even. There does not appear to be any mention of Nitya lagna falling in 6" bhava from bhagya 
rdshi, in case of even bhagya rdashi.

Uses of Six Lagnas are explained 


(1)Janma Lagna is useful to predict everything. 

(2)Arudha Lagna is useful in predicting whether the native is having wealth (Bhagya) or not. If 
benefic planet is placed in Arudha Lagna wealth is indicated, if malefic planet is placed poverty 
is indicated. 

(3) Ghatika lagna is useful in ascertaining Raja Yoga. 

(4) Bhava Lagna is useful in knowing parents matters 


(5) Hora Lagna is useful in knowing the longevity of parents and Raja Y ogas. 
(6) Nitya Lagna is useful in Prasna (Horary Astrology) and day to day activities 


Chandrashekhar’s comment: I think the shloka talks of Arudha lagna being used to assess whether 
the jataka has much fortune or not.

Now begin the views about aspects. 


Wherever in the Chart a planet placed in Fixed sign aspect the movable signs and the planets 
placed in it except (leaving) the adjacent movable sign. The Planets placed in movable signs aspect 
the fixed signs and the planets placed in it except the adjacent fixed sign. The Planets placed in 
Dual signs aspect the planets placed in other dual signs leaving the self (own) dual sign. 


Example: Moon is placed in Simha Rasi (fixed sign), leaving the immediate movable sign of 
Karkataka, aspects Tula, Makara, Mesha and the Saturn placed in Tula. Ravi, Budha, Kuja 
placed in Vrischika Rasi (fixed sign) aspecting Mesha, Karkataka, Makara movable signs, leaving 
the immediate movable sign Tula. Saturn placed in Tula is aspecting, leaving the Vrichika Rasi 
and the planets placed in it, the Simha, Vrushabha, Kumbha Rasis and the Moon placed in Simha 
Rasi. Guru is placed in the Dual sign Dhanur Rasi, is aspecting the dual signs of Kanya, 
Mithuna, Meena. Sukra is placed in Kanya is aspecting Guru placed in Dhanur and Meena 
Mithuna Rasis.

Now the strength of grahas ( being described) 

The Planets placed in Movable signs are powerful than the planets placed in fixed signs. The 
planets placed in Duel signs are more powerful than the planets placed in fixed signs. As such the 
planes placed in duel signs are more powerful than the other planets placed other than movable 
signs. As already discussed in the previous example (under planetary aspects chapter) the planets 
Guru and Shukra placed in Dual signs are powerful than the planets, Chandra, Ravi, Budha, Kuja 


placed in fixed signs, and Saturn placed in Movable sign.

During the odd number of week days i.e., Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and during the day 
time and in Odd horas birth of “Male” Child is indicated. “Female” Child is indicated during even horas. 
During night times “Female” Child is indicated in Odd horas, and “Male” child is indicated in even horas. 
Similarly vice-versa to the above during the even number of week days i.e., Monday, Wednesday and

indicated. During night times in Odd Horas “Male” Child is indicated in even horas “Female” Child is

Female 


accuracy achieved in the year 2000 the readers can also check their birth time and their 


sex - This is a powerful tool for Rectification of birth time) 


Balarista 
The male children who born during first half Ghati (12 mts) of Hora have Balarista. For 
Female last half Ghati of Hora is Balarista. 


Chandrashekhar’s Comment: The original shloka also says that the won rdshis of the nodes are to be accepted 
per ancient science and goes on to say that the exaltation rdshi of Ketu is Simha and that of Rahu is 
Vrishchika. This is different from the position of Parashara who tells Vrishabha being exaltation or Rahu and 
Vrishchika of Ketu. 


The definition or explanation, also talks of there being danger to life of the Jataka if it be a male born if in day 
birth the hora is even while in night if the male birth is in odd hora, if the birth is in the first half ghati of that 
hora, there is danger to the life when a child. Similarly if a female is born in sama hora birth, birth in the last 


half ghatis of the sama hora indicate possibility of death of the jataka. 


Chandrashekhar’s Special Comments: The definition text is transliterated from Telugu and I have left it 
untouched, having only corrected the Sanskrit shlokas and have added my comment where I felt they might add 
substance to the already scholarly translation done by Shri Raghvendra Rao.

Raja Yogas 
As already discussed in previous chapters, Janma Lagna, Hora Lagna, Ghatika Lagna, are 
aspected by the planets placed in exalted signs leads to Raja Yoga, or when any two lagnas out of 
the of Janma Lagna, Hora Lagna, Ghatika Lagna are aspected by the exalted planet, Raja Yoga is 
indicated. 
To interpret the previous example: In this chart (apparently the manuscript has given some 
standard chart) though Exalted Shani is aspecting Vrushabha, Simha, Kumbha rasis, any of the 
above three rasis did not fall under Janma Lagna, Hora Lagna and Ghatika Lagna. As such no

While implementing the already said planetary aspects; if a planet is aspecting its exaltation 
sign, to this planet an exalted planet is placed in 2" it is a Raja Yoga. 
In the previous example — Sukra is placed in dual sign; Kanya is aspecting the dual sign of Meena 
Rasi, to the Sukra Saturn is placed in 2™ in exaltation sign Tula is a Raja Yoga in the chart of the 
native. 
Chandrashekhar’s comment: The translation of the definition is correct. However I 


think the shloka says that if a graha in exaltation occupies the 2nd bhava from the graha 
that is aspected by (another?) graha in exaltation, a Rajyoga is caused.

If Chandra and Sukra are having Mutual aspects and placed in third to each other is a Raja 
Yoga. If Chandra is placed in 3" sign from Sukra, Dhana, Vahana Yoga are indicated. It is

Longevity 
Here the nature of Karaka is being told in one shloka 
In Jataka Sastra wear ‘Rasyanta Graha’ means the planet which has moved forward in 


terms of degrees is a Karaka. Wate ‘Bhavanta Graha’ means the planet which placed before a 
few degrees to Bhavasandhi also a karaka. sqzasena Adrusya Shatkam (invisible six) means the 
starting from Lagna Bhava to the end of sixth Bhava. qeayeny ‘Drusya Shatkam’ (visible six) 
means starting from Saptama Bhava to end of Vyaya Bhava. The planets placed in the ends of 
Drusya and Adrusya Bhavas are also Karakas. ast ‘Chakrardham’ means (half Chakra) from 
starting point of Mesha to end of Kanya. asife ‘Chakradi’ means starting from Tula to end of 
Meena Rasi. The planet placed in the ends of Chakrardha and Chakranta is Atmakaraka. The 
planet placed in the end of Suryanta, Chandranta is a Karaka (Here Suryanta and Chandranta is 
not defined). 

Chandrashekhar’s comment: Suryanta (@l=) obviously means end of Surya thus after the degrees of 


Surya or meaning when the graha comes out of combustion. Chandranta (a-aid) means a graha 


conjoining Chandra asa graha is said to become strong when in Samagama with Chandra and would 


indicate a graha that is within one degree of Chandra, perhaps one degree ahead of Chandra, is also a 


karaka The learned may draw their own conclusion. 


All these are discussed in the example Horoscope of Ramachandra Bhattaraka. In the given 
example horoscope Rasyantha Graha is Sani, since Sani is urmfire Bhagadhika. Sukra is placed a 
few degrees before the Sandhi of 3" and 4° Bhavas, is Bhavanta Graha. From beginning of Lagna 
and end of sixth Bhava is Adrusya Shataka, Kuja is placed in the Adrusyantha is a Karaka. From 
Saptama Bhava to the end of Vyaya Bhava is Drusya Shatka, Sani is placed in the end of 7 
Bhava is a Karaka, because Sani is in Astama Bhava and there are no planets in 9,10,11,12 Bhavas, 
as such Sani became karaka here. Chandra is placed at less degrees, than the Sandhi, as such he is 
not a Karaka. Kuja is in the end of aspet Chakrardha hence he is a Karaka. Chandra is placed in 
the ast Chakranta, is Karaka. Suryantagata is Budha, (explanation — one may get a doubt why 
Sukra is not taken into consideration? In Mithunarasi Ravi Bhukta degrees 28, Budha degrees 26, 
Sukra 24, Budha is placed at 26" degree whereas Sukra is placed in re degree only as such Sukra 
is not taken as Karaka). Here Sani is Chandranta Gatah because there are no planets between 
Sani and Chandra. Sani is placed at the end of the Rasi. In the end let us see the abstract of 
karakas - Bhavanta Gata is Sukra, Adrusyagata Kuja, Drusyagata Sani, Chakrardha gata Kuja, 
Chakranta gata Chandra, Suryanta gata Budha, Chandrantagata Sani. Among these planets Sani 
got 3 times karakatwa by three different parameters. As such Sani is Atmakaraka. Always the 
Bhagadika Planet is Karaka Graha as said by the Scholars and Astrologers.

Chandrashekhar’s comment: The graha that has gained most degrees in the rdshi, occupied by it, 


amongst all grahas is called the karaka. Amongst the grahas the one who has gained the least degrees in 


a rdshi is called antyakdaraka.

Now begin the karaka, upa-grahas and antya grahas 

Now Karaka, Upagraha, Antyagraha are narrated - Among the planets, the planet which has 
moved more number of degrees is known as Karaka. Among the planets the planet which is placed 
in lesser degrees is known as Antyagraha. According to Dikshita antyagraha means Maraka. 
Bhagadhika is Karaka, the planet which is placed in middle degrees is known as Upagraha. The 
planet placed in lesser degree is Antyagraha. The above three lords are called as Jatakadheesas

Important: (Short Introduction) - First of all the Astrologer has to decide the longevity of the 
native, before moving to forecasting the events of the chart. Without deciding the longevity there 
is no use in forecasting the predictions. Longevity is categorized in three types 1. Dheergayu (long 
span of longevity) 2. Madhyamayu (medium span of longevity) 3. Alpayu (Short span of 
longevity).

If Lagna falls in a movable sign and Hora lagna also falls in a movable sign the native is long lived 
(Dheergayu); If Lagna falls in a movable sign and Hora lagna falls in a fixed sign medium 
longevity (Madhyamayu). If Lagna falls in a movable sign and Hora lagna falls in a dual sign the 
native is short lived. Similarly if lagna falls in a fixed sign Hora lagna falls in a dual sign, 
movable, fixed signs the result will be long lived, medium lived and short lived. If Lagna falls in a 
duel sign and Hora Lagna falls in a fixed, dual and movable signs long, medium, and short lived 
respectively as stated in Raid Siddhanta. 

After ascertaining the longevity in the Chart, if the native is long lived the astrologer has to 
compute == Kendra, WX Phanaphara, AeA Apokleema Dasas. If medium lived Kendra, 
Phanaphara dasas are to be computed. If short lived only Kendra dasa is to be computed. Similarly 
the same procedure to be followed to both of the parents also. All the above is explained with 


detailed examples.

Example: The horoscope given in the example relates to a woman born in Dhurmati nama 
Samvatsara, Bhadrapada masa, Suddha vidiya, Thursday, Birth time from sun rise is 30 Ghatis. 
Bhagadhika Sani is Karaka, placed in Vrushabha,. 3-RIsth Antya Sangyaka (who is in less 
degrees) Guru. Janma Lagna - Kumbha. Hora Lagna — Simha. Let us examine the rule “If Lagna 
falls in fixed sign, Hora Lagna falls in Dual, Movable, Fixed signs- long, medium, short lived 


respectively”. As such the native is short lived.

In another example - Bhagadhika Guru - Karaka. Janmalagnam - Mesham, Horalagnam - 
Karkatakam. in this example both the Lagnas fell in movable signs hence the native is long lived 


(Dheergayu). Like this short, medium, long lived yogas are explained. Later Karaka Dasa

Aishvarya Yoga - Prosperity and Richness Yoga 

Prosperity and Richness Yoga is of two types 1. YAAEAMT (Subha Graha Yoga) Yoga caused by 
benefic planets. WIHEaM (Papagraha Yoga) Yoga caused by malefic planets. Subhagraha Yogas 
(benefic planet yogas) are narrated first.Thus ends the original shloka. As per general principle the 
planets aspecting Lagna gives favourable results. As already explained that the planets placed in 
movable signs aspects the planets placed in the fixed signs. The planets placed in fixed signs 
aspects the planets placed in movable signs, the planets placed in dual signs aspects the planets 
placed in other dual signs. As already said that while aspecting Lagna the planets placed in fixed 
signs are stronger than the planets placed in movable signs (and those in Dwisvabhaava signs are 
stronger than those in fixed signs, etc.), power planets are combined with other planets, exalted 
planet Budha, Chandra, Sukra, Guru are placed in 2" rise ir", the native will be a wealthy, 


prosperous and Rich. 


Chandrashekhar’s comment: I think the word “balavat” in “WAaQUErARGwY” is connected with the 
strength of grahas aspecting from Chara Sthira and Dwisvabhava rashis. What is being next said that in 
similar fashion the benefics in the order of Budha, Chandra, Guru and Shukra are to be treated as 
progressively stronger when they occupy the respective bhavas, in exaltation and shall cause the jataka 


to be wealthier, in that order.

Benefic planets should be placed always in Dhanasthana (ie., in 24 house). If an exalted planet is 
placed in Dhanasthana is less fortunate. If Budha is placed it is better than that (exalted Planet), 
If Guru is placed better than that(Budha), If Sukra is placed better than that (Guru). This 
principle is applicable to Dhanasthana only. In Labhasthana Guru and Chandra extends extremely 
favourable results than Sukra. If Guru is placed in Fourth gives much more results when 
compared to all other planets. As explained above the benefic planets which are giving extremely 
favourable results than lagna are placed either in Dhanasthana or in Labhasthana gives best 
results. Guruyoga and Sukrayoga to Chandra leads to nullify several evil effects in the Chart. 
For Vrischika Lagna natives, if Guru is placed in Dhanur Rasi, that is in 2nd house though not 
aspecting Lagna gives wage prosperity and richness. Similarly for Kumbha Lagna natives Meena 
Sukra gives Rajayoga. Guru also gives favourable results in Meena. For Mesha Lagna natives 
Sukra is not that much favourable. For Kumbha Lagna natives Guru is not extremely favourable 
planet. The fourth Kendra is equally stronger when compared to Lagna, as per this rule if fourth 
house falls in Movable sign its of no use, if it falls in fixed sign better results, if falls in Dual sign 


extremely favourable results are told in Sastra.

Predictions are to be made from Vilagna, Ghatikalagna, Horalagna similarly, means Vilagna or 
Ghatikalagna or Horalagna (or) any two among the three, is aspected by an Exalted planet 
indicates Raja Yoga. Here Grahantara Yoga is also to be taken into consideration. Ravi Budha 
Yogas are not useful. If an exalted planet is aspecting Lagna it is useful to Budha in Ravi Yoga. 
If that Budha is having debilitation Yoga there is no use of the aspect of an exalted planet. If 
Budha is placed in 6" se there is no use when it is aspected by an Exalted planet. This is 
explained as —- For Tula Lagna Chandra Rahu are placed in Vrushabha, it is debilitation for Rahu 
and Exaltation to Chandra, in this case there is no use of Exalted aspect. For Mesha Lagna if 
Chandra Rahus are placed in Vrichiha, uae #0 relationship with a debilitated planet it is not useful. 
If debilitated aspect is formed in 2™, 3", 1" - useful as opined by Appayya Dikshita. According 
to Dikshitaif an exalted planet is placed in 3 having neecha yoga, it is useful and yield favourable 
results, as explained for Tula lagna Chandra Rahu placed in Vrushabha. If neecha Sukra yoga 
formed to Budha, no doubt exalted aspect results are favourable. With regard to Simha, Kumbha 
lagans Guru, Kuja placed in Makara, benefic results are indicated. Since Ravi is enemy to Sani 
which lead to extreme troubles. After critical examination in detail the result is : If a planet is 
combined with another planet, the second one is to be judged whether it is friendly? Enemy? 
Benefit? Malefic? Is to be taken into account. According to the difference in the planets, the 
difference in predictions are also inaveated: I se yogas formed through the planes having no 
complete independence, if aspect of 4" 45 o", a" Lords is formed it is useful in giving benefic/ 
malefic yogas are to be judged.

ps 


Now are being told the Papa yogas 
(So reads the original shloka) 
In the Chart among the 12 signs if malefics are placed in 3" : 6" lead to benefic results, that too if 
the malefic planets aspect Lagna gives extreme benefic results. If malefic planets are placed in 6" 
lead to several benefic results. If a malefic is placed in ut having other Raja Yogas lead to benefic 
results. However it will not give benefic results independently. If a malefic planet is having a 
malefic relation lead to extreme benefic result. If a benefic yoga formed Yoga bhanga is indicated. 
Similarly the malefics are placed in 6" Pi the debilitated placed in 6 a8 th not aspecting Lagna is 
somewhat useful. If a benefic is placed in 6" ae aspecting Lagna lead to benef results.

Raja Yoga Bhanga — Nullification of Raja Yoga 

Malefic planets placed in Trikonas (trines), not having benefic aspect to lagna is Kemadruma 
Yoga. Likewise when one malefic planet is placed (in trines), a Kemadruma Yoga of smaller 
proportion is caused. Similarly, when Shani - Chandra are placed in Kendras or when Shani is 
placed in trines, the yoga (Kemadruma) is broken. If malefic planets are placed in Kendras, that 
too malefic planets or Shani placed in Lagna is extremely nullified Yoga. If Chandra or Shani is 
placed in exalted sign, there is no (Kemadruma) Yoga. Debilitated planet’s aspect is also equal to 


Malefic planets aspect, and nullifies this Yoga. However a debilitated planet is placed in 6, 8 this 


yoga is not applicable. Similarly, if a malefic is placed in 2™ Daridra Yoga (Poverty yoga). 
Benefic planets placed in Kendras leads to Subha Yoga, similarly Chandra is placed in Kendra is 
also a good Yoga. A chart is to be written starting from Lagnadhipati as said by Yavanachara, 
after writing Graha Chakra Yogas are to be judged.

Now, the Bhagya yoga. 
To the Lagnadhipati pene fi in 2 ; madlejac in 3" , benefic in is , benefic in 5, malefic in 6", 
benefic in 7" , malefic in git , benefic in 9 are placed no doubt lead to Raja Yoga. According is 
Manipravala Rule it is very clear - to the Lagnadhipati benefic in 2™, Malefic in 3, benefic in 4", 
Malefic in 5, benefic in 6'', malefic in 7" benefic in git malefic in 9” lead to Raja Yoga. Benefic 
in 2", said to be benefic in 2™ and benefic in 5"" and 9" is having rivalry the Second is Maharaja 


Yoga and the first is Sreemantha. There is no Dosha (defect/blemish) since it is a Rule. As 
explained in the verse s=taehutstat Uttarottara Papatwa (more malefic when placed in more 
number of degrees) if this Graha Chakra Yoga is formed in Dhana Yoga and other benefic yogas 
as narrated earlier lead to extremely benefic results. Generally in the Horoscopes (charts) of 
Kings in 6", 3 3" malefic relations were seen/observed. If Chandra Rahu aspects to 2" lead to 
Nirdhana Yoga (Poverty Yoga). If 8" Lord aspects 2" sign lead to always troubles to the native. 
If this yoga formed in 6" and 8" with benefic planets and the benefic planet placed in debilitation 
in Dhana Sthana is also a benefic.

A Mission Saptarishis Initiative 


Foreword 
‘ y anchinathiyam is a very valuable commentary on intricacies of Sage Jaimini’s approach 

to astrology. It might interest the readers to know that “Krishna Mishra’, a 
contemporary of the great “Varaha Mihira” (505-587) had said in his “Jyotish Phala 

Ratnamala”’, an authoritative text on Jaimini: 

NERSSY AA GAA PAGAL IRTH BV: Fale AA BL: AGA Mesa Mea NAMA Maa Maas TFA 

Tel: TAY TARTAN 

Meaning: The Goddess (Bala Tripura Sundari) has revealed to me that on account of curse of 

Sage Kanva, a south Indian Brahmin by the name Vanchindatha shall elaborate on my text, 3832 

years after year of Kali (or at the age of nineteen), through a text written by him for popularizing 

it in general public.” 


The original Sanskrit text called “Vanchinathiyam” was translated to Telugu and Published by 
Shri Kompalli Narasimha Sastri of Sastri Jyotishalayam Tuni, East Godavari District and 
printed at Lakshmi Printing Works Rajamundri in 1933. 


A copy of this valuable text was given by a great Jaimini astrology scholar and a living legend Shri 
Madura Krishnamurthy Sastriji, to Shri Ravindra Bhagwat who kindly made this available to 
Saptarishis Astrology management for the benefit of astrology fraternity. Shri V. Raghavendra 
Rao who is himself a scholar in Indian culture and Jyotish, has painstakingly translated this, very 
valuable, text first from Telugu Sanskrit lipi to English for the benefit of astrologers at large. 


It has not been an easy job since there is a difference in the way Telugu, which uses a derivative of 
Brahmi script, is written and where some of the letters are pronounced in a different manner than 
Sanskrit which uses Devanagari script. All efforts have been made to correct any anomaly in the 
original shlokas while retaining the text of the definition (Vyakhy&) as understood from the 
original Telugu script, as far as possible. 


I trust the readers will appreciate the contributions of Raghavendra Rao Madhura Krishnamurty 
Sudhindra Kumar and, in bringing out this great astrological work.

In this verse it is explained that the planet(s) placed in fixed signs are having more 
strength than the planet(s) placed in movable signs. If Benefic planets are stronger than 
Lagna, malefic planets have no strength when compared to Lagna, uaahT Sampanna 
Yoga forms when the benefic planets aspecting or not aspecting the Lagna. As explained 


in the verse ta-nlay ofa GE: “Chandrah Kavih Kavim Chandrah” are applicable only to 
those who are wealthy. If a planet having strength is placed in between Sukra and 
Chandra this yoga is not giving good results. Of the above said two Yogas whichever is 
stronger will give results. How to decide whether it is strong enough - is adding strength 
in two or more ways for example the yogakaraka planet is placed in exaltation also adds 
strength to it, in due course of time, the results of both Yogas will be given. In the 
grahachakra (horoscope) when the arti yogadhika is formed, always a benefic in 
second, a malefic in third and a benefic in the fourth should be placed. If a benefic 
planet is placed in third where there is no Yoga. In the Yogas explained earlier though 
the malefic planet and debilitated planet gives equal results, the exalted planet and 
benefic planet gives equal results.

The aspect of an exalted planet to Lagna is Raja Yoga. Here as per aera: Ger: 
‘Charasi Sthitah Khetah’(planet placed in movable sign) aspect is taken. Aspect of a 
debilitated planet to Lagna is also Raja Yoga. Traditionally it is believed that this i is giving 
results due to aspect only. Some believe that if a debilitated planet is placed in 3 or inn” is 
Raja Yoga. Aspect of benefic planets gives extraordinary good results, that too if aspected 
"and 9 is extremely favourable as per tradition. Benefic placed in 6" ; 8" aspecting 
Lagna is a Raja Yoga. Though this yoga forms like this due to placement of malefic and 
benefic planetary positions in Kendras Poorest are also getting married and leading their 
routine life. If two malefic planets combined and placed in Lagna and Trikona aspecting 
Lagna leads to extreme poverty yoga fasiveitsuart ‘Visesha Daridrya Yoga’. Similarly 
Dhana Sthana is also seen. Papa yoga formed in Trikona or Kendra leads to aISahT 


Dridrya Yoga. The malefic planets placed in 6 8° 3 and 11" aspecting Lagna or Malefic 


- 3" are co- operating for Waasart Aishvarya Yoga. Some 
opines Bee malefic planets Seer 6 3" 3° aspecting lagna is not a good yoga. ne 
th 


planets simply aspecting 6" 8 


aspect of 6" 8" lord placed in cee sign, or the aspect of a planet placed in 6" ,8 
in barrens to lagna is weagart Aishvarya Yoga. If a papa Yoga formed Pager) is 
indicated, If a malefic is placed in 12" and the malefic planet aspects Lagna Yoga 
nullifies. Debilitated Chandra is placed in Lagna or Chandra associated with debilitated 
planet is frequent Daridrya Yoga. Some others opined that this type of results are to be 
told to the planetary positions formed in Lagna and Kendras also.

Take Chandra nakshatra (placement of moon in the star) in full. Divide it with 12. 
find out the Dwadasamsa where Chandra is placed, if it is odd sign count anticlockwise, 
if it is even sign count clockwise direction fix it as Chandranakshatra Rasi. Similarly 
compute to all the remaining nine planets also. The author of the book Vanchanadha 
opines that the numbers to be counted anticlockwise for other planets clockwise. After 
completing the calculations, the Nakshatradhipati for Lagna is the first nakshatradhipati, 
similarly nakshatradipatis follows. If Nakshatradhipati is placed in exaltation or 
debilitation AishvaryaYoga, or in that sign an exalted planet, benefic planet is placed or 
Chandra is placed extraordinary Aishvarya Yoga. Some others opines that in that sign 
friendly planet, Rasyadhipati is placed Raja Yoga. Similarly based on the 
nakshatradhipatis Nakshatradasa Phala is also predicted. The traditional astrologers 
opined that when the Karaka Graha, Upagraha (that is Madhya Graha, Antya Graha) 
gaining strength the nakshatradasa starts giving results. In the following verse deals 
with the longevity of the natives.

Regarding forecasting longevity the verse chare chare is to be taken in to account. 
As narrated earlier the nature/elements of Karaka (®ROASY karaka swaroopa) is to be 
taken into consideration as narrated earlier. First these are to be analyzed critically. If 
maraka (death) is forecasted based on the Signs, either 6" Lord or 8 Lord leads to 
maraka either to the 6" lord or the planet placed in the trines to 6" house leads to maraka, 
this is known as sign of maraka. Maraka is forecasted either during the 6" Lords dasa or 
during 8" lords dasa, this is applicable to those whose longevity is medium. For those 
whose longevity is long or short maraka is to be judged based on the trines of 6 and 8" 
signs, similarly maraka is to be predicted in its signs that maraka planets trines dasas. 
Balanadha opined that this is not narrated in the Lagna Dasa.

Maraka is judged based on the verse ‘Chare Chara’ sloka, based on the longevity 
arrived according to signs, after completing the total dasa period arrived maraka is 
indicated. Similarly for medium longevity natives maraka is after completing the period 
of madhyayu. Here Maraka is to be judged based on the strong sign among Lagna and 
Saptama, that is in Lagna, 2nd, 3rd rounds then the native Alpa, Madhya, Purnayu. 
Maraka is to be judged. Maraka planets placed in Lagna and Kendras; Sukra, Kuna, 
Rahu, Chandra is lords to 6th, 8th lords to all signs, causes maraka as already narrated 
earlier. Similarly judging maraka is to Mother, Father, Wife, Son also.

Maraka to Parents being narrated - Suryamsa, Sanyamsa gives maraka to Father. 
Chandramsa, Sukramsa gives maraka to Mother. Some times their Arudhas also gives 
maraka. To examine this if placed in exalted sign, placed in own sign only, otherwise 
during therir dasas only maraka is indicated, this is applicable to Surya and Sani only. In 
the natural chart while judging longevity to Father and Mother, among Ravi and Sani the 
planet which is placed in lesser degrees is lead to maraka. If both were placed in lesser 
degrees, among those the planet placed in more degrees lead to maraka. If Ravi or Sani is 
having 9th lordship (ie., Pitrusthanadhipatya) the planet placed in more degrees lead to 
maraka. Similar calculation is to be made in respect of Mother also. Based on 
Dwisamvada (same value twice) of Trikona Rasis to Vedhaka lead to Maraka. As was 
already narrated that the Amsa Rasi of Astamadhipati is not the main maraka giving 
sign, to start with eighth signs are to be considered.

Upakrama Rasis are of Several types, they are based on the birth lagna, according 
to Udaya Chakra, the gth is Pitru Bhava, Some said based on the Natural Chart gth is to 
be decided, in another if Lagna falls in odd sign that sign itself is Lagna, if it falls in even 
sign Lagnasaptama is to be taken as Lagna. Like this some opined that based on the 
Upakrama Rasis navama ie., gth is to be fixed, in this context much difficult being 
experienced by people in deciding ninth, to clearly explain the differences to all the 


people I have decided (here I means the author of the book Vanchanadha) and making a 
rule to take if Lagna falls in Odd sign the same sign is taken as Lagna, if lagna falls in 
even sign 7th sign to that Lagna is to be fixed as Lagna. Basing on the natural chart ninth 
and Upakrama signs are to be fixed. If 7th is fixed as Lagna according to Vikruti Chakra 
gth signs are to be fixed in antilock direction. If power planets are placed based on the 
Vikruthi chakra 9th signs are strong.

According to Dikshitha’s thought though Lagna falls in Odd sign, if strong planets 
were placed in 7th, then 7th is taken Lagna. In his opinion pitru maraka planets (father's 
death) are Ravi and Sani and Kendra signs, Pitru maraka is indicated during Simha, 
Makara, Kumbha Rasis Dasa periods. Similarly Matru (Moth's) maraka is indicated 
during the dasa periods of Karkataka, Vrishabha, Tula Rasi. If malefic yoga formed in 
those signs there is no doubt in giving maraka, If benefic yogas formed delay in giving 
maraka is to be forecasted carefully. According to Dikshita’s opinion if strong planets are 
placed in those signs, maraka is indicated during the Trikona rasis dasas. According to 
others Surya, Sani Amsas are marakas, some times the 7th and Trikona Rasis of Surya 
Sanyamsas also lead to maraka.

If strong planets or several planets are placed either in 7th or in Trikona signs to

planets are placed, its 7th is to be taken.

If Lagna falls in odd sign that sign itself is Lagna; if falls in even sign 7th sign from 
that sign is Lagna. Based on the Natural chart gth signs are to be fixed. Respective Pitru 
Bhavas and remaining Bhavas are to be fixed and named accordingly. Some Scholars 
opined that the Trikonas to the seventh sign from Lagna, some scholars opined that after 
fixing the respective Bhavas, and started to setting in to motion of the Rasi Dasas. 
During the Trikona Rasi Dasa of the planet placed in the lesser degree, during the Lagna 
dasa and during the 8th Sign Dasa of the respective Bhavas maraka to Father and Mother 
are to be judged.

As per Parasara system Pitru Matru maraka judgment is narrated Sani and Surya 
gives Maraka to Father, Sukra, Chandra gives maraka to Mother, both are equal in 
giving maraka during their dasa periods, danger to Father is indicated during the Trikona 
dasa of Surya and Sanis Amsa. Similarly during the Amsa Rasis of Chandra, Sanis 
trikona dasa matru maraka is indicated. Among Ravi and Sani the strong planet gives 
maraka. Among the Ravi and Sani Amsas the strong planets amsas trikona Rasi is to be 
taken first. Judging the strength of that seventh sign to Surya, Sanyamsas is explained 
that either Surya or Sani is placed in exalted sign, if strong planet is placed in the said 
amsas, or aspected by a strong planet, instead of Ravi or Sani's Dasa, basing on the 
strength of the sign such as exalted / own sign among the two the strong Rasi's Trikona 
Rasi is stronger in giving maraka. If having equal strength arrieved two, three times of 
maraka in the same sign maraka is to be judged carefully as said in sastra. The sign 
which is Trikona to Ravi's Sign; the sign which is 7th to Ravi’s sign; Trikona rasi to the 
starting sign; due to difference in falling in lesser degrees to which sign two or three to 
which sign is arrived two or three times in the same sign of maraka, Maraka is indicated 
in that Trikona Rasi. Similarly maraka to mother is also judged.

A Mission Saptarishis Initiative 


Foreword 
' 7 anchinathiyam is a very valuable commentary on intricacies of Sage Jaimini’s 
approach to astrology. It might interest the readers to know that “Krishna 
Mishra”, a contemporary of the great “Varaha Mihira’” (505-587) had said in 
his “Jyotish Phala Ratnamala”, an authoritative text on Jaimini: 


N_ ne. as 


NEUSE IA ATA EHAHIAMAMAINT A FIOT: FAA AWA HLT: AGT ANSTAM Bel NAMA MATH AAAEAT TPA Wee: 
HAY TARTANA 

Meaning: The Goddess (Bala Tripura Sundari) has revealed to me that on account of curse of Sage 
Kanva, a south Indian Brahmin by the name Vanchindatha shall elaborate on my text, 3832 years after 
year of Kali (or at the age of nineteen), through a text written by him for popularizing it in general 
public.” 


The original Sanskrit text called “Vanchinathiyam” was translated to Telugu and Published by Shri 
Kompalli Narasimha Sastri of Sastri Jyotishalayam Tuni, East Godavari District and printed at 
Lakshmi Printing Works Rajamundri in 1933. 


A copy of this valuable text was given by a great Jaimini astrology scholar and a living legend Shri 
Madura Krishnamurthy Sastriji, to Shri Ravindra Bhagwat who kindly made this available to 
Saptarishis Astrology management for the benefit of astrology fraternity. Shri V. Raghavendra Rao 
who is himself a scholar in Indian culture and Jyotish, has painstakingly translated this, very valuable, 
text first from Telugu Sanskrit lipi to English for the benefit of astrologers at large. 


It has not been an easy job since there is a difference in the way Telugu, which uses a derivative of 
Brahmi script, is written and where some of the letters are pronounced in a different manner than 
Sanskrit which uses Devanagari script. All efforts have been made to correct any anomaly in the 
original shlokas while retaining the text of the definition (Vyakhy&) as understood from the original 
Telugu script, as far as possible. 


I trust the readers will appreciate the contributions of Raghavendra Rao Madhura Krishnamurty 
Sudhindra Kumar and, in bringing out this great astrological work.

As narrated previously in the Trine Rasis where 8" Lords posited are maraka giving 
Rasis. Among the 8" Lords whichever is placed either in exaltation or in debilitation leads to 
maraka. If an exaltated / delilitated planet is placed either in 6" or in 8", its trine Rasi leads 
to Maraka. If there are no exalted planets, based on the samvada (identical results) of gf 
Lords Amsa is arrived, maraka is indicated in that Rasi. Usually among the 8" /o" Lords 
who are placed in lesser degrees is leading to maraka. Among the gf. 6 Rasis to which 
Rasyadhipatis amsa samvada is occurring, to which rasi strong malefic effect is predicted, to 
which Rasis trine several planets are placed, in that rasi Maraka is indicated. 

Usually if malifics are placed either in 6" or in 8 and strong planets are placed in its 
trines (or) several planets are placed in trines, its Lord is placed in trines, during the Kona 
dasa of fixed sign Trikona Rasi, maraka is indicated. As narrated previously while judging 
longevigy (Short/Medium/Long) based on those principles, and without any controversy to 
those, longevity is to be judged.

If each malefic planet is placed, maraka is indicated. As per kala chakra Vyakhya, 
if two or three malefics relation is formed is also leading to maraka. Maraka is indicated during 
the dasa of Rahu placed in Vrushabha, during the Ketu Dasa where Ketu placed in Kumbha. Similarly 
while judging Father's, Mother's death and for self also, Niryana Sani, Niryana Ravi are to be 
taken in to account, While judging Pitru / Matru Maraka when the Niryana Rasi is a cruel 
sign during the starting period of that Rasi Maraka is indicated. If it is related to a benefic 
planet pitru Ganda is indicated, during the fag end of the Dasa. Appayya Dikshita narrates 
that Maraka is indicated during the Trikona Rasis of ar 6th rasis. Some opines that during 
the Dasa periods of extremely malefic planets. Maraka of Father / Mother / Longevity is to 
be judged from Trikona dasa, during that period maraka is indicated, especially during the 
Bhukti period of Dhana Rasi maraka is to be judged. In the cases of Balarista there is no 


need for computation of Dasas and longevity.

Balarista Yogas are narrated - If Chandra is placed in the fag end of Chandrarasi 
or placed either in Lagna, or in 2°¢ Balarista is indicated. Similarly if malefic planets are 
placed Balarista is indicated. If Lagnadhipati placed in 6" Lord’s sign or in 8" Lord’s sign, if 
the Rasyadhipati where Lagnadhipati is placed in the Rasis explained previously Balarista is 
indicated. Longivity is fixed as short lived according to Ghatikalagna.

Rasi Dasa Swaroopa Is Narrated 


First Rasidasa is to be started from the Ninth Rasi from among the strongest of Lagna 
and Saptama (Ascendent and ii signs). If such sign happened to be odd one, it is to be 


continued clockwise, if it happens to be even sign the rasi dasas are to be continued from 
anticlockwise rasis. These are three types regarding making predictions relating to longevity 
Lagnadasa and Saptamadasa are to be taken. This is again two types one is regarding 
“Bhogya” (two adjacent signs to the sign required on clock wise direction) another is 
regarding “Bhukta”. For Mesha lagna natives Meena and Kumbha are “Bhukta” (two 
adjacent signs to the sign required on anticlock wise direction) rasis and Vrishabha, Midhuna 
Rasis are “Bhogya” rasis. To make predictions Bhogya rasis are useful. Some others opine 
that Bhukta rasis are also useful. Such Bhogya Rasi Dasas are two types one is from 9 sign 
based on Prakruti chakra (Horoscope) the other is from go" sign and continued based on 
Udaya Chakra. Among the two first one is for all the common people. The Second one is for 
“Wealthy people” there is noting special in the first Dasa, in the second dasa there are several 
special aspects (here aspect means normal meaning not the planetary aspect) are discussed, 


they are highly secret. However a few are narrated.

While computing the rasidasa of that particular Rasi, the Rasi and Rasyadhipati 
(the sign and the signlord) are to be treated as Lagna. Based on the above two other bhavas 
are to be fixed, in the Chara Dasa Bhavas if a malefic is placed harm to the native is 


indicated, if benefic is placed prosperity is indicated.

Now a chart is taken as example - in this Chart at present it is running Dhanur 
Rasi Dasa. As such, as soon as malefics enter into Midhuna and Mesha Rasis, danger to 
Spouse is indicated. In Gochara if malefics are placed in Kumbha, and in Mesha Rasis 
problems to children are indicated. When malefics enteres into Karkataka and Kanya signs 
disgrace/dishonours to self are indicated, if benefics enters in the said signs favourable results 
and natural malefic gives ill health. Several yogas in the Gochara Dasa were narrated 
previously. Regarding forecasting the death of Father, mother and for self Niryana Guru 
Niryana Vyadhi Graha are to be ascertained. I am not discussing about longevity because it 
is of not much useful here. Please go through my previous works on astrology as indicated in 
this book.

Karaka Rasi is defined from ‘tat’ sound, but it is not Lagna. Starting from lagna 
if it is counted upto karaka if several years are arrived, it is to be counted from Lagna upto 
Karaka. If it is counted from Saptama upto Karaka if several years are arrived, it is to be 


taken from Saptama itself, is the procedure. In the first Rasi dasa, in that Rasi karaka dwells 


during first year, during second year karaka dwells in second rasi, and during third year in 
the third rasi similarly starting from the First rasi upto the rasi where karaka is placed is to be 
computed. Likewise others are to be judged. After completion of Karaka dasa, Karakas 
Kendra Rasi Dasas are to be started. After completing Karaka Kendra Dasas, Karaka 
Phanaphara Rasi Dasas are to be started after completing them, the rasi dasas of Karaka in 
Apokleema Rasis are to be put into motion / Started. In those rasis either in the starting or 
in the ending Rasis, if debilitated planet / benefic planet / exalted planet is placed, though a 
malefic planet is placed if it happens to be a_benefic sign / malefic sign results are to be 
judged carefully. A great difficulty is indicated in the starting and ending of Makara 
(Capricorn) if Rahu is placed in it the native will be put into Jail and all the money with the 
native will be lost. If Guru is placed in the Starting Rasi Dasa Loss/Destruction/annihilation 
of house is indicated. If Chandra, Sukra are placed in 12"" to the starging Rasi, the native has 
to face the fury of the King. Either Sukra or Chandra is placed in 2"! the native will be under 
the softcorner of the King. If Rahu is placed in Dhana to the Upakrama Rasi, no doubt in 
losing all the money is indicated. If Kuja or Ketu placed in 12"" fear from fire is indicated, like 
this to the starting Rasi if any malefic is placed, harm to that respective sign is indicated. 


Gochara dasa is also to be considered

Ascendant is pisces. Sun is in Aries, Mercury and Venus are placed in Gemini, 
Mars is placed in Leo, Saturn and Rahu are placed in Libra. Jupiter in Scropio. Since Moon 
is placed in more number of degrees in Karaka. Since less number of years arrived on 
counting from yf it is taken on counting from Ascendant Chandra Dasa is 09 years. In the 
benefic sign beginning, if Karaka is placed in Pisces, it is to be taken similarly. Based on the

Here Yagnarayana's son’s Chart is taken as example - Ascendant is Karkataka, 
since Makara is strong, first Dasa was started from Makara. In the beginning Makara Dasa 
years are 6, afterwards Dhanu Rasi dasa 4 years, to the Vrichika Kuja’s it is to be counted 
upto Ketu and arrived 10 years. Sani placed in 4" rasi which counted anticlockwise direction 
from Vrichika is a Rajayoga. Since Ketu placed in 10" lead to problems / troubles, because of 
placement of Sukra in the fag end it will be some what better. Next Tularasi dasa for two 
years, this is Sukra Dasa and since Sukra is placed in 2° and Budha is placed in a" is a best 
combination. Because of debilitated aspect entire life is filled with sorrows, difficulties. 
Next Kanya Rasi Dasa for 9 years in the second Sani and Rahu are placed, because it is 
apokleema Dasa, the respective sign lord being placed in Makara lead to difficulties. During 
Rahu Bhukti monetary losses are indicated and malefics placed in a and 9 lead to Daridra 
Yoga. If Ravi Chandra yoga formed in se the naive has to face the fury of the King.

Movement of Mahadasadhipati is narrated - If karaka dasa is started from Lagna, 
starting from Lagna each karaka moves. After completing the karaka planets, next karakas 
trine planets are to be taken. It is starts moving from the sign to next sign where karaka is 
placed and continues. Similarly after careful examination of the debilitated, exalted planets 
in the upakrama avasana rasis. If Rajayoga is formed in that Upakrama Rasis that Ravi is 
treated as exalted, if Sukra is placed there that Ravi is treated as debilitated one. As such in 
each year during avasana rasi and moving rasis are to be examined carefully. While 
predicting results one has to observe - that starting from Chandra and to others is that sign 
falls under Upakrama Rasi, or is it an exalted one, or it is its own sign or the sign of exalted 


Lord or it is a malefic sign or a benefic sign etc.,

To the Rasi its relation to exalted planet, exalted Lord are formed that Rasi is 
equal to an exalted sign. Similarly if a sign is having relation of a debilitated Lord or its lord 
is placed in debilitation or a debilated planet is placed in it, it is a debilitated sign, similarly 
the benefic, malefics are also to be examined. Saptama and karaka planets etc., are moving, 
those are to be observed for the nakshatra (star) dasa system. If a Lord is placed in exaltation 
during its Rasi dasa, all antardasa planets are deemed to be exalted. If the lord is in 
debilitation, similarly all the antardasa planets are deemed to be debilitated. During the 
exalted dasa, the native experiences favourable results atleast for a short period. In our school 
of thought during the rasyantardasa it is of three types. If any planet is placed in the dasa rasi 
it is of two types, else three types, again it is to be divided into two types. Predictions are to 


be made according to Hora or Drekkana.

revealed, in this process an example is narrated with regard to spouse, If karaka is placed in
