Meet Saturn’s Other Face

S aturn’s darker persona is recognized universally in myth and SATURN
fairytale. Here, noted astrologer Liz Greene takes a major step in 
the unveiling of the light of reason, so long obscured by those who A New Look 

have interpreted Saturn as a ‘malefic’ planet and, in so doing, presents a 
remarkably rich study of the unconscious mind, shedding light on that at an
mysterious, elusive entity that psychology calls the self. 

 Old Devil
“Saturn symbolizes a psychic process as well as a quality or kind  6

of experience. He is not merely a representative of pain, restriction,  
and discipline; he is also a symbol of the psychic process, natural to  
all human beings, by which an individual may utilize the experience  

of pain, restriction, and discipline, as a means for greater  
consciousness and fulfillment.”  Liz Greene

— from the book

Greene retraces Saturn’s character through sign, house, aspect, and 
synastry in a brilliant analysis which reveals his other face: that of  

the initiator who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater  
consciousness, self-understanding, and, eventually, freedom.

“Liz Greene’s Saturn is one of the key works in the most important foreword by

of astrology: the idea that astrology is not a map of one’s fixed  Robert Hand

destiny but is a potential map of the unfolding of the  
authentic, higher self.”

Foreword

Many years after its initial publication it is difficult to overes-
timate the importance of Liz Greene’s Saturn: A New Look at an Old 
Devil and what it represents. It was and is an important step in the 
progress of the twentieth century’s most crucial contribution to the 
evolution of astrology—namely, the use of astrology as a tool of self-
realization and self-actualization.

Traditional forms of astrology derived from the Middle 
Eastern traditions--which include Hellenistic, Jyotish, and Medieval 
Astrology (both in Arabic and Latin)--seem to have assumed that 
the basic events and circumstances of one’s life were predetermined 
to a significant degree, if not completely. Those Hellenistic astrolo-
gers strongly influenced by Stoicism show this tendency at its most 
extreme. The following passage from Manilius demonstrates this:

The fates rule the world, everything stands settled by law.

Long seasons are marked out by causes which are fixed.

As we are born, we are dying, and the end depends 
upon the beginning.

From this both wealth and kingship flow, and, more 
often there arises poverty. Skills and character are 
granted to those thus created, also vice, praise, the 
losses and the gathering of things. 
—[Manilius, Astronomica Book IV, lines 14-19. My translation]

Islamic and Christian astrologers of the middle ages gave 
greater scope to free will in theory, but in practice this is not obvi-
ous. Also, all three traditional forms of astrology held that there were 
“good” and “bad” planets, which later came to be called benefics and

malefics, one of which was Saturn. Benefics “caused” good destinies, 
malefics evil ones.

However, even in the ancient world, there were voices which 
dissented from both of these ideas--that everything was determined 
at the moment of birth and that there were “good” and “bad” plan-
ets--a concept which Saturn does much to undermine. The philoso-
pher Plotinus  (AD 204/5 –270) rejected both ideas in Enneads. His 
description of how the planets act could have been written by a mod-
ern astrologer:

We may think of the stars as letters perpetually being 
inscribed on the heavens or inscribed once for all and 
yet moving as they pursue the other tasks allotted to 
them: upon these main tasks will follow the quality of 
signifying. . . 
—Enneads 2.3.7, McKenna translation

He rejects the idea of good and bad planets in the following 
two passages:

The belief is that the planets in their courses actually 
produce not merely such conditions as poverty, wealth, 
health, and sickness, but even ugliness and beauty and, 
gravest of all, vices and virtue and the very acts that 
spring from these qualities, the definite doings of each 
moment of virtue or vice. We are to suppose the stars 
to be annoyed with men—and upon matters in which 
men, molded to what they are by the stars themselves, 
can surely do them no wrong. 
—Enneads 2.3.1, McKenna translation

[The planets are]. . . continuously serene, happy in the 
good they enjoy and the vision before them. Each lives 
its own free life; each finds its own Good in its own 
Act; and this Act is not directed towards us.
 —Enneads 2.3.3, McKenna translation

Foreword 5

Other Platonists followed Plotinus in this respect, but this 
had little impact on practical astrology. However, these passages serve 
to tell us that even in ancient times the “traditional” view of astrology 
was rejected by some, firmly, on philosophical grounds.

Despite the above exceptions among the ancients and a few medi-
eval philosophers who voiced similar objections, deterministic views and 
the idea of benefic and malefic planets dominated astrology until the 
twentieth century. It was the twentieth century and the astrology of the 
modern West which saw the overthrow of these two positions.

Before Liz Greene’s work, others had taken steps--indeed large 
steps--in this direction, most notably the late Dane Rudhyar (1895 - 
1985) and some of his followers. Even as far back as the work of Alan 
Leo (1860 - 1917) at the turn of the last century, one could see move-
ment in this direction. But in the case of Leo, this trend was enveloped 
in a heavy layer of Theosophy, and it could be argued that self-actualiza-
tion in Leo’s work was much more directly part of his Theosophy and 
only incidentally part of his astrology. One had to more or less adopt 
his theosophical beliefs and practices in order to use astrology for self-
actualization. His Esoteric Astrology, much like the later work of the 
same name by Alice Bailey, considerably changed and even distorted the 
ancient symbolism of astrology in order to achieve its result, rather than 
building on that symbolism and extending it to a new purpose.

Dane Rudyhar, who was a student of Bailey’s, took the next 
step and used the true and authentic ancient symbolism of astrology as 
it was to describe astrology as a tool of self-actualization. Works such 
as his Astrology of Personalitycombined Bailey’s insights, along with 
others gained from the psychology of Freud and Jung, to make it clear 
that astrology could move from its medieval heritage of predicting 
events and the external circumstances of life to reveal an understand-
ing of the inner processes of the soul. Rudyhar explored how these 
influenced the individual’s life and, more importantly, how an under-
standing of these could give one freedom and self-determination; he 
also roundly attacked the idea of benefic and malefic planets. 

I do not mean to take away from Rudhyar’s value as an author 
and the importance of his work in what I am about to say. His work 
was written in language that was often obscure, abstract and very the-
oretical. His material gave one hope that  it was possible to transcend 
any particular astrological manifestation, but it did not offer any con-
crete ways to do this. It was for the next generation of astrologers to

begin to accomplish this task. Liz Greene’s Saturn was an important 
contribution to this work.

The format of the book is actually rather traditional. 
Superficially it appears to be a conventional handbook of delinea-
tions. It takes up Saturn’s influence in the signs and houses, and in 
aspect to the other planets. I can say without taking away from Liz 
Greene’s accomplishment in this work that this was not an original 
arrangement; many handbooks of astrological delineations before did 
the same thing. But this more or less conventional way of organiz-
ing the material was exactly what was needed to fill the gap between 
Rudhyar’s powerful but abstract descriptions and the needs of a seeker 
trying to find out what to do with his or her natal chart. 

 However, I must raise a bit of a quibble here, regarding the 
practice of equating the symbolism of planets in the houses with the 
symbolism of planets in the corresponding signs. For example, fol-
lowing this belief, , Saturn in Aries acts like Saturn in the first house, 
Saturn in Taurus acts like Saturn in the second house, and so forth. 
Older, pre-modern astrology may be philosophically and spiritually 
limited, but its symbolic vocabulary is huge and rich. This equating 
of sign and house positions was never done except in melothesia, the 
assignment of signs and houses to parts of the body (Aries and first 
related to the head, Taurus and second relate to the throat, etc.) Signs 
and houses are very different kinds of symbolic entities, having very 
different functions. To equate them in this manner, I believe, is to con-
fuse two very different symbol systems.

But even given my objection, I do not believe this is a great flaw 
in  Saturn because Liz Greene’s emphasis here is clearly on the house 
placement over the sign placement and for this purpose the delinea-
tions are masterful. The references to sign placement, even if signs and 
houses could be equated, would have to be of less value for the simple 
reason that Saturn spends two and a half years in a sign, and about two 
hours each day in a house. The house placements of a planet are much 
more characteristic of the individual person while the sign placements 
describe all persons born over an extended period of time.

The nature of the book’s descriptions of the combinations of 
Saturn with signs, houses, and other planets set it apart from the “cook-
book” approach of previous works. It is not that Greene’s descriptions 
are more “accurate” (as if one could make a precise forecast of exactly 
how a planet will manifest in each setting). It is a matter of providing

descriptions which enlarge the capacity of the individual to take con-
trol of his or her life. Instead of fully developed prescriptions for what 
will happen, the reader is presented with a range of arguments derived 
from the combination of symbols and then shown how changes in 
consciousness and self-awareness can completely turn life manifesta-
tions around, turning those that are potentially difficult more creative 
and fulfilling. Her descriptions are not mere “optimistic” descriptions 
of possibilities that ignore the downside, but are instead descriptions 
of the work that an individual needs to do in order to make creative 
changes. Greene does not avoid describing the realizations that must 
occur and tasks to be undertaken. It all requires a change in con-
sciousness and increased self-awareness. Here is an example from her 
description of Saturn in the sixth house:

When a man is relatively unconscious, Saturn [in the 
sixth] may be symbolic of discontent and resentment 
because he may be aware only of the fact that he is in a 
rut and that he is imprisoned by circumstances. . . .Yet 
the meaning of the routine escapes him because he does 
not truly understand the meaning of service. . . It is 
said in esoteric teaching that service, rather than being 
“good works”, is an innate quality of the inner man . . . 
Service of this kind is the result of inner integration for 
once the body and feelings and mind of a man are in 
balance, he can then begin to become aware, intuitively, 
of the purpose and nature of his inner psyche. . . Service 
which is the result of inner balance is the potential 
result of Saturn in the sixth house when he is expressing 
in a conscious way. 
—[page 44 in the 1976 edition]

As mentioned previously, even in medieval astrology it was 
recognized that free will can alter an astrological indication. But this 
belief was largely for religious reasons. If one did not have freedom of 
will, then the freedom to choose salvation could not exist. It would 
have made God, not the individual responsible for the individual’s 
success or failure in achieving salvation through the planets. . But 
while medieval astrologers paid lip service to this idea, it did not lead

them to show how astrological influences could be modified by an act 
of will. It is not even very clear that they believed it could be done.

Saturn led the way in one of the triumphs of modern astrology 
in  showing that a combination of acceptance, understanding, and the 
ability to perceive alternative choiceswith increased awareness is the 
variable that can change the way in which one experiences one’s chart 
and one’s life. And here is an important point! I firmly believe, and 
I believe that this book points to this, that the level of consciousness 
with which one approaches one’s own life is not fixed or determined by 
whatever the birth chart signifies. One’s potential level of self-aware-
ness is not fated! It may be very difficult to change one’s consciousness 
as circumstances—family, friends, one’s cultural background— may 
seem to work against it at times, but it is always possible.

The choice of Saturn as the subject of this book was superb. Liz 
Greene has subsequently written several other similar works on other 
planets. But Saturn was the best place to begin precisely because Saturn 
is the planet that has most seemed to restrict freedom and fix destiny to 
astrologers. Many astrologers have seen Saturn as the planet of “karma” 
in the false but common sense of the word often used in the West, i.e., 
as the distributer of an inevitable fate handed out as punishment or 
reward for deeds done in the pastor in previous lifetimes. 

That even Saturn’s energy can be altered by the proper degree 
of wisdom and understanding opens up a way of seeing all of astrology 
in the same light. It is not necessary for one to go on an extreme spiri-
tual path, to abandon one’s life in the world and take up the begging 
bowl to achieve this. Greene shows in countless examples how smaller 
“enlightenments” are available to us all if we approach things with the 
proper understanding. In traditional astrology Saturn was called the 
“greater malefic” (Mars being the “lesser”). Being the worse of the two 
traditional “malefics,” Saturn, makes it clear that this could be done 
with all of the symbols of the chart. 

In this way Liz Greene’s Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil 
has become one of the key works in this most important contribution 
of twentieth century astrology to the development of astrology and 
the idea that astrology is not a map of one’s fixed destiny, but a poten-
tial map of the unfolding of the authentic, higher self.

Meet Saturn’s Other Face

S aturn’s darker persona is recognized universally in myth and SATURN
fairytale. Here, noted astrologer Liz Greene takes a major step in 
the unveiling of the light of reason, so long obscured by those who A New Look 

have interpreted Saturn as a ‘malefic’ planet and, in so doing, presents a 
remarkably rich study of the unconscious mind, shedding light on that at an
mysterious, elusive entity that psychology calls the self. 

 Old Devil
“Saturn symbolizes a psychic process as well as a quality or kind  6

of experience. He is not merely a representative of pain, restriction,  
and discipline; he is also a symbol of the psychic process, natural to  
all human beings, by which an individual may utilize the experience  

of pain, restriction, and discipline, as a means for greater  
consciousness and fulfillment.”  Liz Greene

— from the book

Greene retraces Saturn’s character through sign, house, aspect, and 
synastry in a brilliant analysis which reveals his other face: that of  

the initiator who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater  
consciousness, self-understanding, and, eventually, freedom.

“Liz Greene’s Saturn is one of the key works in the most important foreword by

single contribution of twentieth-century astrology to the development  
of astrology: the idea that astrology is not a map of one’s fixed  Robert Hand

destiny but is a potential map of the unfolding of the  
authentic, higher self.” 

—Robert Hand, from the foreword
