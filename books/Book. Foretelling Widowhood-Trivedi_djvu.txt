PREFACE 



Foretelling Widowhood is the fruit of research 
work carried out by us during the last two 
decades, A work of predictive astrology, it 
amalgamates a plethora of principles enshrined in 
various classical texts and practical study of birth 
charts of those who have been unfortunate enough 
to suffer the immeasurable grief and plight of 
untimely widowhood. Untimely widowhood is the 
biggest tragedy that can befall a woman and is 
irreversible. In olden days, widowhood in general and 
untimely widowhood in particular was considered 
an unpardonable sin and a woman had to commit 
Satu that is to mount the pyre of her late husband. 
Was not this inhuman? Women would be ever 
grateful to Raja Ram Mohan Rai whose untiring 
efforts led to rooting out of this obnoxious practice, 
A common belief among masses, as also amongst 
self-styled astrologers, is that mangali females or 
those females having kuja do$a in their birth charts 
are predisposed to suffer widowhood. We would like 
to humbly opine that this belief is only partially 
correct. It is not certain that females having kuja 
do?a will essentially undergo the miseries of marital 
disaster such as widowhood. Many females, who 
suffered untimely widowhood, were not mangali 
either from ascendant, or from Moon or from Venus. 
This is definitely a wrong concept that widowhood 
will curse only a mangali female. In fact, much Is 



x Foretelling Widowhood 

not known about the kuja dosa and its actual effect. 
This thought provoking voluminous work contains 
9 chapters. First two chapters, Planetary Dimensions 
and Zodiac and Essentials of Astrology, cover a few 
important but basic information and principles 
regarding confusions and doubts about a number 
of astrological concepts such as nodi dosa, nica 
bhanga rajayoga, Combustions & badhakas, 
retrograde planets, MarsrSaturn conjunction, Jupiter- 
Venus etc., 

We have also exercised a lot in formulating timing 
of widowhood and dealt with 32 cases of widowhood 
In Chapter 3 entitled Eariy Widowhood : An Astrological 
Exploration with detailed analyses and findings. 

Timing an event is the tougher task to perform 
than predicting. We have used certain classical 
aphorisms In Chapter 4 entitled as Timing 
Widowhood. We have also discussed the timing of 
widowhood cases in detail. We hope that this would 
act like bridgestones in timing an event for students 
of astrology- 
It has been observed that there are many 
misconceptions about Jupiter, e.g., it can prevent 
widowhood if it has an influence over 7 th or 8 th 
house, but our observations in this regard Is that, 
nearly fifty percent cases of widowhood occur 
during the major or sub period of Jupiter, which 
has been explained in Chapter 5 named Widowhood 
and Misconceptions about Jupiter. 

Few females are fortunate enough to be blessed 
with akhanda saubhagya yoga. Sages have mentioned 
a lot about the combinations on widowhood but they 
have discussed less on akhanda saubhagya yoga 
We have detailed this properly in Chapter 6 on 
Akhai}4 a saubhagya Yoga 

Chapter 7, Birth in Jyestha naksatra is an important 
as many misconceptions and wrong impressions 



Preface . xL 

prevail among us regarding the birth in jyestha 
naksaircL Adversities can certainly be reduced and 
eliminated if advice of sages like Kalidasa are 
strictly followed and other remedial measures 
undertaken. 

The work wouldn't have been complete in all 
respects, had the chapter on the untimely loss of 
wife had not been included. While it can not be 
gainsaid that women who suffer early widowhood, 
have to normally undergo more pain and sufferings 
than men. It can only be claimed on the risk of 
sounding insensitive that the men do not suffer 
pain at the loss of their spouses. In a happy 
conjugal life, loss of either spouse is traumatic. 
Therefore we have included Determinants for Death 
of Wife as chapter 8. 

The book would have been incomplete without the 
remedial measures - some common and some rare. 
It will not be out of place to mention that prevention 
is always better than cure. We have mentioned as 
many as 38 remedial measures in chapter 9 entitled 
Remedies For Marital Maladies and Widowhood. 
Most of these measures have been tested by us over 
hundreds of women in whose birth charts potent 
combinations of loss of husband were present. We 
advise all such women who want to be blessed with 
akhanda saubhagya to select a remedial measure 
suitable to their planetary combination and follow 
it with firm faith and dedication. 

We express our immense gratitude and sincere 
thanks to venerable Mr. Narendra Prakash Jain of 
M/s Motilal Banarsidass for the decision to publish 
this work and having already earlier published our 
six books in Hindi: - 

1. Vaivdhik Vilamba Ke Vividha Ayama Evam

3. Santdna Sukha : Sarvaftga Ctntana

We offer heartfelt appreciation to our daughter 
Deeksha who always inspires us for writing on 
astrological subjects, son Vlshal who spared some 
of his valuable time in processing and compiling 
the book - their respective spouses Rahul and 
Shilpi, and our grandchildren Yug and Ansh. 
We also offer our sincere thanks to Dr. Rakesh 
Asthana, the Chief Medical Officer in Central 
Health Service for editing. 

We are quite confident that Foretelling Widowhood 
will be warmly welcomed by the readers of astrology. 
However we would be indebted to them for their 
reactions and opinions. 

We trust and pray that this work will preclude 
widowhood at practical and theoretical levels and 
would empower and enable those afflicted by the 
ire of most malefic Mars and misfortune of marital 
maladies to everlasting conjugal life of highest 
order. Hence, truest reward for this humble effort 
would be the happiness and Joy of those, thus 
bestowed.

Chapter- 1 
PLANETARY DIMENSIONS AND ZODIAC 



Zodiac is an imaginary belt in the heaven about 
9 degrees either side of the Sun's path within 
which the planets and the constellations move 
from east to west. This zodiac is known as bhava 
cakra or rosicokrcu 

This zodiac is an imaginary circle of 360° which 
Is divided Into twelve equal parts and each part 
is of 30°. Generally, we name the divisions as rdsi 
and entire cakra the rasicakrcL 

The east-west movement of the heavenly bodies 
is just an apparent movement. Actually the planets 
In the solar system travel from west to east while 
the stars on the background are almost fixed, that 
is, their distance is so big from us that their 
movements appear as if non-existent. 

Of the several movements of our earth, two are 
important for our day to day life. The earth rotates 
round its axis completing one rotation in about 
twenty-four hours of our time and revolves round 
the Sun completing one revolution In 365 days 6 
hours 9 minutes 9 seconds. 

The twenty-seven zodiacal constellations have 
been considered Important for calendric astronomy 
same as the twelve Signs of the zodiac. 

Importance of the rdsicakra and the naksatra 
cakra are described in length In the following lines.

22. Angles : The ascendant, 4 th , 7 th and 10 th axe 
called angles or kendras. 

a) The 5 th and 9 th from the ascendant are 
trlnes or konas, 

b) The 6 th , 8 th and 12 th from the ascendant 
are called evil houses or trtkasthdnas. 

c) The 3 rd , 6 th , 10 th and 11 th from the as- 
cendant are known as uccaihsthdnas. 

d) The 2 nd and the 7 th are called 
marakasthanas or houses of death. 

e) The 4 th and 8 th from the ascendant are 
known as cahxrasras. 

f) The houses adjoining the angles (i.e. 
the 2 nd , 5 th , 8 th and 1 1 th ) are designated 
as cadent houses or apoklimas. 

g) The houses adjoining apoklimas (viz. the 
3 rd , 6 th , 9 th and the 12 th ) are known as 
panapharas or succedent houses. 

Apart from the nine planets from the Sun to Ketu, 
Hindu astrology also recognizes sub-planets or 
upagrahas, These positions should also be inserted 
in the horoscope for they are capable of giving 
certain effects independent of the nine grahas or 
planets. 

The five upagrahas are dhuma, vyailpata, parivesa, 
tndracapa and upaketu. These are non-luminous or 
aprakasaka grahas. The actual positions of these 
are to be calculated as given in the Bfhat Parasara 
Hora Nostra (Ch. 3 Slokas 61-64). 

To get Dhuma 4 signs 13 degrees and 20 minutes 
of arc to the Sun's longitude. Dhuma from 12 signs 
to ascertain the position of VyaGpata Dhuma is 
reduced. The position of Parivesa is obtained by 
adding 6 signs to VyaSpata. To get the position of 
tndracapa the longitude of Parivesa deducted from 
12 signs. Upaketu will be ahead of indracapa by 



Planetary Dimensions and Zodiac 9 

16 degrees 40 minutes and one sign or 30 degrees 
behind the Sun, 

From the above we can deduce the following 
simple standard formulae to know the positions of 
the five aprakasaka grahas when the sun's longi- 
tude is given, 

a) Sun+ 133° 20 =Dhuma 

b) Dhuma+ 53 20 Q '= Vyatipata 

c) Vyatipata + 180 = Partvesa 

d) Partvesa less 53 2£'= Indracapa 

e) Indradhanu$<% + 16 40 '= Upaketu 

f) Upaketu + 30 = The Sun. 

There are four kinds of Varga evaluations, viz, 

a) $adLvarga (6 divisions only considered) - rasu 
hora, decanate, navarhsa. dvadasdmsa and 
trimsarhsa. 

b) Saptavarga (7 divisions): saptaihsa calculations 
to $advarga to get saptavarga divisions. 

c) Dasa Varga (10 divisions): khalarhsa, dasarttsa 
and $a$tianxsa calculations is added to the 
saptavarga scheme. 

d) $odasa Varga : These are 16 divisions or 
vargas. 

Now, the special technical names given in this con- 
text are:- 

a) $advarga scheme, if a planet is in two good 
varga$, it is called kiihsuka varga. Similarly if 
it has 3 good vargas then vyafijaria; 4 good 
vargas, cdmara; 5 good vargas, chatra; and 6 

. good vargas, fcur^ota. 

b) When saptavarga scheme is considered, the 
above names for the 6 good vargas remain the 
same as for $advargas while 7 good vargas get 
the name mufcufa 

c) When dasavarga scheme is considered, the 
number of good vargas go with the following 
names — 



10 Foretelling Widowhood 

2. Pdrijata 3. Uttama 4. Gopvra 

5. Sirhhdsana 6. Pardvata 7. Deualofca 
8. Brahmaloka 9. £aJcrai>dhana 
10. Srvdhama 
d) Lastly, when sodasavarga scheme is consid- 
ered the good vargas go with the undermentioned 
special names. 

2. Bhedaka 3. Kusuma 4. Ndgapuspa 

5* Kanduka 6. Kerala . 7. Kalpavrik$a 
8. Candanavana9. Purnocandra 
10. Uccaihsravd 11. Dhanuantari 
12.SuryaJcanta 13. Vidruma 
1 4 . Sakrasf mhdscuia 
15-GotoJca 16* Srivallabha 

In these divisional considerations, good vargas 
mean the planet's exaltation sign, mulatrikana sign, 
own sign and the signs of the lord of an angle from 
the arudha lagna. The divisions of a combust planet, 
defeated planet, weak planet and a planet in bad 
avasthas like sayana are inauspicious and be not 
considered good. 

For convenience sake, the sages used these terms 
in their slokas. When the term Saryakantamsa 
appears, it denotes that the planet is in 12 such 
good vargas out of the 16 divisions, or when the 
term pdravatdmsa is used it means the planet is 
in 6 such good divisions in the dasavarga scheme. 
So to say, these are brief terms. 

Vargottama is however a different term. It means 
that the planet occupies one and the same rdsi and 
navdm£a. 

Nddiamsas: Each rdsi is divided into 150 
nddiamsas, measuring 12' of arc. A nddiarhsa is 
again divided into two parts which are respectively 
known as pwvabhaga (former part) and parabhaga 
(latter part). Some Nddi texts make each rdsi into 



Planetary Dimensions and Zodiac 1 1 

600 nadlariisas thus making the entire zodiac into 
7200 parts. 

Description of Naksatra 

The zodiac is an imaginary elliptical band 18° wide 
described round the star sphere at the centre of 
which runs the Ecliptic; to this narrow band are 
confined the Sim, Moon and the planets and can 
never be seen on any other part of the sky except 
the zodiac. 

The zodiac Is divided into twelve equal lengths in 
each of which the Sun transits for a period of one 
month of the year. They are the signs of the zodiac. 

The naksatras or the kalaman$ala or circle of 
time. They are twenty-seven In number. Each of 
which has peculiar functions as per its quality. 

A question may arise as why Oriental Astro- 
Science takes selected few planets and a selected 
few constellations in preference to the innumerable 
ones studded in the sky. The simple answer to this 
is that, such of them who influence our lives on 
this planet earth have been accepted by the givers 
of this science in preference to the rest. 

The 360 degree of zodiac is divided into twelve 
equal parts. Each part is a sign of 30 degrees 
longitude. In the same way, these 360 degree have 
been divided into 27 equal parts called constellations, 
that is, stars or star groups. Hence, stars forming 
a group are called constellations. In 1982, the 
International Astronomical Union recognized 88 
constellations; but for the Astrological purposes 27 
constellations have been recognized and each of 
these has been assigned to a planet. The 28 th 
naksatra group is called abhyit which is in the sign 
of Capricorn extending from 6° 40 r to 13° 20'and 
is ruled by the Moon. This abhijit has not been given

constellation is 13° 20 ' . Each rdsi includes 9 
quarters [padas) of the constellations. In the table 
No. 2 Mesa rdsi (Aries) is formulated by the four 
padas of asviriu four padas of bharanl and one pada 
of krttikcL The rest three padas of krttika go to the 
next rdsi vrsabha and herein all the 4 padas of 
Kohini plus 2 padas of Mrgasira are to be found- 
thus completing the 9 padas in a rdsi and so on 
it goes with the rest. 

The placement of Moon in a constellation marks 
the broad period (dasd) of the planet which governs 
the constellation. For Instance, Moon is in Leo 20° 
in a horoscope. This point falls in the constellation 
of purudphdlgruni of which Venus is the governing 
planet and therefore, the person born under this 
constellation will experience the broad period (dasd) 
of Venus, the constellational lord. This is as per 
the vimsottari dasd system, propounded by the great 
sage Pardsara. 

Man is a twelve fold being - three fold spirit, 
three fold body, three fold mind and three fold soul. 
These divisions are very clearly seen in the twelfth 
signs of the zodiac.

The visionary classifications of the constellations 
is suggestive that the person having his Moon in 
blind or andha constellations is of a superfluous 
intuitional judgement whereas mandak$a is little 
better in the matter* The madhydk$a sees thrpugh 
things with a mediumistic view while sulocana sees

things through and through. This interpretation may 
be classed as a philosophical one of the 
constellations. 

Mandi : MandU the poisonous one is the son of 
Saturn as described In Indian Astrology. Determi- 
nation of its position in a birth chart is the most 
important task. 

For day born, the duration of a day (sunrise to 
sunset) is called a divamana. Divide this by 8* Each 
part is governed by a planet. The day lord is the lord 
of the 1 st part and remaining parts are ruled by the 
planetary order of the weekdays. 

Similarly, to determine the position of Mandi for 
night birth, divide the ratrimana, duration of the 
night (sunset to sunrise) by 8. The first part is ruled 
by the planet 5 th from the day lord and the remaining 
parts in the same order as mentioned in case of day 
born. Here also, the part ruled by Saturn goes to 
Mandi or gulika* J 

Here is a table for easy reference.

Example -- For instance, a boy is born on 9 th July 
1985, Tuesday at 1.30 pm 1ST In Bhubaneshwar. In 
any local almanac the duration of the day can be 
found. The author's calculations are based on the 
Ra$p-iya Pancamga prepared by the Director Gen- 
eral of Meteorological Centre for the year 1985. Ac- 
cording to this, the sunrise of 9 th July is at 5.13 am 
and sunset at 6,31 pm for Bhubaneshwar. So the 
Divamana is 13 th 18m=798 minutes. Dividing this by 
8, we get 97m 30 seconds per part, that is, lh 37m 
30 sec. Since the day is Tuesday, 5 th division of the 
day will be ruled by Saturn, 4 th division ends after 6 
hrs, 30 mts of sunrise, that is, 5h 13m+6h 30 = 
11.43 am. From 11.43 am beings the fifth division 
governed by saturn, which is time when Mandi rises. 
At 1 1-43 am, of 9 th July 1985, the sign Virgo rises in 
the East. So Mandi is to be fixed in the sign Virgo in 
the birth chart or Virgo is to be called as the Gidika 
Lagna for this chart. The lagnasphut (longitude of 



J 8 Foretelling Widowhood 

gulika lagna) at 1 1 .43 am is Virgo 2 1'30 K so the gulika 
or mandi is in Virgo 21°30' of the chart. 
Importance - One can rectify the asundance of a 
horoscope considering its position. That may be in 
trine from mandi itself, or the 7 th , 5 th or 9 th from 
the rasi or the navamsa occupied by Mandi, its 
dispositor or the Moon. 

Fortuna: What is Pars Fortuna? Fortuna, also 
called Pars Fortuna, Is a magnetic point in the 
horoscope represented by the earth symbol. 

It Is to be determined by adding the longitudes 
of the ascendant with that of the Moon subtracting 
the longitude of the Sun from the total, that is, 
lagriasphuta (+) candrasphuta (-) ravisphuta = Fortuna. 
Example - For instance, the Sun Is in Virgo 15°20 r 
the Moon is in Capricorn 13° 30' and the ascendant 
falls in Libra 28°, so the position of Fortuna is to 
be as follows. 

Lagnasphuta is 6° 2# + candrasphuta 9° 13' 30"= 
16°11'30"- ravisphuta 5° 15'20"= 10° 26' 10". So 
Fortuna is to be placed in the 26° 10' of Aquarius. 

A critical example now. Suppose ascendant is in 
Aries 15° 2' , Moon Is also in 15° of Aries. So 0° 
15'+ 0° 15'= 1° O'OO". The Sun is in 5° 15' or Leo 
15°. therefore, the ascendant and Moon total fall 
short of the longitude of the Sun. Here add one 
circle that is, 12 signs and deduct the longitude 
of the Sun which will be 1° 0'00>+ 12°=13°0' Off' 
- 5° 15'= 7° 15 00 " or Scorpio 15°. Fortunes position 
will be at Scorpio 15°. 

Effects - Fortuna is both a sensitive and a fortunate 
point in the zodiac, which improves the matters 
signified by the house it occupies.

Pranapada : What is Prdriapodd ? A prdna is equal 
to 15 lltas and one danda is equal to 4 pranas. 
A human being takes birth only when the ascendant 
falls either in the Pranapada itself or in the 5 th , 
7 th or 9 th bhavas therefrom or In the 5 th or 9 th counted 
from the 7 th house from Pranapada. 
How to calculate? Convert the given time into 
vighatls and divide the same by 15. If the Sun is 
in a movable sign add the resultant rdsi, degrees 
with it, if in fixed sign add 240 degrees with above 
and in case dual sign 120 degrees to be added. 
Example - For instance, the child is born at 20 
ghatis 20 vighaGs after sunrise. Converting the same 
into vigha&s, we get 1220, Dividing it by 15 the 
result comes 81-5 means 81 rdsis 5°, Dividing this 
by 12, we get 9 signs 5° or 275°. If the Sun is in 
a movable sign (suppose in Libra 10°) then 275° 
+ 190° = 465°. Since one sign is of 30° it will be 
15° 15'. Deducting 12 signs it comes to 3° 15'of 
Cancer 15°, wherein Pranapada will be placed. 
Importance - The importance of Pranapada lies in 
its use for rectification of birth time as mentioned 
above. 

Calculations of upagrahas 

Like gra/ias-Pianets, there are five upagrahas or 
subplanets. They are l-Dhuma, 2-Vyatipdta, 
3-Parivesa, 4-Indracapa, 5-Upaketu. They are highly 
malefvcs in their behaviour and effects. 

How to calculate them? Note the longitude of the 
Sun of a nativity and calculate these non luminous- 
aprakasa Grahas as per the formula given below: - 

1. Sun's longitude + 133° 20'= Dhuma 

2. Dhuma + 53° 20'= Vyatlpata 

3. Vyatlpata + 180° = Parivesa 

4. Parivesa - 53° 20'= Indracapa 

5. Indracapa* 16° 40'= Upaketu 



20 



Foretelling Widowhood 



Upaketu, if increased by 30 degrees will be equal to 
the Sun's longitude of the given horoscope.

Though the calculations of these subplanets are 
not necessary for the horoscope, still their roles 
are very much felt at the time of minute study of 
a chart. Hence the necessity of this chapter. 

How they behave? - They behave as per the moods 
or whims of their dispositors, the lord of the houses 
they occupy. Since they are highly maleflcs and 
afflict the bhdva, mostly negative results can be 
expected from them.

Chapter-2 
ESSENTIALS OF ASTROLOGY 



Following principles have been traced from 
various works of astrology. These are most 
important observations of various astrologers 
and a few of these have been taken from classical 
works. These principles of astrology will help the 
beginners for the advanced study of astrology. These 
principles of the science of astrology have been 
experienced on over thousand of birth charts and 
the results have always been astonishingly, precisely 
accurate and correct. We have included the general 
principles of astrology also for the ready reference to 
students, such as the rules of nica bhanga rq/ayogra, 
combustion, bddhakas, cancellation of nadl dosa and 
the like. 

Principle 1- Navamsa 

One important use of navamsa is to assume that a 
planet is in association with the planet in whose 
navamsa that is situated, navamsa chart may be 
studied independently, provided the time of birth is 
absolutely correct. 

Principle 2 - Dispositors 

(a) The dispositor gives the results of the planets, 
which are occupying their signs. For advance 
study of the theory of the dispositors, a book 
name Dispositors by J.N.Bhasin may be referred- 



28 Foretelling Widowhood 

b) The dispositor usually carries the effects of the 
planets posited in their sign, e.g., Mars in Pisces, 
then its dispositor Jupiter opposite to its life 
saving nature, because of carrying the effects of 
Mars, will kill the native (or concerned 
individual). 

1, 5, 9 are fleiy signs 

2, 6 t 10 are earthly signs 

3, 7, 11 are aiiy signs 

4, 8 t 12 are wateiy signs 

lords of these houses are also fleiy, earthly, aiiy 
or watery in nature. They incorporate these 
nature (Aery, earthly, aiiy and watering), but if 
any house is occupied by a planet, its lord will 
act In accordance with the nature of the planet 
posited in its sign, even though its own nature 
may be different. 

Principle 3 - Planets And Separation 

The Sun, Saturn and Rahu possess separative 
tendencies. The 12 th house and the lord thereof also 
has separative tendency. Dispositors of these planets 
also have separative tendency. These planets give rise 
to separation during their dasa bhuktl If any house 
receives malefic Impact of at least three of these, the 
auspicious results of that house will be spoiled* 

Principle 4 - Jupiter And Sun 

For Virgo lagna, Jupiter in 11 th in Cancer gives 
daughters as it owns two kendras. Retrograde Jupiter 
In 11 th gives male child. Generally, it may be clearly 
understood that it is not at all essential that male 
planets like Jupiter or Sun, tend to bless one with 
male children only. 

Principle 5 - Effect Of Sun 

The Sun creates problems, tensions and trouble from 
the person where the Sun Is placed. In 7 th , the Sun 



Essentials of Astrology 29 

causes disputes with wife, in 5 th with children, in 4 th 
with mother and so on. Sun promotes 3 rd , 10 th and 
1 1 th houses if placed therein, in the 5 th house, Sun 
gives daughter and not son. In 7 th , Sun gives unhappy 
married life and separation because the native 
ignores his/her spouse. In 4 th Sun may give rise to 
heart trouble, especially if Ketu is associated in 4 th . 

Principle 6 - Moon 

Moon should be regarded as malefic if it is placed 
within 72° from the Sun* Moon is a benefic from 8 th 
lunar day of bright fortnight to the 7 A lunar day of 
dark fortnight* 

Principle 7 - Sudarsana System 

Sudarsana is the system introduced by maharsi 
Parasara. According to this, position is analyzed in 
relation to Sun lagna and Moon lagna also In addition 
to general lagna. Sudarsana Cakra contains these 
three charts In one, e.g., If any house Is afflicted as 
well as disposed, In relation to all the three lagnas, 
the matters of that house will largely be hampered 
or promoted accordingly. 

Principle 8 - Cancellation Of Nadi Dosa 

1. There Is no nadi dosa If birth takes place in 
Rohinu ardra, mrgasira, krttikcL pusya, sravana, 
revatu and uttarabhddrapada. 

(Jyotisa Cintamani) 

2. If the Moon sign of either of the couple is owned 
by Jupiter, Venus or Mercury, Nadi Dosa will be 
cancelled or it will be ineffective. 

(Vivaha Kautuhala) 

3. Nadi dosa will be cancelled if janma naksatra of 
the boy and girl is same but the pada is different, 
i.e., if both are born in different quarters of the 
same constellation. 



30 Foretelling Widowhood 

4. if both, boy and girl are born In the same 
naksatra but the Moon sign Is different. 

5. If the Moon sign of the boy and girl are same but 
constellation are different. 

6. If Moon sign of boy and girl are ruled by the 
same planet, i.e.* If there is ekddhipatya the nodi 
dosa is automatically gets cancelled. 

Principle 9 - Marriage Time 

a) So many rules have been laid down for timing 
of marriage but we are not able to time all 
marriages correctly. I have experienced that 4 th 
house does play a vital role in the timing of 
a marriage. Fourth house creates a feeling of 
own home, belonging to some one and being 
responsible to him or her fully. Marriage is not 
merely a union of two physical bodies but it 
is a sacred bond of love, care and responsibility 
for whole life. Marriage causes lot of variations, 
additions and emotions in the mind of every 
person. Therefore, the 4 th house must be con- 
sidered for timing of marriage in addition to 
the 7 th and 2 nd house. 

b) Transit of Jupiter is very important in timing 
marriage. After fixing up appropriate dasa and 
bhukti for marriage, see the influence of 
transiting Jupiter. It should influence by way of 
aspect or It should transit over the 7 th house, 
lagna, its lords or karakas like Moon or Venus. 

c) The rules of Phaladlpikd about the importance 
of Jupiter's transit over the sum of longitude of 
lagna lord and 7 th lord or to the trine position 
does not work accurately. 

Principle 10 - Late Marriage 

a) If the Sun, Moon, 7 th lord and karakas are under 
the influence of Saturn, the marriage will be 
delayed. If the luminaries and karakas fall in 



Essentials of Astrology 31 

Saturn's ndvamsa, the marriage will be delayed. 
Influence of retrograde planets either by 
placement or aspect over the 2 nd or 7 th house or 
their lords will also cause delay in marriage. 
Combination of Moon and Venus is also a 
negative combination for early marriage. If Venus 
falls in the sign of luminaries* i.e., Cancer or 
Leo and is also hemmed between them, the 
marriage will be delayed* 
b) Mutual aspect or conjunction of Saturn and Mars 
in respect to 7 th house will also create obstacles 
in marriage. Placement of concerning planets 
in fixed signs and navamsa will also cause some 
delay in marriage. The Intensity of adverse 
planets causing delay in marriage should be 
properly judged, so that probable dasdand bhukti 
for marriage may be judged correctly. 

Principle 11 - Widowhood 

The Sun or Mars in the sign of their exaltation or 
own sign identical to the 1 st or 7 th house will cause 
widowhood. If Sun is placed in the 1 st or 7 th house for 
Leo, Aries or Libra lagna, the widowhood will be there* 
Placement of Mars in the 1 st or 7 th house for Aries, 
Libra, Scorpio, Taurus, Capricorn or Cancer 
ascendant, will cause widowhood. These clues should 
be studied, with other favourable or unfavourable 
combinations. These should not be applied verbatim. 
Specific combination of widowhood are explained in

Principle 12 - Two Wives 

If Venus or 7 th lord is hemmed between two malefics 
or papas, two wives will be there. It is not essential 
that both wives are legally married to the native. 
One may be a secret and responsible for relationship 
with any female just like that of wife. This is an 
important rule and has been verified in dozens of 
horoscopes. 



32 Foretelling Widowhood 

If Venus is placed in movable sign and navamsa 
(not vargottama), the native will have two wives. 

Venus in Cancer and Moon in Capricorn, the 
native will have two marriages. 

Placement of Moon and Venus in the 7 th house 
In association gives rise to bahukalatra yoga, i.e., 
number of wives will be there. 

If the lord of the 7 th house and Venus falls in 
the dual sign in male x nativity, two marriages will 
take place. If these fall in the navamsa of Mercury 
or Jupiter, more than one marriage will surely be 
there. 

If Moon joins the 7 th or 3 rd house from lagna and 
Mercury is placed In the 10 th house as reckoned 
from lagna lord, the native will be surrounded by 
women. 

If the 7 th lord is strong, exalted or It is retrograde 
In the lagna, more than one marriage will take 
place. 

If the 7 th lord is strong, and well placed, marriage 
will take place in a decent and rich family and vice- 
versa. 

Principle 13 - Short Life Of One Partner 

If Moon is placed In the 6 th or 8 th house with a ma- 
lefic in the lagna and the same position is present In 
the horoscope of partner, the husband or wife will 
die soon after marriage. 

Principle 14 - Death Within 8 Years 

a) If Moon is placed In the lagna and Mars Is posited 
in the 7 th house, the death of boy or girl will 
come within 8 years of marriage. 

b) If Sun and Saturn are conjoined In the 7 th house 
in association with Rahu or Ketu, the native will 
be killed by the spouse. 

c) If Mars and Jupiter are conjoined in Cancer or 
Capricorn, spouse will be destroyed* If retrograde 



Essentials of Astrology 33 

Jupiter, joins Mars, the same results will come 
in evidence, 

d) If one is born in Taurus ascendant, and lagna 
lord Venus falls in Scorpio, the early loss of 
spouse will take place. 

e) Saturn in the 3 rd house, will give marriage with 
a girl who has already lost her father. The danger 
to the life of mother-in-law within one year of 
marriage will be there. 

f) Mars in the 8 th house will cause diseases of 
uterus to the wife of the native. In a female 
horoscope, it will also cause widowhood. 

g) The native will lose all his wealth, illicit 
relations, if Rahu falls in the 7 th house with a 
malefic in the sign of a malefic planet. 

h) Saturn and Moon placed in the 7 th house deny 
marriage. Mars conjoined with Mercury in the 
7 th house is very adverse and causes marital 
mishaps. Mars with Venus in the 7 th house 
makes one rich through the spouse though the 
combination is very adverse for marital 
happiness, Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn in the 
7 th house gives a dumb spouse instead of riches. 
Jupiter Mars in the 7 th house denotes a very 
prosperous husband. 

Principle 15 - Children 

Taurus, Leo, Virgo and Scorpio are honoured at 
alpasuta rast The girl who is born in these signs, 
will be blessed only with a few children. However, if 
the sign comes under the influence of many beneflcs, 
many children will be born. 

Principle 16 r Family Of Spouse 

The wife will come out from a decent and rich family 
if the 7 th lord is stronger than lagna lord and is well 
placed under the aspect of beneflcs or it is exalted. 
The family of wife will be a reputed one. 



34 Foretelling Widowhood 

Principle 17 - Beauty And Physique Of Spouse 

The planets placed in the 7 th house or the planets 
who lend their aspect over the 7 th house, decide the 
beauty of spouse. The 7 th lord should not be taken 
much into consideration in the judgement of beauty, 
structure, age and complexion of the wife as this is 
generally done so by mistake* 

Principle 18 - Direction Of Marriage 

The direction indicated by the planet who becomes 
the lord of the 7 th house as reckoned from Venus, 
will be the direction of the house of wife from where 
she will come out 

Principle 19 - Result .Of Planets 

Generally, the planets give the results, good or bad 
more strongly for the houses they are placed in or 
aspect as compared to the houses they own. 

Principle 20 - Dasd 

a) The planet ruling a person as the sub-period 
lord invariably influences the main dasd lord 
irrespective of their position in the horoscope, 
e,g., in Mercury, Mars period, Mars will harm 
the aspects of Mercuiy, relatives, brain etc. 

b) Dasd bhuJctflord if placed in a same house, gives 
bad results. 

c) Soni-Venus is always bad. 

d) Sani R&hu is always bad. 

e) Rahu is conjoined with Kendra or trikona lord 
gives very good results regarding the house it 
controls. 

f) Dasd lord should be taken as lagna under 
separate chart keeping the dasd lord in lagna 
should be prepared for the examination of dasd 
bhukti results correctly. Similarly, while studying 
the details of sub-period keeping the sub period 
lord in the lagna another chart should be 



Essentials of Astrology 35 

prepared for accuracy, correctness, preciseness 

of dosd bhukti results, 
g) Mars Rahu in 7 th creates havoc including Mars 

Saturn and Rahu Saturn in the married life. 

That may cause separation, widowhood, deaths 

and miseries, 
h) If a child dies within 5 years, it is due to mother's 

ill luck, if 5 to 12 years, father's ill luck and 

after 12 years due to own sins, 
i) Jupiter Sun Yoga - very good and will promote 

the house. 

Principle 21 - Libra Ascendant And Jupiter 

For Libra ascendant, Jupiter owns 3 rd and 6 th house 
but he gives beneflc results as an exception to general 
rule. Though usually astrologers consider Jupiter 
as malefic for Libra ascendant. 

Principle 22 - Distinction Between Life And 
Wealth Prospects 

When the lord of any house aspects its own house, 
prospects of that house are promoted, e.g., for 
Capricorn natives, Saturn's aspect on lagna gives 
honour and wealth but shortens the life. 

Mars for Aries natives, if placed in 10 th aspects 
lagna, will give honour and wealth but the body would 
be subjected to injurious and short life. 

Principle 23 - 11 th Lord 

If the lord of the 11 th house is a malefic planet and 
he is placed In 5 th house, it Is not good for life 
prospects of elder brother. If such lord is afflicted by 
aspects of malefics, birth of elder brother denied. 

Principle 24 - Sun And Venus 

If Sun is located in any sign of Venus and is aspected 
by Moon, the man is fond of call girls.

the Sun is in the ascendant, the native has more 
vitality. Cancer rules heart and gastric pain. 

Cancer people are fond of foods and are healthy 
eaters. Their health is afflicted often due to wrong 
diet. 

Sun in Cancer or Capricorn, if afflicted indicates 
heart troubles. There are many forms of heart 
trouble. Instead of going deep into it, the astrologer 
should foretell about the problem connected with 
heart only* If any doctor is a student of astrology 
as well, and knows the anatomy, he can be more 
precise in correctly pinpointing the particular 
problem of heart, on the basis of aspect, conjunc- 
tion and signs involved. We have discussed this in 
quite detail in our article. Planets and Cardiac 
Troubles.. 

An affliction of Ketu indicates weakening of heart 
by poison from some malfunctioning organ or from 
another disease or affliction. If Ketu and Sun 
occupies 4 th house, heart trouble is indicated. If 
conjunction takes place in Cancer in 4 th house, it 
is worst.

life. 

Principle 49 - Retrograde Planets in Exaltation 
by Dr. Shastri 

a) If debilitated planet is retrograde, it will give 
exaltation results and vice-versa. 
Debilitation is cancelled if any planet is exalted 
in the sign of the debilitated planet, square to 
the Moon but Moon is unfortunate in this 
respect because no planet is exalted in Scorpio. 
Moon's exaltation is not Taurus. This is pure 
speculation. 

b) All retrograde planets should be considered as 
strong The benefit of such a strength, of course, 
goes to the house which the retrograde planet 
owns. The results may therefore, depend on the 
fact whether it owns a good house and is strong. 
In which case, the house and benefits. When 
the retrograde planet is lord of an evil house, it 
of course, increases the evil nature thereof. Keep- 
ing in view the fact that Jupiter owns a good 
house, the following sloka No. 40 of Chapter 15 
seems to have been penned by author of 
SarvarthacintdmanL 

Drai" ^TctiMifii d|i?i<£i?iidi <H6Mcii -enter ^jdn£<*iyitft 

i.e., during the ruling period of a retrograde 
Jupiter, a person gets much wealth, sons, wife. 
He is victorious in battle, gets favour from 
government, scented articles, clothes and 
excellence of speech. 

There is no doubt that Jupiter lord of a good 
house in retrogression will give good results but 
this is subject to the overriding condition that 
Jupiter in such a condition should not be under 



54 Foretelling Widowhood 

heavy affliction. If he is, say under as many 
as four malefic influences, then, Inspite of his 
retrogression, Jupiter will give bad results, 
c) For retrograde planets, In general Phaladipika 
(Chapter IV, Sloka No. 4) says:- 

faUe?l6d<£Rjfcltfrl<l I I 

A planet possesses strength when he is 
retrograde, as his rays are brilliant and full, 
even though he may be posited in a debilitation 
or inimical sign or amsa Like the Moon, a planet 
even if occupying an exaltation, friendly or his 
own sign or amsa becomes weak, should he be 
eclipsed due to vicinity to Sun. 
When Jupiter is retrograde, it denotes also the 
existence and prosperity of the things etc. of 
which it is the significator. For example, if in a 
birth chart, when the other factors for main 
issues viz. the 5 th house, its lord, the 9 th house 
and its lord are all weak, but Jupiter is retrograde 
and unaspected by malefics, the native will have 
a number of male issues. 

Principle 50 - My Experience About 
Vimsottari Dasd System 

a) Jupiter and Venus are inimical in nature- One 
is devaguru and other is danavaguriL Sub period 
of Venus in the major period of Jupiter or siib 
period of Jupiter in the major period of Venus 
are adverse for family happiness, prosperity and 
general health provided one of them is adversely 
placed in a malefic sign or malefic house* 



Essentials of Astrology 55 

However, if both are favourably placed In benefic 
houses and signs and they are in quadrant or 
in trine from each other. Their dasa bhukti will 
be excellent, 
b) When Venus and Saturn are equally powerful 
in a horoscope, occupying exaltation or 
vargottama positions, they in their mutual dasa 
bhukti will cause the down fail of the native, 
even though he is an emperor. If one of the 
planets is strong and the other weak, the 
stronger one will cause the Yoga.. If both the 
planets are weak and placed in 6 th , 8 th or 12 th 
from each other or own those houses or 
conjunctions, they will bestow on the native's 
prosperity. If one of them owns an auspicious 
house and other a malefic one, even then both 
of them will produce good effects. Such is the 
opinion of some sages. 

Principle 51 - Special Significance of Jupiter 

For Women, Jupiter has a special significance, in as 
much as Jupiter is the significator of Husband in 
their horoscope. When in the birth chart of a women 
Jupiter becomes the lord of the house representing 
the husband, viz., the 7 th , it naturally represents 
the husband par excellence. Affliction of such Jupiter 
obviously tells heavily on the longevity of the 
husband. The view that Jupiter is the significator of 
husband (and not Venus as held by some) is 
supported by the author of the famous work 
Phaladlpikd, while enumerating the traits of Jupiter, 
Mantreswara says:- 

i.e., learning, control over senses and the longevity 
of husband, should be considered from Jupiter. 



56 Foretelling Widowhood 

In this context, it may be added that exalted Jupiter, 
whatever its merits, is generally bad for the longevity 
of the relation represented by the house in which its 
sign Sagittarius f^lls, particularly in cases in which 
Jupiter in such a position is afflicted too. For 
example, In regard to exalted Jupiter in the 8 th house 
of a birth chart with Ketu* the author of Devakeralam 
remarks at page 130:- 

i.e., the eldest sister of father will become a 
widow but will live long. The author of this book 
opines that Jupiter should be regarded for Saubhagya 
of the female. In addition to merits, education, 
nature and personality, popularity etc. whereas 
Mars signifies Vaidhavya. The affliction of Jupiter 
by Mars in the concerning houses may not save 
widowhood even if Jupiter aspects the 8 th house or 
placed therein. 

Principle 52 - Saturn Represents Animals 
In chapter 56 of BPHS, we read in Slokas 12 to 14 

i.e., if Saturn is in debilitation or eclipsed in 6 th , 
8 th and 12 th house, the native sustains loss of 
animals like cows and buffalows and becomes an 
enemy to his relatives. From the above stofca, it 
is evident that Saturn can be a representative of 
animals. In fact being lowest in scale no other 
planet is more qualified to be a representative of 
the animal class than Saturn. In fact Saturn also 
acts for "Species" such as of animals. For example, 
if Saturn occupies the sign Sagittarius in the 6* 
house, then Jupiter lord of the 6 th house would 



Essentials of Astrology 57 

represent a horse . This fact further Indicates 
earning from horses (on races) if Jupiter has an 
intimate relation with the lagna and its lord. 

Principle 53 - Mars and Moon both represent 
blood 

That Moon represents blood is a fact veiy well known 
(see however Jataka Parijata 2-28). Mars also repre- 
sents blood and if afflicted brings about trouble in 
blood, in this connection Jataka Parijata 6-95 repro- 
duced below is relevant. 

oTTcR ^llf^ldftjrl^fci OTgaiTJ^ cKJRrt ^fc[ I 

i.e.. if Mars is in the 7 th house of the birth chart, 
the native suffers from blood and bile troubles. 
Mars-in-8^ house gives piles, fistula and accidents. 

In cases where a planet represents both, it 
naturally becomes strongest representative of blood, 
and if it is afflicted, brings about blood trouble in 
more severe manner. Mars in the sign of Moon, 
i.e., Cancer, makes Moon a pucca representative 
of blood, similarly, Moon in the sign of Mars, say 
Scorpio, lagna makes Mars a pucca representative 
of blood, which of course is polluted, diseased etc. 
if the Moon or Mars as the case may be, is afflicted 
by Rahu and Saturn factors of disease. When there 
is such an affliction of Moon or Mars and Mercury 
too is in any of the lagnas or is lord of any of the 
lagnas and afflicted by Rahu or Saturn, the trouble 
spreads to skin as well and this becomes a case 
of leprosy, leucoderma, eczema, allergy to skin. 

Principle 54 - Moon Lagna 

Candrakalanadi has the following to say in sloka 30 
at page 300 in regard to the Importance and the 
necessity treating Moon as a lagna. 



58 Foretelling Widowhood 

The house occupied by Moon is body, while the 
lagna house like breath, it is by a thorough 
examination of the house with reference to both 
lagna and candralagna then prediction can correctly 
be made. 

This is an important rule and one which is of 
immense in practice. For example, the sign of a 
planet happens to be from both the lagna and the 
candralagna and the lord of that sign is heavily 
afflicted, the yoga will be disastrous for career of 
the man* If on the other hand, it is strong and 
we aspected the man will get rapid promotion etc. 
in life, the idea is that the lord of a particular house 
from lagna assures an added importance and a 
sense of certainty in its act when it is also lord 
of the same. No. of house from the candralagna as 
well. This is of course an actual working of 
Sudarsana (See Rule 42). Mdnasagan paddhati also 
expresses a similar view and says:- 

Q)c\a\ "sfl^sTrS^rarr arras ?tuig£]4R ^Rg?R 1 1 

i,e., in giving effects Moon acts as a seed, lagna 
as a flower, navamsa etc. as fruits and house as 
the taste of those fruits. 

Principle 55 - Plurality 

Mercury is the planet of plurality par excellence. 
The Yoga for twin births is not complete without the 
cooperation of Mercury. This can be inferred from 
the fact that every other planet represents only one 
of the humours but mercury represents all the three 



Essentials of Astrology 59 

of them. From a reading of slofca 49 of Chapter 6 of 
Jataka Pdrijdta given below it is clear that Mercury 
has a special role of plurality to play. 

i.e„ if Mercury is stronger than the rest of the 
planets and is placed in a fcoria house, the native 
will have double face, feet, arms etc. By location 
In the fcoria Mercury will influence the lagna with 
ease and since it will have an effective and 
somewhat exclusive influence on the lagna, its 
quality of plurality will have ample opportunity to 
play its part and make the limb involved more than 
one in number. The Uttar Calamity says that 
Mercuiy represents Qi-yju<£UfjTat, i.e., mixed objects 
which Implies plurality. 

When there Is intimate link between the lagna 
and the 3 rd house, and its signiflcator Mars and 
Mercuty too Is involved In the yoga, the birth of 
twins takes place. For a practical Illustration, 
please see the birth chart with Gemini lagna given 
at page. 

Principle 56 - Medical line 

Sun Is Intimately related to medical line $*MlM ^TPg 
sjpt tt% sjntc £*|R3> is part of Sloka 44 of chapter 
15 of Jataka Pdrgdta and says that medical practice, 
wool etc. are related to Sun. 

Principle 57 - Music and musical instruments 

That Venus represents music Is well known. For 
example, the author of Jataka Pdri/dta says in Sloka 
101 of Chapter 8 as under:* 



60 Foretelling Widowhood 

i.e., Venus in exhaltatlon makes a person indulge 
in luxury, women, music and dancing. 

For exaltation of Mercury, the author of 
Sarvarthacintdmani says in Sloka 2 of Chapter 14 

i.e., the ruling period of an exalted Mercury gives 
eminence, affluence good health, good items of 
wealth in kind, elephants and the hearing of the 
sound of the musical instrument called Mrdanga. 
Thus Venus relates to music proper and Mercury 
to instruments of music. 

Film line is intimately connected with both of 
them and hence these two planets have much 
influence on the lagna of film factors. 

The house of the horoscope concerned in the 
matter of music is the 3 rd as it is 2 nd from second 
and also part of the respiratory canal. 

2 nd house represents speech, sweetness, softness 
or harshness of wife as the case may be. Venus 
and Mercury in 2 nd house gives rise to musical 
throat. The 5 th house must also be well disposed. 
If Mercury or Venus are placed in 5 th house and 
2 nd house is well disposed with beneflcs like Jupiter 
and Moon will be blessed with art of singing. 

Principle 58 - Quickness of results 

Amongst the planets, Mercury is one that is known 
for giving quick results. In regard to this planet, 
sloka 69 of chapter 1 of Sawarthacintamani records:- 



Essentials of Astrology 61 

i.e., Mercury is Jocular, has all the three 'humours 
phlegm, bile and wind, is eunuch and gives its 
results very quickly. If Mercury is lord of a good 
house, such as 5 th or 9 th and is quite strong, it 
will give good luck soon after the start of its dascu 
Similarly if it is badly afflicted say as lord of the 
8 th house, it can cause immediate death. 

Another factor that works for quickness in results 
is the intensity of the influence. If the intensity 
of the influence. If the intensity of the influences 
is comprised of malefic planets, the bad results 
follow quickly. If, however, the intensity is one of 
beneflc influence, the desirable event takes place 
at an early date. For example, much Influence of 
beneflcs on the factors for marriage, i.e., 7 th house, 
its lord and its signlflcator would bring about 
marriage at an early date. 

Principle 59 - Cause of divorce, abdication, 
sannyasa etc. 

Sun, Saturn and Rahu are the three main causes 
for separation, forsaking, leaving etc. this separation 
may take place In the shape of divorce, or abdication 
or sannyasa but it is essentially the result of the 
separative influence of the above noted three planets. 
In regard to Sun, Jataka Paryata &loka 23 Chapter 
16 opines in regard to its location in the 7 th house as 
under: - 

i.e., if Sun occupies the 7 th house of the birth 
chart of women, she will be given up by her 
husband i.e., divorce etc. Rahu and Saturn also play 
the part of severance. Sloka 93 of Chapter 5 of 
Jataka Parijata states that: 



62 Foretelling Widowhood 

zfT^ercrraimifcr mg<H<r<$$i<wjis ai^&^ejcte^ uttctb 1 1 

Jataka Pdrydta, Sloka 93, Chapter 5 

If Saturn is situated in the 9 th house and jupiter 
joins the 3rd house, then both the hands of the 
native are severed same results are observed if 
jupiter is placed in the 12 th house and Rahu in the 
8 th house, i.e., if Rahu, Saturn and Mercury are 
situated together in the 10 th house, the hands are 
severed. Severance, it may be added, is here the 
result of the separative influence of Saturn and 
Rahu on Mercury which stands for the arm. It is 
significant to note that this evil yoga has occurred 
in the 8 th from 3 rd , i.e., the death house of arms. 
Jaimtni Sutra 12 of is more explicit. It says: 

"9lfoiyi££OT yiUOil<$lct c3T3t\ oTCSfr OT I 

i.e. Saturn and Rahu cause bad name and are 
instruments of separation and destruction (of wife 
etc.) Thus the Sun, Saturn and Rahu are instruments 
of separation as distinct from "killing" outright, 
which is the function of Mars and Ketu. This 
statement of Jaimtni Sutra is relevant to old days 
when removal of hands was an important 
punishment for the culprits even at this time, this 
is relevant in various Muslim countries like Saudi 
Arabia, removal of hands is big punishment to 
thieves and dacoits. 

Principle 60 - Strong and weak planets 

Under the following conditions, planets become 
strong and give good results if they are beneflcs for 
the lagna concerned- The good results will of course, 
be mainly in respect of the house in which their 
mulatrikona sign falls. 



Essentials of Astrology 63 

A. When they are in good houses such as* kendras. 

B. When they are In their exaltation, own or friendly 
sign. 

C. When they are near about the middle of the sign, 

D. When they occupy friendly vargas {Sapta varga, 
Sodasa vargcL 

E. When they are farthest away from Sun. 

F. When they are in houses where they get Direc- 
tional Strength {digbala like Sun and Mars in 
10 th house, get full digbak$. 

G. When they are aspected by benefics. 

H. When they are located with benefic planets. 

I. When they are surrounded by natural benefic 

planets. 

J. When they are retrograde. 

K. When they are well placed from lagna (2 nd , 4 th , 
5 th 7 th > 9* 10 ih or H th from it) 

L. When they are well placed from the main dasd 

lord. 
M. When they are friends of main dasd lord. 
N. When they are in friendly naksatras. 

When planets have the traits opposite to those 
listed above, they give bad results i.e.:- 

a) When they are located in bad houses such as 
6 th , 8 th and 12 th . 

b) They are in inimical signs, 

cj When they occupy the very start (0° - 3° 20') or 
the fag end of the sign {26° 40^ 30° 00'). 

d) When they occupy inimical vargas. 

e) When they are in the same sign as the Sun and 
particularly they are within their respective 
degree of combustion {12, 17, 13, 11, 9 and 15 
from Moon to Saturn respectively); 

f) When they occupy a house opposite to the one 
which they get directional strength. 

g) When they are aspected by maleflcs. 



64 Foretelling Widowhood 

h) When they are located with a malefic planet 

i) When they are surrounded by malefics. 

j) When they occupy bad houses from lagna, i.e., 
3 rti 6 th ( 8 th or 12 th 

k) When they are enemies to the main dasa lord. 
1) When they are badly placed from the main dasa 

lord, 
m) When they occupy inimical naksatras. 

Some of the more important points noted above, 
have been Incorporated in the following Slokas 2 
and 3 of Sarvarthacintamani Chapter 16. 

CJ&<^loo!l(Dlu(tflfcte aigUfrlcft Q\ldW § 6\ \ zWQ $l SR*^3Jg8l 

i.e. planet technically called in Gocara or transit 
always gives good results in its ruling periods when 
the transiting planet is one which is not located 
in 5 th , 6 th , 8 th or 12 th house as Moon or its own 
position. It is not eclipsed by Sun but is located 
in his own, exhalted, mulatrikona or friendly sign. 

Principle 61 - Factors Enhancing Value 

The lord of the 2 nd and I I th house are not only in 
themselves factors that denote by their strength the 
abundance of wealth, these are also factors that 
enhance the value of the person, or thing that they 
influence by their association or aspect. This point 
has been brought out by Sloka 89, chapter 4 of 
Sarvarthacintamani as under: - 

.a^TcTT^T^rerfalJcr "CTT ^ TT^t^tST^ET 0)lc?A TOT 



Essentials of Astrology 65 

i.e., if the lord of the 2 nd and the 11 th houses 
are associated with the 4 th house, the lord of the 
4 th house or with the significator of the 4 th house 
(Mars=property), is in vaisesika arhsa and is under 
the aspect of good planets, the man possesses very 
valuable house. The value is aptiy awarded by the 
lord of the 2 nd and 11 th houses. These houses being 
of finance and gains respectively, denotes value. 
People with Aquarius as their ascendant can benefit 
immensely by this fact as Jupiter the significator 
of finance himself becomes lord of two houses of 
finance (2 nd and 11 th ) and thus triply represents 
value. If Jupitor in such cases is strong and aspects 
the house and the significator of any object, that 
object will be enhanced much in value. In Leo 
nativities Mercury becomes the lord of the 2 nd and 
11 th houses and as such, is a factor for value like 
Jupiter. When in a Leo nativity Mercury and Jupiter 
both have combined influence, their enhancing 
quality is obviously increased especially for Leo or 
Cancer ascendant. This is very important factor 
which should be understood properly for accurate 
application and correct predictions. 

Principle 62 - Basis of Determining Benefic or 
Malefic Nature of Planets 

Benefics and malefics criterion for Indian Astrology 
has two types of planets:- 

(a) Natural (b) Conditional 

natural type and the conditional type each have their 
own separate benefic and malefic planets. The two 
types are explained below: - 

Natural benefics and malefics 

Jupiter and Venus are natural benefics* Sun, Mars, 
Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are natural malefics. 
In natural condition, i.e., without reference to any 
particular lagna, Moon is treated as benefic provided 



66 Foretelling Widowhood 

it is not within 72 degrees from Sun in distance. If it 
is,. whether in the dark or bright fortnight, it 
considered and acted as malefic. Mercury when 
acting alone is a beneflc. If with malefics, it becomes 
a malefic, with benefics, it is of course a benefic. 
Rahu acts like Saturn while Ketu acts like Mars. 

Conditional benefics and malefics 

Planets lord of the l at , 4 th , 7 th and 10 th houses of the 
horoscope cease to be natural benefics or malefics 
as the case may be. The lords of the trines, I.e., 5 th 
and 9 th houses whether they are natural benefics or 
natural malefics always give good results. Lords of 
3 rd , 6 th and 1 1 th houses give bad results. Lords of 2 nd 
and 12 th houses gives the results of the house in 
which their sign other than the one in these houses 
falls. In the cases of Sun and Moon owning one sign 
only, becoming lords of the 2 nd or 12 th house they 
give the results dependent on their strength and the 
influence they are under the house etc. In which 
placed. The lord of the 8 th house is considered as 
bad. 

Note: In the above analysis, the lord of the 1 1 th 
house has been declared as a malefic. In our 
personal view, the badness is intended to refer to 
health- As far as finances are concerned, the lord 
of the 1 1 th house gives good results, unless of course 
it is weak. 

In regard to the conditional planets, the rule for 
finance is that if a particular planet is benefic for 
a particular lagna, the stronger it is the better and 
useful the results. If such a planet is weak and 
afflicted, it gives bad results and the more it is 
afflicted the worse the results. If, however, a planet 
is malefic for a particular lagna and Is strong the 
stronger it is the more harmful it becomes. If such

a malefic planet is weak and afflicted, It gives good 
results and the more It Is afflicted the better are 
the results. 

Principle 63 - Aspects 

In Indian Astrology, every planet aspects the house, 
sign or planet placed 7 th from it. In counting the 7 th 
place, the house in which the aspecting planet is 
located is also taken into account. The following 
planets, in addition to having the above noted 7 th 
aspect have the following special aspects. Mars 
aspects the house etc. placed 4 th and 8 th from it. 
Jupiter aspect the house etc. 5 th and 9 th from it. 
Saturn aspects the house etc. placed 3 rd and 10 th 
from it 

a) Rdhii and Ketu have also aspects like Jupiter 
i.e. these shadowy planets aspect the house etc. 
placed 5 th and from them. 

b) In the case of aspect by Rahu and Ketu, it should 
be kept in mind that they also throw along with 
their own influence or the influence of the 
malefic planet or planet with whom they may be 
associated or under whose Influence they may 
be located. For example, if Rahu and Mars are 
located in the 6 th house, the 9 th aspect of Rahu 
on the house of weak will convey to that house 
the influence of Mars as well. Similarly if Rahu 
is located in the 6 th house and Mars is in the 3 rd 
house or the 12 th or 11 th , the influence of Rahu 
on the 2 nd house will be also include the influence 
of Mars by whom Rahu is aspected. 

c) A planet located 10 th from any house etc. throws 
Vk its normal aspect on the house. This aspect 
may be called kendra aspect (square aspect). 



68 Foretelling Widowhood 

in this connection, please see the following sloka 
No. 3 of chapter 26 of BPHS {Brihat Parasara Mora 
Sastra) 

rn^j^OT ua^eifecT ueieufetf "Wer cTETT I 

i.e., planets have one fourth aspect or influence 
on 3 rd and 10 th house from them, half on those 5 th 
and 9 th from them, 3/4 m on 4 th and 8 th from them 
and full on the 7 th from them. 

Principle 64 - Dispositors etc. 

Planet situated in good or bad conditions in a house 
or sign gives good or bad effects to the house over 
which the planet concerned has lordship. But these 
effects will further be modified by the position of the 
planet who in turn is the lord of the sign occupied 
by them. For example, if Sun is lord of 5 th house in 
any horoscope and is in the 7 th house, it would be 
considered weak by virtue of its occupying the 
debilitation sign. But if Venus lord of the debilitation 
sign of Suri is in turn located in Aries, Sun would be 
considered as strong because of this placement of 
Venus in his exhaltation sign. This means then that 
the lord of the sign occupied by any planet works as 
the planet. We can thus say that:- 

If the sign or signs of a planet are not occupied 
by any planet, it would give the results good or 
bad in accordance to its lordship as a conditional 
planet for the lagna involved. If however, one of its 
signs is occupied by a planets, it would give the 
results good or bad of the planets occupying its sign. 
If both of its sign are occupied by planets, it would 
give the effects of the. planets who have more affinity 
of traits with it.

Principle 65 - Malefic Planets in Trines 

It has been our experience that natural malefic 
planets Sun, Mars and Saturn when located In the 
5 th or 9 th house of the horoscope lose much of their 
strength, say about 1/3* of it For example, it has 
come in our experience that Saturn in its sign of 
exaltation, is not conducive to the longevity of the 
person in whose lagna its sign Aquarius falls. This 
is apparently due to the fact that In such cases, 
Libra the exaltation sign of Saturn falls in a trine 
from Aquarius. The above view is borne out by Mdna- 
sagari Paddhati which, for example says in regard to 
the location of Saturn in the 5 th house. 

i.e., Saturn in inimical sign makes one bereft of 
son and wealth and one is unhappy. He gets one 
son only if Saturn is in its own sign or sign of 
exhaltation or in a friendly sign. The word 'gsft* lends 
support to the view that it is not merely the traits 
of the 5 th house that suffer, here but also those 
of Saturn as signiflcator. 

Principle 66 - Mental deficiency 

Mental deficiency is caused by the affliction of Moon 
and Mercury located in Kendra, Vide &loka 18 of 
Chapter 6 of Jataka Paryaia ^sfef^f #*lft§ira>?r 3T 3fari$T£tft 
im^ti m^\ Why has the condition of their location in 
Kendra been imposed is an interesting question* The 
answer is that planets by their location in Kendra 
influence the lagna. When the said affliction will 
influence the lagna too, directly another factor 
standing for brain will be involved in affliction, 
lending, weight to the onset of the disease. We will 



70 Foretelling Widowhood 

see in the case of study of the sixth house that a 
condition of the location in kendra was imposed there 
too. Moon and Mercury represents the emotional and 
rational powers respectively. The fourth house is one 
of emotions and the first and 5 th of rational thinking. 
Thus a complete Yoga for mental derangement or 
lunacy would be formed only when all these factors 
are involved. That is why we have opened thus in 
Horn Sataka— 

•fldF, TTqRfr % (>4cjtil 
"cra^9TOT^ I I 

d\cj>c\ \ u \ -er^T strat dafwiRbff er Sftzrfr 1 
■stfrar "Sflt^rrc^rur^ cfur otsst <6o<hx\ jtu ^ 1 1 

i.e., the fourth house and Moon denotes the emotional 
side of man. Mercury and the 5 th house denote the 
rational faculties of man. When both the emotional 
and the intellectual faculties of man are shocked, 
disturbed and reduced, lunacy results. That is the 
reason why when these factors are afflicted by malefic 
planets (by association or aspect) madness comes to 
be in evidence. 

Principle 67 - Planets in Lagna and Disease 

In regard to the location of Mercury in lagna, lagna 
is considered body as a whole. Lagna in its broad 
sense includes the Sun lagna and the Moon lagna. 
Due to this representative character of lagna and to 
the fact that lagna stands for "Self, any planet that 
happens to be located in lagna fully represents the 
tissue of which it is the signiflcator. For example, 
Mercury which stands for skin, if afflicted in a place 



Ess enttals of As trology 7 1 

other than lagna, would no doubt denote some trouble 
In skin but the assertion to that effect can not be 
made with any measure of certainty. On the other 
hand, if Mercury is afflicted while located in lagna, 
it can be said with certainty that it would bring about 
trouble in skin, the reason being that Mercury in 
lagna assumes a wider role which skin has in body. 
The disease called leucoderma arises from affliction 
If Mercury satisfies the above condition, i.e., when 
it is suffering in any of the three lagnas. The principle 
applicable to Mercury as explained above, may 
applied to other planets. For example, if Mars is In 
lagna and is weak and afflicted by Rahu and or 
Saturn, the person is likely to suffer through muscles 
and blood trouble and so on. 

The sign In the lagnas too represent their respective 
limbs more effectively than in any other house. This 
is evident from the following sloka No. 49 of chapter 
60 of Jataka Parijata— 

i.e., If Moon occupies her own sign (Cancer) in 
the ascendant and is aspected by Saturn and Mars, 
the man becomes "hunch backed". Similarly if there 
Is the sign Pisces In the lagna and is aspected by 
Saturn, Moon and Mars, the man becomes lame. 
In the first case the sign Cancer in lagna represents 
fully the chest: which it normally stands for, and 
by affliction gets it bent. In the second case the 
sign Pisces, comes to lagna and gives full 
representation to feet for which it stands and hence 
by affliction brings about lameness. In short, the 
Idea is that feet suffer In such a case more severely 
than would have been the case, had Pisces been 
afflicted anywhere . else than in lagna

Principle 68 - Aristorcratic factors 

Sun and Moon are called <Mhft, i.e., Royal planets. 
In modern times, the term can be interpreted as 
referring to people high up in social and political 
spheres - the aristocratic class as a whole. Any factor 
that would be influenced by them would be infused 
with their aristocratic or royal character. Thus the 
status of that factor will be boosted. For example, if 
the 7 th house is influenced by Sun and a strong Moon, 
the wife or husband as the case may be, will come 
from a family enjoying high financial status. &loka 
43 of chapter 28 of Saravali given below, runs in the 
same strain — 

tt^uyicHcHeiic/ii ^ufcT^jcrt i?wuii agftfrd i at I 

i.e., Venus if located in the sign of Moon (Cancer) 
and well aspected by Sun, makes the wife as active, 
with a pure body, a princess, ambitious and rich. 
Wife coming from a royal family or a family very 
high in power and pelf is thus due to the influence 
of royal planets Sun and Moon on the significator 
of wife* Astronomically, seventh aspect of Sun on 
Venus is not possible. What is intended is the 
influence of Sun which must be there on Venus 
in order to make wife royal or aristocratic. 

Principle 69 - Longevity 

The longevity of a person has to be determined by 
the strength of both his first and 8 th house 
Veda the following sloka No. 4 of chapter VII of 
Sarvarthacintaxrmnlr- 

' aifcJJaoai!) W d^ddo^ ^fcfi^^fa "S?J$lf$kWr|<t I 



Essentials of Astrology 73 

When the lord of the lagrxa and that of the 8 th 
house are together in 6 th or 12 th house and are well 
aspected, they confer long life etc* authors have 
dealt with the first and the 8 th house separately 
and held these as houses of longevity. In regard 
to longevity vis-a-vis the first house, the author of 
Scuvarthacintamarii says in sloka 107 of the second 
chapter— 

i.e., when the lord of the ascendant is strong and 
not influenced by maleflcs and Is on the other hand, 
located in kendra and aspected by beneflcs, it 
removes danger of death and brings about very long 
life and bestows on the native many good qualities 
and great wealth. Thus the house of life and death 
being the first and the 8 th house, the nature of 
influence exerted on these houses and their lords 
indicates the mode of death, its cause etc* the 
following slokas are relevant in this context — 

if Moon and the lord of the lagna are located in 
or associated with the sixth, eighth or twelfth house 
of the horoscope and are afflicted by Saturn, Mandi 
or Rahu, then death in miserable manner should 
be predicted. The idea is that the manner of the 
affliction of lagna and Moon gives a hint in regard 
to mode of death.

mother and dies —

From the 8 th house of the horoscope, should be 
decided the question of life and death* the rectum, 
mode of death food, service, venereal disease and 
dishonour. 

Principle 70 - Traits of first house 

The first house of the horoscope is designated by 
many terms, one of which is janma* i.e., birth. This 
name is veiy appropriate as the very first event that 
happens to the soul with its advent into this world 
is his veiy birth. Astrology has therefore, associated 
birth and all things intimately connected with birth 
with the first house, the lagna or ascendant. The 
place at which a birth takes place, i.e., whether it is 
in air, on earth, below earth, in water etc. is 
considered and decided by a study of the first house. 
For example, the author of Devakeralam writes in 
slokaNo. 848 at page No. 78— 

<Ha>^1#i0)<?i cHa<£ zXc$ "515 ■srerf&oTcJ, 

i.e., if Saturn Is located in the lagna in the 
navamsa belonging to itself and rahu is with the 
Moon, the native will be born in a jungle. From 
this slofca it is clear that the nature of the place 
of birth is determined by the nature of the planet 



Essentials of Astrology 75 

influencing the most the lagna and the candra 
lagncL For a birth in a boat or ship, the author of 
Jataka Parijata states in sloka No, 61 in chapter 3 — 

~<AQo\ TJlciuib^xT^Tsftr X3TT tfo^ chddl'cIT "CT^Tcf I 

i.e., if there is a watery sign (4, 8 or 12) in the 
ascendant and Moon aspects the same from seventh 
house, the Yoga indicates birth in a boat. Here also 
the same principle has been applied. 

In fact the principle is very wide in its application 
and we can say that whatever is governed by 
conditions at birth or whatever that is had by 
persons from birth, such as stature of the body, 
caste in which one is born, etc. is all determined 
by a study of the influences being thrown on the 
lagna and the candralagna. 

The first house of the horoscope is the quintes- 
sence of the whole horoscope. It has such major 
roles as longevity, wealth, health, honour and 
position. When therefore, first house get strength- 
ened, these qualities are boosted. There are differ- 
ent ways in which this house may get strengthened. 
One is when a beneflc planet occupies. It, another 
is when a benefic planet aspects it, another is when 
benefic planets surround it, i.e., one occupies the 
12 th and the other the second house of the horoscope 
yet another is when natural beneflc planets are 
located in the sixth, seventh and eighth from it. 
The last case goes by the name of Lagnadhi yoga. 
Moon too is treated as lagna hence here is repro- 
duced a sloka 42 of chapter VI of Phaladipika 
extolling the. qualities of the lagna when boosted — 



76 Foretelling Widowhood 

i.e., If natural benefics occupy the sixth, seventh 
and eighth house either from the lagna or Moon, 
Rqjayoga is created. If the benefics are in ordinary 
strength, the man becomes a leader of men, if in 
medium strength, a minister and if in high strength, 
the Yogas makes the man a king, i.e., a person 
holding real ruling powers. 

Principle 71 - Dasd Bhukti 

A. If Saturn and Rahu are conjoined together, the 
prosperity and success will be promoted much 
during the period of the stronger planet out of 
the two. 

B. If Rahu or Saturn are conjoined with a 
yogakaraka planet, the dasd will be excellent 
and the native will attend much progress during 
the dasd bhukti of these malefics. If Saturn is a 
yogakaraka there,, the major or sub period of 
Saturn will be veiy promising. 

C. If Rahu falls in Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, 
Scorpio, Sagittarius or Pisces, anywhere in the 
horoscope, that will certainly bless the native 
with one or the other good results at least. 

D. Any planet placed at 30° of the sign. Occupied 
by it, will certainly create obstacles problems 
and troubles during its dasd bhukti 

E. If Mars is conjoined with a debilitated planet, 
the good effects of Rahu will be curtailed and 
the malefic effect of the debilitated planet will 
be enhanced. 

F. Sub period of a planet should be divided in three 
equal parts. The planet will exhibit the results 
of the house and its position in the l Bt one third 
part. It will give the effects of the sign occupied 



Essentials of Astrology 77 

by 2 nd part and in the last part of its dasd, the 
planet will show the results of aspects. 

Principle 72 - Navarhsa 

The first house may also be boosted through the 
navamsa, i.e., when the navamsa sign In the lagna 
Is the same as the lagna. Such a lagna Is called 
vargottama lagna and has been extolled In sloka 6, of 
chapter 9 In Sarvdrthacintamarti — 

T§j9t udffcia ores* 3r&T3en3r w ^r^ar^; 

I.e., a birth should be considered lucky or fortunate 
where the lagna is ucupottama, or where a natural 
benefic planet occupies the second house from the 
sun, or where the kendras first, fourth, seventh and 
tenth houses In a horoscope are not vacant, or 
where there is karaka yoga, I.e., where planets in 
exaltation or in their own signs and located in 
mutual kendras and also in kendras from the 
ascendant. All the four situations, It would be 
observed become conducive to the lagnas In one way 
or the other. Hence the Importance of the lagna 
can not be Ignored. 

Principle 73 - Planets Aspectlng Own Signs 

Any sign that Is aspected by its lord or is associated 
with It and Is also Influenced by association or aspect 
by natural benefic planets and has ho influence on 
It of any malefic planets denotes the prosperity of 
the traits and characteristics of the house In which 
It Is located. This is supported by the following sloka 
No. 1 of chapter 1 1 of Jataka Por^ata— 

iX 3r 9TCJT f^T3H3R^FF "OfSrife "Sig^T (ftftlcll T3T, 



78 Foretelling Widowhood 

Following sloka from Brhad Hora Parasara may 
also be quoted In this reference. 

■sjtre^roif "sMJiriij^r cR^nfi^xr t^r 

ftfT^fteOT olcrcHc?! U4?d<?l HTl 

The Importance of this sloka is the same as above 
with the additional proviso that this principle is 
true in regard to both the natal and the horary 
chart. 

We present this principle to the reader with the 
highest recommendation. It will be found applicable 
to all prominent personalities whatever their walk 
of life. In case where the said principle Is applicable 
to the ascendant and the candra lagnas (the sign 
occupied by Moon at birth) it confers greatness as 
would be illustrated in the body of the book. We 
may, however, add in this connection that when 
it is a case of a natural maleflcs such as Mars 
or Saturn aspectlng Its own sign any where while 
it may and does enhance the social and financial 
status of the person concerned, it is not conducive 
to the life of the person etc. represented by the 
house so aspected. 

Another point that we would like to add is that 
when under the above rule a house is aspected etc* 
by its lord, the benefit of such an aspect or 
association goes not only to the house so aspected 
but also to the house where in the other sign of 
the planet . concerned Is located. For example, if in 
the case of a Scorpio nativity, Mars lord of the 
ascendant is located in the 12 th house from it where 
it aspects its own sign Aries located in the sixth 
house, the benefit goes not only to the sixth house 
but also to the first house where the other sign 



Essentials of Astrology 79 

Scorpio of Mars is located. 

Sarvarthacintamani is more explicit on the point. 
Here is sloka No. 2 of chapter 2 thereof— 

■error ^rflf 9iUtfiucidocif^&igeW§jui ^r^s "spSSs Tgjsrarftr 

i.e., Any house that is conjoined to or aspected 
by a natural beneflc planet, that happens to be its 
lord and is influenced by association or aspect by 
natural beneflc planets, gives best results, provided 
it is not influenced by association or aspect by a 
natural malefic planet. When any house is con- 
joined to or aspected by a natural malefic plaAet, 
who is its lord and is similarly conjoined with or 
aspected by natural beneflcs also gives best results, 
provided of course that the planet so aspecting is 
not its enemy, eclipsed or otherwise very weak. 

Principle 74 - Lagna and Life 

The lagna not only denotes infancy and the very early 
age of man, it also indicates life as a whole, or the 
entire period of life- Here is sloka 2342 of 
Devakeralam— 

i.e., if the lord of any lagna is exalted In its 
highest degree in the 9 th house and is also aspected 
by Jupiter, the native is rich throughout life and 
is never in want. 

Sarvarthcucintamani in sloka 94 of chapter II stresses 
the same rule when it says — 



80 Foretelling Widowhood 

i.e., If there is a beneflc planet in the lagna and 
another beneflc aspects it, but there Is no malefic 
influence on the lagna, the native enjoys comforts 
throughout life. If on the other hand, there are more 
than two malefic influences on the lagna (without 
any beneflc influence) the entire life of the native 
is miserable. These principles show how intimately 
the question is related to the strength of the lagna 

Principle 75 - Children 

If Cancer sign falls in the 5 th house and Jupiter Is 
placed there, one will beget daughters only; if Saturn 
occupies the 5 th in Cancer, male children will be 
bom. Mercury in Cancer in 5 th gives few sons and 
placement of Moon in 5 th house In Cancer gives more 
daughters and less sons. For this, following sloka of 
Jatakadesa marga may be referred — 

Principle 76 - Things made alien by sixth house 

The 6 th house of the horoscope does not merely stand 
for ones enemies and the traits of enmity, it also 
stands for the, trait of alienness, i.e., not belonging 
to us, foreign etc. For £xample,stofcaof JatakaParijata 
freads as under— 



Essentials of Astrology 81 

If the lord of the 4 th house is strong and well 
aspected but Is either with or aspected by the lord 
of the 6 th house and the horoscope belongs to a 
lady, she gets a son from a person other than her 
husband. If the horoscope belongs to a male, he 
does not get a son even if he marries many women. 

Alluding to birth Jataka Pan/dta says Illegitimate 
in sloka 68 of chapter 12 - 

"3TTg dldlft ^^Y^faR^ <-W olid art | 

i.e.. If the lord of the 4 th . 9 th , 1 st and the 6 th are 
together any where the birth should be considered 
as bastard. The cause for such a birth is of course, 
the association of the foreign element denoted by 
the lord of the 6 th house with factors for self, 
mother, father (I s1 , 4 th and 9 th houses respectively). 

Principle 77 - Present, Past and Future 

Time is indefinite. Human birth Itself is what gives 
it a start and creates the Illusion of time, hence we 
take the first house, i.e., the house of birth as the 
"present". In order to have a triangular conception 
of time, we have the triangle constituted by the 1 st , 
5 th and 9 th houses of the horoscope, where 9 th stands 
for the past, for It represents a point In time that 
has long p^st the horizon, i.e., the present, the 5 th 
stands for the future for it represents a point, i.e., 
sign which has still to rise In the eastern horizon 
[lagnd). While dealing with the traits of the 5 th house 
Uttarakalamrta has said — 

oTlaTT WT33T TT^T U<£lcJI fa^faccl ^f f£ra?Tr Cb<Hlct 

Chapter 5 slofca 8 



82 Foretelling Widowhood 

i.e., 5 th house relates inter alia to much coveted 
affairs, immense work, paternal property and fore- 
sightedness, which implies that the 5 th house is 
related to future. It is in recognition of this fact 
that "speculation business" (sa#d) is associated 
with 5 th house. The ability to read the future of 
man is also accordingly associated with this house. 

For the 5 th house from Moon of Jupiter Manasagari 
paddhati says — 

i.e., a man has supernatural vision if Jupiter is 
located 5 th from Moon. The vision is of course the 
ability to be quick to sense the future. 

Principle 78 - Foreign Travel 

The 8 th house of horoscope is concerned, inter alia, 
with overseas journeys. While dealing with the 
nature of events connected with the 8 th house location 
of Moon, the author of SamarthacintamaijLi states in 
sloka 29 of chapter 13. 

i.e., during the ruling period of Moon when she 
is situated in the 8 th house, there is emaciation 
of body (Moon being a lagna factor stands for body) 
fear of drowning (both the 8 th house and the planet 
Moon are wateiy in nature and the 8 th is house 
of destruction), travel to foreign countries (being 
journey overseas), opposition to all (Moon stands 
for the masses as a signiflcator and is located in 



Essentials of Astrology 83 

a very bad house), eating third rate dishes (Moon 
being related to eating and 8 th to badness) and 
trouble to mother and relatives like mother (Moon 
is signiflcator for mother). Some people associate 
foreign travel with the 9 th house which is really 
a house of long travel within one's own country, 
for Saturn located in the 8 th house Manasagari 
paddhati has in sloka 8 of chapter II said "^llcrd^ 
"fcpssfcr, i.e., one goes and stays in foreign land in 
trouble. 

Principle 79 - Scantiness and dearth trait of 6 th 
house 

The 6 th house by its association with others through 
Itself or through its lord, brings about reduction, 
want, dearth, scantiness, restriction etc. to the traits 
with which it is associated, sloka 76 of chapter 6 of 
Jataka Parijata is relevant In this context and reads 
as under — 

i.e., if Venus and lord of the 7 th house (both 
represent wife) are located in the 6 th house, the 
yoga renders wife stirile. Similarly if the lord of 
the lagna. In company of the lord of 6 th and Saturn 
is located in kendra or koria the man gets impri- 
soned. We thus see that the 6 th house reduces the 
functions of the party with which it is associated. 
When associated with representative factors of wife 
It has reduced considerably, her power as a woman 
to procreate and when associated with lagna it has, 
In collaboration with another factor for reduction, 
reduced and restricted the movements of the body 
leading to "imprisonment". Thus 6 th house and its 



84 Foretelling Widowhood 

lord act as restricting influences. Parasara also 
expresses the same principle when it says in 24- 
63 of Brhat Pdrdsarahord Sastra — 

i.e., when lord of the 6 th house goes to the 3 rd 
house of valour it makes the man devoid of valour* 

Principle 80 - Marriage relates to 2 nd house 
as well 

Normally we examine the 7 th house of the horoscope 
in connection with problems relating to marriage. 
But the 2 nd house of the horoscope is also relevant 
to the question of marriage particularly to the ques- 
tion of the time of its coining about as the second 
house is the house of "family" and a family of one's 
own is created only with marriage. In this connec- 
tion, sloka No. 60 of chapter 6 of Sarvdrthacintdmani 
states as under — 

i.e., if in the 2 nd and the 7 th houses of the 
horoscope there are vargas of benefic planets 
(decante, navamsa and other similar division are 
called vargas) and If these houses and their lords 
are associated with or are aspected by benefics, 
the man gets married in a very early age. Parasara 
too has made a similar statement In sloka 24 of 
chapter 16 BPHS as under — 

i.e., if Venus is in the 2 nd and lord of the 7 th 
house is in the 11 th , the man generally marries in 



Essentials of Astrology 85 

his 10 th or 16 th year of life, i.e., early in life. In 
passing it may also be added that the cause of early 
marriage in the above case has been due to the 
participation in the yoga of the lord of the 1 1 th house 
- the house of gains or acquisition. 

Principle 81 - Cinema 

Representation of Brhat Pdrdsamhora Sdstra 
chapter 24 sloka 113 iinks "pleasure" to the 5 th 
house. This work and sloka 24 of chapter 2 of Jataka 
Parijata hold that the planet Mercury has a special 
relation to "pleasure resorts". Thus by a combina- 
tion of Mercury and the 5 th house we can have such 
modern pleasure resorts as the cinema, the clubs 
the circus and the like. For example, if the sign 
Gemini of Mercury is located in the 5 th house, the 
5 th house may be considered as a cinema and its 
relation to other factors in the birth chart inter- 
preted accordingly. The sloka of BPHS referred, to 
above is as given below — 

i,e., when the lord of the 10 th house occupies the 
5 th , the native is very well educated, always in 
happy mood, wealthy, and blessed with sons. The 
word hya - is noteworthy as signifying Itself as one 
of the chief traits of the 5 th house. The other sloka 
runs as under — 

aigiyjlfoioieii ufrttcLdi diluifoiGidiufe -**kp 

It is meant that place of frequent resort of Sun 
is a temple, of Moon a wateiy place, of Mars where 
fire is mostly in evidence, of Mercury a place of 
.intellectual enjoyment or playing etc.

Principle 82 - Loss of wealth by Govt, orders 

The 10 th house represents the Govt, the 12 th house 
being 3 rd from the 10 th would therefore, represents 
the arms of Govt., i.e., means of execution of the 
intentions of Govt, thus the 12 th house of a horoscope 
represents the orders of Govt., which if adversely 
effect the 2 nd house may mean loss of wealth through 
Govt, orders, i.e.. as a measure of punishment etc. 
in this context sloka of Sawarth<M;intamaniis relevant. 
It reads in part as under — 

TJSrtn^t aoT9TR3R& yM<*U£|<6. 03T8RB 

i.e., when the lord of the 12 th house is located 
in the 2 nd house one may lose wealth as a punishment 
awarded by Govt. 

For the same reason, the lord of the 8 th can 
perform the functions of the orders of the Govt, as 
the 8 th house is 11 th from the 10 th and constitutes 
the 2 nd arm of the Govt, in fact, just as the 1 st , 
3rd 10 th and 1 1 th houses are the houses representing 
the deliberate actions of any person, in the same 
maimer the P\ 3 rd , 10 th and 11 th house of the Govt, 
would represent deliberate action by Govt, these 
houses in the case of Govt, would be 10 th , 12 th , 7 th 
and 8 th houses respectively from the main horoscope 
of the native concerned. 

Principle 83 - Prediction through definition & 
correlation 

Prediction in Astrology gets facilitated if we can 
translate the problem under consideration into 
astrological factors and then proceed to examine each 
of those factor* For example, in cases of lunacy or 
mental derangement, we know that this disease 
results from the derangement of brain as well as 
through the shock to the emotional side of our being. 



Essentials of Astrology 87 

We have, therefore, to examine such factors in the 
birth chart as stand for the emotions and the brain. 
Now the brain is represented in astrology by the first 
house, its lord, the 5 th house, its lords and the planet 
Mercuiy. Similarly emotions are represented by the 
4 th house, its lord and the planet Moon. Thus when 
the factors enumerated above are afflicted, lunacy 
results. 

The author of Jdtaka Pdrydta puts the same thing 
in essence when it says in sloka 81 of chapter 6 — 

i.e., the native will suffer from lunacy if Mercury 
and Moon (brain and emotion respectively) are 
located in kendra but without any benefic influence 
on them. 

Principle 84 - Factors for darkness 

The following sloka No. 70 of chapter 3 of Jdtaka 
Pdri/dta enumerate the factors that represent 
darkness — 

If Moon is in the signs (10, 11) or the navamsa 
of Saturn or is located in the 4 th house from lagna, 
or is aspected by Saturn, or is located in watery 
signs (4, 8, 12) or is situated with Saturn anywhere 
in the horoscope, the birth should be declared as 
having taken place in darkness. If three or more 
planets occupy their sign of debilitation, the birth 



88 Foretelling Widowhood 

takes place on earth (and not on bed). Thus the 
following are the factors of darkness. 

a) The sign of Saturn, 

b) The 4* house. 

c) Saturn. 

We can, of course consider a fourth factor In the 
form of Rahu who acts always like Saturn. The term 
darkness here has a symbological significance and 
may denote incognito conditions of man or conditions 
where he remains In darkness as seen by the general 
public. 

Principle 85 - Masses 

The mutual link, in any manner, between the lords 
of the first house (self) and the 4 th house (masses) 
Indicates an interest In masses, i.e., in the country 
of birth. It Is thus a Yoga for patriotism and is present 
in the horoscope of all patriots. For example Sardar 
Patel, famous architect of free India, a Cancer 
nativity, had lord of 4 th In 4 th . He had lord of 4 th 
house from Moon lagna linked to the lord of the said 
lagna. Akbar the great, a great lover of his country 
and its people* had an exalted Mars in the 4 th house 
and Saturn lord of the 4 m located in lagna with the 
lord of the lagna (ascendant) who squares the 4 th 
house. Haider All, another great patriot had Libra 
as his ascendant. Saturn lord of his 4 th house was 
aspecting the 4 th house while Venus lord of the 
ascendant was in his fourth house. Bal Gangadhar 
Tilak, another patriot of first water* had Venus lord 
of the 4 th house located in Cancer in the ascendant. 
Similarly Dr. Rajendra Prasad, first President of India 
had Sagittarius as his ascendant with the second 
sign of Jupiter falling in the 4 th house. His Jupiter, 
the lord of the 4 th house was aspecting the ascendant. 



Essentials of Astrology 89 

Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, with Cancer as his 
ascendant had his Venus lord of the 4 th house in 7 th 
thereby aspecting the ascendant. He had also an 
exchange between the lord of Moon lagnaand that of 
the 4 th house from it. Shri Jawaharla! Nehru, first 
Prime Minister of India had a Venus in dignity in 
Libra in the 4 th house and Moon as the lord of 
ascendant placed in Cancer itself 10 th from it, thus 
creating an intimate link with the 4 th house. 

Principle 86 - Charitable deeds 

The 9 th house Is the house of religion and high 
thoughts and therefore of charitable deeds. The lords 
of the 10 th house and 11 th house of the horoscope are 
equally the houses of good and charitable deeds. The 
following authorities are relevant In this context — 

i.e., 

(1) If the lord of the 9 th house Is in the varga called 

siinhasana and is aspected by the lord of the \agr\a 

and is also aspected by the lord of the 10 th house, 

one Is a great philanthropist, 
(ii) If the lord of the 9 th house occupies the 4 th , the 

lord of the 10 th house is In a kendra, and the 

lord of the 12 th house is aspected by Jupiter one 

is a great philanthropist, 
(ill) If the lord of the 1 1 th house Is located in a kendra 

house one is a great philanthropist. 



90 Foretelling Widowhood 

We should, therefore, treat the lords of the 9 th , 
10 th and 11 th house as conducive to good and 
charitable deeds. 

Principle 87 - Sub and main period lords 

The planet having its sub period in the vimshottari 
das a system, should always be considered as 
influencing for good or for bad, the planet having its 
main ruling period, irrespective of the fact, whether 
the sub-period lord actually influences in any way 
the main period lord. This principle is born out by 
authoritative texts. For example, the following siofca 
No. 23 of chapter XVI of Sarudrthacintdmani may be 
referred to in this connection — 

ch$\Q\ ffrgcr ?raf <&(&m auricr^diyrfl 

i.e., during the main ruling period of Sun located 
in the 10 th house and the sub ruling period of a 
beneflc planet there is ever lasting fame and also 
acquisition of ruling powers. In SawaHhacintdmani 
VXI-6 we again read — 

i.e., during the sub period of a malefic planet 
in the main period of the planet, that is the lord 
of the day of birth located in the 2 nd house (wealth) 
one has loss of wealth, harshness of speech, mental 
worry, eye trouble and much fear. It would be noted 
that the author has nowhere stated in the siofca 
that the planet havings its bhukti should in any 
way influence the planet having the main ruling

strongly as evidenced by the results stated.

Principle 89 - Houses and their affairs 
Houses are the imaginary divisions of the earth cre- 
ated by super imposition of the zodiac on it through 
the ascendant, i.e., the sign rising in the eastern

The houses are evolutionary in conception and deal 
with all affairs of life. Some of the more important of 
which are given below — 

First House - Conditions at birth, such as the 
nature of the place of birth, the body as a whole, 
the limbs of the body individual, colour of the body, 
stature of the body, longevity, honour, self, sex of 
partner, brain, wealth, means of livelihood, wife of 
the eldest brother of father, husband to the eldest

ration, luxury, enjoyments of bed, sleep, orders of 
the govt, defence department, temple or places of 
worship, the career of public, wife of the younger 
brother to mother, husband to younger sister to 
mother, imprisonment, spy. 

Principle 90 - Sandhis or junction points 

Just as a turning point on roads is dangerous to life, 
just as the period of transition from puberty to youth 
is fought with danger to character, just as the public 
transit from slavery to freedom involves danger to 
life, just as the turning away of one season and 
coming up of a new is full of possibilities of disease, 
similarly the interval between the termination of one 
sign and the start of another is dangerous to the 
realization of the traits of the planets in these 
junction points. The author of the Phaladlpikd has 
gone even to the length of saying — 



94 Foretelling Widowhood 

i.e., if a planet even if it be located In its sign 
of exaltation, in its own sign, or the sign of a friend 
and having all the six types of strengths, would 
be without any results, if it is located at the 
junction point. For the above reason, a planet 
located at a point where both sign and a naksatra 
terminate simultaneously such as the end of signs 
Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces, would be still more 
dangerous for planets particularly Moon to occupy. 
These 3 points are called gandas. The reason is 
obvious for in such a contingency the planet is not 
able to act in accordance with the traits of the 
proceeding sign nor with those of the coming one. 
It is, as if it is in a no man's land. 

Principle 91 - Educational attainments 

Even in texts, there is confusion in regard to the 
house to be considered for academic education. Some 
are of the opinion that it relates to the 2 nd house, 
others opine that the house of education is 4 th , while 
there are still others who hold that 5 th house is the 
house of education. We are in favour of the 2 nd house. 
Authors who have stated the 4 th as the house of 
education have also mentioned the 2 nd house also as 
one of education. The author of Phaladipika is most 
clear and explicit on the point. He says in XVI-5. 

TSffWTtfd "S}-lf6lc|Qf<fl"ilu(c1crll eft m oi) TTOTR STTff 



Essentials of Astrology 95 

i.e., if Sun is located with the lord of the 2 nd house 
of a horoscope, one is capable of doing good to the 
public. He also earns wealth and education. If, 
however, the lord of the 2 nd is located with or is 
under the influence of Saturn, the native gets very 
little education and of a low type too. 

Principle 92 - Fourth house as birth place 

The fourth house is generally treated by people as 
one's residence, which of course, it is. But it is also 
the place of birth like the lagncu On this point, the 
author of Phaladipika observes in sloka 14 of 
chapter XVI— 

i.e., if the lord of the 4 th house occupies any of 
the bad houses, 6 th , 8 th or 12 th , alongwith Sun and 
Mars or if Sun and Mars are located In the 4 th 
house, the house in which one is born is a burnt 
one. If Sun as the lord of lagna is located in the 
4 th house and if Moon aspects it from the 10 th house, 
the yoga indicates that the person is born in the 
house of his mother, i.e., in her parent's house. 

Principle 93 - Moon in 6 th house - danger to life 

While dealing with the question of arista, i.e. danger 
to life in infancy, authors like Varahamihira and 
others have stated that Moon by occupying certain 
houses of the horoscope and being weak therein 
brings about death in infancy. These houses are 1 st , 
5 th , 7 th , 8 th , 9 th and 12 th . The list makes no mention of 
the 6 th house which is also dangerous for Moon to 
occupy. Moon in 6 th house if weak and afflicted may 
not kill one in infancy but certainly It is strong factor 




96 Foretelling Widowhood 

for shortening life considerably. In this context, see 
the following sloka from Jyotisatattva — 

<£i&iicii£i ai^r 

i.e., If the planet Venus is located in the 7 th house 
and Moon in the 12 th house, the Yoga takes away 
life of wife. The life of wife is obviously endangered 
here by the 6 th position of Moon from the 7 th house 
and its significator. 

While dealing with Moon's positions in various 
houses, the author of Saravall says the following 
for the 6* position of Moon— 

i.e. if Moon is in the vicinity of Sun and is in 
the 6 th house, one is very short-lived. 

The author of Jdtaka Parijata has said the same 
thing in chapter 8, £toka 75 - 

Principle 94 - Sudarsana - an illustration 

Jupiter, Venus and Mercury are throwing their 
combined good influence on the 5 th house. The 5 th 
house is moreover not aspected by any malefic planet 
and yet there is the true statement of the subject in 
regard to suffering of a chronic nature. What is the 
answer of Astrology? Sudarsana is the answer. Let 
us see, lord of 5 th from lagna is Mercury. Lord of 5 th 
from Candra lagna is Jupiter and lard of 5 th from the 
Surya lagna is Venus. All these 3 planets are located 
under the strong aspect of an exhalted malefic Saturn 
and that too as the lord of the sign occupied by two 
maleflcs, Sun and Ketu, it was thus as a result of 



Esseni&ils of Astrology 97 

the affliction by the disease giver Saturn of the lord 
of the 5 th house from all the three lagnas that this 
chronic trouble came into existence. If you examine 
the problem merely from lagna alone, you are sure 
to fail, as then you are likely to think that since 
both the 5 th house and its lord is under the influence 
of Jupiter and Venus there should be no trouble in 
the belly. Thus Sudarsana teaches us to have an 
integrated view from all lagnas. 

Principle 95 - Cordiality 

There are two main rules for determining cordiality 
between two relations as seen from the horoscope of 
any one person. The first rule is that if the lord of 
the house of the relation concerned Is strong and so 
also is the Significator of that relation, there will be 
cordiality between the subject and his relation 
involved. For example see the following — 

i.e., if the lord of the 9 th house from lagna is full 
of strength (by house position, sign position, as- 
sociation aspect etc) and so also is the karaka, i.e. 
Significator of father (Sun) the subject will be 
obedient to his father. 

The 2 nd rule for cordiality is that the two planets 
involved should not be located in 6 th , 8 th position 
from each another or the lagna etc. the following 
sloka No. 28 from chapter 20 of Phaladipika is 
relevant* 



98 ForeteVdng Widowhood 

i.e., a planet that is enemy to the planet having 
its main ruling period, or is located in the 6 th house 
or its enemy of the lord of lagna, will turn even 
the best of friends into enemies in its sub period 
and there is great fear of not only enemies but also 
of losing honour. 

Principle 96 - Jupiter and illegitimate birth 

From a perusal of the following sloka No. 6 of chapter 
5 of Brhatfdtaka, it would be seen that Jupiter has a 
substantial role in determining whether a particular 
birth is real or an illegitimate one. 

15T ddtflQicr^ W dj^fel^STct of "OFT "SJSt^ 

yfauilotfcHldlciat 

dMUIUClTlb'dfcJI 3^l5£rofT ^7#?f UoJUl oTTct UCJI<$fa<1 

i.e., when in the horoscope of a person, the lagna 
and the Candra lagnas are not aspected by Jupiter 
or if Sun and Moon are located together but are 
not aspected by Jupiter or if Sun and Moon are 
in the same sign with Saturn and Mars, the birth 
should be, declared as from some one other than 
the known father of the native. It seems the 
influence of Jupiter on Sun and Moon (factors of 
birth and representatives respectively of father and 
mother) is a legalizing and validating influence that 
makes a birth real. It is, therefore, stated in the 
above sloka that without such an influence birth 
becomes illegitimate* 

But in actual life, we see that a birth is 
illegitimate in spite of Jupiter's influence on the 
lagna factors stated. However, Mercury does play 
a vital role in illegitimate birth of a person, as 
Mercury is also illegitimate child of Moon. 



Essentials of Astrology 99 

Principle 97 - Rahu's aspect-an illustration 

Rahu and Ketu - the shadowy planets throw their 
influence or aspect as it is called on the house etc. 
located 5 <h and 9 th from them. Here Parasara opines 
in this content — 

i.e*. J?dhu and Kefu have full aspect on 5 th , 7 th 
or 9 th houses and half on second and tenth. Based 
on the above principle and on the shadowy nature 
of these planets* we have stated that the shadowy 
planets also convey the effects of the planets under 
whose influence they are situated. 

Principle 98 - Separative nature and planets 

When a king loses his kingdom or abdicates, when a 
person leaves his home and hearth and becomes a 
sonny as in, when a divorce takes place hetween the 
wife and the husband, there is always evidence in 
the birth chart, of influence of a 'separative* nature 
being exerted on the houses concerned. We have 
observed in Horasalaka — 

Chaya Atmqja Pangu Divakaresu Khet Dveyo Disati 
Yatra Njj Prabhavam Nunam Prathakta Visayadhi 
Tasmat Dasrne Yathah Raja Nyasam Ahuh. 

Translation: Out of Rahu, Saturn and Sun, when 
two or more planets throw their influence on a 
house etc, the native is separated from the traits 
of that house. Just as, if Rahu and Saturn are 
aspecting the 10 th house (and it's lord) one has to 
lose his kingdom or job. The principle of "Separa- 
tion" illustrated above is of universal applicability. 
In the field of health and disease, when we find 
that the 6 th part of the kala puru$a, Le., the 6 th 



1 00 Foretelling Widowhood 

house, it's lord, the 6 th sign (Virgo) and its lord 
(Mercury) are all afflicted through association or 
aspect, by Saturn and Rahu, one suffers from 
Hernia, which is obviously a disease wherein the 
intestines (represented by the 6 th part of the 
Kalapurusa) are dislo cated , i.e., separated from 
their normal location, in the human system. 

Principle 99 - Element of Houses 

The lord of the first, fifth and the ninth houses are 
generally fiery in nature because these houses are 
of that nature. 

The lord of the 2 nd , 6 th and the 10 th houses 
represent the 'earthly' qualities. The lord of the 3 rd , 
7 th and the 11 th house represent 'air' and those of 
the 4 th , 8 th and the 12 th houses represent *water\ 
If, however, these houses are occupied by any 
planet, the lord thereof will represent the element 
of the planet in occupation, and not the nature of 
the planet that is the lord of the house. For 
example, Ketu and Mars are situated in the 12 th 
house in Pisces, then the lord of the 12 th house, 
i.e., Jupiter, according to the normal rules stated 
above stands for 'water', being lord of a watery 
house, but in this case, it will not act as water 
but will act as 'fire 1 , since it will carry the effects 
of the firy planets-Ketu and Mars which occupy the 
sign of Jupiter in the 12 th house. It is thus clear 
that when a fiery planet occupies a fiery house 
containing a fiery sign, such as Mars and Ketu 
located in Aries in the 5 th house, it's lord will 
represent 4 fire' in many capacities and as such will 
cause much harm to the house etc. it may influence. 



Essentials of Astrology 1 01 

Principle 100 - Karmic control theory 

One of the most important dimensions of astrology 
is karmic control theory of planets. As per Hindu 
astrology, Rahu and Ketu are shadowy planets which 
play significant role in predicting one's destiny. 
According to Hindu system of astrology, a planet can 
get modified by it's ownership of a certain house or 
it T s placing in the birth chart. Why can't lords of the 
houses occupied by Rahu and Ketu be considered in 
predicting one's fortune. In Hindu mythology, destiny 
of a person in the present life is sum of his past 
karmas (good or bad) and actions in the present life. 
As a matter of fact, Rahu and Ketu acts as a vacuum 
tube connecting unknown past karmas and the 
known present or Rahu and Ketu bridge the gap 
between the previous form of soul to the present 
soul structure. 

in the domain of karmic control theory, astrologer 
must pay proper attention towards modification, of 
astrological predictions, Karmic control planets are 
nothing but dispositors of Rahu and Ketu or lords 
of the houses occupied by Rahur-Ketu. Ketu is the 
inlet point for past karmas, the planet ruling the 
sign of Ketu is called the incoming or past life karmic 
control planet. The planet ruling the sign of Rahu, 
controls the Karmic distribution in present life, that 
is why, it is known as karmic distribution planet. 
The karmic control planets imparts strong effects 
on the destiny of native depending upon their 
location in the birth chart and aspects they make 
with other planets. The aspects made by the karmic 
control planet to other planets are of utmost 
importance in the karmic understanding. 

As per oriental text of Hindu astrology, if the 
karmic control planets are together, they will make 



1 02 Foretelling Widowhood 

the native great even if no other planetary 
combination is present to form any Yoga* If this 
Yoga produced by karmic control planets is afflicted, 
the person born will still be great, but this 
combination will destroy the person also. Another 
important known observation is that whenever any 
planetary configuration has given rise to a Raja 
Yoga and if this YogOy in one way or the other is 
associated with karmic control planet, the power 
of this Yoga will get boost-up many times but if 
this yoga is afflicted, the native will still be great 
but he will be destroyed also due to his karmic 
destiny. Besides this, if Rahu and Sun are in 
conjunction, considerable personal elevation of the 
native is indicated wherever the combination is 
located in the birth chart. 

Principle 101 - The 12 th house 

The planet Venus feels very happy in the 12 th house. 
This is contrary to the general rule which says that 
a planet in the 12 th house becomes weak and causes 
harm to the traits it represents. Why is Venus strong 
and happy In the 12 th house? The answer lies in the 
fact that the traits of the 12 th house and the planet 
Venus are similar and complementaiy. Both Venus 
and the 12 th house represent bhoga or enjoyment 
and luxury. Due to this affinity, Venus in the 12 th 
house is strong. Hence people in. whose horoscopes 
Venus Is placed in the 12 th house in a friendly sign, 
have generally long living wives. That the planet 
Venus gives good results by it's location in the 12 th 
house is the opinion of the authors of Bhavartha 
Ratnakara and Uttara Kaldmrta These authors also 
hold the view that the location of Venus in the 6 th 
house too causes affluence. Here also the reason is 



Essentials of Astrology 103 

the same, viz., the affinity between Venus and the 
12 th house, which it would aspect by being situated 
in the 6 th house. 

Principle 102 - Influence of planets 

Any house, sign or planet is considered to be under 
the influence pf a planet placed tenth from it. The 
nature of influence of course will depend on the fact 
whether the planet in 10 th place is benefic or malefic 
in nature. This type of kendra influence should always 
be given due* consideration, in addition to the usual 
examination of the planetary aspects. The planetary 
aspect are explained below. 
L Every planet aspects fully, I.e., throws its 

influence on the house, sign or planet placed 7 th 

from it. 
II. Jupiter, Mars and Saturn throw their influence 

in the manner indicated in (I) above. In addition 

they have their special aspects as under. 

a) Jupiter aspects fully the house, sign or 
planet placed 5 th or 9 th from it. 

b) Mars aspect fully the house, sign or 
planet placed 4 th or 8 th from It. 

c) Saturn aspects fully the house, sign or 
planet placed 3 rd or 10 th from it. 

Aspects of planets are of utmost importance in 
astrology as these have enormous modifying influ- 
ence. 

Principle 103 - Debilitated Planets 

Debilitated (ntca) planets give bad effects In regard 
to the element for which they stand. For example. 
Sun and Mars are "fiery" in nature and when 
debilitated, set limbs on flre. Venus and Moon are 
"watery" in nature and when debilitated bring in an 
element of liquidity in the limb which they afflict. 



104 Foretelling Widowhood 

For example, a debilitated Moon in the fifth gives 
"pleurisy", Jupiter through its debilitation associates 
swollen condition in the trouble. Similarly Saturn 
brings in an element of pain, Mercury through its 
debilitation brings about trouble involving many 
complications. 

Principle 104 - Malefic becomes strong 

Benefic planets Jupiter, Venus, Mercury are weak 
in 3 rd and 6 th houses where malefics become strong 
by location. 

Principle 105 - The sixth house 

This is an evil house and indicates miseries, 
problems, deaths, enmity, ailments and grief. The 
6 th house is 9 th from 10 th and 10 th from 9 th , therefore, 
the 6 lh house governs the future prospects and 
promotion in the professional career of a native. 
Whenever the 10 th or 6 th lord occupies the 6 th house, 
one earns his livelihood through service and not by 
business. Promotion, extensions, suspension, 
demotion and termination should also be judged from 
6 th house in addition to 10 th house. The 6 th house is 
also called the house of service, therefore, the 
prospects of service come under the control of 6 th 
house. 

Principle 106 - The 8 th House 

The 8 th house is the most misunderstood house as it 
is dealt for the matters connected with deaths* The 
8 th house is the house of mysteries, similar to Scorpio 
sign. The 8 th house governs legacy, i.e., inherited 
property through will of any person. The relationship 
of the 4 th and 8 th house show gain of property through 
legacy. Hidden treasure kept under the ground should 
also be judged from the 8 th house if 2 nd and 5 th house 
also support. The 8 th house is 11 th from 10 th and 10 th 



Essentials of Astrology 1 05 

from 11 th , therefore, accomplishment of elevated 
ambitions comes under the control of 8 th house. It 
has been observed in the horoscopes of various 
class 1 officers, IAS, Chairman, Managing Directors, 
Ministers, GM's secretaries, that Is the 8 th house 
plays a prominent role in the Judgement of their 
profession. The 10 th house has an Influence of the 
8 th lord or the 8 th lord occupies the 10 th lord. As per 
general principles of astrology, 10 th house should be 
spoiled if 10 th lord occupies 8 th and 8 th lord occupies 
10 th . But it Is Just opposite owing to reasons 
mentioned above> The 8 th house also controls the 
crowd and masses. Mr. S.Kannan, the popular 
research oriented scholar of astrology has 
emphasized a lot over the 8 th house in his various 
articles published in The Astrological Magazine of 
Bangalore. The 8 th house 12 th from the 9 th house, 
therefore, it controls foreign travels also* Death of 
father should be judged from the 8 th house and 
mother's death should be judged from 3 rd house* 
Placement of the lord of the lagna in the 8 th house is 
not adverse for longevity until unless it is" aspected 
by malefics. If 8 th house is strong in bkavabala, the 
native will live long. 

Principle 107 - Maraka 

It Is believed that lord of 2 nd and 7 th house are maraka. 
The death is the last phase of life and if 1 st house 
denotes childhood then the 12 th house should rule 
the death. In my experience, I have found that 12 th 
house has a prominent role in causing one's death. 
The 8 th house governs the longevity, then the 12 th 
from 8 th , i.e., the 7 th governs death. Similarly, as per 
the principle of Bhavat Bhavasru the 8 th from 5 th , i.e. 
the 3 rd house rules longevity. The 12 th from 3 rd house 
is the 2 nd house which rules death. So the 2 nd house 
is a maraka, the 7 th house is stronger maraka and 



1 06 Foretelling Widowhood 

the 12 th house is strongest maraka. 22 nd DesaKana 
signifies the source of death. 

Principle 108 - Saturn's Mahadasd 

An important rule of dasa that the 4 th dasa from 
birth will be adverse provided it is Saturn's 
mahadasd. It means that if the birth has taken place 
during the major period of Mars, then the major 
period of Saturn will be bad as it is 4 th dasa from 
Mars dasa This rule needs further research in my 
experience of about 35 years that this principle does 
not hold good. I have found that the natives born in 
Mrgasira, Citrd or Dhanistha, enjoyed the major 
period of Saturn if Saturn was well fortified 
and strong. 

Principle 109 - Lords of Triangles 

If lords of triangles conjoin in the ascendant or 10 th 
house, one earns great name, fame and fortune 
provided the conjunction is unafflicted. 

Principle 110 - Lords of 6 th and 8 th house 

If lords of 6 th and 8 th house are maleflcs especially 
for Gemini and Cancer ascendant and conjoin in 
the ascendant, the 6 th or 8 th unnatural end of life 
may come In evidence before 36 th year of age pro- 
vided the conjunction is unaspected by benefics. 

Principle 111 - Lords of angles/triangles 

If lords of angle are placed in triangle or vice-versa, 
that gives good results even if they are malefic or 
benefic. If the lords of angles are placed in angles or 
if the lords of triangles are placed in triangles that 
does not give good results. Irrespective of the fact of 
their being malefic or beneficln nature. 



Essentials of Astrology 107 

Principle 112 - Jupiter in the 7 th House 

Placement of Jupiter in the 7 th house should not 
always be appreciated. If Jupiter falls in the 7 th house 
in watery sign in Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, that brings 
disaster in married life, the wife or husband may 
not have a real or Intimate feeling with spouse. 
Partner may leave or run away or may even expire, 
exactly depending upon other planetaiy combination. 

Principle 113 - Profession 

The judgement of native's profession is mostly 
examined from the 10 th house only. The lord of 
navamsa occupied by 10 th lord usually signifies the 
nature of occupation but this is only a supplementaiy 
principle. Planets placed in the 10 th house and 
navamsa lord occupied by them also has a lot to do 
one's profession. The 2 nd house and its lord do play a 
significant role In examination of vocation. The 1 1 th 
house is also Important for the confirmation of the 
job undertaken by the native. 

Principle 114 - Mangall dosa and cancellation 

It is said by sages that Mars causes mangall dosa if 
it is posited in the 1* 2 nd . 4 th , 7 th , 8 th and 12 th house. 
However, mangall dosa will not exist if Mars occupied 
always be appreciated. If Jupiter falls in the 7 th house 
in watery sign in Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, that brings 
disaster in married life, the wife or husband may 
not have a real or intimate feeling with spouse. 
Partner may leave or run away or may even expire* 
exactly depending upon other planetaiy combination. 

Principle 115 - Effective kuja dosa 

We have observed that Mars harms the married life 
and to the spouse in the horoscope of males if its 
influence is there in 7 th house. Therefore, placement 
of Mars in the 12 th , 1 st , 4 th and 7 th house in a male 



1 08 Foretelling Widowhood 

nativity brings havoc in conjugal bliss in male 
nativities. Males should be treated mangall if Mars 
is placed in any of these houses. A female native 
will be mangali if Mars influences the 7 th or the 8 th 
house because the 8 th house represents happiness 
and span of married life in addition to the life span 
of husband. Placement of Mars in 1 st , 2 nd , 4 th , 5 th , 7 th , 
8 th and 12 th house will make a female mangall Here 
our observation about the placement of Mars in 5 th 
house in female horoscope is quite negative in respect 
of her married life. She may suffer loss of husband, 
divorce or miserable married life. We have penned 
an article about the role of Mars in 5 th house for 
females in The Astrological Magazine and have also 
written a chapter on it in my exhaustive book on 
marriage named Predicting Marriage, 

Principle 1 16 - Condra mangala and guru rnangala 

A common belief among us is that aspect or 
conjunction of Jupiter or Moon with Mars nullifies 
mangall dosa but it is not correct under our 
observation. We have studied innumerable 
horoscopes and our humble observation in this regard 
is just opposite to the general view. We have also 
written various article on the subject that conjunction 
or aspect of Jupiter or Moon with Mars enhances 
the intensity of kuja dosa Mars gets exalted where 
Jupiter is debilitated and Mars gets debilitated where 
Jupiter is exalted but they are mutual friends. 
Similarly, Mars is debilitation in the sign of Moon 
and Moon is debilitated in the sign of Mars, what 
kinds of friends they are? Mars gets exalted in 
Saturn's sign and Saturn gets debilitated in Mars's 
sign Aries. Mars has a peculiar relationship due to 
its very complicated nature. After examination of 
hundreds of horoscopes, we have observed that kuja 



Essentials of Astrology 1 09 

dosa gets enhanced whenever Mars is posited in the 
sensitive houses and is under the influence of Jupiter 
or Moon either by conjunction or by aspect. There 
had been lots of controversy about the subject in the 
columns of the letters to the Editor In The Astrological 
Magazine and finally the most famous astrologers 
like Dr. P.S. Shastri, Mr. H.R. Shanker, Mr. K.N. 
Rao and Dr. Nimai Banerjee etc, accepted and 
appreciated this observation of Mars and Jupiter, 
Mars and Moon whole-heartedly. 

Principle 117 - Sun and Saturn 

Sun and Saturn are father and son but they are 
ideal enemies. They are reverse in nature in most of 
the respects. The Sun is exalted In Aries while 
Saturn is debilitated there and vice-versa. Sun rules 
East, Saturn rules West. The Sun is king and the 
Saturn Is servant and so on. Mr, H.N. Katve who 
should be honoured like Varahamihira of present era, 
has revealed an astonishing fact about relationship 
of Sun and Saturn, He has specified in his classical 
work sani-vicara about the relationship of the Sun 
and Saturn by association and opposition. If a native 
has the combination of Sun and Saturn in his 
horoscope, the progress of his father will be heavily 
checked after the birth of the child, If the Sun is 
weak and Saturn is strong. In case if the Saturn is 
weak and Sun is strong, the Sun will not be able to 
progress, prosper, or promote his professional career 
and financial aspect so long as his father Is alive. In 
fact, if the Sun and Saturn are conjoined or placed 
opposite to each other about 180° apart, the native's 
who are father and son in birth, were bitter and 
strong enemies in the previous births. They fought a 
lot in the earlier birth. In such a case, one will have 
to face defeat. The nature has arranged that the 



J JO Foretelling Widowhood 

native who was defeated, will gain from the fortune 
of the other person by becoming his father and son. 
This is an automatic adjustment by the nature. The 
native who born in the previous birth will lose his 
fortune or his son or father will take his fortune and 
will progress. In many cases, the father snatches 
the fortune of son and prospers a lot. In other cases 
soon after the birth of son, downfall or even the death 
of father takes place because he had troubled his 
son (in the previous birth) veiy much and the son 
will snatch the fortune of his father* The son will 
prosper and the father will be ruined. 

Principle 118 - Career 

For the judgement of profession, the nature of the 
ascendant and its lord, the position of the Moon and 
the strength of the 6 th house of service should also 
be taken into account. A beneflc in the 6 th or lord of 
lagna or the 10 th in 6 th usually indicates that the 
native is destined for service. For smooth service 
career, lords of lagna and the 10 th should be on 
friendly terms with lord of the 6 th , otherwise due 
recognition of one's ability is not forthcoming from 
one's boss or employer. Again, a planet in the 10 th or 
the 10 th lord receiving the aspect of a beneflc denotes 
uncommon ability for successful administration and 
management. Mercury rules intelligence and Jupiter 
intuitive insight. When these planets are well 
disposed in a horoscope, the native is intelligent and 
efficient. 

Principle 119 - Occupation and planets 

The following combinations by aspect or by 
conjunction related to the 10 th house give rise to 
specific means of livelihood. 



Essentials of Astrology

These combinations get modified according to the 
benefic aspects they receive. 

Again the position of the lord of the 10 th is worth 
considering, especially in its relation to lagna or 
to another benefic aspecting it. If lord of 10 th is 
placed with 9 th lord, the native earns through 
writing. If lord of 10 th is in 9 th with Ketu and 
aspected by Jupiter, the native earns through 
religious and spiritual preachings. If lord of 10 th 
is in 11 th with Mars, the native earns through 
scientific pursuits. If lord of 10 th is with Saturn, 
the native earns through hard toil and even 
asceticism. If lord of 10 th is in 9 th house or with 
Mercury, the native earns through writing. If lord 
of 10 th is with lord of 9 th and Mercuiy, the native 
earns through writings on astrology. 



Essentials of Astrology 113 

If lords of 4 th and 9 th are in the 10 th house, and 
lord of 10 th is in 11 th house, the native earns through 
big business and manufacturing of goods* (The 
nature of the commodity differs in keeping with the 
characteristics of the planets aspecting 10 th house). 

The importance of lagna and its lord and their 
relative position to 10 th house stabilizes a native's 
source of income. Lord of 10 th in lagna or aspecting 
lagna definitely brings luster and distinction to 
one's career or means of livelihood. Again, if lord 
of 10 th is exalted and aspects lagna or is posited 
in 10 th house, it is an important factor in ensuring 
smooth means of livelihood, involving less struggles. 

Principle 120 - Promotion 

How to judge the prospects of promotion in a 
horoscope? The house concerned with promotion is 
the 10 th . Strong planets in the 10 th house have their 
say in matters of professional prospects. While 
examining the 10 th house, the following factors 
should be kept in view:- 

1. Lord of the 10 th house. 

2. Lord of the sign occupied by the lord of the 10 th 
house, 

3. Planets in the 10 th house. 

4. Planets aspecting the 10 th house or its lord. 

5. The position of the Sun in the horoscope, 
especially its association with the 10 th house, 
since the Sun is indicator of professional 
prospects. 

6. A powerful Sun in the 10 th house is a clear 
indication of rise in one's career. 

7. Lord of 10 th is to be counted from lagna, from 
Moon, from Sun and from 6 th house, the house 
which indicates service. 

The position of the 6 th house is also to be taken 
into consideration. 6 th house is the 10 th house from 



114 Foretelling Widowhood 

the house of fortune, the 9 th house. Moreover, an 
excellent Rcga Yoga in the horoscope bearing on 10* 
house or 6 th house is in the invisible hemisphere. 
Its connection with the lord of the 10 th , the visible 
house, brings a native's service prospects into 
limelight and prominence. For sudden supercession 
and professional gains, lord of the 10 th and the 2 nd 
conjoin in a kendra and the. 6 th house is strong, 
1 . Lord of 6 th exalted, lord of 10* in 1 1* along with 
lord of the 9 th house. 

2. Lord of 6 th aspecting 6 th , lord of 10* aspecting 
10 th and a powerful Raja Yoga present in the 
horoscope. One touches the highest post in one's 
field, 

3. Lord of the 10* or 6 th from Moon aspected by a 
benefic and the presence of 3 planets in 
kendras. 

4. Lord of 10 th in 10* lord of 6 th in 6* and lord 1 1 th 
or 2 nd aspecting 10 th house. 

5. Lord of 10 th aspecting 6 th house, lord of 6 th house 
aspecting 10 th house and lord of 11* aspecting 
10 th house. 

6. Lord of 10 th in 10 th , lord of 9 th aspecting 10 th 
house and lord of 6 th in 2 nd or 1 1* house. 

7. Lord of 10 th aspecting 10 th house, lord of lagna 
aspecting 10 th house and lord of 11 th in 9 th and 
9* lord strong. 

8. Lord of 10* in 1 1 th with lord of 6* and lord of 9* 
or 2 nd in 6 th . 

9. Lord of 10 th in 10 th , lord of 6 th exalted in lagna 
and lord of 9 th in lagna aspecting 9 th or 10 th 
house. 

10. Lord of the 10 th in 9 th , lord of the 1 1* in the 10* 
and lord of the 6 th aspecting the 6 th . 

1 1 . Lord of the 10 th in the 9*, lord of lagna, 2 nd and 
the 1 1 th in the 10 th and lord of 9 th aspecting the 
6 th house. 



Essentials of Astrology 115 

12. Lord of the 9 th in 9 th house; lord of the 10 th in 
10 th house and lord of the 6 th aspecting the 6 th 
house. 

Sudden promotion by supersession 

1. Lord of the 10 th house in combination with lord 
of 2 nd , lord of 6 th aspecting 10 th house, and lord 
of a trikona in 10 th house. 

2. Lord of 10 th in 11 th , lord of 9 th , 10 th and togna

of 9 th in 10 th , lord of 11 th and 6 th aspecting 10 th 
house. 

4. Lord of 10 th in 1 1 th or 2 nd , lord of 6 th and 10 th in 
association either by aspect or conjunction. 

5. Lord of 9 th aspecting 10 th house and lords of 6 th , 
2 nd and 1 1 th combine in a kendra or receive the 
aspect of a powerful benefic. 

6. Lords of 9 th and 10 th in the 10 th house, lord of 
11 th aspecting the 10 th house, lord of the 10 th 
from 10 th house aspecting 9 th house, and lord of 
the 6 th too aspecting 10 th house. 

7. Lord of the 10 th in the 9 th , lord of the 9 th in the 
2 nd , aspecting the 9 th house or 10 th house, lord 
of the 6 th in iagfna and lords of 2 nd and 1 1 th are 
in the 10 th . 

Principle 121 - Time and duration of mental ills 

Mental tensions and ailments appear. - 

1. When malefic planets transit over the natal Sun 
or Moon or lagna lord. 

2. When malefic planets in their transit afflict the 
6 th , the 8 th or the 12 th lord. 

3. When Saturn aspects the radical Moon or Sun 
or vice-versa in transit. 

4. When lord of lagna in transit has its connection 
with the 8 th or 12 th house or its lord. 



116 Foretelling Widowhood 

5, When Mars or the Sun passes over natal Rahu 
or vice-versa, 

6. When what rules, the Moon, Mercuiy, Saturn 
and Nodes occupy houses of their fall or their 
inimical signs. 

Principle 122 - Sudden gains 

Sudden gains are possible through speculation, 
lottery, race, buried treasure and prizes and awards. 
We give below some of the combinations of sudden 
gains— 

1. If lords of 10 th and 2 nd combine in a kendra 
(angle) or trikona {trine). 

2. If lords of 2 nd and 1 st reckoned from the lord of 
2 nd is in kendra (angle). 

3. If lords of 2 nd and 1 1 th are in a kendra* 

4. If benefics occupy 3, 6, 10, 1 1 houses from the 
Moon. 

5. If yogakaraka is connected with 5 th house, 
success in speculation is assured, provided the 
5 th house is strong. 

6. If Jupiter is strong and connected with the 5 th 
house as well as the 2 nd house, success in 
speculation or gambling is achieved 

7. If lord of lagna is in the 11 th , combined with 
lord of 9 th , and lord of 11 th is in the 2 nd t lottery 
Yoga is formed. 

8. If benefics are in 3 rd , 5 th , 7 th and 11 th houses. 

9. If lords of 2 nd , 9 th , 1 I th are strong and free from 
the evil aspects of 6 th and 8 th lords. 

10. If lord of 1 st or 2 nd is in 10 th , wealth from State 
is indicated. 

Principle 123 - Transits 

The result of transiting planets should be examined 
from radical Moon only and not from ascendant. Moon 
is a planet of timing events. At the time of birth, the 



Essentials of Astrology 117 

rising nak$atra decides the balance dasa bhukti in 
any dasa system and that helps in timing events . 
Thus it is the naksatra which helps in working out 
the major or sub period. Thus Moon is the factor 
whose movement decides the time of occurrence of 
the events. Therefore, timing through transits of 
planets should be considered for their actual results 
from their radical Moon only. 

Principle 124 - 10th Lord and transit of Jupiter 
and Saturn 

If Saturn will cross over the radical location of 10 th 
lord, problems in profession will certainly arise. 
Similarly, if Jupiter will cross over the lord of 10 th 
house, the professional prosperity will be highlighted, 
merits will be recognized and all round success in 
career will come in evidence. It may be noted that 
transits of planets help in working out precise and 
accurate time of events. Transiting planets do not 
give rise to any event which is not indicated in the 
birth chart. Good or bad event will take place when 
a particular planet will transit in a particular sign 
or house- Events will be prominent when vital planets 
like Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu, Ketiu Sun either cross 
the position of any radical planet or opposite to them 
or aspect them in one or the other way. Nak§atra are 
also important in which the particular planet will 
be transiting or the navamsa in which a planet is 
transiting will certainly play a vital role in shaping 
out time of event. This requires lot of practice and 
experience. 

We have given 124 astrological principles of great 
importance to help the readers and especially for 
those students and beginners who face lots of 
confusion in astrological dictums. One can acquire 
immense knowledge of science of astrology of various 



118 Foretelling Widowhood 

fields if he carefully understands these principles 
and apply the same in practical nativities. These 
principles have been taken from various classical 
works, our observations and from the writings of 
great, famous and successful astrologers of our 
country such as Dr. B.V. Raman, Dr. Nimai Banerjee, 
Dr. P.S. Shastri, Mr. KM Rao, Mr. J.N. Bhasin, 
Mr. B.S. Gupta and Mr. Gopesh Kr. Ojha etc. I feel 
deeply obliged to all of them and express my humble 
regards and innumerable thanks. 



Chapter-3 

EARLY WIDOWHOOD : 
AN ASTROLOGICAL EXPLORATION 



Much has been written and experienced by 
sages and modern astrologers about the 
widowhood of females. Mostly position of 
Mars In the sensitive houses where Mars gives rise 
to kuja do?a Is held responsible for such tragedies 
particularly in the horoscopes of females. It is true 
but definitely not absolute. 

Widowhood Is always a setback but if it comes 
soon after marriage or due to accidental or suicidal 
death of husband, this Is extremely bad, giving rise 
to extreme degree of terrible plight and sorrow to 
the native. Here, I want to discuss certain planetary 
combinations for such tragic death of husband soon 
after marriage. Every case has different combination* 
A serious study of all such cases will make the 
observations most accurate and precise. 

Following planetary combinations cause early 
widowhood. The cause of death of the husband may 
either be accident, mishappening, suicide or 
incurable ailment depending upon the planetary 
configurations in the horoscope of female. It Is not 
at all essential that the loss of husband will take 
place with female suffering from kuja do$a. Many 
females may lead a happy married life inspite of

the females were not mangali and they suffered the 
tragic death of their husband. After that I will 
explain the cases of mangali females who lost their 
husbands within a short span of their marriage. 
Prior to it, it will be relevant to quote related 
aphorisms as mentioned in various classics.

Following sioka has been given In Jyott$atattva

has stressed over the placement of malefic planets 
in malefic signs in the 8 th house as that may cause 
widowhood to the female.

The author of Jyoti$anjmva Navanltama mentions 
a few important combination for loss of spouse in 
slokas 90-95. The contents of the slokas are applicable 
in the horoscope of a female that she may suffer 
widowhood if these combinations are present in her

Many more slokas from various classical works 
may also be quoted here to illustrate the planetary 
combinations for widowhood. However, let us 
summarise all combinations of widowhood, which 
are mentioned by sages and have been found most 
authentic. 

Planetary Combinations For Widowhood 

L If the lord of the 7 th house falls in the 8 th house 
with 8 th lord and is conjoined with malefics or 
aspected by malefics. 

2. If the Sun is conjoined with 7 th lord and the 8 th 
lord aspects them with Rahu In the 7 th house, 

3. If Mars occupies the 8 th house with the lord of 
the 8 th house and the lagna falls in malefic 
navamscL 

4. Conjunction of Mars, Rdhiu and Saturn in the 
8 th or 7 th house will give early widowhood. 



J 30 Foretelling Widowhood 

5. If the 7 th house is owned by a malefic planet and 
Is occupied by Mars and Saturn together or Mars 
and Saturn join 8 th house with malefic lord of 
the 7 th house, same results will appear soon after 
marriage, 

6. If the 7 th house and Its lord are hemmed between 
maleflcs and are devoid of conjunction or aspect 
of benefics. 

7. Mars if placed in the 7 th or 8 th house adversely and 
is not Yogakdraka, one should think of widowhood 
provided other combinations confirm It. 

8. If Rdhu falls in the sign of Mars and occupies 
Troikas. 

9. If there Is mutual exchange between the 7 th and 
8^ lord under the aspect of maleflcs. 

10. If the lords of the 6 th and 8 th are associated in 
the 6 th or 12 th house, the loss of husband will 
take place soon after marriage. 

11. If Moon is associated with maleflcs or hemmed 
between maleflcs, one may become widow. If the 
7 th and 8 th houses are afflicted by maleflcs If 
reckoned from Moon, one will lose her husband. 

12. The lord of the iagna and the 7 th lord are 
conjoined with maleflcs along with Venus. 

13. If three maleflcs are conjoined In the 7 th house, 
the female may be the cause of death of her 
husband and mostly due to her extramarital 
affair. 

14. If the 7 th lord Mercury Is posited in the 8 th house 
with maleflcs or under affliction or placed under 
pdpakartari Yoga, the female may manage the 
death of her husband or he may die due to her.

she will lose her husband.

and maleflcs occupy the 8 th house, the native

the 8 lh or 12 th house with maleflcs, one will 
become widow. 

18. If Mars joins 7 th or 8 th and the Sun joins the 
ascendant, there is a possibility of widowhood. 

19. If Moon is posited in the ascendant and Mars

21. If lord of the 7 th house occupies the Troikas or 
any of the lord of Troikas join the 7 th house but 
8 th lord should join the 7 th house and any of the 
combination is under the aspect of malefic or 
associated with malefics, one will lose her 
husband. 

Our Observations Regarding The Subject 

If we program the computer with all these 
combinations and apply to the practical horoscopes 
of widows, only 10% accuracy will be seen. This Is 
so because astrological aphorisms that is the 
planetary combinations as mentioned in classical 
works can not be applied verbatim. Scholars must 
use their intelligence to understand the planetary 
configuration and the action resulting into loss of 
the husband. The correct application of the 
appropriate rules of astrology will certainly enhance 



J 32 Foretelling Widowhood 

the confidence to foretell such a shivering and 
disastrous truth of widowhood. The 8 th house indicates 
the span of married life whereas the 7 th house 
represents all about husband. Jupiter indicates 
saubhagya of a female and Mars is the signiflcator 
of husband. In one way or the other, Moon and Venus 
signify spouse. The blending of these planets and 
houses with their relationships with the concerning 
Bhavas will reveal the truth. 

It is easy to predict widowhood with the 7 th or 
8 th house afflicted by Mars, Saturn or nodes. But 
many times it is not so easy. If there is no planetary 
affliction of the 7 m house or 8 th house or the female 
is not mangall or when Jupiter lends its aspect over 
the 7 th house or Jupiter occupies the 7 th or 8 th house, 
widowhood is not suspected but in practical study 
of horoscope, we have observed that this is not true. 
It Is believed that Jupiter's placement in the 8 th 
house or its aspect over the 8 th house gives rise 
to akhanda saubhagya yoga. In many cases, I have 
found in the horoscope of few widows that Jupiter 
occupied the 8 th house or aspected the 8 th house. 
In the horoscope of Beena and Manju, Jupiter's 
placement in the 8 th house can not be overlooked. 
This needs veiy keen study whether the placement 
of Jupiter in the 8 th house will save widowhood or 
not? Whether astarna guru will bless the female with 
akhanda saubhagya. If Jupiter owns the 7 th house 
and joins the 8 th house in Martian sign Aries and 
Is aspected by Mars, widowhood can not be saved 
by astama guru. Similarly, if Jupiter Is retrograde 
in 8 th in Inimical sign, that may cause widowhood 
even If it is not aspected by Mars, Saturn or RahiL 
I have explained various planetary combinations for 
widowhood with the help of various illustrations. 
I am surprised that many females suffered loss of 



Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 133 

their husband when Jupiter's sub-period or major 
period is operative over them. I will try to conclude 
a few thought-provoking observations regarding 
widowhood in concluding paragraph of this paper. 

A Scientific Analysis And Practical Cases Of 
Early Widowhood 

Widowhood within 5 months after marriage 
(No kuja dosa) 

Case 3.1: (Horoscope No. 1) 

She was born in Cancer ascendant. Yogakaraka Mars 
occupies the 5 th house Scorpio under retrograde 
motion under argotic navamsa. The 7 th house is 
aspected by 7 th lord Saturn who obtains debilitation 
in the 10 th house and the lord of the 6 th and 9 th house 
Jupiter occupies the 3 rd house. Apparently this 
appears to be quite a good horoscope for marriage 
due to aspect of Jupiter and Saturn, the lords of the 
7 th and 9 th house respectively. Here the aspect of 
retrograde Mars on the 8 th house is extremely adverse 
for the life of husband. 1 have tried to establish that 
the placement of Mars in the 5 th house for the female 
natives may cause widowhood. She got married on 
June 24 th , 1994 during sub-period of Mercury in the 
major period of Sun. Jupiter and Ketu are only 1° 
apart. The Bhagyadhipati Jupiter falls close over the 
axis of Rahu and Ketu. She lost her husband in the 
sub-period of Mercury in the major period of Sun on 
November 4 th , 1994. I have explained repeatedly in 
my writings that one should not be married during 
dasa bhukti of those planets who indicate adversity, 
miseries, widowhood, separation and mishappenings 
in married life. Mostly we have found that the 
adversity took place in the lives of those whose 
marriage took place during negative vibrations of 
planets.

Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 135 

In the present case, as soon as the sub-period 
of Saturn in the major period of Sun began on 
May 16 th , 1993, the marriage took place on 
June 24 th , 1994 and within 5 months after marriage, 
her husband was crushed in a road accident. In 
this horoscope Mars and Saturn both aspect the 
12 th house which is 7 th from lagna lord Moon. The 
aspect of Mars over the 8 th house Is damaging for 
the life of husband. The 2 nd house is 8 th from 7 th 
and indicates the death of husband. The 8 th house 
also indicates family life as well. Therefore, the 
marriage and widowhood both took place' during the 
major period of Sun. 

Widowhood took place on November 4 th , 1994 in 
the major period of Sun in the sub-period of 
Mercury, Mercury Is the lord of the 7 th house as 
reckoned from lagna lord Moon. Here Mercury is 
combust and falls in inimical constellation of Roftbfi 
and obtains navdmsaol Mars. Therefore, the husband 
expired during sub-period of Mercury in the major 
period of Sun. 

If we see the horoscope carefully, Mars and 
Saturn are responsible for widowhood, Saturn gets 
debilitated, i.e., falls in Martian sign Aries. There 
are only Jupiter and Ketu who fall in Saturn's 
navarhsa whereas Venus and Mercury both fall in 
Martian navarhsa Aries. Mars also falls in its own 
argotic navamsa. Therefore, the planets who are 
under the influence of Mars can bring widowhood 
In their dasa bhuktl These are Venus and Mercury. 
Mercury Is the 8 th lord from Mars and joins the 
7 th whereas Mercury is 7 th lord from lagna lord Moon 
and Joins 6 th , Therefore, sub-period of Mercury In 
the major period of Sun, from where it is second 
lord, resulted in widowhood. 



1 36 Foretelling Widowhood 

Suicide Of Husband Within 3 Years (No ku)a do$a) 

Case 3.2 - (Horoscope No. 2) 

The native is a daughter of a multi millionaire MP. 
Her marriage took place during Venus-Rahu period 
(March 3* 1993 to November 3 rd , 1996) on March 
6 th , 1996 with a good looking, smart boy. Father-in- 
law was a veiy strict person. He scolded her husband 
on March 8 th , 1999 due to a failure of the undertaking. 
The shock was so deep that her husband committed 
suicide on the same day when she was passing 
through Venus-Jupiter dasa November 3 rd , 1996 to 
January 3 rd , 2000. Thus she suffered widowhood just 
after three years of her marriage date at just 23 
years of age. She was also blessed with a son on 
April 8 th , 1998. Father of the widow girl got a serious 
shock and tried for her second marriage. Finally, 
she got married again on December 8 th , 2000 In 
Venus -Saturn dasa-bhukti. This girl Is also not 
mafigalL Even then, she suffered an early widowhood 
due to following planetary combinations. 

1. Ketu occupies the 8 th house, which is as bad as 
Mars in the 8 th house. Saturn aspects the 8 th 
house, Ketu and Venus In addition to lagna and 
lagna lord Mercury . 

2. She was born in jye$fhd nak$atra 3 rd padcu The 
husband was eldest and the husband was also 
born in jye$tha nak$atrcL Husband and wife will 
suffer heavily by death of either of them, if both 
are born in Jye$Xha naksatrcL 

3. Jupiter occupies the 7 th house In own sign Pisces. 
Whenever Jupiter falls in watery sign in the 7 th 
house, it brings disasters to conjugal life. 

4. Mars who is the 8 th lord, falls in the 9 th house 
from lagna but In the 8 th house from debilitated 
Moon. Thus Mars in 8 th from Moon and Ketu in 
the 8 th from lagna caused the early widowhood.

5, The 7 th lord Jupiter and the 2 nd lord Venus both 
obtain argotic navarhsa which caused first 
marriage and resulted into second marriage as 
well. Hence Jupiter and Venus both are mdraka 
for Virgo ascendant. 

6. Moon-Mars opposition or conjunction is adverse 
for marital happiness. Similarly, Mars Jupiter 
and Saturn-Mars opposition and conjunction as 
aspected on each other spoils conjugal bliss. 

Loss of Husband in Less Than A Year (Not rruzrigafi) 

Case 3.3 (Horoscope No. 3) 

I am illustrating a case of a native who got married 

on May 8 th , 1996 and lost her husband on April 17 th , 

1997 under very tragic circumstances. She was in 

advance way of family when her husband expired 

within a few minutes after coming back from his 

office. In this horoscope, we find that Mars is posited 

in the 10 th house with yogakaraka Venus. The 7 th 

lord Moon Joins the 9 th house under no malefic aspect 

Why did she become the victim of misfortune 

resulting into her widowhood within one year of her 

marriage? This is a complicated case in which even 

a competent astrologer may not be able to predict 

early widowhood. Following observations may help 

us to astrologically Justify the death of her husband. 

1 . Death of husband Is governed by the 8 th house In 

a female nativity. The lord of the 8 th house, the 

Sun occupies the 11 th house in Martian sign 

Scorpio and Saturn's nak$atra anuradhau The Sun 

is under mutual aspect with Saturn who falls In 

Mars nak$atra mrgasird. The mutual aspect of 

Sun and Saturn is always adverse and produces 

malefic effect. Hence both Sun and Saturn occupy 

the nak$atra of Saturn and Mars respectively 

which is a damaging factor in regard to the 

matters connected with 8 th house, i.e., longevity 



Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 139 

of husband, as Sun owns the 8 th and Saturn owns 
the 2 nd . 

2. The 7 th lord Moon joins the 9 th house in inimical 
sign Virgo, The Moon is shifted in the 8 th house 
and obtains Saturn's navdmsa. 

3. The lord of lagna retrograde Saturn obtains 
inimical navdmsa of Sun and 4 th and 1 1 th lord 
Mars falls in Saturn's navdmsa Aquarius- Thus 
opposition of Mars and Saturn in navdmsa is 
present indicating a disaster in marriage. 

4. Conjunction of Moon and Venus in navdmsa 
chart is also adverse for long lasting marital 
happiness. 

5. Kdraka of savbhogya, Jupiter, falls over the axis 
of Rahu and Ketu and falls in inimical navdmsa 
Virgo. However, close conjunction of Venus and 
Mars in Svati naksatra and placement of two 
planets in Saturn's navdmsa caused widowhood. 
The marriage of the female took place during 
Rahu Rahu dasd Bhuktt. on May 8 th , 1996 and 
the husband expired during Rahu Jupiter period 
on April 17 th , 1997 which indicates the adversity 
of close affliction of Jupiter with Rahu may cause 
such problem provided other negative indications 
are found in the birth chart of a female. 

It is essential to look into Bhdva cdlita chart 
without making any mistake in this birth chart. 
The 7 th lord Moon who occupies the 9 th house is 
shifted in the 8 th house, that indicates early death 
of her husband during Rahu Jupiter dasd bhuktt 
Jupiter is the lord of the 3 rd and 12 th house and 
joins the 12 th house with RdhiL Placement of Jupiter 
over the axis of Rahu and Ketu is certainly adverse 
for longevity of husband. Conjunction of Venus and 
Mars in svati naksatra, which is ruled by Rahu+ 
is also adverse because Jupiter is closely associated 
with Rahu* As soon as Jupiter's sub-period in i?dhu

her husband. 

Accidential Loss Of Husband Due To Aircrash 
(No kuja dosa) widowhood within 4 l A years 

Case 3.4 - (Horoscope No, 4) 
She was an extremely charming girl and got married 
with a veiy smart, active, handsome, energetic, loving 
and caring man around 23 years of age on 
October 5 th , 1973 during Rdftu-Jupiter dasa bhukti 
The husband was working as a Pilot Officer in Indian 
Airforce. 1 have pointed out again and again that the 
placement of Jupiter in the 7 th house is damaging 
for married life and life partner. In this birth chart 
marriage took place in the sub-period of Jupiter who 
owns the 8 th and 5 th house. The plane of her husband 
crashed on March 2 nd , 1978 and that brought the 
greatest sorrow of widowhood during Rahu - Mercury 
dasa bhukti. The astrological reasons may be 
analysed as under — 

1. The 8 th house in a female nativity covers the 
longevity of husband and Rahu occupies the 8 th 
house under the malefic aspect of Mars and 
Saturn. This combination alone is powerful 
enough to bring widowhood. 

2. The lord of the 8 th house Jupiter joins the 7 th 
house and 7 th lord Saturn is afflicted due to 
placement over the axis of Rahu and Ketu. 

3. Mercury is the lord of the 2 nd house and is 
associated with Venus and Sun in the 3 rd house. 
Mercury obtains navamsa of its debilitation and 
becomes a marakesa in this birth chart. That is 
the reason why Mercury bhukti which is 8 th from 
Rahu, the dasa lord, brought widowhood. 
Mercury is 7 th lord from Rahu and joins the 8 th 
house. Therefore i?dhu-Mercury period Is 
extremely adverse for her.

Suicide Of Husband After 15 Years (No kuja dosa) 

Case 3.5 - (Horoscope No. 5) 

Let me illustrate another case of an extremely 
talented female Class I officer and posted as DGM 
in Development Authority. She is not a rnangall but 
she lost her husband after nearly 15 years of her 
marriage* The husband was an architect engineer 
and always suffered from . mental depression and 
committed suicide on December 4 th , 2000 during 
sub-period of Venus in the major period of Moon. 
The combinations of loss of husband are — 

1. The 7 th lord Moon falls in the last pada of Asvani 
whereby its dispositor is Mars. 

2. The yogakaraka Venus Is under deep combustion 
and is associated with inimical Sun in the 8 th 
house. The 8 th house governs length of life of 
husband. Both Sun and Venus obtain the 
navamsa of Venus where 8 th lord Sun is 
debilitated. 

3. Mars and Saturn are placed in the 10 th and l 8t 
house respectively and aspect each other. Mars 
owns the 4 th house and its affliction means the 
matters connected with the happy home of 
husband and wife will be damaged. Affliction or 
mutual aspect of Mars and Saturn always plays 
a negative role in married life. 

4. The matters should be taken Into consideration 
from 7 th house, 7 th lord and karaka Mars as well. 
Here the 7 th lord is Mars and Mars Is posited in 
the 7 th from Moon under the aspect of retrograde 
Saturn,

5. Let us take the sign occupied by Mars as 
ascendant. It is Libra here and Mars happens a 
maraka for Libra ascendant. The 7 th and 2 nd lord 
Mars is heavily afflicted by 4 th and 5 th lord 
retrograde Saturn. Thus the matters of the 7 th 
house have been damaged. 4 th house should also 
be taken into consideration. From Mars, the 4 th 
house is occupied by retrograde Saturn and is 
also aspected by Mars. Thus, the happiness of 
conjugal bliss has been hampered. This also 
shows that the married life of 15 years was also 
miserable. 

Loss Of Husband And Young Daughter In A Road 

Accident (No kuja dosa) 

Case No. - 3.6 (Horoscope No. 6) 

She is a very charming, extremely fair and pretty 
woman with sharp features, impressive overall 
personality. She is very bold, courageous and 
intelligent. She got married with a promising IPS 
officer on January 30 th , 1975 at 18 years of age. Her 
life partner who was IG Police, expired in a road 
accident on July 26 th , 2002 when she was passing 
through the sub-period of Moon In the major period 
of Moon from February 2 nd , 2002 to December 2 nd , 
2002. 

It is very difficult to judge her widowhood in this 
horoscope and why this fatal incident occurred 
during the sub-period of Moon in the major period 
of Moon. Moon is placed in Jyestha naksatra and 
in the sign of its debilitation and is also aspected 
by Mars and is associated with Saturn and Rahu. 
Thus the Moon is heavily afflicted. Therefore, soon 
after the beginning of the major period of Moon, 
she suffered tragic death of her husband. 

Jupiter in the 8 th house gives rise to saubhagya 
yoga but retrograde Jupiter does not do so. It

curtails the life of husband. There is mutual

Jupiter, She got married with IPS officer on 
January 30th, 1975 during ketu saturn dasa bhuktL 

She is well qualified and has done M-Sc. in 
Bio-chemistiy. She therefore got good job of gazetted 
level in place of her husband on November 15 th , 
2002. Moon is the 6 th lord and its placement in 
the 10 th house has given her the service of her 
choice in police department. 

Thus, Jyestha borns suffer either divorce or loss

Indications For Accidental Death Of Husband 

The 8 th house indicates happiness of married life 
and husband in a female nativity whereas 8 th from 
8"% i.e. t 3 rd house governs the demise of husband. 
Here retrograde Jupiter falls in the 8 th house and 
Mars joins 3 rd from lagna under no benefic aspect. 
Mars is placed in Asvinl naksatra ruled by Ketu and 
Jupiter is also placed in Magha naksatra ruled by 
kettL Moreover, Venus occupies the 1 1 th house of its 
enemy Jupiter and is hemmed between enemies, 
Sun, Moon and Saturn giving rise to papakartari 
yoga. Venus also obtains navamsa of Mars and 
mutual exchange is also there between Mars and 
Venus. These factors are responsible for tragic 
accident of husband. 

The 7 th lord Sun occupies 12 th in Capricorn and 
obtains navamsa of Mars. Sun receives the malefic 
aspect of Saturn. Thus the 7 th house, 4 th house 
(sweet home) and the 8 th house are badly damaged 
in one or the other way and that caused the 
accidental death of her husband. 

Rule: if a female is born in Jyestha naksatra, she 
may suffer tragedy of her married life during Moon 



1 48 Foretelling Widowhood 

or Mercury dasa bhukti Retrograde Jupiter in the 
8 th house becomes a malefic and does not save 
widowhood particularly if malefics are placed in the 
8 th from Jupiter. 

Widowhood Within TVo Months Of Marriage [a$tama 
mangold Husband Crushed By A Train 
Case 3.7 - (Horoscope No« 7) 

Tliis is the horoscope of another unfortunate girl. 
She was born in Aries ascendant with debilitated 
Saturn and exalted Sun. In fact combination of Saturn 
and Sun denies happiness of marriage provided this 
combination has anything to do with 7 th house. Mars 
occupies the 8 th house under retrograde motion in 
own sign. Here Moon is hemmed between two first 
rate malefics. She got married on April 27 th , 1999 
during Saturn-Venus period. Here 7 th and 2 nd lord 
Venus is marakesa for Aries ascendant and is 
associated with Rahu and obtains inimical navamsa 
of Jupiter. She suffered widowhood on 
June 27 th , 1999 just after two months when her 
husband was crushed under train. Marriage of the 
native was performed during sub-period of Venus 
which happens a killer for Aries ascendant and its 
placement in the 12 th house is further bad, as it 
falls over the axis of nodes and is aspected by 
retrograde Jupiter. This period of marakesa Venus 
killed her husband. Marriages should not be 
performed in such mdraka period or under those 
periods which indicate adversities. She lost her 
mother around 12 years of age on October 19 th , 1981, 
lost her father on April 4 th , 1993. After the loss of 
husband, she is working as teacher in a small school 
to meet her both ends. It is not out of place to mention 
that she had done M.A., B.Ed., before her marriage.

Venus falls in Saturn's constellation uttara

Saturn is debilitated and Venus and Saturn are 12 th

Loss Of Husband Within 1 Year After Marriage 

Case 3.8 - (Horoscope No. 8) 

She was an exceptionally beautiful, very fair girl of 
outstanding merits of features and figure. She got 
married in May 1972 at 17 years of age with a 
Mechanical Engineer. During the sub-period of Mars 
in the major period of Mars, she was in a family way 
in advance stage. Around May 1973, when she was 
undergoing the sub-period of Rdhuin the major period 
of Mars, she pressurised her husband to go 
somewhere alongwith her. The husband agreed and 
they went to a hill. Both of them stayed at a very 
pleasant place. She was extremely happy as this 
trip happened just before delivery. After spending 
some time there, her husband started the jeep and 
tried to reach her just to avoid a few hundred feets 
of walk for his wife, due to her pregnancy. The jeep 
went out of his control and toppled hundreds of feets 
down. The husband immediately expired. 

In this birth chart, the 8 th house is occupied by 
the lord of tagna Venus, malefic Rahu and Moon. 
The 8 th house indicates life of husband, this 
combination is aspected by Jupiter and Ketu from

retrograde in the 9 th house. The 2 nd house, is 8 th 
from 7 th house, therefore it indicates death of 
husband. The 7 th house is hemmed between Saturn 
and Rahu giving rise to papakartari yoga. Moreover, 
7 th lord Mars occupies 12 th house under argotic 
navarhsa under the mutual aspect of Saturn. This 
combination is bad for a long lasting married life. 
It generally brings separation but in this horoscope, 
Venus and Moon are closely conjoined in the 8 th 
house where Moon obtains the navarhsa of 
debilitation. The lagna and 7 th house both are placed 
under papakartari yoga, 7 th and 8 th houses both are 
afflicted. Venus and Mars obtain own navarhsa 
showing adultery, Mars and Saturn both aspects 
3 rd house, that is the house of brother. In this case, 
she established physical relationship with the 
brother of her husband and waited for more than 
10 years till he grew up as an adult. Later she 
married with her *devar\ i.e., the younger brother 
of her husband. Mars Mid Venus if aspect each 
other in navarhsa or exchange their navarhsa and 
at least one among the lord of the ascendant and 
7 th house be Mars or Venus. The licentious activities 
will be there. Here placement of Rahu in the 8 th house 
in Ketu's constellation Mulct, placement of Mars in 
Ketu's naksatra asvinl and placement of Ketu in 
Rahu's naksatra ardra is very adverse set up of 
planets. Ketu and Rahu exchange their naksatra and 
7 th lord Mars joins Ketu's naksatra giving rise to 
widowhood within one year of marriage. It is clearly 
indicated that she will suffer widowhood because 7 th 
and 8 th house and their lords are heavily afflicted. 
She should have never married during sub- 
period of Mars, Rahu and Ketu in the major period 
of Ketu. 



Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 153 

I once again strongly emphasise that one should 
not enter into conjugal life especially during the 
adverse vibration of those planets who are responsible 
for bringing miseries, separation or widowhood. All 
over it has been mentioned that muhurta or the 
selection of appropriate muhurta or selection of 
auspicious time for marriage is the best prevention 
of al] kinds of adversities which are likely to 
creep up. 

Husband Committed Suicide Due To Torture 
By Wipe After 6 Years Of Marriage 
Case 3*9 - (Horoscope No. 9) 

The lady was married to a handsome and smart 
doctor on March 7 th , 1979. She was blessed with a 
son on February 20th, 1980 and a daughter on 
October 18 th , 1982. The lady had a very quarrelsome 
nature whereas her husband was quite peace-loving. 
When the husband came to know about the illicit 
relation with someone, he could not bear that shock 
and committed suicide on March 19 th , 1985 when 
she was running under sub-period of Mars in the 
major period of Jupiter, 

The lord of the 6 th Saturn is posited in lagna and 
the 4 th and 7 th lord Jupiter falls in the 8 th house 
in martian sign Aries. Thus, the 8 th lord Mars and 
the 7 th lord Jupiter aspect each other. The owner 
of the 6 th house Saturn aspects 7 th and 10 th house 
and Moon as well. The 7 th lord Jupiter falls in the 
8 th house in the sign of Mars as well as obtains 
the navarhsa of Mars. Further, Jupiter and Mars 
aspect each other. Thus, the lord of the 7 th house, 
Jupiter is under the heavy influence of Mars in 
the 8 th house in Saturn's sign Aquarius has further 
strengthened the combination for widowhood.

Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 155 

It is believed that placement of Jupiter in the 
8 th house gives rise to akhanda saubhagya yoga 
irrespective of its being malefic or beneflc for the 
particular ascendant. In this horoscope Jupiter is 
the lord of 4 th and 7 th house and joins the 8 th . Many 
so-called astrologers foretold her to be blessed with 
saubhagya yoga due to placement of Jupiter in the 
8 th house. But it did not happen so because her 
husband died after 6 years of marriage and that 
too during the major period of Jupiter. It should 
be carefully noted that the lord of the 7 th house 
if placed in martian sign in the 8 th house and 
receives the aspect of Mars, she will definitely loose 
her husband in early-married life. This is a classical 
case of widowhood where the rules are applicable 
absolutely. 

Husband Shot Himself After Seeing Physical 
Involvement Of His Wife With Another Person 

Case 3.10 - (Horoscope No. 10) 
She was born in Leo ascendant with Mars in the 7 th 
house. The 7 th lord Saturn is also placed in the sign 
of Aries, Mars obtains navamsa of Saturn. She was 
married with a very handsome IPS officer on 
June 4 th , 1964 during Moon-Jupiter period. She 
invited her lover on February 28 th , 1982 when her 
husband was out of station. Somehow as her husband 
had certain doubts regarding her relations with the 
other person, he came back around midnight and 
was deeply shocked to find his doubts confirmed. He 
committed suicide on the same night. 

In the birth chart yogakaraka Mars is posited in 
the 7 th house and Ketu in the 8 th house. I find that 
Ketu must be attached an importance equal to 
Mars. Here Ketu in the 8 th and Mars in the 7 th show

widowhood. Sages have also mentioned that malefic 
in the 7 th causes widowhood. The 8 th house is 
hemmed between first rate malefics Mars and 
Saturn. Mars obtains navarhsa of Saturn and the 
7 th lord Saturn falls in the navarhsa of Jupiter in 
the 8 th house from navarhsa lagna* Thus Jupiter, 
the 8 th lord caused widowhood in its own bhukti

Suffered Widowhood Within One And Half Year As 
Husband Was Killed By His Own Wife 

Case 3, 11 - (Horoscope No. 11) 

The lord of the 7 th house Mars in Scorpio joins the 
7 th house itself in association with 2 nd and 5 th lord 
Mercury and Ketu. Saturn occupies the 10 th house 
and there is mutual aspect between Mars and Saturn. 
She was deeply involved with a muslim boy. Marriage 
could not be possible with that boy as she was Hindu. 
Due to utmost pressure of parents, she got married 
in October 1987 (Jupiter) with a handsome engineer 
boy. She was blessed with a daughter in October 
1988 (Jupiter) and soon after she diplomatically, 
cleverly and intelligently managed the murder of her 
husband in January 1989. Here 5 th lord Mercury is 
placed with 7 th lord Mars. This is also a Madan Gopal 
Yoga which makes one adulterous. Mercury provides 
her negative intelligence and Ketu further enhanced 
the intensity of Mars. Mutual aspect between Mars 
and Saturn further aggravates the intensity of Mars. 
In Bhava Kautuhalam, Jlvanaha mentions in chapter 
9 that the placement of Mercury in the 7 m house 
makes one adulterous and she kills her husband if 
Mercury is afflicted. The Woman native sloka '14' 
mentions a critical condition of placement of Mercury 
in the 7 th house in Virgo only. In other slokas as 
mentioned earlier, three malefics in the 7 th house

and goes to her lover. In this case, three malefics 
Mars, Ketu and Mercury are associated in the 7 th 
house. These are aspected by Rahu, How appropriate 
sages have mentioned and according to concerning 
sloka, she should have killed her husband to many 
her lover. This may be noted that she got married in 
the sub-period of Jupiter in the major period of 
Jupiter running from April 23 rd , 1987 to 
June l s \ 1989. Here Jupiter is a malefic as it is 8 th

Retrograde Jupiter is always bad for female nativities

Here Mars is placed in the 7 th house in Scorpio, Thus 
she is a strong mangall girl. Jupiter occupies the 
lagna, thus there is mutual aspect between Jupiter 
and Mars. Her father was Chairman of UPSEB and 
consulted me about the matching of horoscope with 
a doctor boy. He was not mangall 1 strongly advised 
against the proposal. Many astrologers of Varanasi 
advised for the marriage because kuja dosa was 
neutralised by Jupiter's mutual aspect, according to 
them. Mr. Chairman did not give any importance to 
my observation that kuja dosa gets enhanced by 
Jupiter's association or aspect. The native was

smart doctor who got crushed by the car on March

According to Achaiya H.N. Katwe, if Saturn is just 
behind Mars, then it is damaging and makes one 
strong mangolL The 8 th house from lagna is occupied 
by RahiL Malefics in the 8 th house are bad for long

Loss Of Husband Within Ten Months Of Marriage 

In An Air Crash 

Case 3.13 - (Horoscope No. 13) 

For Libra ascendant, position of Mars must be 
carefully examined as Mars owns 2 nd and 7 th house 
and thus it possesses the strength to kill the native. 
Mars falls in the 8 th house, so either the marriage 
will be delayed and she will lead a miserable life or 
will be separated or loose her husband or may meet 
with untimely and unnatural end of her life 
depending upon the various other factors. Jupiter is 
the lord of the 8 th and 4 th house and it is placed in 
the 2 nd house under retrograde motion and it is 
aspecting 8 th house as well- 
In the present case of a lady producer of AIR, 
the affliction of the 7 th lord Mars may be noted as 
it falls in the 8 th house under the mutual aspect 
with Saturn. Thus the 7 th , 8 th and 2 nd houses are 
under the influence of Mars and Saturn. Sun also 
obtains navomsa of Saturn. These combinations 
delayed her marriage though she was extremely 
beautiful and charming, till 34 years of age. She 
was married on March 11 th , 1961 during Moon-Rdhu 
period. Once she had gone to airport to see off her 
husband and saw that the plane caught fire within 
few seconds after taking off. Widowhood was cursed 
on her within 10 months of her marriage on 
January 10 th , 1962 during sub-period of Jupiter and

in the major period of Moon. The ascendant. Mars, 
Saturn and Moon have gained strength by obtaining 
vargottama navamsa. The 2 nd and 7 th lord Mars in 
the 8 th , Saturn in the 2 nd resulted in widowhood. 
Saturn has further reduced her happiness of conjugal 
life as it is placed in the sign of Mars and in own 
constellation anuradha. The 4 th house should also 
be judged for confirmation. Here Saturn the 4 th lord 
has been damaged due to mutual aspect of Mars, 
The 4 th house has further spoiled the happiness of 
home as it is under pdpakartari yoga. 

It may be carefully noted that placement of Mars 
in the 8 th house in Taurus for female nativities will 
result into accidental death of husband. The 
possibility of widowhood will be further strengthened 
if malefic aspects of Mars or Saturn is identical 
to 8 th or 2 nd house. 

Husband Was Killed By Criminals After 8 Years Of

life with her loving, caring and accommodating 
husband. The husband was an Industrialist and 
multimillionaire. Certain criminals demanded a huge 
sum of money. He refused to give money inspite of 
repeated threats. That resulted into his murder on 
the evening of November 18 th , 1999 (Thursday). The 
native was in hospital in labour-pain to deliver the 
child. There was difference of only a few hours in 
the murder of her husband and delivery of the son. 
None had the courage to tell her about this great 
tragic killing of her husband- She was informed only 
the next day just before final departure of the body 
of her husband for cremation. 
She was born in Scorpio ascendant. There is no

planet in the 7 th or 8 th house which may indicate 
widowhood or any such tragedy. It is not easy to 
foretell about the murder of her husband by looking 
into her birth chart. 

1. In Bhava Chart, the lagna lord Mars falls in the 
8 th house and obtains navamsa of the 7 th lord 
Venus. This is certainly adverse for the life of 
husband. 

2. The 7 th and 8 th lords Venus and Mercury occupy 
10 th house under pdpakartari yoga. Therefore the 
matters of the 7 th and 8 th house have been spoiled. 

3. The lord of 8 th house Mercury obtains navamsa 
of Mars in association with debilitated Saturn 
and that too under mutual aspect between 
malefic Mars, Saturn and Mercury. Thus the 8 th 
lord Mercury is heavily afflicted by Mars and 
Saturn. Therefore, It resulted Into the murder 
of husband. There may be other reason for loss 
of husband. How can we explain the murder of 
her husband by examination of the chart of the 
female? 

4« The 8 th lord Mercury falls in a fiery sign Leo and 
fiery navamsa Aries, Mercury falls in Ketu's 
naksatra maghd. Ketu also acts like Mars. 
Moreover Mercury is hemmed between Mars and 
Ketu in Rdsi chart as well as Bhava chart. In 
navamsa, Mercury obtains Mars navamsa and 
is aspected by Mars and is associated with 
malefic Saturn. Thus 8 th lord Mercury is under 
the heavy affliction of Mars, Saturn and Ketu. 
Violent planets, fiery sign and 8 th lord indicate 
the assassination of husband. 

5. The assassination of her husband took place ori 
November 18 th , 1999 when sub-period of Moon 
and major period of Venus was under operation. 
From Venus-Moon Is 12 th lord and occupies the 
8 th house from Venus. Moon also obtains

navdmsa of Mars due to being in debilitation. 
Moon is posited in Saturn's naksatra uttara 
bhadrapadd over the axis of Rahu and Ketuu Moon 
is closely associated with Rahu, therefore Moon 
will act like Rahu. As soon as sub-period of Moon 
came under operation on October 27 th , 1999 to 
December 2 nd , 1999, the planning of killing was 
done and executed exactly on November 18 , 
1999.

Case 3.15 - (Horoscope No. 15) 

She is beautiful daughter of an IAS Officer. She was

During the year 1990 very handsome and smart boy

multimillionaire went into, deep grief and setbacks. 
Her husband was forced to join private job to meet 
both ends. He was picking up well. The female native 
planned to visit Jaipur with her son and husband. 
They were going from Delhi to Jaipur and there is 
six lane, extremely good road, where there was no 
possibility of accident. The planets brought the 
biggest calamity in her life when head on collision 
with a Tata Siera took place on August 9 th , 2001 
during sub-period of Saturn in the major period of 
Mars. Her husband expired on the spot and she 
received multiple fractures in her body. Incidentally 
she got the best treatment in Apollo Hospital of Delhi 
for about six months. At present, she is staying with 
her parent-in-laws and leading a maladious and 
lonely life of a widow. She faced the biggest misery 
and in flash of a second blossoms of her life were 
crushed and everything went into endless dark, 
during Mars-Saturn period, 

Now let us analyse her horoscope. There is 
mutual exchange between Mars and Saturn. Mars 
is placed in the 8 th house in Aquarius and Saturn 
in Aries in the sign of debilitation in the 10 th house. 
Here 7 th and 8* lord Saturn occupies Martian sign. 
Yogakaraka Mars is closely associated with Rahu. 
This is a strong indication of widowhood. There is 
strong belief among astrologers that aspect of 
Jupiter over Mars neutralises or cancels the kuja 
do§CL Here Jupiter aspects the 8 th house. Mars and 
Rahu, who join the 8 th house and the 7 th and 8 th 
lord Saturn. If Jupiter cancelled the kiija dosa why 
she suffered a tragic death of her husband? It is 
also believed that the placement of Mars in Leo 
or Aquarius anywhere in the birth chart does not 
give rise to kuja do§a. This is stated in the slokas 
mentioned earlier. 



Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 169 

In this case, we clearly see Mars joins 8 th house 
in Aquarius and is also aspected by Jupiter. The 
aspect of Jupiter has strengthened the 7 th and 8 th 
lord Saturn. Why did she suffer widowhood? if kuja 
dosa was cancelled and Jupiter's aspect over Mars 
and Saturn nullifies such adversity. I, therefore, 
opine that the placement of Mars in Aquarius or 
Leo does not cancel kiya dosa and the aspect of 
Jupiter or Moon over Mars (as that can be seen 
In the case as Jupiter and Moon both aspect Mars), 
does not cancel kuja dosa of any kind. In my 
experience, the kuja dosa gets enhanced due to 
aspect or conjunction of Moon and Jupiter. 

In this horoscope, there is mutual exchange 
between 4 th and 6 th lord also as 4 th lord Venus joins 
6 th and 6 th lord Jupiter joins 4 th . This is an adverse 
combination which indicates loss of happiness, 
prosperity, property and peace. 

Placement of the 12 th lord Mercury in the 7 th 
house is also adverse as it is aspected by marakesa 
and debilitated Saturn. Let me explain that the loss 
of husband can take place during dosa bhukti of 
7 th and 8 th lord or planets placed therein or during 
the period of occupants or lord of 2 nd house or 
otherwise during the period of Jupiter, if it is 
retrograde or afflicted and has a concern with the 
life of husband. I believe that Jupiter is the karaka 
of suhaga, i.e.* the life of husband where Mars Is 
the significator of husband.

husband met with a massive heart-attack. She. got 
married in 1981 and she lost her husband on 
November 5 th , 1996 during Jupiter-Saturn period. It 
may be noted that Saturn is yogakaraka and joins 
the 7 th house, 12 th and 7 th lord Mars occupies the 5 th 
in association with 5 th lord Mercury. The aspect of 
Mars over the 8 th house, conjunction of Rahu, Venus 
and Saturn in the 7 th house is responsible for loss of 
her husband. 7 th lord Mars Is conjoined with the 
Mercuiy who is marakesa. Here the affliction of 4 th 
house can also be seen. 8 th lord Jupiter occupies the 
4 th house and 4 th lord Sun is debilitated in the 6 th 
and is hemmed between Mars, Saturn and Rdhtt 
giving rise to pdpakartari yoga. In bhdva chart, Saturn 
and Sun conjoin in the 6 m house. Jupiter's aspect 
also over the 8 th could not save widowhood and the 
death of husband took place in major period of Jupiter 
in the sub-period of Saturn. Here we can see that 
the placement of Mars in the 5 th house is almost as 
adverse as Mars in the 7 th or 8"* house. She had a 
love marriage on May 17 th , 1981 during Rahu Saturn 
dasa bhukti and blessed with two female children on 
February 20th, 1984 and October 12th, 1987 
respectively.

Mars occupies 8 th house in square position with

when she was passing through the sub-period 
Mercury In the major period of Venus. She had also 
been blessed with a son who is her biggest support

Venus occupies the 12 th house which further confirms 
the adverse probabilities of conjugal life. 

Husband Committed Suicide Immediately After 
Marriage 

Case No, 3,18 - (Horoscope No. 18) 

This is the horoscope of Rekha, famous film actress. 
She has always been appreciated for her talent in 
the field of acting. In real life, she could not get 
happiness of her married life and suffered widowhood 
soon after her marriage with Mukesh AgarwaL She 
also remained involved with famous personalities of 
film industry from time to time. What made her 
widow? Why did her husband Mukesh Agarwal 
committed suicide? Lord of lagna Jupiter occupies 
the 8 th house In its sign of exaltation. As I said earlier, 
aspect of Jupiter or its placement in the 8 th house 
gives long life to husband. In this horoscope, 8 th house 
and exalted Jupiter is aspected by Mars and Saturn 
both. Mars aspects the 7 th house where Ketu Is 
posited. Venus Is hemmed between Mars, Rdhu and 
Saturn giving rise to papakartari yoga. This snatched 
the happiness of conjugal life. Mars Is shifted In the 
2 nd house In Bhava chart. From there also, Mars 
aspects the 8 th house, here there Is mutual aspect 
between Mars and Jupiter in bhava chalit Therefore, 
akhanda saubhagya yogals converted into vaidhavya 
yoga. Presence of Ketu in the 7 th house is as bad as 
that of Mars. If 8 th house is occupied by beneflc and 
aspected by malefic like Mars and Saturn, one looses

her husband. Here 7 th lord Mercury is conjoined with 
exalted Saturn in the 11 th house. 7 th lord Mercury 
obtains navdrhsa of its debilitation. In the slokas 
mentioned earlier, it has been clearly mentioned, if 
7 th lord Mercury gets debilitated or afflicted or placed 
in the 8 th house, the female will kill her husband 
and whole family will be destroyed. Here killing 
means the source of death of her husband. It is well 
known that her husband Mukesh Agarwal committed 
suicide by hanging himself by dupatta of Rekha. In 
fact she misbehaved and tortured him a lot as per 
newspaper and magazines. Since Mukesh loved 
Rekha to the degree of insanity, he could therefore 
not bear the shock given to him by Rekha and killed 
himself* Thus Rekha was the actual cause of suicide 
by Mukesh Agarwal. 

Husband Killed By A Human Bomb 

Case - 3.19 (Horoscope No. 19) 

This horoscope belongs to Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, who 
became wife of late Mr* Rajiv Gandhi, former Prime 
Minister of India on Februaiy 25 th , 1968 in Jupiter- 
Ketu period. The tragic killing of her husband 
Mr. Rajiv Gandhi on May 2V l , 1991 (Saturn-Kdhu) 
shocked the whole world. At that time she was 
running in the 45 th year of age and her life completely 
changed. From the position of a queen, she just 
became the widow of a former PM. She kept herself 
away from Indian politics as she had paid a heavy 
cost for the same. She was running under the sub- 
period of Rahu in the major period of Saturn when 
Rajiv Gandhi was killed. The lord of the 7 th and 8 th 
house joins the ascendant under the aspect of 
malefic Mars from the 6 th house. It is retrograde 
Saturn in the ascendant who obtains navdrhsd of 
Mars. It will not be out of place to mention that she

Saturn occupies 12 th house. Conjunction of Rahu and 
Mars in the 8 th house has strong indication of 
widowhood. Mars and Rahu are shifted in the 9 th 
house In Bhava Ce&it Here Mars and Saturn aspect 
each other and Saturn aspects 7 th lord Jupiter. It 
may be noted that when 7 th lord occupies the sign 
ruled by Mars or Saturn and is aspected by Mars or 
Saturn, widowhood is possible. Rahu and Mars in 
the 8 th house surely cause widowhood. All these 
combinations are present In this birth chart which

Husband Crushed By A Truck In Less Than A Month 
After Marriage At 20 Years Of Age 
Case 3,21 - (Horoscope No. 21) 

This is the irony of misfortune that she suffered 
intense tragedy and terrible plight of widowhood just 
after 24 days of her marriage. She got married 
decently on November 23 rd , 1987 during sub-period 
of Venus in the major period of Mercury and suffered 
the tragic death of her life partner on December 17 th , 
1987 just after 24 days of her marriage* 

The husband had gone for the morning walk and 
there was lot of fog* The truck driver could not see 
him* As a result, he was crushed badly by the truck 
and expired on the spot. He was a teacher in a 
private school at Sitapur. The wife proved pati-hanta 
for him. In this horoscope, retrograde Saturn who 
owns the 6 th house occupies the 7 th house under 
retrograde motion. Rahu occupies the 8 th house in 
Aries and is aspected by Mars and Ketu from the 
2 nd house. We have repeatedly opined that if Rohm 
Ketu, Moon or Saturn are placed in Martian sign 
in the 7 th or 8 th and are under mutual aspect with 
Mars, widowhood occurs* The 7 th lord Jupiter is a 
bddhaka and marakesa for this ascendant and is 
deep combust. The birth took place on the day of 
amavasya. It is believed that the female becomes 
widow if she is born on amdvasycL In this horoscope, 
7 th lord Jupiter is exalted in the 11 th house with 
its lord Moon, ascendant and 10 th lord Mercury and 
12* lord Sun, Jupiter aspects its own 7 th house, 
but still due to deep combustion and being a 
bddhaka and marakesa, killed her husband within

24 days after marriage. Mars and Ketu are also 
marakesa for this ascendant as Mars is 8 th and 3 rd 
lord, placed In 2 nd house in conjunction with Ketu. 
2 nd house is 3 rd from 7 th house and indicates 
husband's death. Venus is the lord of the 2 nd house 
and is 2 nd from 7 th Jupiter and mahddasd lord 
Mercury, Therefore, she lost her husband during 
Mercury-Venus period. It may be noted that Venus, 
if placed in Leo or conjoined with Sun or Moon or 
hemmed between them, will curtail conjugal bliss 
to a great extent. 

Evil Combinations In A Nutshell 

1. Rahu in 8 th house in fiery sign Aries of Mars and 
aspected by Mars. 

2. 8 th lord Mars over the axis of nodes. 

3. 7 th lord Jupiter is deeply combust, badhaka and 
marakesa and obtains navdrhsa of debilitation. 

4. Retrograde Saturn owns the 5 th . and 6 th and joins 
the 7 th house in Jupiter's sign and navamsa. 

5. 2 nd lord Venus occupies 12 th house in inimical 
sign Leo which curtail marital happiness . 

6. The birth took place on amdvasyd which also 
gives rise to widowhood, if other combinations 
also confirm.

is a naksatra of mulcu Here Rdhu occupies the 8 th 
house and Mars joins the ascendant and aspects 
RahiL It has been observed that if Rahu joins the 8 th 
house in Martian sign Aries, widowhood comes quite 
early because it is a fleiy sign. If Rdhu joins 8 th house 
in Scorpio Martian sign and is aspected by Mars, 
widowhood comes in between the 6 th and 1 1 th year 
after marriage depending on other planetary 
combinations. 7 th lord Venus occupies the 12 th house 
in its sign of exaltation, i.e., Venus is associated 
with Mercuiy and Saturn, 8 th lord Mars js hemmed 
between Saturn and Ketu. 8 th house from Moon is 
afflicted which resulted into widowhood in Sun - 
Venus period on January 1 st , 1969. Venus is the 
lord of the 2 nd and 7 th house, i.e., the marakesa and 
joins 2 nd from Sun. This becomes a maraka for 
husband, 2 nd house is 8 th from 7 th , therefore, its 
lordship is always adverse if other planetary 
combinations confirm widowhood. 

If 8 th lord Mars joins ascendant or the 7 th house 
and malefic like Rahu, Ketu or Saturn occupies the 
8 th , widowhood will certainly be there, as in the 
present case. 

Loss Of Husband Due To Massive Heart Attack

very simple girl who got married to a lecturer of 
Physics on November 24 th , 1968. The marriage was

frustrations, distress, despair, dissatisfaction, 
humiliation just after reaching her home of in-laws. 
They were so harsh with her that she was beaten 
badly whenever tears appeared in her eyes. All 
jewellery and garments were snatched from her. She 
stayed with her husband for one month but she was 
unable to recognise him because they were never 
together for that one month. She was forced to sleep 
in the storeroom or veranda during winters on the 
ground. 

Any way after coming back to her parents after 
one month, she cried continuously for three days. 
As a result of that, her father received unbearable 
shock and expired. Whole family was shattered and 
doomed into mourns. Her father believed in astrology 
a lot. Horoscope of both were matched by one 
famous astrologer of Lucknow, even then this 
tragedy took place. Her father died at an early age 
whereas many astrologers predicted a long life of 
76 years of age. All went wrong and whole family 
started to disbelieve astrology. She remained 
separated from her husband for seven years or so. 
We suggested her vrata on Tuesdays, donation for 
mafigcda, recitation of Vedic m antras for mangala 
and reading of mangcda stotra etc. 

At around 28 years of age in 1976, her husband 
visited her making her astonished. However, she 
started living with her husband thereafter. Effect 
of Mars can be seen in this case* The marriage 
took place at 21 years of age but the conjugal bliss 
was absent till 28 years of age. She hardly enjoyed 
marriage for 21 years and suddenly her husband 
expired on November 7 th , 1997 during Jupiter Venus 
dasd bhuktt, which is invariably bad. Many a times, 
it has been found in many cases that the death 
of husband takes place in major or sub-period of 



186 Foretelling Widowhood 

2 nd lord. 2 nd house is 8 th from 7 th and indicates the 
death of husband. Sub-period lord Venus is the lord 
of 7 th house as reckoned from Jupiter and Is placed 
in the 8 th house and from there, Jupiter falls in 
the sign of Mars and is retrograde in the 10 th house 
in jyestha nak$atra. 

In this horoscope, Mars falls in the 8 th house and 
Saturn and Sun join in the 6 th house. 7 th house 
is placed under strong papakartari yoga, 8 th house 
is joined by Mars and aspected by Saturn. Rahu 
who is 8 th from 8 th house, i.e., in the 3 rd house, 
falls in aries and is aspected by Mars and Saturn 
both. This resulted into sudden loss of her husband 
and lonely life thereafter. 

Thus, she faced Immense miseries of married life 
inspite of 34VS matching points of astakiita and 
balance of kuja do?a. That's why I have always 
emphasized that it is not only matching points and 
matching fcufa dosa which matters. There must be 
matching of planets and bhavas as well. Why Mars 
and Moon should be considered for happy married 
life? Why 7 other planets and bhavas should not 
be taken into account? 

Husband Expired Due To Severe Stomach Problem 

Case No. 3. 24 - (Horoscope No. 24) 

She got married with an Engineer around 16 th year 
of her age during Venus-Venus period. She suffered 
sudden loss of her husband around forty-five years 
of age during Moon-Satum period on October 22 nd , 
1969. She is not mangali either from lagna or Moon 
or Venus. She enjoyed lot of fortune of all kinds of 
luxury, vehicles, servants, ornaments etc. The 
conjunctions of the lords of both the triangles, 
Mercury and Saturn in the ascendant made her very 
fortunate. However, the placement of the 2 nd and 7 th

lord Mars in the 5 th house is really very adverse. The 
death of husband took place during Moon-Saturn 
dasa bhuktl Saturn is 8 th from Moon and is afflicted 
due to conjunction with the Sun. Mars aspects 8 th 
house and Saturn aspects 7 th house. This can be 
noted that widowhood took place during yogakaraka 
Saturn's sub-period who is exalted in the ascendant 
and has given rise to Sasa Mahapttru^a Raja Yoga. 
It is a tough exercise to time widowhood. It is not 
essential at all that it will take place during dasa 
bhukti of concerning planets only. If Mars is 
responsible for widowhood, it may come around 21 
to 28 years or 42 to 49 years of age. If Saturn is 
responsible, widowhood may come around 31 to 36 
years or 54 years. Many combinations are there for 
widowhood after 7, 10* 15, 20 years of marriage. After 
approximate age, dasa bhukti will help in timing 
widowhood. 

Loss Of Husband During Stomach Operation 

Case No. 3.25 - (Horoscope No. 25) 

She was the first child of her parents. The birth took 
place in jyestha naksatra, fourth pada. Her mother 
expired soon after her birth. She got married around 
21 years of age. The married life was miserable. The 
husband was quite smart, good looking and 
attractive. Many girls were Involved with him. She 
lost her husband on January 23 rd , 1969 during 
operation of stomach. 

For Libra ascendant, Mars is the worst planet 
and here Mars occupies the ascendant in association 
with the 9 th lord Mercury. Rahu occupies the 8 th 
house and Is aspected by Mars and Saturn. Birth 
has taken place on new Moon day, i.e., amavasycL

debilitation and 1 2 th lord Mercury occupies the 
ascendant under affliction by Mars. 

We have observed that the major period of Moon 
is very adverse for jyestha borns. She underwent 
the curse of widowhood on January 23 rd , 1969 
during major period of Moon and sub-period of 
Saturn. Saturn heavily afflicts the 2 nd house, and 
the Moon and thus both happen a marakesa for 
her husband. She was blessed with one daughter 
and two sons and expired on May 30 th , 2001 after 
leading so lonely life of more than 32 years. 

Here placement of Rahu in the 8 th house and 
aspect of Mars, Saturn, Sun, Moon and Ketu over 
there, resulted into widowhood around 41 years of 
age. She suffered a lot thereafter. 

Death Of Husband Due To Massive Heart Attack 
Case No. 3.26 - (Horoscope No. 26) 

She got married on June 24 th , 1982 at 18 years of 
age during sub-period of Ketu in the major period of 
Rahu. Her husband was a man of outstanding 
personality. He was very kind-hearted, helping and 
Judicious. On August 6 th , 1993 her husband expired 
due to a massive heart attack. She faced the biggest 
tragedy in loss of husband at 29 years of age when 
there were many dreams to be blossomed. But the 
sudden widowhood crushed her dreams miserably 
and ruined her life. 

Placement of Mars in the 5 th house should be held

ascendant is under papakartari yoga. In this case 
again, the Jupiter could not save widowhood though 
it aspects the 8 th house. The lord of the 8 th house 
Sun occupies the 6 th house in close association with 
Rahu and Venus. There is mutual exchange between 
5 th lord Venus and 6 th lord Mercuiy. 8 th house is

aspected by retrograde Saturn from 2 nd house and 
Mars from 5 th house. Thus, the 8 th house which 
rules the span of married life, is heavily afflicted 
because the 8 th lord Sun is closely associated in 
the 6 th house over the axis of nodes and the 8 th 
house is aspected by first rate maleflcs like Mars 
and Saturn, 

The husband expired on August 6 th , 1993 in the 
sub-period of Saturn in the major period of Jupiter. 
Saturn owns the 2 nd house and it becomes stronger 
malefic as it becomes retrograde. Jupiter who is 
the 12 th and 3 rd lord, is a malefic for Capricorn 
ascendant- Thus, the joint aspect of 12 th and 3 rd 
lord Jupiter, lagna and 2 nd lord retrograde Saturn 
and 4 th and 11 th lord Mars over the 8 th house 
resulted into the tragedy. It may be noted that 
Jupiter is the lord of the 2 nd house as reckoned 
from 2 nd and therefore, sub-period of Saturn in the 
major period of Jupiter snatched the pleasure of 
conjugal bliss and the pleasant company of her 
most loving and caring life partner.

his two daughters and a son. The female suffered 
the tragic death of her husband around 37 years of 
age during sub-period of Ketu in the major period of 
Jupiter. 

The lord of the 8 th house Mars is conjoined with 
Rahu in the ascendant. Saturn and Mars both 
aspect the 8 th house and Rasi lord Venus occupies 
Leo sign which is always adverse. 7 th and 8 th house 
are heavily afflicted by Mars and Saturn. It may 
be noted that Mars is the lord of the 6 th house and 
Saturn aspects the 8 th house alongwih the aspect 
of marokesa Jupiter on the 8 th house which snatched 
the life of her husband at an early age. 

The widowhood occurred in the Jupiter- Ketu 
period- Here the Jupiter is the lord of the 8 th house 
and marokesa for Gemini ascendant and it is also 
combust and badhakadhipatt Ketu joins the 7 th 
house. Thus, Jupiter and Ketu both became marokesa 
for husband and this dasa of Jupiter-Ketu resulted 
into this biggest tragedy of her life. 

We had forewarned for this tragedy as we were 
in close contact. It may be noted that Mars obtains 
navdmsa of Jupiter in whose dasa she suffered 
widowhood. This is a rule of astrology that widowhood 
may take place during close dasa bhukti of that 
planet which indicates this tragedy.

Yogakdraka Mars occupies the 2 nd house and aspects

as well. From major dasa lord Jupiter, Mercury owns

Thus, Mercury becomes the killer of her husband as 
reckoned from major period lord Jupiter. 

Mrs, Indira Gandhi was assassinated on October 
31 st , 1984 in the major period of Saturn in the sub-

certainly. Rahu obtains vargottama navarhsa. The

of Mrs. Indira Gandhi. In spite of best efforts, he 
could not be hospitalized and expired on November 
5 th , 1984 when she was passing through Rahu-Moon 
period. Rahu occupies the 8 th house and is associated 
with Mars. Moon is heavily afflicted due to 
conjunction with inimical Venus and Sun and is 
also aspected by malefic Saturn. Therefore, subperiod 
of Moon in the major period of Rahu resulted into 
plightful demise of her husband. In this horoscope, 
9 th house is very strong and aspected kendradhipati 
Jupiter as well. The husband was a simple instructor. 
He had purchased many acres of land at a very cheap 
rate, just in few thousand rupees in Ghaziabad, Due 
to her good fortune, many big organisations and 
factories established around that land and the cost 
of land multiplied thousands of time. By God's grace, 
she is playing in billions of rupees and she is a 
leading land lady of Ghaziabad and now she has 
become a colonizer. 

Husband Expired Within Two Months Of Marriage 

Case No. 3.30 - (Horoscope No. 30} 

In this horoscope, the combination of widowhood is 
strongly present due to placement of Mars in 8 th 
house in Saturn's sign Aquarius. 8 th lord Saturn is 
retrograde and joins the 11 th and Mars and Saturn 
aspect each other and afflict the 8 th house. This 
clearly signifies early widowhood and almost no 
marital happiness. She got married during sub-period 
of Moon in the major period of Rahu on 
June 5 th , 1993. Within 2 months, in same dasa bhuktU 
her husband expired. Association of Rahu and Moon 
in the 7 th house can be seen. The death of husband 
took place during sub-period of Moon in the major 
period of Rahw Affliction of 4 th house is also there as 
4 th lord Venus joins the 6 th house in inimical sign 
under papakartari yoga.

200 Foretelling Widowhood 

In our society, it is generally presumed that 
mangali girl suffers widowhood, if she gets married 
with a non-maripaftboy. It is absolutely wrong. Mars 
does play a vital role in giving rise to various 
adversities in marriage and conjugal bliss like all 
other malefics. There are various other factors and 
planetary combinations which cause widowhood, 
even if the husband is also mangalv 

In case No. 3.1 she lost her husband within 5 
months of marriage. She is not mangali because 
yogakaraka Mars occupies the 5 th house, 
Bhagyadhipati Jupiter aspects 7 th , 9 th and 11 th house 
but even then Jupiter could not save widowhood. 
In this horoscope birth took place in the first pada 
of mutd naksatrcL Mars aspects 8 th house, Saturn 
aspects 12 th and 7 th . Bhagyadhipati Jupiter falls 
close over the axis of Rahu and Kettu Ketu is only 
one degree apart from Jupiter. Thus the lord of the 
house of fortune is heavily afflicted* 

In cose No. 3.2 Jupiter occupies own sign Pisces 
in the 7 th house. It is believed that Jupiter in the 
7 th brings all kinds of happiness, prosperity and 
long life to husband if it occupies the 7 th house. 
She is not mangali as Mars joins the 9 th house. Why 
did she suffer widowhood within 3 years of marriage? 
It happened due to her birth in Jyestha naksatra. 
In fact she was married to a boy who was also born 
in Jyestha naksatra. She was married in Venus- 
Rahu period and suffered widowhood in Venus- 
Jupiter period. Here Jupiter has formed Hamsa 
Mahapurusa Raja Yoga. It is 7 th lord and placed in 
7 th , even then caused widowhood in its bhuktl Here 
Venus and Jupiter both are marakesa. Let me 
hasten to add that Jupiter-Venus or Venus-Jupiter 
brings havoc in the life if at least one is adversely 
placed. 



Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 201 

In Case No. 3.3, she is not rnangall as Mars joins 
the 10 th house with 10 th lord Venus, there is no 
affliction of the 7 th or 8 th house. The lord of the 
ascendant Saturn is well placed in Trikona, then 
why did she suffer widowhood within 10 months 
of marriage? She got married during Rdhu-Rahu 
period and lost her husband during i?dhu-Jupiter. 
it was really a tough job to foresee widowhood in 
this case. Saturn and Mercury both are retrograde. 
Sun and Saturn who own the 8 th and 2 nd house 
respectively, aspect each other and fall in the 
constellation of Mars and Saturn respectively. This 
is fatal for husband because 8 th house indicates 
happiness of married life and 2 nd house Indicates 
family life and death of husband. More over lord 
of 6 th and 9 th house Mercury and the lord of 8 th 
Sun are conjoined in the 11 th under papakartari 
yoga. Mars and Saturn are 6 th and 8 th from each 
other. Mars aspects lagna and lagna lord both. 
Saturn aspects the 7 th , the 8 th lord Sun, 6 th and 
9 th lord Mercury and the 2 nd house. Venus and Mars 
are conjoined in svdti nak$atra and they are closely 
associated within 3°. Rahu afflicted Jupiter adversely 
and that brought such an early widowhood to the 
native. 

In Case No. 3A f fifth and eighth lord Jupiter 
occupies the 8 th house. She is not rnangall Yogakaraka 
Mars occupies the 5 th house. She lost her husband 
in air crash within 4Vi years of marriage in Rahu- 
Jupiter period. Here the placement of Mars in the 
5 th house and joint aspect of Saturn and Mars over 
the 8 th house and Rahu is responsible for her 
widowhood. Here the 8 th lord Jupiter joins 7 th and 
7 th lord Saturn is afflicted due to its placement over 
the nodes and aspect the 8 th house. 

In this Case No. 3.5, she is not mahgali as Mars 
joins the 10 th house, 7 th or 8 th house is also not 



202 Foretelling Widowhood 

afflicted. Jupiter aspects the 7 th house, 9 th house 
and 11 th house. Here 9 th lord Mercury is exalted 
in the 9 th house. Jupiter occupies own sign Saturn 
occupies lagna in own sign, 7 th lord Moon is placed 
in Aries and in 1 st pada of Asvirii naksatra and is 
aspected by malefic Mars. The 7 th house is under 
the adverse influence of Mars who becomes the 8 th 
lord if reckoned from Moon. Mutual aspect between 
Saturn and Mars is also adverse for family life. She 
lost her husband during Moon-Venus dasa bhuktL 

In Case No. 3.6, she suffered widowhood during 
sub-period of Moon in major period of Moon. 
Because Moon falls in Jyesfhd naksatra in 10 th 
house. She is not mangcdL 7 th lord Sun is placed 
in 12 th house and aspected by Saturn. Here Jupiter 
occupies the 8 th house which indicates long life and 
akhanda saubhagya but she lost her husband at 
the age of 45 because retrograde Jupiter is malefic 
in the 8 th house especially for Aquarius ascendant. 
Here Jupiter is marakesa and retrograde. Jupiter 
should be treated like malefic Mars. Due to the 
birth in jyestha and placement of Moon in the sign 
of Mars under heavy affliction of Rahu and Saturn. 
She suffered widowhood. We have seen that if Moon 
falls in the sign of Mars and is aspected by Mars 
and if it is also associated with malefics, one will 
suffer widowhood. 

In all these cases, which are illustrated here, the 
females are not mangali from ascendant. The 
affliction of 7 th or 8 th house is also not present and 
even there is no indication of loss of husband at 
the preliminary judgement. But almost all these 
females suffered early widowhood. We have also 
come across the observation that Jupiter does not 
always save widowhood. By chance in all the 
illustrations except a few, either it was the major 



Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 203 

period of Jupiter or the sub-period of Jupiter which 
resulted into widowhood. We have mentioned that 
Jupiter in a female horoscope indicates saubhagya. 
If Jupiter owns malefic houses, trikas or it is 
adversely placed and if it is retrograde and has 
anything to do with the 7 th or 8 th house either by 
occupation or aspect, that will intensify the chances 
of widowhood* 

The 5 th house is a triangle but if Mars is placed 
there, widowhood may come in evidence* This is 
very bad disposition of Mars in the horoscope of 
any female. 

In case of horoscope nos. 1, 4, 16, 24, 26 we have 
seen that position of Mars in the 5 th has brought 
great disaster in their lives and made them widow. 
These are few important points to be taken a serious 
view of, while examining the life of husband, i.e., 
the saubhagya. These are in addition to general 
combination which are given in various classical 
works and are stated in the beginning. 

If Moon falls in the sign of Mars, i.e., in Scorpio 
or Aries and birth constellation is that of MuLa, i.e. 
jyestha or asvinl if Mars is so placed in the birth 
chart that Moon may receive full aspect of Mars, 
widowhood may take place. If Moon is associated 
with Mars or there is mutual aspect between Moon 
and Mars, the possibility of widowhood becomes 
stronger, provided any of the Moon or Mars own 
trikas or are related with the concerning houses 
or signs. If so, the death of husband can take place 
during Moon's, Mercury's, KetiCs or Mars dasa 
bhukti as the case may be. If Saturn, Rahu or Ketu 
also get associated with this planetary combination, 
the curse of widowhood will appear soon in life. 

If Jupiter falls in the 7 th house identical to 
Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces, one should not think of 



204 Foretelling Widowhood 

happy and everlasting conjugal life* In fact placement 
of Jupiter in the 7 th house in fiery sign, i.e. Aries, 
Leo or Sagittarius is encouraging for lasting 
happiness. Retrograde Jupiter in the 7 th or 8 th house 
should be examined like Mars. In case No* 2, Jupiter 
and Pisces In the 7 th house caused widowhood in 
the 3 rd year of marriage. In case No. 4, Jupiter in 
Aquarius in the 7 th , resulted Into early widowhood 
after four and half years. If Jupiter owns 7 th and 
joins 8 th under mutual aspect with Mars, early 
widowhood will take place. Similarly, if 8 th lord 
Jupiter is placed in the 7 th house and Mars aspects 
7 th or 8 th house, widowhood will appear soon after 
marriage. Therefore, any kind of high and favourable 
results should not be expected if Jupiter joins 7 th 
or 8 th house. 

If one finds difficulty to judge whether the 
combination will really make the female widow, he 
should examine the 4 th house and its lord. The 
placement of 4 th lord In trikas (6 th , 8 th or 12 th ) or 
the placement of lords of trikas in 4 th will strengthen 
the probabilities of widowhood. Placement of Ketu 
should be examined just like Mars. If Ketu and Mars 
both afflict 7 th and 8 th house, the widowhood will 
come soon after marriage. 

If 7 th lord falls in. trikas over the axis of nodes, 
that is also adverse for the married life and 
longevity of spouse. We have made observation that 
if Mars simply occupies the 7 th house and is 
aspected by lagna lord or the lagna is aspected or 
owned by Jupiter, death of husband will not take 
place. If lagna is placed under papakartari yoga and 
Mars is retrograde in the 7 th house, that will bring 
separation but definitely not widowhood. If the 
ascendant and 7 th house are hemmed between Sun 
and Saturn in a way that Sun is aspected by 
Saturn, the happiness of married life Is denied 



Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 205 

generally, if the lagna lord is weak, the marriage 
may be completely denied. 

In various cases, it has been found that if Mars 
and Saturn aspect each other and one of them owns 
the 7 th house, serious problems in marriage appear 
but if Mars is 7 th lord and occupies own sign or 
the sign of Saturn and is aspected by Saturn, 
widowhood will be the outcome. 

If 7 th lord Jupiter is placed in 8 th house and 
aspected by 8 th lord Mars, the widowhood will 
appear after a few years of marriage. The worst 
combination for widowhood may be the joint influence 
of Saturn, Mars and Rahu over the 8 th house* For 
a long life of husband, Mars and Ketu should not 
occupy 7 th and 8 th house respectively. If the 7 th lord 
is placed in the 6 th or 8 th house under papakartari 
yoga, such havocs are bound to come* We have 
found that the placement of 7 th lord in the 6 th may 
give rise to separation if afflicted and if 7 th lord 
occupies the 8 th house under affliction, the loss of 
spouse generally appears. 

It is believed that Jupiter's aspect or association 
with Mars appreciably neutralizes or reduces kuja 
dosa. It is also believed that the conjunction or 
mutual aspect of Moon and Mars will nullify the 
kuja dosa if Mars occupies any of the sensitive 
houses. Our humble opinion is not in favour of this 
view. In our various articles and books, we have 
tried to illustrate and proved the fact that Jupiter's 
aspect and association with Mars enhances the. 
kuja dosa. Similarly, the intensity of kuja dosa gets 
multiplied if Moon is associated with Mars or has 
mutual aspect with Mars. 

It is also believed that if Jupiter aspects the 7 th 
house, all adversities regarding marital happiness 
get nullified. In our humble observation of hundreds 
of horoscopes, we can support this view. In various 



206 Foretelling Widowhood 

horoscopes, aspect of Jupiter In 7 th house caused 
widowhood in its own dasd bhuktt Retrograde 
Jupiter in the 7 th house, if owns upchaya or trikas 
is more adverse. We have made an attempt to 
explain the role of Jupiter in the 8 th house earlier 
in the concluding paragraphs of the subject. 

Many times, we generally examine the rasi chart 
and navdmsa chart but I always emphasise on 
bhdua chart as well. If ascendant lord Mars occupies 
9 th house and gets shifted in 8 th house and is 
aspected by any malefic, widowhood should be 
predicted. Placement of Mars in 7 th or 8 th house 
tends the female towards widowhood. If the lord of 
the ascendant is strong, widowhood will be prevented. 
If 9 th and 7 th house are also strong but Mars, Saturn, 
rdhu or ketu are adversely placed in the 7 th or 8 th 
or there is any combination of loss of husband, the 
Intensity will be heavily reduced and widowhood 
will not take pla.ce. We therefore, opine to examine 
the strength of ascendant which is of foremost 
Important. Secondly, the strength of 9 th house, 
thirdly the strength of 7 th house should be judged 
to reach the final conclusion. In many horoscopes, 
strong combinations of loss of life partner are 
present but widowhood was prevented because the 
ascendant and other concerning houses were quite 
strong and well fortified. 

It is believed, due to classical aphorisms that kufa 
dosa gets nullified if Mars falls in Leo or Aquarius 
anywhere in the horoscope. We do not support this 
'view at all. In the horoscope of Mrs. Maneka Gandhi, 
yogakaraka Mars joins 8 th in Aquarius. Jupiter and 
Mars aspected each other, even then she suffered loss 
of husband at 24 years of age on 23rd June of 1980. 
In case Nos. 15 and 30, Mars joins Aquarius in 
8 th , even then, they suffered terrible sorrow and 
grief of early widowhood. I believe that placement 



Early Widowhood: An Astrological Exploration 207 

of Mars in any sign in 8^ is worst for longevity 
of husband. 

If Mars occupies the ascendant or the 2 nd house 
in association with Rahu and Ketu, widowhood may 
take place around 36 th to 45 th year of age. If many 
maleflcs occupy the 7 th house or if Mars and Ketu 
conjoin in the 7 th house or if Mars joins the 7 th 
and Ketu joins 8 th , the female becomes the cause 
of death, suicide, accident or murder of her husband. 

A common belief in our society, among our 
families prevails that if the girl is mangalu she is 
likely to suffer heavily after marriage. On the 
contrary, it is also accepted that non mangali girls 
will have high degree of conjugal bliss. Mrs. Sonia 
Gandhi is not mangali but she suffered a lot when 
her husband Mr. Rajiv Gandhi was killed on 
May 2 I st , 1991. She has also faced so many violent 
deaths in her family. Here the lord of lagna Moon 
who joins the 12 th house, is under the mutual 
aspect with Mars. The lord of 7 th and 8 th house joins 
the ascendant under the aspect of Mars, If Saturn 
and Mars are 8 th and 6 th from each other, and the 
ascendant is weak and any of them owns 6 th house, 
such marital disaster is bound to come. If 7 th or 
8 th house is aspected by Mars and Saturn both, 
similar adversities will appear. 

If Rahu or Ketu are placed in the 8 th house, Mars 
and Saturn aspect 8 th house from anywhere, 
widowhood will surely be there. Similarly, the 
conjunction of Mars and Rahu gives rise to widowhood 
under peculiar circumstances. If Moon is afflicted 
in one way or the other or it is placed under papa- 
kartari yoga, problems in married life will arrive. 
If Moon is placed in the sign of Mars and aspected 
by them, the loss of husband may take place. If 
Moon is placed anywhere in Scorpio or Aries in 



208 Foretelling Widowhood 

asvinl or jyestha and is aspected by Mars as well, 
the probability of widowhood becomes stronger. 

Each case has different configuration of planets 
and the whole horoscope should be examined 
carefully, in one horoscope, placement of Mars and 
Saturn, Mars and Rahu or Mars and Ketu in the 
8 th house can result in widowhood while in other 
horoscope, It may not do so if the ascendant and 
9 th house are strong and well fortified. We therefore, 
suggest to examine navafhsa chart and bhava chart 
as well before finally reaching any conclusion. If 
the affliction of the concerning houses are heavier, 
ascendant is weak and 9 th house is also not well 
disposed, the loss of husband will take place at 
an early age. If affliction is less and the ascendant 
and 9 th house are strong, the widowhood will not 
take place before 40 years of age. It is essential 
to know whether there is any specific and strong 
combination of widowhood in the birth chart. If 
such combination is present, the appropriate dasa 
bhukti should be worked out only after overall 
judgment of the birth chart. Many preventive 
measures may also be observed from early life, if 
the combinations of disaster are found present in 
the horoscope. If the remedial measure selected by 
us are appropriate and suitable, the curse of 
widowhood can certainly be converted into ever 
lasting happy married life. 



Chapter-4 
TIMING WIDOWHOOD 



Once, my astrological guru told me that after 
a thorough examination and careful 
judgement of the horoscope, one can foretell 
all events of life correctly upto ninety-nine percent. 
However, the timing of events is really a tough 
exercise and it is not possible to time each and every 
event correctly and precisely. In fact, there are so 
many missing links in astrology, which 1 believe, 
have been burnt in the fire of Nalanda University, it 
was Ailauddin Khiiji who destroyed invaluable 
treasure of knowledge of various subjects when he 
invaded India. As the record of history reveals that 
this fire was burning for nearly six months, it can 
be imagined how many manuscripts, books and 
literature were present in Nalanda which was the 
first and foremost university of India. 

Like all other aspects of life, it is really tough 
to tell the time of widowhood too with fine accuracy. 
We have vimsottari dasd system* astottari dasd and 
transits of planets including astaka varga with us 
to help in timing events. Apart from vimsottari and 
astottaru there are so many other dasd systems like 
kdlacakra dasd, Gemini dasd 9 cara dasd and 
gatydtrrtaka dasd systems, which are not much in 
use. We will confine ourselves to vimsottari dasd 
system only and transits. It will not be out of place 
to mention that only those events can take place 
in life, which are indicated by the lords of major 



2 1 2 Foretelling Widowhood 

and sub-period during particular course of time. 
It depends on our knowledge, experience and 
intelligence that how appropriate use of astrological 
rules, we make in making accurate prediction and 
observations. Transits of planets can only help in 
fine-tuning of time of the events indicated by dasa 
bhukti during that period. 

We will attempt sincerely and honestly, to work 
out the time of widowhood of a few cases for the 
benefit of our readers. However, before that, let us 
look at few aphorisms from classics. 

•jrgr "3[c3t "are cgpfr "«H<yoiai^r iSterosr "s^iTi^^siicrd^Tf^r 

1. It means that the widowhood takes place during 
dasa bhukti of the navarhsa lord occupied by 
the lord of the 8 th house provided malefics 
occupy the 8 th house. 

2. It is not at all essential that widowhood will 
take place during the dasa bhukti of Mars, 
Saturn or Rahu if these planets are responsible 
for causing widowhood. It may take place 
during the period of 2 nd lord or the planet 
occupied by 2 nd house as 2 nd house is 8 th from 
7 th and governs death of husband. The sub- 
period lord may be 2 nd from the major dasa 
lord responsible for widowhood or the sub- 
period will be of 7 th or 8 th lord from mahadasa 
lord or the planet posited there or may bring 
such disasters during their bhukti The planets 
occupying or aspecting or making relationship 
with the 2 nd house of 2 nd lord, 8 th house of 8 th 
lord may bring widowhood, or death of the 
spouse. 8 th house is actually 2 nd from 7 th . 
The 2 nd house is 8 th from 7 th house and indicates 
death of husband. So the 8 th and 2 nd house 
should be examined for the judgement of 



Timing Widowhood 213 

widowhood In the horoscope of a female. Acharya 
Mukund Ballabh writes in his great classic 
Phalita Martanda under Stri Jataka chapter as 
sloka 18:- 

fl^sfcd^ ffireracTr fSra3r ^a^fe^T ?rs^r fijei^r "oraf2>r 

If malefic is placed in the 8 th house Jroin lagna 
in the horoscope of a woman, the widowhood 
will take place during the major or sub-period 
of the navdmsa lord occupied by the malefic 
occupant of the 8 th house. If a benefic is placed 
in the 2 nd house (benefic by nature, placement 
and lordship, such benefic should be free from 
malefic aspect or association) the woman will 
die in front of her husband, i.e., she will obtain 
akhanda saubhagycL Achaiya Mukund Ballabh 
further writes in sloka 20 of Phalita Martanda 

The husband and wife will die together if the 
8 th house in a female horoscope is strong and 
it is aspected or associated with beneflcs and 
malefics. If lord of 7 th and lagna are conjoined 
or there is mutual exchange between lord of 
1 st house and 7 th house and in addition to that 
7 th lord is associated with beneflcs or a benefic; 
the death of wife and husband will be together. 
This Is said by all astrologers.

Chapter 16 Jataka Pdrydta, Volume II 

If malefic occupies the 8 th house, the wife dies 
during the dasa bhukti of navarhsa lord of that 
malefic. If benefics occupy the 2 nd house, she 
will not suffer widowhood. On the contrary, she 
will die prior to her husband. If Moon falls in 
Taurus, Virgo, Leo or Scorpio, there will be few 
children only. 

3. Widowhood may come during dasd bhukti of the 
navarhsa lord of the planet occupied by 8 th house 
or the lord of the 8 th house. First, the planet 
responsible for widowhood may be worked out. 
The navarhsa lord of that planet may create such 
havoc during their dasd bhukti Find out the 
navarhsa lord of the planet, which is the worst 
malefic and responsible to cause widowhood. 
Find out the sarvdstaka varga points in the sign 
occupied by him. That will be the age during 
which widowhood may occur. 

4. Subtract the longitude of the ascendant or 
ascendant lord from the longitude of the 7 th 
lord, when Jupiter will transit over the point 
so obtained, widowhood or divorce may come 
in evidence. However, the transit should only 
be used when dasd bhukti is indicating 
widowhood strongly. The use of transit is to 
make the prediction more precise and to time 
the event correctly within a shorter span. 

5. It is generally believed that the combination 
of Jupiter and Venus in the ascendant or 7 th 
house will bestow lot of good fortune in respect 



Timing Widowhood 215 

of life partner but it is not so in true sense. 
Generally, Venus-Jupiter dasa bhukti creates 
problems in married life, if at least one of these 
planets own malefic houses. If the longitude 
of Venus is less than the longitude of Jupiter 
and both fall In the constellation of a malefic 
or obtain navdmsa of a malefic planet, there 
will be loss of spouse. 

6. Placement of Mars with Sun, Ketu or J?dhu 
either in the ascendant or in 7 th , 8* or 12 th 
house may bring loss of life partner... 

7. If the lord of the 7 th house is conjoined with 
Saturn and is aspected by Mars, one will suffer 
widowhood provided Moon and Rahu join 6 th 
house in addition to that. 

8. If the combination of widowhood is present with 
strong Mars under the aspect of Saturn, early 
widowhood is likely. 

Any yoga regarding widowhood should be examined 
properly before final conclusion. We will be 
discussing here the art of timing widowhood. It is 
a tough task. I believe that one may be successful 
In timing widowhood if he is well versed with the 
rules and observation regarding this mishappening 
of life. Here the cases are from different walks of 
life and all cases have different configuration for 
working of the time of widowhood. If we study the 
dasa bhukti which caused widowhood and why did 
it do so, 1 strongly believe there will be precise 
accuracy in our foretelling time of widowhood. 
These cases have been examined and explained 
here:- 

Case 4.1 - (Horoscope No.l-uide p. 134) 

Marriage - June 24 th , 1994 at 25 years of age 
during Sun-Mercuiy dasa bhukti 



216 Foretelling Widowhood 

Widowhood - November 4 th , 1994 after 414 months 
of marriage during Sun-Mercuiy dasd bhuktL 

Mercury is under the influence of Mars, it is 
combust and falls in inimical constellation of Moon. 
The 2 nd house which indicates marriage and death 
of husband is owned by Sun. The 2 nd house from 
Sun is owned by Mercury who is heavily afflicted 
by Mars. Moreover Mercuiy obtains navdmsa of 
Mars, therefore, during the bhukti of Mercury in 
the major period of Sun, she suffered loss of 
husband. 

Case 4.2 - (Horoscope No.2-uide p. 137) 

Marriage - March 6 th , 1996 at 20 years of age 
during Venus-Rdhu dasd bhukti 

Widowhood - March 8 th , 1999 in Venus- Jupiter 
dasd bhukti 

According to the sloka quoted above, Ketu who 
joins the 8 th house falls in the navaxhsa of Venus. 
Therefore, in major period of Venus, widowhood took 
place when sub-period of Jupiter was operating. 
Jupiter is 7 th lord under vargottama navdrhscL It 
cannot be believed that she suffered widowhood in 
Venus-Jupiter period. Jupiter is placed under papa- 
kartari yoga. Moon falls in jyestha naksatra and is 
aspected by Mars. This combination is responsible 
for widowhood. Here Jupiter is 8 th lord from Mars 
and 2 nd lord from Moon. Therefore, Jupiter's sub- 
period killed her husband. It may be noted that 
if Jupiter joins 7 th house in a watery sign under 
affliction, adversity may appear soon after marriage. 

Case 4,3 - (Horoscope No.3-uide p. 140) 

Marriage - May 8 th , 1996 during Rahu-Rahu dasd 
bhukti. 

Widowhood - April 17 th , 1997 during Rdhu-Jupiter 
dasd bhuktL 



Timing Widowhood 217 

This is a typical case of widowhood. She got 
married on May 8 th , 1996 in Rdhu-Rahu period and 
Rahu is placed in 12 th house with 12 th lord Jupiter. 
Her husband expired on April 17th, 1997 during 
Rahu Jupiter dasa bhuktL Rahu obtains navamsa 
of Mars, Jupiter is 7 th lord from Moon and joins 
the 4 th house as reckoned from Moon* Jupiter is 
certainly a malefic for Capricorn ascendant and as 
soon as Jupiter's sub-period in Rahu began, the 
husband suddenly lost his life, if Jupiter is afflicted 
in the horoscope of a female, the adversity may 
come in major or sub-period of Jupiter. Here 
afflicted Jupiter aspected the 8 th house and caused 
the tragedy within 10 months after marriage. 

Case 4.4 - (Horoscope No.4-uide p. 142) 

Marriage - October 5 th , 1973 Rahu- Jupiter period 

Widowhood - March 2 nd , 1978 JMhu-Mercury 
period 

Second marriage - September 29 th , 1979 

First son - March 1 st , 1975 

Second son - October 17 th , 1980 

Jupiter occupies the 7 th house in Aquarius. Here 
Jupiter is forming kendra trikona Raja Yoga. She 
suffered widowhood A l A years after marriage during 
J?d/iu-Mercuiy period. R&hu joins the 8 th house and 
Mercury is 8 th from Rahu and owns 7 th house from 
Rahu and 11 th house from ascendant. Here Mercury 
obtains navamsa of debilitation, it is combust too. 
Seeing the position of Mars in 5 th and Rahu in the 
8 th and Saturn in the 2 nd house, the widowhood may 
be expected within 36 to 45 years of age. If the 
marriage could be avoided during Rdftu-Jupiter 
period, it was quite possible to save widowhood. 
Here 1 want to say that planets which indicate loss 
of husband, will not essentially cause widowhood 
during their dasa bhuktL dasa bhukti of those 



218 Foretelling Widowhood 

planets may not come in life at all. The widowhood 
may appear during the dasa bhukti of those planets 
which show the possibility of adversity due to 
affliction, conjunction or aspect by malefics and 
during dasa of planets which are related to the 
concerning houses as well. Navarhsa chart should 
certainly be examined carefully. In the present 
case, Rahu in 12 th , Mercury in 8 th under debilitation 
in navarhsa chart shows adverse results because 
Mercury is 2 nd lord from navarhsa lagna. In Rasi 
chart, Rahu and Mercury are in khadastaka posi- 
tion and Mercury is 2 nd lord which also shows the 
death of husband as it is 8 th from 7 th , Mercury is 
8 th from Rahu. 

Case 4.5 - (Horoscope No.5-ufde p. 144) 

Marriage - February 10 th , 1986 during Venus- 
Jupiter dasa bhukti 

Widowhood - December 4 th , 2000 during Moon- 
Venus dasa bhukti 

One daughter - June 29 th , 1992 

7 th lord Moon falls in asvinl in Aries and the moon 
is aspected by its dispositor Mars. Mutual aspect 
between Mars and Saturn is also responsible for 
this great tragedy. The death of husband took place 
in the sub-period of Venus in the major period of 
Moon. Venus is the lord of 2 nd and 7 th house as 
reckoned from 7 th lord Moon and Venus is adversely 
placed in the 8 th house in Leo with Sun. Sun and 
Venus are placed in purva phalgunl constellation 
and in the same navarhsa of Libra where the Sun 
obtains its debilitation. 

I believe that the position of the 2 nd lord from 
lagna should be considered as it is 8 th from the 7 th 
house and rules death of husband as well. Simi- 
larly, the position 2 nd lord from the position of 7 th 



Timing Widowhood 219 

lord is also very inauspicious. Mars is the karaka 
of widowhood and Jupiter Is the karaka of husband. 
So, examine the ascendant, the position of 7 th lord 
as lagna. Mars and Jupiter, to reach to the final 
conclusion. Here Venus sub-period caused widow- 
hood. Venus is 8 th from ascendant and ascendant 
lord. From 7 th lord Moon, Venus is the lord of 2 nd 
and 7 th house and joins the 5 th house in Leo. From 
Jupiter, Venus Is the lord of 8 th and 3 rd house. From 
Mars, Venus is the 8 th lord and joins the 11 th house 
with Sun in Leo, Thus, Venus becomes maraka for 
husband from all angles. The widowhood came 
during the major period of Moon because Moon 
occupies the Aries and is aspected by Mars and 
Saturn. This is the strong indication of widowhood. 
Widowhood was possible in Moon-Mars dasa bhukti 
or in Moon-Venus dasa bhuktL Placement of ret- 
rograde Jupiter in own sign Pisces, in 3 rd house 
and its aspect over the 7 th and 9 th house resulted 
in the conjugal bliss for about 15 years. 

Case 4.6 - (Horoscope No.6-uide p. 146) 

Marriage - January 30 th , 1975 during Ketu- 
Saturn dasa bhuktL 

Widowhood - July 26 th , 2002 during Moon-Moon 
dasa bhuktL 
Birth of first daughter - April 13 th , 1978 
Birth of second daughter - July 3 rd , 1985 
Here Moon is placed in jyestha naksatra in 10 th 
house in Scorpio under debilitation. Moon receives 
the adverse aspect of Mars as well. Moon and Mars 
are in khadastaka position. Therefore, widowhood 
took place when she was running under sub-period 
of Moon in the major period of Moon. Moon is 7 th 
lord as reckoned from 7 th lord Suri. From Mars-Moon 



220 Foretelling Widowhood 

is 4 th lord and joins the 8 th house in conjunction 
with Rahu and Saturn. From Jupiter, Mars is 
placed in the 8 th house and Mars is the dispositor 
of Moon, therefore, the affliction of Moon is maxi- 
mum as regards to loss of husband. 

Case 4.7 - (Horoscope No.7~vide p. 149) 

Marriage April 27 th . 1999 during Satum-Venus 
dasa bhukti 

Widowhood - June, 27 th , 1999 during Saturn- 
Venus dasa bhukti 

Widowhood took place during Saturn-Venus dasa 
bhukti Venus is lord of 2 nd and 7 th house from 
ascendant and joins the 12 th house under exaltation 
with Rahu. Placement of 2 nd lord in the 12 th house 
with malefic may cause widowhood in dasa bhukti 
of that planet. Here 7 th lord Venus is afflicted by 
Rahu in thel2th house* Venus owns 3 rd and 7 th 
house from its own position. Retrograde Mars 
occupies the 8 th house and Venus is 12 th and 7 th 
lord from there and is afflicted by Rahu. Venus is 
10 th and 2 nd lord as reckoned from Jupiter and falls 
in 7 th house over the axis of Rahu and Ketu, Thus, 
Venus becomes the maraka for husband. In this 
case, the marriage should have been avoided during 
Rdhit-Venus dasa bhukti 

Case 4.8 - (Horoscope No,8-iude p. 151) 

Marriage - in the 17 th year during Mars-Mars 
dasa bhukti 

Widowhood - in 18 th year during Maxs-Rahu dasa 
bhukti. 

The lagna and 6 th lord Venus joins the 8 th house 
in association with inimical Moon and Rahu and 
is aspected by Saturn and inimical Jupiter. 7 th lord 
Mars occupies own sign Aries in 12 th house under 



Timing Widowhood 221 

mutual aspect with Saturn. Widowhood took place 
during sub-period of Rahu in the major period of 
Mars. From the ascendant, 7 th lord Mars joins the 
12 th house and is aspected by Saturn, this indicates 
severe harm or loss of husband. 

From Jupiter-Moon Venus and Rahu are con- 
joined in the 7 th house and are aspected by 8 th lord 
Saturn. Jupiter is afflicted due to conjunction with 
Ketu and due to mutual aspect with lagna lord 
Venus. 8 th house indicates pan of married life and 
it is owned by Jupiter who occupies the 2 nd house 
and falls over the axis of Rahu and Ketiu Therefore, 
she suffered widowhood during the major period of 
Mars who is most heavily afflicted and adversely 
placed under mutual aspect with Saturn. Rahu is 
placed in 8 th from lagna and 7 th house from Jupiter. 
Therefore, the husband expired in the accident 
when the sub-period of Mars in major period of 
Rahu was operative over her. 

Case 4.9 - (Horoscope No.9-uide p. 154) 

Marriage - March 7 th , 1979 during Jupiter- 
Mercury dasd bhukti 

Widowhood - March 19 th , 1985 during Jupiter- 
Mars dasd bhukti 

A son born on February 20 th , 1980 and a daughter 
on February 18 th , 1982. 

Jupiter Is 4 th and 7 th lord and occupies Martian 
sign Aries. 8 th lord Mars occupies the 2 nd house and 
has mutual aspect with Saturn. This is a classical 
case when she suffered widowhood when sub-period 
of Mars was operating over her in the major period 
of Jupiter. If 7 th lord is placed in 8 th house and 
8 m lord aspects the same, widowhood may take 
place during their dasd bhukti. From 7 th lord 
Jupiter-Mars is 7 th and from Mars, Jupiter is 7 th .

Thus, Jupiter-Mars dasa bhukti will cause widow- 
hood is Indicated from all angle. 

Case 4.10 - (Horoscope No.lO-inde p. 156) 

Widowhood - February 28 th , 1982 during Rahu 
Jupiter dasa bhukti 

Yogakaraka Mars occupies the 7 th house and Ketu 
occupies the 8 th house. Jupiter is the 8 th lord and 
is afflicted in the 10 th house. Jupiter obtains 
navamsa of Saturn who is marakesa for Leo ascen- 
dant. There is mutual exchange between Mars and 
Saturn in this horoscope. Rahu is placed in the 
8 th house from mars, i.e., 2 nd from ascendant. 
Jupiter is the 8 th lord from ascendant and 7 th lord 
from Rahu. Therefore, her husband committed 
suicide on February 28 th , 1982 when the sub-period 
of Jupiter in the major period of Rahu was running. 
For Leo ascendant, Jupiter is a malefic, therefore, 
the widowhood took place in Jupiter's sub-period. 
Jupiter-Rdftu both obtains navamsa of Saturn who 
is marakesa for husband. Therefore, dasa bhukti of 
Rdhu-Jupiter proved disastrous for her. 

Case 4.11 - (Horoscope No.ll-uide p. 158) 

Marriage - October 87 during Jupiter-Jupiter 
dasa bhukti 

Widowhood - January 89 during Jupiter-Jupiter 
dasa bhukti 

Strong indication of widowhood is present in this 
horoscope as Moon-Ketu-Mercury are present in 7 th 
house. The Saturn aspects this combination. Such 
a serious affliction of 7 th house by Mars, Ketu, 
Mercury and Saturn will certainly cause very early 
widowhood. The manlage took place in Jupiter- 
Jupiter dasa bhukti and widowhood also took place 



Timing Widowhood 223 

during the same bhukti. Here retrograde Jupiter 
who is the lord of the 8 th house is placed in the 
2 nd house under the aspect of malefic Mars and 
inimical Venus* The Jupiter becomes a marakesa 
for husband. Therefore, the husband died in the 
Are accident in the sub-period of Jupiter in the 
major period of Jupiter. From 7 th lord Mars, Jupiter 
is placed in the 8 th house and that automatically 
becomes a maraka for husband, in navamsa chart, 
Mars and Saturn are conjoined in the 8th house 
and 12 th from the position of the lagna lord Venus, 
in navamsa chart, lord of the 8 th house is Jupiter. 
Mars and Saturn obtain navamsa of Jupiter, there- 
fore, Jupiter becomes killer for husband from all 
angles. 

Case 4.12 - (Horoscope No«12-uide p. 160) 

Marriage - February 9 th , 1974 during Ketu - Moon 
dasa bhukti 

Widowhood - March 16 th , 1976 during Ketu- 
Jupiter dasa bhukti 

Mars occupies the 7 th house of its own and 8 th 
and 11 th lord Jupiter who is placed in the 
ascendant, aspects the 7 th house and Mars. 
Widowhood took place in the sub-period of Jupiter 
in the major period of Ketu. Jupiter is the lord of 
the 8 th house and is aspected by Mars. Therefore, 
the accidental death of her husband took place in 
the sub-period of Jupiter in the major period of 
Ketu. It is a rule that navarhsa lord of the malefic 
placed in the 8 th house may give rise to widowhood. 
Here Rahu is the dispositor of Jupiter and Rahu 
obtains the navamsa of Jupiter as well. Therefore, 
Jupiter's sub-period was fatal for her husband. Ketu 
also acts like Mars and its aspect over the 8 th house 



224 Foretelling Widowhood 

shows widowhood during its own major period. In 
case there is lesser adversity in regard to span of 
married life, probability of widowhood could be in 
the major period of Venus in the sub-period of 
Jupiter or Mars. 

Case 4.13 - (Horoscope No.l3-vide p. 162) 

Marriage - March 11 th , 1961 during Moon - Rahu 
dasa bhukti 

Widowhood - January 10 th , 1962 during Moon - 
Jupiter dasa bhukti 

One of the worst combination of widowhood is 
present in this birth chart. It may be noted that 
2 nd and 7 th lord Mars occupies the 8 th house and 
this is sufficient to give rise to widowhood to any 
female. Here Saturn occupies the 2 nd house. There 
is mutual aspect between Saturn and Mars, so 
widowhood was destined to her soon after marriage. 
Moon occupies the 7 th house in martian sign and 
falls in Asvinl naksatra. From Moon, Saturn is 
placed in the 8 th house under the aspect of Mars. 
Moon, Mars and Saturn obtain vargottama navamscu 
3 rd and 6 th lord Jupiter who is a malefic for Libra 
ascendant joins the 5 th house In Aquarius in 
association with Sun. Jupiter is combust and Is 
shifted in the 6 th house with Sun. From ascendant 
Jupiter is the 3 rd lord and is dispositor of Ketu. 
From Moon -Jupiter Is the 12 th lord and is placed 
in malefic sign in combustion in the constellation 
of Rahu. Here the dispositor of Mars that is the 
8 th lord Venus falls In the sign and navarhsa of 
Jupiter. Therefore, Jupiter's sub-period in the major 
period of Moon has given the biggest tragedy of loss 
of husband within 10 months after marriage. Here 
again we see very early widowhood is indicated to 
the female. In such case the planets placed in the 



Timing Widowhood 225 

8 th house and navdmsa lord of that or navdmsa lord 
of the 8 th lord may cause widowhood. If Mars or 
Saturn indicates widowhood, then the naodmsa or 
the constellation obtained by the same is also 
important while examining the time of loss of 
husband.

Venus is the lord of the 7 th and 12 th house who 
is a malefic for Scorpio ascendant, Venus falls in 
Leo in association with Jupiter and Mercury and 
sub-period lord Moon is 8 th from there. Even in 
bhava chart, Moon and Venus are in khadastaka 
position, Moon falls over the axis of Rahu and Ketu 
and obtains navarhSa of its debilitation. Major 
period lord Venus obtains navdmsa of Moon. Moon 
falls in Saturn's naksatra Uttara Bhddrapadd whereas 
Saturn is debilitated in 6 th house under vargottarna 
navdmsa. In bhava chart, Mars is shifted in the 
8 th house, Mars obtains navarhsa of Venus. There- 
fore, it was the major period of Venus which 
resulted into her widowhood. On the other hand 
Mars falls in. the sign of Moon and Moon obtains 
navdmsa of Mars, therefore, when the sub-period 
of Moon was running, her widowhood took place.

226 Foretelling Widowhood 

A combination of widowhood is very strongly 
present in this birth chart as Rahu and Mars 
occupy the 8 th house which is 7 th from lagna lord 
Moon. 7 th lord, debilitated Saturn aspects the 7 th 
house and 9 th lord Jupiter, 12 th lord Mercury 
occupies the 7 th house under Saturn's aspect. It is 
said that the tax/a dosa gets nullified if Moon and 
Jupiter aspect Mars but we have not found this 
correct iri our observation regarding number of 
cases. In this horoscope Rahu and Mars occupy the 
8 th house under the aspect of beneflc Jupiter and 
lagna lord Moon but she suffered widowhood on 
August 9 th , 2001 after about 10 years of her 
marriage during Mars Saturn dasd bhukti Mars is 
yogakaraka for Cancer ascendant but its close 
conjunction with Rahu in the 8 th house in Saturn's 
sign Aquarius resulted into widowhood in its major 
period. Had Mars not been a yogakaraka here, the 
widowhood would have come earlier? Sub-period 
lord is Saturn who is placed in martian sign Aries 
under debilitation. 8 th lord Mars also occupies 
Saturn's sign, therefore sub-period of Saturn is 
strong enough to bring widowhood to her. J?dhu who 
occupies the 8 th house, joins the navdriisa of Mars* 
Therefore* the widowhood resulted into the major 
period of Mars. In navamsa chart, Mars and Saturn 
both aspect each other and indicate accidental 
death of her husband in their dasd bhukti Her 
husband died in a road accident due to extreme 
loss of blood while going from Delhi to Jaipur.

She is veiy charming, smart, intelligent, dynamic,

performance. She had a love marriage on 
May 1 7 th , 1981. She was enjoying immense 
happiness, love, care, prosperity and emotional 
feelings in her family life with her children and 
husband. Suddenly on November 4 th , 1996, her 
husband suffered a massive heart attack when he 
was shifting from one house to another in the 
Medical College campus. Here 8 th lord is Jupiter 
who aspects the 8 th house, even then the loss of 
her husband could not be saved at such an early 
age* She suffered this tragedy during the major 
period of Jupiter in sub-period of Saturn, Jupiter 
is the 8 th lord and is aspected by malefic Saturn. 
Jupiter is also 8 th from Moon, therefore, the husband 
died in the major period of Jupiter. Saturn, Rahu 
and Venus are placed in the 7 th house and Rahu 
obtains navarhsa of Saturn. Moreover, Saturn is 2 nd 
lord as reckoned from Jupiter, therefore, sub-period 
of Saturn resulted into this biggest tragedy of her 
life. Rahu occupies the 7 th house and falls in Jyestha 
naksatra in Scorpio sign. This is bad for husband's 
longevity, it may be noted that planets placed in 
the 7 th house if falls in Jyestha, Dhantstha or Aslesa, 
that will curtail happiness in married life. Here 
affliction of 7 th house by Rahu and Saturn resulted 
into late marriage and early widowhood. Aspect of 
Mars over 8 th house is responsible for early 
widowhood as it owns 7 th and aspects 8 th .

widowhood, position of planets should be reckoned

from Mars as Mars is the karaka of widowhood. 
Jupiter is 7 th lord from Mars and is placed in 12 th 
house from Mars, under the aspect of 6* and 7 th 
lord Saturn as reckoned from Jupiter. Therefore, 
she was miserably trapped by the hands of 
misfortune of loss of her life partner during the 
sub-period of Saturn in the major period of Jupiter.

Saturn and Rahu as well. Ratiu obtains navamsa 
of Venus and Venus obtains its own navamsa. Mars 
who is placed in the 8 th house, obtains navamsa 
of Mercury. Therefore, widowhood canie in the sub- 
period of Mercury in the major period of Venus, 
Moreover, Mercury is 8 th as reckoned from Mars 
and Venus is 8 th as reckoned from 7 th lord Saturn. 
Thus, the widowhood is clearly Indicated in the sub- 
period of Mercury in the major period of Venus. 
It is not essential that Mars or Saturn will cause 
widowhood though they are placed in the 8 th house 
and Saturn owns 8 th house too.

Timing Widowhood 229 

Widowhood - October 2 nd , 1989 during sub-period 
of Sun in the major period of Mercury. 

She is a famous film actress of Indian cinema. 
She got married with Mr. Mukesh Agarwal after 
a long lasting courtship and after about a year, 
her husband committed suicide due to misbehaviour 
of Rekha with him. He was a business tycoon but 
he loved his wife so much that he could not bear 
the negative attitude of his wife. Here lagna lord 
Jupiter occupies 8 th house in its sign of exaltation 
Cancer and is aspected by Mars and Saturn both 
in rasi chart as well as bhava chart. Here Jupiter 
obtains navamsa of the Sun. therefore, she suffered 
widowhood in the sub-period of Sun in the major 
period of Mercury who is the 7 th lord and obtains 
navamsa of its debilitation. It may be noted that 
Ketu is placed in the 7 th house and Mars aspects 
7 th and 8 th house and lagna lord Jupiter. Conjunction 
of Mars and jRdhu in the ascendant is strong 
indication of widowhood especially due to aspect 
of 2 nd lord Saturn. Ketu is placed in the 7 th house 
in the sign of Mercury, therefore, Mercury will give 
adverse effect of Ketu during its major period. 
Moreover, Mercury is 8 th lord from 8 th lord Moon 
and Sun is 8 th from Moon. Mercury falls in the Svati 
constellation, which is ruled by JRdhu. Mercury 
obtains navamsa of debilitation, that is Mercury 
falls in Jupiter's navamsa, therefore, it becomes a 
killer of husband. Moon and Jupiter both are 
planets of emotions who are involved here in giving 
rise to widowhood to Rekha. This is the reason that 
her husband got a severe emotional set back and 
committed suicide. Here again, we see that the 
indications of widowhood are present in this 
horoscope because Mars and Rahu are conjoined 
in the ascendant aspected by Saturn and ascendant 



230 Foretelling Widowhood 

lord occupies the 8 th house which is aspected by 
Saturn and Mars both. 6 th lord Venus occupies the 
12 th house in Martian sign under pdpakartari yoga. 
However, at the time of widowhood, dasd bhukti of 
none of these planets who are involved in causing 
widowhood, was running. Therefore, for any events 
of life sub-period and major period may be different 
from those planets who are indicating a particular 
event, good or bad. If we keep it in mind, we will 
definitely be benefited in timing events of life. 

Case 4.19 - (Horoscope NoA9-vide p. 176) 

Marriage - February 25 th , 1968 during Jupiter- 
Ketu dasd bhukti 

Widowhood - May 2l sl , 1991 during Saturn-tfdhu 
dasd bhukti 

Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, wife of Rajiv Gandhi, lost her 
husband during Saturn-l^dhu period. Saturn is 7 th 
and 8 th lord and is worst malefic for Cancer 
ascendant. Mars also aspects Saturn, Saturn is 
retrograde and is 8 th lord from Moon as well. Lagna 
lord Moon occupies 12 th house and is shifted in 11 th 
house from where Mars is 8 th . Rdhu falls In Moon's 
naksatra Rohtni and Moon falls in RahxTs naksatra 
ArdrcL Moon is hemmed between Saturn and Rdhu 
giving rise to papakartari yoga. Therefore, sub- 
period of Rdhu in the major period of Moon was 
extremely bad as Saturn is 8 th lord from Moon and 
joins 2 nd house. 

As reckoned from Mars, Saturn is in 8 th house 
and .Rdhu is in the 6 th house. From Jupiter, Rahu 
is 8 th and Saturn is 10 th , therefore Saturn obtains 
navdrhsa of Mars and Rdhu is 8 th from there, 
therefore sub-period of Rdhu in the major period 
of Saturn resulted into the loss of her husband. 

Many times it becomes difficult to interpret 
correct dasd bhukti for timing widowhood. In this 



TUning Widowhood 231 

case Saturn obtains navamsa of Mars, therefore, 
tragedy was possible in Mars bhukti in Saturn but 
a careful evaluation of the horoscope reveals that 
the widowhood took place in the sub-period of Rahu 
and not in the sub-period of Mars as per the reasons 
explained above. 

Case 4,20 - (Horoscope No.20- vide p. 178) 

Marriage - May 22 nd , 1989 during Moon-Mercury

She is a beautiful and very rich woman whose 
marriage was ceremonised on May 22 nd , 1989 
during sub-period of Mercury in the major period 
of Moon. The husband was murdered due to per- 
sonal enemity on May 7 th , 1992 just after three 
years of marriage, during Mars-Mars dasa bhukti 

Mars and Rahu occupy the 8 th house with and 
fall in Saturn's sign Capricorn. This shows early 
widowhood. For timing widowhood correctly, one 
should examine sub-period of planets responsible 
for widowhood during the major period of the same 
planet in which the marriage took place and 
especially when the major period lord is adversely 
placed and playing a role to cause widowhood. 

Here Rahu is placed in the 8 th house with Mars 
and Moon. Therefore, major period of Mars and sub- 
period of Mars, indicate widowhood in its dasa 
bhukti The 8 th lord Saturn is placed in the 12 th 
house under retrogration and aspects 7 th lord 
Jupiter who occupies the 6 th house in Martian sign 
Scorpio. Here the 8 th lord Saturn damaged the 7 th 
house and its lord Jupiter. Rahu and Mars damaged 
the 8 th house, i.e., the house of longevity of hus- 
band. Therefore, the husband was killed during 
sub-period of Mars in the major period of Mars. 



232 Foretelling Widowhood 

Placement of 7 th lord Jupiter in Martian sign Scorpio 
in the 6 th house and the placement of Rahu with 
Mars in the 8 th house and placement of 8 th lord 
Saturn under debilitated navamsa in Aries shows 
that her husband will be killed soon after marriage. 

Case 4,21 - (Horoscope No.21-uide p. 180) 

Marriage - November 23 rd , 1987 during sub- 
period of Venus in the major period of Mercury. 

Widowhood - December 17 th , 1987 during sub- 
period of Venus in the major period of Mercury. 

We have tried to illustrate the correctness of 
aphorisms mentioned by our sages in various 
classical works. In the early pages of this chapter, 
we have referred the sloka of Phalita Martarjida that 
the death of husband will take place during the 
major or sub-period of the navamsa occupied by the 
malefic occupant of the 8 th house. In this horoscope, 
Rahu occupies the 8 th house in Aries under the 
mutual aspect of 8 th and 3 rd lord Mars. Rahu obtains 
navamsa of Mercury, therefore, widowhood took 
place in the major period of Mercury. Lord of the 
2 nd house is Venus who is placed in inimical sign 
Leo in the 12 th house. Moreover, Mars and Ketu are 
the dispositor of Venus and Venus obtains own 
navamsa in the 8 th house in navamsa chart. This 
horoscope indicates very early widowhood immedi- 
ately after marriage. Therefore, marriage and widow- 
hood took place in the same dasa bhukti of Mercury- 
Venus. The lord of 2 nd house resulted into marriage 
but due to severe affliction of 2 nd house and its lord, 
the husband was crushed by a truck just after 24 
days of her marriage. 8 th and 2 nd house indicate loss 
of husband. The Influence of Mars, Ketu and Rahu 
on the 8 th house and the placement of the 6 th lord 
Saturn in the 7 th house under retrograde motion Is 



Timing Widowhood 233 

extremely adverse for conjugal bliss and life of her 
husband. In such cases, where the combination of 
loss of husband are present, there must be proper 
matching of horoscopes by the competent astrolo- 
gers. Selection of muhurta for marriage is best 
prevention. Dr. B.V. Raman has emphasized a lot 
on the proper selection of time (muhurta) which 
saves widowhood, divorce and other adversities.

Ghildren - One son and two daughters 

This lady was born in Aries ascendant with Mars 
in the ascendant. Rdhu occupies 8 th house in 
martian sign and is aspected by Mars as well. Here 
Rdhu obtains the navdmsa of Sun and at the time 
of widowhood, major period of Sun was running. 
Venus is the lord of the 2 nd and 7 th house and hence 
it becomes a marakesa and its placement in the 
12 th house in the sign of exaltation with Saturn 
and Mercury is adverse especially because Venus 
obtains navdmsa of its debilitation. Therefore, sub- 
period of Venus in the major period of Sun brought 
widowhood to her on January 1 st , 1969. It may also 
be noted that she was born in Maghd naksatra 1 st 
pada which is an adverse mula and Venus is also 
8 th from Moon alongwith Saturn and debilitated 
Mercury. Mars In the lagna in Aries and Rdhu in 
the 8 th house in Scorpio are indicating widowhood 
within 10 years of marriage in a general way.- 
Marriage took place on November 5 th , 1961 during 
Venus- Mercury dasd bhuktl Venus dasd ended on 
September 18 th , 1963 so the widowhood could have

come In the subsequent major period of the Sun, 
Ultimately, she lost her husband in an accident 
on January 1 st , 1969 during Sun-Venus period. Both 
are in dvidvadasa position in rasi chart. Thus it 
could be the sub-period of Venus who is the strong 
marakesa for her husband in various ways. Venus 
is 8 th from Moon and Sun is 7 th from there. From 
Mars, Venus is the lord of 2 nd and 7 th house and 
joins the 12 th house. Prom Jupiter, Sun is the lord 
of the 8 th house and joins 2 nd house. Mars and lagna 
both fall in asvird nak$atra and are 3° apart. Jupiter 
is debilitated and falls in the noksaira of Mars, that 
is dhanistha. Jupiter obtains Sun's navamsa. This 
confirms the possibility of widowhood within a 
period of 9 and 10 years of marriage. 

Case 4.23 - (Horoscope No.23- vide p. 184) 

Marriage - November 24 th , 1968 during the sub-

Widowhood - November 7 th , 1997 during the sub-

Children - Two daughters and a son. 

This is the horoscope of a charming female who 
was married at 20 years of age on November 24 th , 
1968 during Mars-Venus dasd bhuktl She faced lot 
of miseries in her conjugal life. She remained 
separated from her husband for 7 years after her 
marriage due to various undesirable activities of 
mother-in-law. After the days of her misery, she 
enjoyed conjugal bliss of high order for 20 years 
and lost her husband suddenly due to a massive 
heart attack on November 7 th , 1997 during major 
period of Jupiter and sub-period of Venus. Now 
again applying the same formula that malefic Mars 
occupies the 8 th house in inimical sign Virgo and 



Timing Widowhood 235 

obtains navdrhsa of Jupiter, therefore, widowhood 
took place during Jupiter's major period. 

Moreover, Jupiter is the lord of 2 nd house and 
occupies jyestha naksatra. Therefore, Jupiter is 
strong enough to cause the death of her spouse. 
Venus is 7 th lord and 12 th lord from Jupiter and 
is 8 th from radical location of Jupiter in the rasi 
chart as well as in navdrhsa chart. Therefore, such 
a great tragedy of loss of her husband took place 
in the sub-period of Venus in the major period of 
Jupiter. Both are the best beneflcs and Venus 
happens to be a yogakaraka for Aquarius ascendant. 
Moreover, Jupiter and Venus occupy quadrant and 
triangle respectively. This may mislead to find out 
the correct time of such a tragedy which is strongly 
indicated in her birth chart. Therefore, the rules 
and aphorisms as given in classical works must 
be applied carefully for accuracy and correctness 
in the observation. 

It is easy to find out major period lord who will 
bring the widowhood. From there, examine the 
position of 2 nd and 7 th lord and also from lagna, 
the position of 2 nd and 7 th lord should be judged. 
If the 7 th lord is placed in 12 th house under affliction, 
that may bring such tragedy. It is immaterial 
whether the concerning planet is a yogakaraka or 
it is svaksetru exalted or debilitated. The careful 
examination of the birth chart with sincere 
application of navaihsa chart to work out the period 
of widowhood is most essential. We can say with 
confidence that without considering navdrhsa chart, 
correct time of widowhood cannot be worked out.

Widowhood - October 22 nd , 1969 during the sub- 
period of Saturn in the major period of Moon. 

She lost her husband on October 22 nd , 1969 in 
the sub-period of Saturn in the major period of 
Moon. She was hardly 45 years old at the time of 
this unbearable tragedy of her life. She was born 
in revaix nak$atra which belongs to mukL Mars 
happens to be a marakesa for Libra ascendant and 
its placement in the fifth house is veiy adverse for 
long lasting happiness of married life. Aspect of 
Mars over the 8 th house, 8 th and lagna lord Venus 
and 12 th house is veiy adverse. Mars and Venus 
are in khadastaka position. 7 th house is receiving 
the aspect of Sun and Saturn and 8 th house is 
receiving the aspect of Mercury and Jupiter. In this 
horoscope, Mars should be held responsible for loss 
of her husband at 45 th years of age. Mars obtains 
navarhsa of Saturn, Therefore, the tragedy occurred 
during the sub-period of Saturn. Lagna and 8 th 
house Venus is debilitated in 12 th house and falls 
in Hastd naksatra, which is ruled by Moon. Venus 
is also aspected by Moon, Therefore, the death of 
the husband took place in the major period of Moon 
and the sub-period of Saturn on October 22 nd , 1969. 
Here saubhagya karaka Jupiter falls in the sign of 
Mars in Scorpio in jyestha naksatra in Moon 
navarhsa. Jupiter is shifted in the 3 rd bhava chart 
and from there it aspects the 7^ house. However, 
even Jupiter's aspect over 7 th or 9 th house could 
not protect the life of her husband. The ascendant 
is hemmed between benefics like Jupiter, Venus 
and Mercury, Therefore, she enjoyed the happiness 
of her married life for about 29 years as she was 
married at the age of 16 years and suffered the 
tragedy of loss of her husband at 45 years of age. 
She lived for 17 years thereafter when she suffered

cardiac arrest on August 19 th , 1986 in the sub- 
period of Saturn in the major period of Rahw 

Case 4.25 - (Horoscope No.25-vide p. 189) 

She was the first child of her parents. The birth 
took place in Jyesthd naksatra, fourth pada. Her 
mother expired soon after her birth. She got married 
in 21 st years of her age. The married life was 
miserable. The husband was quite smart, good 
looking and attractive. Many girls were involved 
with him. She lost her husband on January 23 rd , 
1969 during stomach operation. 

For Libra ascendant, Mars is the worst planet 
and here Mars occupies the ascendant in association 
with the 9 th lord Mercuiy. Rahu occupies the 8th 
house and is aspected by Mars and Saturn. Birth 
has taken place on new Moon day, i.e., Amavasya. 
The lord of the ascendant joins the 12th house 
under debilitation and 12 th lord Mercury occupies 
the ascendant under affliction by Mars. 

We have observed that the major period of Moon 
is very adverse for Jyesthd borns. She underwent 
the curse of widowhood on Januaiy 23 rd , 1969 
during major period of Moon and sub-period of 
Saturn. Saturn heavily afflicts the 2 nd house and 
the Moon and thus both happen marakesa for her 
husband. She was blessed with one daughter and 
two sons and expired on May 30 th , 2001 after leading 
lonely life for more than 32 years. 

Here placement of Rahu in the 8 th house and 
aspect of Mars, Saturn, the Sun, the Moon and Ketu 
over there, resulted into widowhood around 41 st 
years of her age. She suffered a lot thereafter. 

Case 4.26 - (Horoscope No.26- vide p,191) 

Marriage - June 24 th , 1982 during sub-period of 
Ketu in the major period of Rdhu. 



238 Foretelling Widowhood 

Widowhood - August 6 th , 1993 during sub-period 
of Saturn In the major period of Jupiter. 

Children - A daughter and a son 

She suffered widowhood on August 6 th , 1993 due 
to a massive heart attack to her husband during 
Jupiter-Saturn dasa bhukti Here Mars occupies the 
5 th house in association with Mercury under mutual 
aspect with Saturn, Saturn occupies 2 nd in aquarius 
under retrograde motion and Mars falls in the 5 th 
house t both Mars and Saturn aspect 8 th house. 
Mars should be mainly held responsible for her 
early widowhood at 29 years of age. Mars obtains 
navamsa of Jupiter, therefore, it was Jupiter's 
major period to cause widowhood. 

The 2 nd house is owned and occupied by retrograde 
Saturn and Saturn also obtains its own navamsa 
Therefore, sub-period of Saturn in the major period 
of Jupiter resulted into loss of her husband. 

Case - 4.27 - (Horoscope No.27-uide p. 193) 

Marriage - November 1 967 during Rahu-Ketu 
dasa bhukti 

Widowhood - July 19 th , 1982 during Jupiter-Ketu 
dasa bhukti 

She is wife of a Geology professor and suffered 
widowhood on July 19 th , 1982 due to massive heart 
attack to her husband during Jupiter-Kettx dasa 
bhukti 1 1 th and 6 th lord Mars is conjoined with Rahu 
in the ascendant. Aspect of Mars on 7 th and 8 th 
house and on the 7 th lord Jupiter and ascendant 
lord Mercury is most undesirable. 7 th lord Jupiter 
is aspected by Mars and Saturn both and obtains 
inimical navamsa of Venus. Here placement of Ketu 
in the 7 th house, the aspect of Mars and Saturn 
over 7 th lord Jupiter and 8 th house is strongly 
indicating early widowhood. Mars is mainly 



Timing Widowhood 239 

responsible for widowhood, 7 th lord Jupiter is 
aspected by Mars and Saturn, Mars obtains navarhsa 
of Jupiter, and therefore, the death of husband took 
place during major period of Jupiter. Ketu occupies 
the 7 th house under the aspect of Mars and Ketu 
falls in own naksatra mula whereas Rahu and Mars 
both falls in Ardra constellation, ruled by RahiL 
Thus Ketu becomes a strong malefic in the 7 th 
house. The sub-period of Ketu in the major period 
of Jupiter resulted into widowhood on 
July 19 th , 1982. 

For timing widowhood, lord of the navarhsa of 
Mars must be taken into consideration where Mars 
is playing a vital role in killing the husband of the 
female. See whether navarhsa lord is the same in 
whose dasa marriage took place or it belongs to 
the planet of subsequent major period in case clear 
and early widowhood is indicated and Mars obtains 
any of the navarhsa as mentioned above, widowhood 
may take place during the same. If maleflcs are 
placed in the 8 th house, the navarhsa lord of that 
planet may bring widowhood during their dasa 
bhuktl Sub period may belong to the lord or occupant 
of the 2 nd house and if Jupiter is not well fortified 
and falls in martian sign Aries or Scorpio and is 
aspected by Mars, the widowhood may come during 
Jupiter mahadasa. The aspect of Jupiter 
over seventh or eighth house may delay widowhood 
but can not prevent it If there is no planet in the 
8 th house, the navarhsa lord of the worst malefic 
should be examined. Navarhsa lord of the 8 th house 
may also cause widowhood. Naksatra lord of the 
planet should also be taken into consideration like 
navarhsa lord and if both are Identical, widowhood 
will take place in dctsd bhukti of that planet. 



240 Foretelling Widowhood 

Malefics placed in 7 th house in the naksatra of 
malefic planets like Ketu, Rahu, Mars and Saturn 
may also kill her husband during their dasa bhuktL 
If the concerning planet falls in the naksatra of 
Mula's, the widowhood may come during their dasa 
bhuktL If we can work out the lord of major period 
responsible for this tragedy, one should by to find 
out whether lord of 2 nd and 8 th house from that 
planet and ascendant indicates the widowhood 
during period of navamsa of naksatra lord. This 
requires lot of patience, careful judgement, vast 
experience and deep knowledge of the subject. 

Case 4.28 - (Horoscope No.28- vide p. 195) 

Marriage - March 26 th , 1942 during Rahu-Saturn 
dasa bhuktt 

Widowhood - September 9 th , 1960 during Jupiter- 
Mercuiy dasa bhukti 

Mrs. Indira Gandhi suffered widowhood on 
September 9 th , 1960 during Jupiter-Mercury dasa 
bhuktL Saturn is 7 th and 8 th lord falls in ascendant 
and obtains own navamsa. Rahu and Ketu are 
placed in mula and ardra constellation, i.e., there 
is mutual exchange of their naksatras. The 7 th and 
8 th lord Saturn, who falls in own navamsa, falls 
in aslesa naksatra. Mercury falls in anuradha 
naksatra, I.e., there is mutual exchange of naksatras 
between Mercury and Saturn. Therefore, it was the 
sub-period of Mercury, in which 7 th lord falls, which 
caused the death of her husband. Jupiter occupies 
the II th house as 6 th and 9 th lord and aspects the 
7 th house. Jupiter obtains vargottama navamsa. Ketu 
and Rdhu are shifted in 11 th and 5 th house 
respectively. Thus, Ketu afflicts Jupiter and obtains 
navamsa of Jupiter as well. Therefore, Jupiter's 
major period resulted in her widowhood in the sub- 
period of Mercury who is the lord of the 7 th house 



Tdning Widowhood 241 

from Jupiter as placed from there under combustion 
and affliction in inimical sign. Thus Jupiter-Mercury 
period, who are also khadastaka in navarhsa chart, 
resulted into death of husband. 

Note: We have discussed here the established 
horoscope of Mrs. Indira Gandhi of Cancer ascen- 
dant. We had rectified her time of birth and 
discussed that horoscope with Leo ascendant at 
various places. According to that, the judgement 
of widowhood is very precise and accurate because 
Mercury is the lord of 2 nd house and Jupiter is lord 
of 8 th house in whose dasa bhukti she suffered loss 
of her husband. 

Case 4.29 - (Horoscope No.29-vide p. 197) 

Marriage - January 16 th , 1968 during Mars-Moon 
dasa bhukti 

Widowhood - November 5 th , 1984 during Rahu- 
Moon dasa bhukti 

She is a lecturer in an intermediate college. Her 
husband was also a teacher. He suffered from septic 
and unfortunately, there was very strict curfew in 
Delhi at that time, due to assassination of Mrs. 
Indira Gandhi, lnspite of best efforts, he couid not 
be hospitalized for proper treatment and expired on 
November 5 th , 1984. Her everything was lost but 
she became a multimillionaire. Her husband had 
purchased very cheap land for the purpose of 
agriculture in 1972 or so. Later on, that area was 
declared as industrial area of Ghaziabad, Many 
factories and industries were laid down around that 
land. The cost of the land increased leaps and 
bounds. However, she lost her husband on Novem- 
ber 5 th , 1984 during Rahu-Moan period. Mars and 
Rahu occupy 8 th house which is a clear indication 
of widowhood. 



242 Foretelling Widowhood 

Here Rahu obtains vargottama navamsa in Aries, 
which is ruled by Mars. Therefore, her husband 
died when she was running under the last phase 
of the major period of Rahu. The 2 nd lord Venus 
obtains navamsa of Moon and Jupiter occupies the 
12 th house* Rahu and Mars both are placed in fiery 
sign. Saubhagya karaka Jupiter is debilitated and 
falls in the ^rduoria, the naksatra of Moon, which 
is 7 th lord from Jupiter. Therefore, sub-period of 
Moon in the major period of Rahu resulted into her 
widowhood on November 5 th , 1984. 1 have observed 
that the lord of the navamsa occupied by the 
constellation lord in which the lord of the 2 nd house 
falls, may cause widowhood during its bhuktl 
Moreover, the navamsa lord occupied by the 2 nd lord 
may also cause death of husband during its sub- 
period. Here 2 nd lord Venus obtain navamsa of Moon 
whose bhukti killed her husband* 

Case 4.30 - (Horoscope No.30-iude p. 199) 

Marriage - June 5 th , 1993 during Rdhu-Moon dasa 
bhukti 

Widowhood - July 27 th , 1993 during Rahu-Moon 
dasa bhukti 

She got married on June 5 th , 1993 and suffered 
widowhood in the sub-period of Moon in the major 
period of Rahu. Mars occupies the 8 th house in 
Saturn's sign and Rahu occupies the 7 th house with 
Moon. Both are placed in aquarius and Capricorn 
respectively* There is mutual aspect between Mars 
and Saturn, 7 th and 8 th lord Saturn, who is retrograde 
is aspected by Mars, Jupiter and inimical Sun. 
Rahu falls in the 7 th house in rasi chart in Moon's 
naksatra sravana and Moon conjoins with rahu and 
falls in Mars naksatra dhanisthd. Therefore, Moon 



Timing Widowhood 243 

is under the influence of Mars and Rahiu Conjunction 
of two planets like Moon and Rdhu gives bad results 
during their dasa bhukti Here 7 th lord Saturn falls 
in anuradha naksatra ruled by Saturn, thus there 
is mutual exchange between naksatras of Saturn 
and Sun, Adversity has been further enhanced due 
to aspect between Saturn and Sun. Thus, 7 th lord 
Saturn is heavily afflicted due to the inimical aspect 
of Sun and Mars and placement in krttikd naksatra 
and as it obtains navarhsa of Jupiter in association 
with Mars. Thus Saturn is heavily afflicted and 
spoiled the results of 7 th house as it aspects the 
8 th house and occupant of 8 th house Mars mutually. 
Therefore, the combination of widowhood is clearly 
present. Jupiter-Mercury and Venus fall in the 
naksatra of Mula's In which Jupiter, who is saubhagya 
karaka falls in jye$tha naksatra and Scorpio sign 
under the mutual aspect with Saturn. So saubhagya 
has been heavily damaged. Here Rahu falls in 
saubhagya naksatra ruled by Moon and therefore 
has given rise to widowhood during the sub-period 
of Moon in own's major period on 
July 27 th , 1993. Here Moon is the karmic control 
planet also and its placement in the seventh house 
in the naksatra of Mars caused widowhood during 
its bhukti.

band that Mars will be coming very near to earth 
on August 28 th , 2003 and Rahu. will also be entering 
into the sign of Mars Aries on August 28 th , 2003 
and a week on either side of this date will be very 
critical for his life. 1 advised against rash driving, 
any kind of hectic action, impulsive reaction and 
inimical activities towards criminals, I also advised 
that his wife must also observe Tuesday vrata and 
must recite angdraka stotra and Vedic mantra of 
Mars etc. However, he ignored all that. In fact 
people have lost faith in astrological prediqtion and 
for that, various so called imperfect astrologers who 
are not well conversant with this science, are 
mostly responsible. People are misguided by them 
and their predictions fail miserably. Therefore, 
general people go to astrologers to listen only that 
their future is bright, full of prosperity, happiness, 
wealth, popularity, power, pelf and innumerable 
achievements as well as full of success. They 
discard them if there is any negative forecast. I 
strongly believe that any honest astrologer will 
speak anything only after confirmation from various 
angles after being confident of his observation. Any 
way in the above case, her husband was coming 
back to Lucknow on August 28 th , 2003 by his own 
new car. He had collision with a strong tree 
probably due to being somewhat in sleep. He died 
on the spot itself. The female of, this case informed 
all this to me on August 29 th , 2003 about this 
biggest misery of her life which was foreseen by 
me earlier. Her voice was full of tears, grief and 
sorrow, which pained me a lot. 

In this horoscope Jupiter occupies Sagittarius 
ascendant and is shifted in 12 th house in bhdva 
chart, Ketu occupies the 7 th house and Venus is 
shifted from 9 th to 8 th , Mars from 10 th to 9 th , Mercury 



246 Foretelling Widowhood 

and Sun from 11 th to 10 th , Moon is shifted from 3 rd 
to 2 nd . Here the Jupiter's location influencing 7 th 
or 8 th house could not save her widowhood. Here 
Mars is 8 th from 8 th lord Moon and it is placed in 
inimical sign Virgo. The 2 nd and 8 th houses indicate 
husband's death in one or other way. The lord of 
2 nd house Saturn aspects the lord of the 8 th house 
Moon. Lagna lord Jupiter is shifted in the 12 th house 
in Martian sign Scorpio, Mars and Saturn both in 
bhdua chart influence each other. Placement of Ketu 
in the 7 th house is also undesirable. 7 th lord Mercury 
obtains navarhsa of debilitation. Jupiter, Mars, Ketu 
conjoins inimical navarhsa Gemini. Mars and Saturn 
both aspect each other and these axe negative 
factors for longevity of husband. Worst of them is 
the placement of Mars In the 8 th house from 8 th 
lord Moon and Moon is also placed in dhanistha 
naksatra 4 th Pada. Mars is placed in Hasta naksatra. 
Thus, there is mutual exchange of Moon and Mars 
and Mars is 8 th from Moon in rasi as well as 
navarhsa chart. The marriage took place in the sub- 
period of Jupiter in the major period of Jupiter. 
How to work out the time of widowhood, first see 
if early widowhood is indicated as in the present 
case. Since the marriage took place in the sub- 
period of Jupiter in the major period of Jupiter, 
one should examine other sub-periods of Jupiter, 
which may bring widowhood. The Sun falls in citrd, 
Moon falls in dhanistha and Saturn falls in mrgasird 
naksatra^ therefore, the adverse effect of Mars will 
come during sub-period of Sun. Since the sub- 
period of Sun comes prior to Moon and Mars, 
therefore, the biggest tragedy came in the sub- 
period of Sun in the major period of Jupiter. From 
8 th lord Moon, Sun is the 8 th lord as well who obtains 
debilitation sign under vargottama navarhsa. The 



Timing Widowhood 247 

tragedy took place when Mars was transiting over 
8 th lord Moon and Saturn was transiting over the 
axis of Rahu and Ketu in the 7 th house from lagna. 
Rahu and Ketu were transiting over radical Saturn. 
On the same day, Rahu entered in Aries and Ketu 
in Libra and Mars was very close to earth and that 
resulted in loss of her husband. 

Case 4.32 - (Horoscope No. 32) 

Marriage - October 7 th , 1992 during Rdhu-Ketu 
dasa bhukti 

Death - August 28 th , 2003 during Jupiter-Saturn 
dasa bhukti 

This is the horoscope of the husband of the above 
female. Mars, Sun and Mercury are placed in the 
7 th house but Mercuiy is shifted in 6 th . Jupiter 
aspects ascendant ownied by him, 2 nd lord Saturn 
occupies its debilitation sign under vargottama 
navdmsa. In navdmsa chart, Saturn and Mars both 
conjoin in 8 th house in Aries. The native is strong 
mangali and 7 th house, Sun and Mars are aspected 
by 2 nd lord Saturn. The tragedy took place during 
the major period of Jupiter and sub-period of 
Saturn. Here Jupiter as lagna lord occupies 9 th 
house and aspects lagna. Jupiter also obtains 
navdmsa of exaltation but it became moraka for him 
as Jupiter falls in mrityuarisa. From Jupiter, Saturn 
is 7 th and 6 th lord, thus Saturn becomes a mdrakesa. 
in bhdva chart, Saturn is 8 th from Jupiter. There- 
fore, unnatural death of his life came during the 
sub-period of Saturn in the major period of Jupiter, 
Saturn is mdrakesa from lagna as well as mahadasd 
lord Jupiter. Placement of the 12 th and 5 th lord Mars 
with 7 th lord Mercuiy with 9 th lord Sun in 7 th house 
clearly indicates love marriage. Saturn is shifted

Widowhood - February 24 th , 1996 during Rahu-

Children - A son and a daughter 

She was born in Libra ascendant with Mars and 
Ketu in the 12 th house. Mars aspects the 7 th house 
as its owner and yogakaraka Saturn aspects the 
8 th house. Thus the 7 th and 8 th houses are afflicted 
by maleflcs. The 7 th and 2 nd lord Mars is closely 
associated with Ketu, with a difference of only 1° 
between them, in the 12 th house. Both fall in the 
2 nd pada of Hasta naksatra. Here Moon falls in 
Ketu's naksatra rnagha which belongs to mida* Thus 
there is mutual exchange of naksatra of Moon and 
Ketu. Opposition and exchange of the inimical Sun 
and Saturn is also adverse because both fall over 
the axis of Moon. However, Moon and Mercury are 
shifted in 10 th and 4 th house respectively. Jupiter 
who falls in dhanistha naksatra aspects Mars and 
8 th house. Mars happens maraka for Libra and 
Jupiter is also a malefic and like marakesa for Libra 
ascendant as Jupiter, here, owns the 3 rd and 6 th 
house. Therefore, the aspect of debilitated Jupiter 
over the 8 th house and Mars could not save 
widowhood though delayed the same.

urn and Saturn is associated with Moon from where 
Rdhu is 8 th , Rdhu obtains navarhsa of Mars and that 
is in the 8 th house from navarhsa lagna. Thus the

Libra ascendant, please do note, if the 8 th lord or

place during dasa bhukti of Rdhu or Ketu, if these

principle. Thus, Mars-i?ahu period who are 6 th and 
8 th from each other resulted into the death of the 
native during their dasa bhuktl 

In this example and in the example of case No. 
32, Mars occupies the 7 th house and it is believed 
most often that the Mars in 7 th house will kill the 
spouse and not to self. This is not so as we have 
seen and illustrated two cases of husband alongwith 
their widows. In both these cases, Mars signifies 
death of self and not of wife. 

A careful judgement and sincere analysis of the 
horoscope is required before reaching to any 
conclusion. It is not at all essential that if husband 
and wife both are mangali, there can not be loss 
of spouse. It should be properly examined whether 
widowhood is present in the horoscope of a female? 
Similarly, horoscope of husband should also be 
judged carefully if he has a short life. The females 
who have combinations of early widowhood should 
never be married with the persons with short span 
of life. The ascendant, 6 th and 8 th houses must be 
strong in the horoscope of their husbands. Proper 
matching of horoscopes by the competent astrologers 
must essentially be done and there should be no 
compromise in matching. Question arises whether 
widowhood can be saved if there are very strong 
and vital indications of loss of spouse. Widowhood 
can not be saved especially when the horoscope of 
the husband is weak for longevity. However, 
widowhood can certainly be prevented in reasonable 
number of cases if proper matching of horoscopes 
is there and there is a selection of most suitable 
muhurta of marriage. 

Conclusion 

We have discussed so many cases here in respect to 
foretelling widowhood and its time period. There can 



254 Foretelling Widowhood 

mainly be four reasons for widowhood to take place 
in early life. 

1. Accidental death of husband. 

2. Death due to any dreaded disease like Cancer, 
heart attack, brain haemorrhage or the like. 

3. Suicide and 

4. Murder 

The reason of death of husband can also be 
worked out. However, though it is most essential 
but quite difficult to work out the time of the death 
of the husband precisely* 

We have made an honest and sincere effort to 
work out the time of loss of husband. It is not at 
all essential that a girl having strong kuja dosa 
will suffer from widowhood certainly. We have 
illustrated number of cases where kuja dosa is not 
present in the birth chart of the girl and she 
suffered very early widowhood. There is a prominent 
role of Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu in giving rise 
to curse of widowhood. If these planets adversely 
influence the 7 th or 8 th or both of these houses 
identical to malefic signs, associations and aspects, 
the female is likely to suffer widowhood. 

A man having Mars in the 8 th house may result 
in his accidental death but this position will not 
damage the life of wife or his conjugal bliss but 
in case of a female, Mars in the 8 th house, may 
result in the death of her husband. A man having 
Mars in the 8 th house should never be got married 
with a female having Mars in the 7 th or 8 th house 
or having malefics there, otherwise that promote 
the possibility of widowhood. 

If Mars, Saturn or other malefics occupy the 8 th 
house, in evil signs or with evil aspects, widowhood 
may take place during the dasa bhukti of navamsa 
lord of the malefic occupant of the 8 th house or the 
lord of the 8 th house. The 2 nd house also deals the 



Timing Widowhood 255 

death of husband as it is 8 th from the 7 th house. 
The death of life partner may take place during the 
dasa bhukti of the lord of the 2 nd house or navamsa 
or naksatra lord of the 2 nd house. It is simple to 
find out the major period lord during which widowhood 
is likely to appear. If early widowhood is indicated, 
the widowhood should take place in the same major 
period in which marriage took place provided those 
planets have any thing to do with the loss of husband 
and indicate their role in befalling widowhood on 
the concerning female. 

After finding out the lord of major period in which 
widowhood is likely to take place, workout the worst 
malefic responsible for the death of husband. The 
death may take place during the navamsa lord of 
that planet or during the sub-period of the lord of 
the 2 nd or 8 th house as reckoned from the lord of 
major period, worked out first as explained above. 

Mars is the slgnificator of widowhood and Jupiter 
is karaka of saubhagya yoga. If Jupiter is a malefic 
for a particular ascendant or it is afflicted or 
Jupiter falls In jyestha or asvinl constellation, the 
widowhood may come during the sub-period of 
Jupiter, We have observed that in nearly 50% of 
cases, widowhood took place during the major or 
sub-period of Jupiter. The death of the husband 
may also take place during the major or sub-periods 
of nodes, i.e., Ra.hu and Ketu. Dasa bhukti of Rahu- 
Saturn or Saturn-Rdhu is also adverse. The planets 
placed in the 7 th , 8 th or 2 nd even in the 6 th or 12 th 
house may befall widowhood. 

After working out the major and sub-period of 
widowhood, application of transit further precise 
the worst span of time for a female to be cursed 
by the biggest tragedy of her widowhood. We want 



256 Foretelling Widowhood 

to draw the attention of our readers that transits 
should never be applied before working out the dasd 
bhukti. Reasonable number of the females who 
received the curse of widowhood, were born in the 
constellation of mulas, e.g., jyestha, asvini, revati, 
magha, aslesa and mida etc. If Moon falls in these 
naksatra and is aspected by malefics like Mars, 
widowhood may come during the sub-period of Moon 
or naksatra lord or sign lord occupied by the Moon 
or during the dasa bhukti of the malefic planet who 
afflicts such a Moon. 

Thus, the period of widowhood should be arrived 
at on the basis of principles, as discussed here and 
also in the explanation of timing of widowhood of 
various cases. 



Chapter-5 

WIDOWHOOD AND MISCONCEPTIONS 
ABOUT JUPITER 



Jupiter is the best benefic among all planets. 
Association or aspect of Jupiter can minimise 
most of the adversities and can also rule out 
many negative indications. We expect that of 
advantages, prosperity, power, popularity, property, 
promotions, peace, wealth, happiness, children, 
education, success, fortune and conjugal bliss of a 
high degree. 

Jupiter is not so benevolent in regard to marital 
harmony according to our humble observations of 
natal horoscopes. Jupiter may be benefic for one 
ascendant while it may be a malefic for the other. 
If Jupiter is a malefic for a particular ascendant, 
there will be loss of conjugal bliss, if it has to do 
anything with the houses related to marriage and 
marital harmony. Here in this chapter, 1 will confine 
myself to the negative effect of Jupiter regarding 
the span of married life. 

Placement of Jupiter in the 7 th house brings 
various kinds of problems in marriage especially 
if Jupiter happens a malefic for that ascendant. 
In watery signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces in the 
7 th house, Jupiter creates havoc in regard to marital 
harmony. This is a general belief that. Jupiter in 
the 7 th house gives a decent and happy married 
life and the spouse would be good looking, having 



260 Foretelling Widowhood 

high moral values in life. Though this is true at 
various places but this does not hold good in all 
cases. The aspect of Jupiter over the 7 th or 8 th house 
in a female nativity gives a long span of married 
life. This belief too, does not hold good everywhere. 
It is also an accepted truth that Jupiter's period 
will be bestowing auspicious and benefic results 
to the native. However, I have found that Jupiter 
does not save widowhood or separation, even if it 
is posited in the 7 th or 8 th house or lends aspect 
over there, in a female horoscope in particular. If 
the combinations of widowhood are present in a 
birth chart, the widowhood may take place even 
during the sub-period or major period of Jupiter, 
as the case may be. It has been mentioned in 
various scripts that the placement or aspect of 
Jupiter over the 7 th or 8 th house rules out the 
possibilities of widowhood. 

The 7 th house governs husband and the 8 th house 
rules the marital happiness, saubhagya and life of 
husband in a female birth chart. Looking at Jupiter's 
location in the 8 th house under retrograde motion 
in Virgo in the horoscope of wife of a senior IPS 
officer, I had once opined a long life for her 
husband. She was not having any kind of kuja dosa 
either from ascendant or from Moon. On 
August 26 th , 2002 I was shocked when I heard that 
her husband and young daughter died in a road 
accident on the spot itself. This tragedy with the 
beautiful woman took place around her 45 th year 
of age. This tragic event for once broke my confidence 
in astrology. I took out more .than ten dozen 
horoscopes of females who had suffered early loss 
of their spouse. I observed that around 50% of them 
entered into the marital disaster of widowhood 
during the major or sub-period of Jupiter and in 



Widowhood and Misconceptions About Jupiter 261 

most of the cases, Jupiter either lended its aspect 
over the 7 th or 8 th house or it was placed there only. 

I will try to explain my humble observation with 
the help of few illustrations that Jupiter is not 
always good and Saturn is not always bad. It Is 
believed and a few Sanskrit scripts also mention 
that /cu/a dosa gets cancelled or is nullified if 
Jupiter or Moon aspect Mars or are associated with 
that. In my observations of more than hundreds 
of birth chart, I do not find myself in a position 
to support this view, 1 have examined ^innumerable 
charts showing close relationship of Mars-Jupiter 
or Mars-Moon where killings, suicides, separation, 
litigation and widowhood took place. We have 
explained all this in our book Predicting Marriage, 
in length. Here I intend to deal with the role of 
Jupiter in saving or causing widowhood. At various 
places, Jupiter makes one fortunate to enjoy 
saubhagya. On the contrary, in various cases 
Jupiter gives rise to widowhood during its dasd 
bhukti and does not save widowhood inspite of Its 
aspect over the concerning houses. 

Jupiter is the significator of saubhdgya yoga 
whereas Mars is the significator of husband and 
the Sun rules the activities, education, profession, 
influence and impression of the husband. However, 
Mars and Jupiter certainly play a prominent role 
as far as loss of husband is concerned particularly 
in young age. Affliction of Jupiter is very adverse 
even in the 7 th or 8 th house. One should not be 
misguided even if Jupiter is exalted or placed in 
own sign giving rise to Hamsa Mahapurusa Rqjayoga 
in the 7 th house. 

Let me illustrate few cases where Jupiter played 
a negative role in causing loss of husband, 
untimely:- 



262 Foretelling Widowhood 

Case No. 5.1 (Horoscope No.2-vide p. 137) 

The birth took place when Virgo ascendant was rising 
with Jupiter in Pisces in the 7 th house. She is the 
daughter of a multimillionaire business man who 
believed a lot in astrology. Placement of Jupiter in 
the 7 th house in Pisces was appreciated by one and 
all for her happy and everlasting married life. She is 
not mangcdl from ascendant but she is mangoli from 
Moon. Her marriage was ceremonised at a very large 
scale on March 6 th , 1996 during sub-period of Rahu 
in the major period of Venus, after proper matching 
of birth charts of both. There was compatability of 
28 points out of 36 and the boy, as also candra 
mafigall. Her husband committed suicide on 
March 8 th , 1999 during sub-period of Jupiter in the 
major period of Venus* The husband failed in 
examination and his father scolded him in insulting 
way and that became the cause of suicide. 

In this horoscope, Jupiter occupies its own sign 
Pisces in the 7 th house but that could not save her 
early widowhood inspite of obtaining vargottama 
navarhscL Here Moon falls in jyestha in Scorpio and 
is aspected by its dispositor Mars, Ketu occupies 
the 8 th house and the Sun joins the 6 th giving rise 
to papakartari yoga. Retrograde Saturn aspects the 
ascendant, the lord of the ascendant Mercury, 
Venus, the 8 th house and Ketu. Jupiter suffers 
kendradhipati dosa and it is also a badhaka for 
Virgo ascendant. In navdmsa, the 7 th lord Jupiter 
is under mutual aspect with 8 th lord Mars and these 
all combinations resulted into early widowhood of 
this girl around 23 years of age. 

Case No. 5.2 (Horoscope No A-vide p. 142) 

The birth chart belongs to the wife of an Airforce 
Officer who suffered widowhood within 4V4 years of 



Widowhood and Misconceptions About Jupiter 263 

marriage inspite of the placement of the 5 th and 8 th 
lord Jupiter In the 7 th house. She was choosen, out 
of one hundred girls by her husband as she was 
extremely beautiful and charming. Jupiter's presence 
in the 7 th house was appreciated by one and all at 
the time of her marriage. She got married on 
October 5 th , 1973 during sub-period of Jupiter in the 
major period of Rahtu She faced the biggest tragedy 
on March 2 nd , 1978 when, the aeroplane her husband 
was piloting, crashed In front of her eyes, 
immediately after taking off. Rdhu's major period 
and Mercuiy's sub-period was operative over her at 
that time. 

Here Jupiter obtains navaihsa of Mars and falls 
in the constellation of Mars, dhanistha^ Mars joins 
the 5 th house in Jupiter's sign Sagittarius and 
aspects the 8 th house and that created the tragedy. 
Jupiter is also responsible to cause early widowhood. 

Case No. 5.3 (Horoscope No. 11 -vide p. 158) 

She is a beautiful female who enjoyed all kinds of 
luxury and wealth during her college and university 
days. She loved a muslim boy but ultimately 
marriage with him could not take place due to family 
traditions. She ultimately got married with a scientist 
around October 1987 during sub-period of Jupiter 
in the major period of Jupiter. Her husband expired 
in a fire accident within 15 months after marriage 
in January 1989. Thus, she got married and suffered 
widowhood during Jupiter-Jupiter dasa bhvktL There 
are various combinations in the birth chart for 
widowhood. Mars-Ketu and Mercury occupy the 7 th 
house and these are under mutual aspect with 
Saturn who is posited in the 10 th * Moon is associated 
with Saturn and aspected by Mars and Jupiter. It is 
strongly believedthat the aspect or placement of 



264 Foretelling Widowhood 

Jupiter in the 7 th or 8 th house gives rise to akhanda 
saubhagya yoga, i.e., the wife will die in front of her 
husband. In this horoscope, Jupiter is placed in the 
2 nd house in Gemini under retrograde motion under 
the aspect of 2 nd and 12 th lord Mars. In bhava calita 
chart, Jupiter is shifted in the ascendant. In either 
cases, Jupiter lends aspect over the 8 th or 7 th house 
but widowhood could not be saved. Here Jupiter 
obtains own navamsa. 

The 8 th house Indicates the span of married life 
that is the life of husband. Here Jupiter falls in 
Rahu's constellation drdrd as 8 th and 11 th lord and 
receives the malefic aspect of evil Mars. Thus 
Jupiter is afflicted heavily as it falls over the axis 
of nodes. Since early widowhood is indicated to her, 
therefore, it resulted in Jupiter-Jupiter dasa bhukti 
which is the same dasa in which the marriage took 
place. I therefore, humbly opine that Jupiter's 
influence over the 7^ or 8 th house in a female 
nativity should not be wrongly interpreted for high 
hopes to save widowhood. For Leo ascendant, 
Jupiter is a malefic and if it is placed even in the 
7 th house under the aspect of any malefic, that may 
make one widow during the period of Its Influence. 

Case No. 5.4 {Horoscope No.9-vide p. 154) 

The lady got married on March 7 th , 1979 with a 
handsome, and smart doctor. She was blessed with a 
son on February 20 th , 1982. She had a quarrelsome 
nature whereas her husband was quite peace-loving. 
Tlie husband committed suicide on March 19 th , 1985 
after knowing about her physical relationship with 
other man. At the time of widowhood, she was 
running under the sub-period of Mars in the major 
period of Jupiter. She was born under Virgo ascendant 
with 6 th lord Saturn, 7 th lord Jupiter occupies the 8 th 



Widowhood and Misconceptions About Jupiter 265 

house in Aries and 8 th lord Mars aspects Jupiter in 
the 8 th house. 

The 7 th and 8 th lord Jupiter and Mars aspects each 
other identical to 8 th and 2 nd house. It is believed 
that Jupiter's placement in the 12 th , 7 th , 2 nd , 4 th , 
8 th and 11 th house gives high moral character and 
saves widowhood. In the present case, Jupiter's 
presence in the 8 th house could neither bless her 
with high degree of moral character nor it could 
save widowhood, I humbly opine that we should not 
expect too much from benefic Jupiter. 

This is certainly true that it is only Jupiter who 
can bless a female with akhanda saubhagya yoga. 
But it is not at all true that Jupiter's influence on 
the concerning houses always saves widowhood, I 
have tried to illustrate the same here that high hopes 
from Jupiter for each and every ascendant is 
misleading in respect of long life of husband, high 
degree of conjugal bliss and for moral character. 

Case No, 5.5 (Horoscope No + 16-uide p. 170) 

This is the horoscope of a famous gynaelcologist of 
UP who is very famous for her talent and merits in 
the field of medicine. She had a love marriage with a 
E.N.T. Surgeon on May 17 th , 1981. Her husband 
expired on November 4 th , 1996 due to massive heart- 
attack when she was under the influence of major 
period of Jupiter and sub-period of Saturn. Here 
Jupiter is the 8 th and 11 th lord. Thus, it is a malefic 
for Taurus ascendant. Jupiter aspects the 8 th house 
alongwith Mars* The Jupiter is the 8 th lord and is 
aspected by malefic Saturn. From Jupiter, Saturn is 
7 th lord and Jupiter is the 8 th lord. Here Jupiter 
aspects over the 8 th house, could not save widowhood. 
On the other hand, joint aspect of Mars-Jupiter and 
Saturn over the 8 th house in the bhava calita resulted 



266 Foretelling Widowhood 

into the biggest tragedy of loss of husband during 
Jupiter-Saturn period. 

Case No. 5-6 (Horoscope No.23-tride p. 184) 

She got married on Nov. 24 th , 1968 during Rahu- 
Moon period. She remained separated from her 
husband for 8 years after marriage due to 
misbehaviour of her mother-in-law. She suffered 
widowhood on November 7 th , 1997 during sub-period 
of Venus in the major period of Jupiter. Here Jupiter 
is the lord of the 2 nd and 1 1 th house. It is placed in 
Martian sign Scorpio. Jupiter is the dispositor of 
Mars, therefore, the effect of Mars has come during 
the major period of Jupiter. The lord of ascendant 
Saturn and 7 th lord Sun are conjoined in the 6 th house. 
From where, Saturn aspects the 8 th , 12 th and 3 rd house 
giving rise to loss off husband. Venus and Jupiter 
are 6 th and 8 th from each other in rdsi and navdrhsa 
both. Sub-period of Venus in the major period of 
Jupiter caused widowhood. It is a rule that malefic 
planet placed in the 8 th house, if indicates widowhood, 
the same will come in evidence during the major or 
sub-period of the navdrhsa lord occupied by the 
malefic planet who has joined 8 th house. Here the 
planet posited in the 8 th house is Mars, who is solely 
responsible for widowhood. Mars obtains navdrhsa 
of Jupiter and sub-period lord Venus joins the 8 th 
house from dasd lord Jupiter in the birth and 
navdrhsa both. Venus becomes 7 th and 12 th lord if 
recknoed from dasd lord Jupiter. Therefore, sudden 
setback of the unexpected demise of her husband 
took place during major period of Jupiter and sub- 
period of Saturn. This is the sole reason of the 
emphasis on the navdrhsa chart. This helps a lot 
not only in timing events but it also helps in making 
very accurate observations regarding all aspects 
of marriage. 



Widowhood and Misconceptions About Jupiter 267 

Case No. 5.7 (Horoscope No.26-uide p. 191) 

She got married on June 24 th , 1982 at 18 years of 
age and suffered widowhood on August 6 th , 1993 at 
29 years of age during the sub-period of Saturn in 
the major period of Jupiter. The Jupiter, Mars and 
Saturn aspect the 8 th house which governs 
widowhood. Here again Jupiter's aspect over the 8 th 
house could not save widowhood. Here Jupiter occupy 
the Martian sign Aries and is 8 th from 7 th lord Moon. 
Jupiter is also aspected by malefic and retrograde 
Saturn. Jupiter is a malefic for Capricorn ascendant. 
Retrograde Saturn occupies the 2 nd house in own 
sign and aspects the 8 th house, 2 nd house indicates 
death of husband as it is 8 th from 7 th . The 8 th house 
indicates span and happiness of married life. Thus, 
Saturn in the 2 nd who is 6 th from 2 nd lord Moon and 
aspects the 8 th house caused loss of husband due to 
massive heart attack in its bhuktt during the major 
period of Jupiter. 1 have always tried to prove that 
Mars in the 5 th house is maladroit for females and 
may cause widowhood. Here Mars who aspects the 
8 th house and obtains navdmsa of Jupiter also 
indicates widowhood during the course of major 
period especially when Mars is the dispositor of 
Jupiter, These points may be noted carefully where 
Mars plays a vital role giving rise to such tragedy. 

Case No. 5.8 (Horoscope No.3-ufde p,140) 

This poor girl who lost her parents before her marriage 
and was serving in a school to meet her both ends. 
She got married on May 8 th , 1996 during RahurRahu 
period and suffered loss of husband within 1 year of 
her marriage on April 17 th , 1997 during sub-period 
of Jupiter in the major period of Rahu. Here Jupiter 
occupies the 12 th house in association with Rdhu 
and aspects the 8 th house. The Rahu obtains navamsa 



268 Foretelling Widowhood 

of Mars and is associated closely with Rahiu In other 
words, saubhagya karaka Jupiter falls over the axis 
of Rahu and Ketu. Therefore, sub-period of Jupiter 
in the major period of Rahu resulted into massive 
heart attack to her husband. That ruined her life as 
she was cursed for widowhood within a few months 
after her marriage. 

Case No* 5,9 (Horoscope No.28-vide p. 195) 

Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the former Prime Minister of 
India, suffered widowhood on September 9 th , 1960 
during major period of Jupiter and the sub-period of 
Mercury. Here Jupiter aspects the ascendant lord 
Moon and the 7 th house. Mars also aspects Moon in 
bhava calita and vice-versa. Ketu is shifted in the 
11 th house and conjoins with Jupiter. Ketu obtains 
navamsa of Jupiter and both are khadastaka in 
navamsa chart. Jupiter is the lord of the 6 th and 9 th

2 nd lord from major period lord Jupiter, who is placed

of Jupiter in whose major period her husband died.

Ketu is placed in the 7 th house of Jupiter and 
Sagittarius is under the aspect of Mars. Therefore, 
Ketu who is a killer for her husband gives rise to

She is the daughter of the Chairman of the biggest 
government organisation of India after Railways. She 
is very charming, pretty and innocent* She got 
married on February 9 th , 1974 during Ketu-Moon 
period. The marriage took place inspite of my repeated 
warnings, with a doctor. She suffered loss of her 
husband on March 16 th , 1976 as he was crushed by 
car in a road accident during sub-period of Jupiter 
in the major period of Ketu. Jupiter is 8 th lord and 
falls in Taurus ascendant and is aspected by malefic 
Mars. Ketu is posited in the 2 nd house in dvirdasa 
position. Jupiter's aspect over 7 th house and Mars 
could not prevent widowhood. Widowhood took place 
during Jupiter's sub-period in the major period of 
Ketu. Here Jupiter is the 8 th lord and also is the 
navamsa lord of Venus who occupies the 8 th house 
in navamsa chart. Here it may be noted that 8 th lord 
Jupiter lends its aspect over the 7 th house and 
obtains navamsa of its exaltation even then, the 
widowhood took place during sub-period of Jupiter 
in the major period of Ketu within 2V£ years of her 
marriage. Therefore, any misconception of false hopes 
should never be there about Jupiter in regard to 
everlasting conjugal bliss.

bhuktL Just after 10 months, her husband expired 
in a plane crash soon after take off on Jan, 10^,1962 
during sub-period of Jupiter in the major period of 
Moon, Jupiter is a malefic for Libra ascendant. It is 
placed in the 5^ house with Sun and is shifted in 
the 6 th house. Moon is placed in the 7 th house in 
Martian sign Aries and 7 th lord Mars occupies the 8 th 
house. Yogakaraka Saturn occupies the 2 nd house 
under mutual aspect with Mars* However, sub-period 
of Jupiter killed her husband because Jupiter is the 
navarhsa lord of the 8 th house Venus. Here Jupiter 
obtains own navarhsa, even then it could not protect 
widowhood at least in own dasa. It may be noted 
that she was born in asvini naksatra and in the sign 
of Mars - Aries and Moon is the dispositor of Mars, 
so it resulted into widowhood into its own major period 
and Jupiter is 12 th lord from Moon and that is afflicted 
in various ways as mentioned above. Therefore, 
Jupiter brought widowhood in its bhuktL

She was the wife of an IPS officer. She was quite

February 28 u \ 1982 during Kahu-Jupiter period. Rahu 
is placed in the 2 nd house and Jupiter is placed in 
the 10 th house in Taurus in association with Venus, 
Sun and Mercury. Jupiter is the 8 th lord and is 
aspected by Mars. Therefore, Jupiter's sub-period 
forced her husband to commit suicide. Jupiter is 7 th 
lord from major period lord Rahu and this house is 
hemmed between 1 st rate malefics Mars and Saturn. 
Thus, the 8^ from lagrta and 7 th from major period 
lord Rahu is Pisces and that is placed under 
papakartari yoga. Jupiter is combust and is placed 
with inimical Venus and Mercury, therefore,

naksatra and is conjoined with Sun, Saturn and KetiL 
Many times, persons born in jyestha naksatra suffer 
a lot during the major or sub-period of Moon especially 
if the widowhood is indicated to them. I know a few 
female nativities who were born in jyestha naksatra 
and they suffered widowhood during Mars dasa bhuktL 
Here Saturn joins the 2 nd house in martian sign 
Scorpio and obtains vargottama navamsa. Here Moon 
is the dispositor of Mars and Mars happens a killer 
for Libra, therefore, Moon gives effects like Mars and 
Moon is posited in 2nd with inimical Saturn and 
Ketu. Therefore, Saturn's sub-period in the major 
period of Moon, resulted in sudden loss of husband 
due to ulcer in stomach. Here Moon and Saturn both 
are heaily afflicted because these are placed over 
the axis of Rahu and Ketu in the 2nd house, which is 
8th from 7th showing untimely death of husband. 
Birth took place in Jyestha naksatra and the husband 
was also Jyestha (eldest) in the family which resulted 
into the tragedy. Therefore, sub-period of Saturn 
finally brought unhappy end of her husband during 
its course and bhuktL 

Dozens of cases may also be illustrated to prove 
the misconceptions about Jupiter in saving 
widowhood or blessing the native for ever lasting 
conjugal bliss. These humble observation in regard 



272 Foretelling Widowhood 

to role of Jupiter and widowhood, i have expressed 
only what I have realised and experienced during 
the study of horoscopes of various females who 
suffered untimely demise of their husband. 

in this regard, I have observed that the widowhood 
generally comes early or late depending upon the 
overall planetary positions in the birth chart. If 
early widowhood is indicated, one should try to 
examine sub-periods responsible for loss of spouse 
but major period should be same in which marriage 
took place or the major period may be just next 
to that depending upon the remaining course of 
period. If maleflcs occupy the 8 th house and give 
rise to widowhood, the same may come during the 
dasa bhukti during the navamsa lord of planet 
placed in the 8 tt house or navamsa lord obtained 
by the lord of the 8 th house. The widowhood may 
also come during the dasa bhukti of those planets 
who are afflicted in the 7 th house or 8 th house or 
during the dasa of the navamsa lord obtained by 
the planet who is solely responsible for widowhood. 

The 2 nd house from ascendant which is 8^ from 
7 th , is also important and its affliction may result 
in widowhood during its course. The 8 th house from 
ascendant, its lord and planets also play negative 
role. Females born in jyestha naksatra may suffer 
widowhood during major or sub-period of Moon and 
during the dasa bhukti obtained by Moon. 

Here we have made an honest, sincere, practical 
endeavour to judge whether Jupiter can prevent 
widowhood, if it is posited in a favourable position. 
Jupiter's placement in the 7 th house in watery sign 
is extremely adverse but if Jupiter is the lord of 
the 8 th joins the 7 th or Jupiter owns the 7 th and 
joins 8 th under the malefic aspect of Mars, widowhood 
may came in evidence during dasa bhukti of Jupiter. 



Widowhood and Misconceptions About Jupiter 273 

The aspect of Jupiter over the 7 th house, 8 th house, 
ascendant etc. does not prevent widowhood if it is 
indicated by the other planetary combinations in 
a horoscope. One should also examine whether 
Jupiter is auspicious or inauspicious for particular 
ascendant. Many times Jupiter may act as malefic, 
like Mars such as placement of retrograde Jupiter 
in the 8 th house in inimical sign under malefic 
aspect. Aspect of Mars over Jupiter and the aspect 
of Jupiter over Mars destroys the good effect of both. 
In such cases, Jupiter becomes a malefic and Mars 
becomes a heavier malefic to harm the female. 

I therefore, strongly but humbly opine that we 
should not have false hopes from Jupiter especially 
if it is favourably placed in the birth chart, that 
it will surely prevent widowhood and will bless the 
native with ever lasting conjugal bliss. On the 
contrary Jupiter may result into loss of spouse, if 
adversely placed and afflicted as illustrated here 
in number of cases.

AKHANDA SAUBHAGYA YOGA 
FOR FEMALES 



Loss of husband is more common than the loss 
of wife. The women who die earlier than their 
husbands, are fortunate and are said to have 
attained akhanda saubhagya. Almost all women 
desire to be akhanda saubhagyavati One attains it 
on the basis of karma of previous life. The average 
age of men is less than that of women as per survey. 
The rate of death of men is certainly higher than 
women because men have to suffer occupational 
hazards and do risky works as compared to women. 
The life of a woman is full of happiness and pride so 
long her husband is alive. Remaining alive of 
husband is the honour of a woman. We will make an 
honest and sincere effort to explain the planetary 
combination in the horoscope of a woman to attain 
akhanda saubhagya yoga. 

The combination of akhanda saubhagya yoga in 
the horoscope of women is most fortunate for them. 
Almost one hundred percent of married women have 
an inner desire to die before their husbands but only 
a few are fortunate to have their desires fulfilled! 
First of all, we shall try to quote a few of 
important aphorisms as given in various classical 
texts. Thereafter, we shall be illustrating a few 
practical cases and verifying of the combination of 
akhanda saubhagya yoga.

Akhanda Saubhagya Yoga for Females 279 

All auspicious yoga present in the horoscope of 
a woman will give good results to her husband and 
should be understood thus. Physical pleasure and 
comfort in the horoscope should be studied from 
the ascendant or Moon, whichever is stronger. 
Merits and demerits of the husband should be 
examined from the 7 th house and his death from 
the 8 th house. 

Mantresvara writes in the sloka 15 of chapter 6 th 
in the great classical work Phaladlpika that the 
female having mahabhagya yoga in her Horoscope 
will be blessed with akhanda saubhagya.

The person with mahabhagya yoga will be im-

in giving gifts and will possess a very high repu- 
tation. She will be a ruler of the earth, will have 
a life span of 80 years and will be of spotless 
character. A female born with this yoga will be 
exceedingly fortunate and possess sweet manners 
and akhanda saubhagya.

Mahabhagya yoga is caused in the case of a male if 
the birth is during the day (between sunrise and 
sunset), if the ascendant, Sun, Moon is in odd signs. 
Mahabhagya yoga will arise in the case of a female if 
the birth is during the night time (after sunset and 
before sunrise) when the ascendant, the Sun, the 
Moon are in even signs.

Even if all beneflcs occupy their sign of exaltation 
but if malefic occupy the 8 th house in the malefic 
sign and that is aspected by any evil planet, the 
female suffers widowhood. If the navarhsa occupied 
by the 8 th lord Is owned by a malefic, the widowhood 
is certain. If beneflcs occupy the 8 th house, the 
female will die before her husband.

if malefics and beneflcs fall in the ascendant, 
beneflcs falls in the 2 nd house, then female dies 
earlier than her husband. If Moon falls in Taurus, 
Leo and Cancer in a female nativity, she has few 
number of sons. If the sign of husband is an odd 
number if reckoned from the sign of a wife, the 
wife will die prior to her husband. If the number 
is even, the husband will die before his wife.

Combinations For Obtaining Akhanqa Saubhagya 

On the basis of practical application of the above- 
mentioned aphorisms, which are taken from various 
classical texts, i have observed that a female can 
attain akhancia saubhagya only if the 9 th house is 
well fortified or strong in addition to these 
combinations of beneflc and malefic planets, as given 
in slokas. This may be summarized as under: 

1. If beneflcs are placed in the 8 th house, the 
female dies before her husband. If maleflcs 
occupy the 8 th lord, the strong beneflcs join the 
second, the female will die prior to her 
husband. 

2. If a strong beneflc or the lord of the 7 th join 
the 7 th house from the ascendant or Moon, the 
combination of widowhood gets cancelled 
automatically. 

3. If beneflcs occupy the 2 nd house, the maleflcs 
and beneflcs both join the ascendant, the 
female will expire before her husband. 

4. If the birth of a female takes place during night 
and the ascendant, Moon and the Sun falls in 
even signs, the female dies before her husband. 

5. The seventh house should be well fortified but 
the ascendant should be weak or Its lord should 
be placed adversely. The second or 8 th house 
or both should be occupied by beneflcs, well 
fortified. However, if 8 th house is weak or 
afflicted, the 2 nd house should essentially be 
well disposed by the influence of beneflc placed. 
akhanda saubhagya yoga will be effective only 
if the 9 th house is strong and its lord is well 
placed or the 9 th house is occupied by the 
Kendra lords and beneflcs. If the 9 th house is 
weak or afflicted in the horoscope of a female, 
she may not attain saubhagya or mangalya 



282 Foretelling Widowhood 

inspite of the presence of other benefic 
combinations of planets in her horoscope. 
Therefore, first of all, the strength should be 
examined while making judgement whether the 
death of wife will take place before her husband, 
i.e., whether she will attain akhanda saubhagya.

was contemplated to take off in July 2002 for which 
selection of astronauts was done In January 2002. 
It was a matter of great pride that Kalpana Chawla 
was again or selected as mission specialist on the 
space shuttle Columbia STS-107 tentatively 
scheduled to take off in July 2002 and with this 
rare event in the history of space mission, she 
became the first woman in the world to venture 
into space twice, the Pride of India, as Kalpana 
Chawla, Unfortunately, we lost her on the tragic 
explosion of Columbia space shuttle STS-113 on 
1 st February 2003. She had almost completed her 
voyage and her shuttle was about to land on the 
earth after just 16 minutes if the explosion would 
not have taken place. 

The loss of Mrs. Kalpana Chawla is certainly 
irrecoverable. However we are concerned with the 
combinations of akhaxycLa saubhagya yoga present 
in her horoscope. She was born in Taurus ascen- 
dant. Yogakaraka Saturn Is conjoined with Ketu in 
the 9 th house but both are shifted in the 10 th house. 
She was born in aslesd naksatra last pada, which 
is of mulcL Lord of lagna Venus is exalted in the 
11 th house and is associated with 4 th lord Sun. The 
combination of lagna lord Venus and 4 th lord Sun 
is certainty splendid with prosperous and happy 
wife. However, 5 th and 2 nd lord Mercury occupies 
the 10 th house with 12 th and 7 th lord Mars and 8 th 
and 12 th lord Jupiter in Aquarius sign. Aquarius 
is an airy sign. Thus the combination of 12 th and 
8 th lord Jupiter and Mars is present in the 10 th 
house with 2 nd lord Mercury. This combination 
shows that Mrs. Kalpana Chawla was extremely 
Intelligent, dynamic and dashing lady who was 
blessed with immense courage and enthusiasm. 
Professionally she was highly placed due to strong

10 th house. 10 th and 9 th lord Saturn is very strong 
in sadabalcL In bhava chart, 5 planets occupy the 
10 th house and adhi yoga has also been formed. 
Moreover, karmic planets are associated with Rahu 
and Ketu, therefore, the strength of karmic control 
planets has been largely enhanced. Moon and 
Saturn are karmic control planets and are placed 
7 th from each other. This is supposed to be strongest 
rqjayoga. Apart from that, strong sapta graha 
mallika rcgayoga is also present. Both the triangle 
lords are conjoined in the 10 th in bhava chart in 
association with 8 th and 11 th lord Jupiter, 7 th and 
12 th lord Mars which shows unaccountable success 
in profession. In this horoscope, lagna lord Venus 
is exalted, Moon and Saturn fall in own. Mars 
obtains navamsa of its exaltation and 10 th lord 
yogakaraka Saturn obtains navamsa of Venus, the 
lord of the lagna. These all combinations made her 
a woman of worldwide fame. Fag end of the major 
period of Venus when the sub-period of Mercury 
was running over her, resulted into her tragic death 
in space on February 1 st , 2003. It will not be out 
of place to mention that Madam Kalpana Chawla 
had expressed her prime ambition a few days ago 
that she wanted to die in space only. She was a 
true patriot and almighty fulfilled her last ambition 
on February 1 st , 2003 as she breathed last there 
in space. 

She was running under the sub-period of Mercury 
who is marakesa for Taurus ascendant and is 
heavily afflicted due to conjunction of another 
marakesa Mars who is inimical to Mercury. Mercury 
obtains mrityuansa and Venus who's mahadasa was 
running, obtains the navamsa of Mars. Saturn was 
transiting in the ascendant and was aspecting 7 th 
and 12 th lord Mars, 8 th lord Jupiter, 2 nd and 5 th lord 



286 Foretelling Widowhood 

Mercury, radical Moon, Rahu and 3 rd house, and 
7 th house. Mars was transiting into 7 th house and 
was aspecting the ascendant, Mercury, Mars and 
Jupiter, i.e., transiting Saturn and Mars were 
aspecting marakesa planets both Mercury and 
Mars, This is very adverse and critical combination 
for death especially as Rahu and Ketu were conjoined 
with Saturn and Mars respectively. Moon and Sun 
were transiting in srdvana naksatra over the axis 
of Rahu and Ketu. Moon and Sun was facing radical 
Moon and Rahu and was crossing Ketu and Saturn 
on the black day of her death. 

Here we are concerned with her death as 
saubhagyavati female. The 7 th lord Mars occupies 
the 10th house who is strong in digbala and obtains 
1.2 sadabala. 2 nd lord Mercury is conjoined with 
Jupiter and 2 nd house is aspected by Jupiter and 
that indicates comparatively long life to her hus- 
band. Lagna is unaspected by any benefic planets 
but is aspected by malefic Mars. Lagna lord Venus 
is associated with inimical Sun and obtains navamsa 
of marakesa Mars. 8 th house is also afflicted as its 
lord Jupiter is associated with Mars and Mercury 
and is placed under papakartari yoga. Moreover, 8 th 
lord Jupiter and lagna lord Venus obtains navamsa 
of Mars under the aspect of Saturn. This is certainly 
indicating short and unnatural end of her life, let 
us examine the 9 th house where yogakaraka Saturn 
is placed in own sign Capricorn. In Bhava chart 
Saturn is shifted in the 10 th house, it is the second 
strongest planet as it obtains 1.33 sadabala. Thus 
9 th house is strong, 8 th house is afflicted, 7 th and 
2 nd house is well fortified and 9 th house also 
happens to be quite powerful. Therefore, she had 
a death of saubhagyavati female though her tragic 
death is not only a very heavy loss of India or USA 



Akhan^a Saubhagya Yoga for Females 287 

but it's a loss of an intellectual, dynamic, 
outstanding, and meritorious female astronaut of 
the world wide fame. Such great soul are rarely 
born on this earth.

This is the case of the daughter of my elder sister 
who always secured the first position in school, 
college and University. She was working as a 
Probationary Officer in a nationalized bank and had 
outstanding records. 

She was married on November 24 th , 1989 during

Here Saturn is yogakdraka and joins the 2 nd house. 
She died due to breast cancer on May 27 th , 1993 
during sub-period of Venus in the major period of 
Moon before her husband at 34 years of age. 
However, though she died within 4 years of mar- 
riage she attained akhanda saubhagya. Here Mars 
is a malefic planet and is a mdrakesa for Libra. 
Ascendant joins the 8 th house under retrograde 
motion whereas Saturn is a yogakdraka for Libra 
lagna and joins the 2 nd house in Martian sign 
Scorpio under full aspect of Mars. Benefic Jupiter, 
Mercury and Sun are shifted in the 2 nd house, thus 
the 2 nd house is well disposed and 8 th house is 
heavily afflicted with presence of Mars. She was 
born In grand muld, i.e., in the first quarter of muld 
naksatra. Mars occupies the 8 th house in Taurus, 
the sign of Venus. Venus is debilitated and combust 
and joins the 12 th house over the axis of nodes. 
Thus the major period of Moon and the sub-period 
of Venus became maraka for her. We find that the

2 nd house is well disposed and strong whereas the 
8 th house is heavily afflicted by malefics, therefore, 
she attained akhanda saubhagya. In bhava chart, 
Mars is shifted in the 7 th house. The 7 th house is 
strong that is the life of the husband is longer than 
the life of woman in question because lagna lord 
is weak, combust and afflicted in the 12 th house 
in debilitation and obtains inimical navamsa. 

The female who attains akhartda saubhagya must 
have strong 7 th house, afflicted or weak ascendant, 
strong 9 th house in particular. In this horoscope, 
9 th house is quite strong as 9 th lord Mercury is 
associated with Jupiter and Jupiter also aspects 
the 9 th house, therefore, 9 th house is well-disposed 
and quite strong. The ascendant is hemmed bet- 
ween Saturn, Rahu and debilitated Venus. Thus the 
ascendant is weak. 6 th and 12 th lords Jupiter and 
Mercury joins ascendant. This further reduces the 
strength of ascendant, in bhava chart, 7 th lord Mars 
is placed in the 7 th house, thus the husband had 
to live longer. Since she was born in mula, as the 
Moon is placed in mula naksatra, therefore, she died 
during the major period of Moon and in the sub- 
period of Venus as lagna and Venus both are 
afflicted and Venus is 8 th lord. The persons who 
are born in any naksatra of mula and especially 
in grand mula suffer heavily during the major or 
sub-period of Moon.

8 th house is occupied by svaksetri Venus in 
association with Rahu and lord of 2 nd house and 
lord of lagna, Mars and Jupiter are placed in the 
7 th house with 6 th lord Sun. Jupiter aspects the 
ascendant which is owned by Jupiter as well. Mars 
aspects the 2 nd house, which is owned by, Mars 
itself. The 7 th house is placed under subha kartari 
yoga, 2 nd lord Mars obtains own navamsa. In bhava 
chart, 7 th lord Mercury is shifted in the 7 th house. 
Thus, the 7 th house is well disposed due to association 
of lagna lord Jupiter. The 2 nd house is also strong 
as its lord Mars occupies own navamsa and falls 

in Moon's naksatra hasta. The 8 th house and its lord 

» 

are hemmed between Mars and Saturn, i.e. placed 
under pdpakartari yoga. But the 7 th and 2 nd house 
are strong. Bhagyadhipati Mars occupies 7 th house 
but it is combust and lagna lord Jupiter is also 
combust and afflicted. This clearly indicates that 
she will die at an early age in front of her husband 
and that her husband will be alive. 2 nd lord Mars 
obtains own navamsa and joins 7 th house whereas 
Rahu is associated with 8 th lord Venus in the 8 th 
house. She expired due to sudden heart failure 
during the sub-period of Rahu in the major period 
of Mars when Saturn was transiting in the 8 th house 
from radical Moon. It may be noted that she was 
born in the last pada of jyestha naksatra, which 
proved fatal for her. She expired when she was 
nearly 44 years of age and both of her two children, 
a son and a daughter were unsettled and unmarried. 
Since 8 th lord Mars is conjoined with lagna lord 
Jupiter and the 7 th lord Mercury in the 7 th house 
and that indicates akhanda saubhagya yoga though 
at an early age. 9 th lord Mars joins 7 th house in 
association with lagna lord Jupiter. Thus the 9 th 
house is strong, Moon obtains nica bhang as 5 th

lord joins 9 th house and adds strength to the 9 th 
house. Saturn obtains vargottama navamsa in own 
constellation anurodha in the 9 th house. This has 
further added strength to the 9 th house. The lagna 
and 8 th house are weak. Therefore, she attained 
saubhagya yoga leaving her husband and children 
behind. 

Case No. 6.4 (Horoscope No. 38) 

Death -August 15 th , 2003 during Mercury Saturn 
dasd bhukti 

This is the horoscope of one of our near relative 
who lived upto 74 years of age and also attained 
akhanda saubhagya. She was a pious lady com- 
pletely dedicated to her husband. They never 
quarrelled and there was never any difference of 
opinion between them on any aspect of life. The 
biggest tragedy of her life was that though she was 
blessed with 3 sons, they expired one after another 
due to liver problem. Here 12 th lord Jupiter joins 
the 5 th house in Taurus under retrograde motion 
and is aspected by Mars, Mercury, Sun and Venus. 
The 7 th house is well disposed as its lord Moon 
occupies the ascendant; The 7 th lord Moon is 
aspected by Jupiter, which Indicates long life of 
husband. This is a clear indication of akhcmda 
saxibhagya yoga. The 2 nd house is aspected by Mars 
and Saturn both. Saturn is the lagna lord, therefore, 
lagna becomes weak and 7 th house becomes strong. 
She expired after a long suffering of cancer on 
August 15 th , 2003 during the sub-period of Saturn 
in the major period of Mercury. Saturn Is 2 nd lord 
and becomes a marakesa due to its placement in 
the 12 th house. Saturn obtains navamsa of Mercury 
and Mercury obtains navaihsa of its debilitation. 
Therefore, tail-end of major period of Mercury

Case No. 6.5 (Horoscope No. 39) 

Marriage - August 17 th , 1957 during Moon - 
Saturn dasd bhukti 

Death - May 17 th , 2002 during Jupiter - Rahu 
dasd bhukti 

She was the most ideal and simple woman who 
dedicated her life for prosperity, happiness and 
elevation of her husband in various ways. 1 often 
used to say that her husband is the luckiest man 
in respect of life partner. Unfortunately cancer was 
diagnosed to her in the month of July 1998. 1 had 
written in her's life reading, her husband's as also 
her children's that she will suffer from any incurable 
disease in the year 1998 and may not live beyond 
July 24 th , 2002. She suffered a lot due to cancer 
of her ovaries and uterus etc. and ultimately 
expired on May 17 th , 2002 cared by her husband 
during the sub-period of Rahu in the major period 
of Jupiter. Here Rahu is placed in the 12 th house 
and Jupiter occupies the 8 th house. Therefore, major 
period of Jupiter and sub-period of Rahu ended her 
life but she attained akharuia saubhagya. Here 
direct Jupiter occupies the 8 th house in Sagittarius 
and obtains the friendly navarhsa of Sun. Jupiter's 
aspect over the 2 nd house is also encouraging 
placement giving long life to her husband. Jupiter's 
placement in 8 th house if unafflicted and well 
disposed, gives rise to saubhagya yoga. Lagna lord 
Venus is afflicted due to conjunction of Rahu and 
aspect of Saturn. Thus the lagna is weak, 7 th lord 
Mars who is debilitated in 3 rd , obtains nlca bhang 
rqjayoga and aspects 7 th house of its own, in bhava 
chart, making the 7 th house strong. The 8 th house 
indicates mdngalya, so she was fortunate to be

Death - January 22 nd , 2003 during Venus - 
Venus dasa bhuktl 

Marriage - June 4 th , 1969 during Saturn - Venus 
dasa bhuktl 

This is the horoscope of wife of an astrologer of 
worldwide fame, editor and proprietor of various 
journals and author of various authentic books in 
astrology, who has always been a great inspirer, 
assistor, and helper to me as well- 
She got married on June 4 th , 1969 during the sub- 
period of Venus in the major period of Saturn. She 
led a very happy and prosperous life with her 
husband and was blessed with number of children. 
She suddenly lost her life on January 22 nd , 2003 
during sub-period of Venus in the major period of 
Venus. Thus, Venus played a vital role in her life. 
Venus is the lord of 3 rd and 8 th house and joins 
2 nd and 9 th lord Mars. Venus obtains navarhsa of 
Mars. Thus, the 8 th lord Venus is under the 
influence of Mars and Saturn. Lagna lord Jupiter 
is posited in the 12 th house over the axis of Rahu 
and Ketu in association with Moon, in bhava chart, 
Saturn aspects the Jupiter, Moon and Rahu. Thus, 
the lagna is weak but the 7 th house is quite strong 
as its lord Mercury joins the 10 th house with Sun 
under retrograde motion. Mercury obtains own 
navamsa. Sun and Mars are the strongest planet 
in this birth chart as they obtain 1.78 and 1.24 
sadabala respectively. Mars is the 2 nd lord and 
aspects the 2 nd house. Jupiter aspects the 8 th house. 
Thus, the 2 nd and 8 th house are well fortified but

the 8 th and lagna lord Venus and Jupiter is afflicted 
which gave the life span of 52 years. The 9 th house 
must be strong for akhanda saubhagya yoga as 
discussed earlier. In this horoscope, 9 th lord Mars 
is placed in the 11 th house in exaltation and is 
associated with 3 rd and 8 th lord Venus. Thus, the 
9 th house is well fortified. All planets are hemmed 
between Ketu and Rahu. She led a very pious life. 
It was the Venus-Venus dasa bhukti on January 
22 nd , 2003 when she breathed last. Venus is the 
8 th lord and some how it is placed under papakartari 
yoga and subhakartari yoga as well. Venus obtains 
navamsa of Mars and is associated with Mars. Soon 
after the beginning of the major period, sub-period 
of Venus, she left this world for final abode as a 
saubhagyavatl and fortunate wife. Jupiter and 
Saturn's* aspect on the 8* house gives long life to 
her husband and affliction of Venus as discussed 
above, gives middle span of life to her. There is 
mutual exchange in the lagna lord Jupiter and 11 th 
and 12 th lord Saturn. In this horoscope, this 
combination has given rise to akhanda saubhagya 
yoga to her and immense success, popularity, 
prosperity, piousity and wide knowledge, deep 
understanding, astonishing foresight and extreme 
simplicity to her husband. 

10 th and lagna lord Jupiter aspects the 8 th house 
and there is no affliction of the 8 th house. However 
the 2 nd lord Mars who is exalted in the 11 th house 
Is associated with Venus there. This is a powerful 
combination of everlasting happiness in married life 
and her long association throughout her life. This 
combination of Mars-Venus is placed under subha 
kartari yoga. Placement of the 11 th and 12 th lord 
Saturn in the 7 th house is not auspicious especially 
as Saturn falls in the nak$atra of Sun but Saturn 



Akhanda Saubhagya Yoga for Females 299 

obtains the navamsa of the ascendant, i.e. Pisces, 
This gives a long life to her husband. The ascendant 
lord Jupiter falls over the axis of Rahu and Ketu 
obtains vargottama navamsa There is mutual ex- 
change in the navamsa of Jupiter and Saturn and 
that shows a long life to her husband and akhxxnda 
saubhagya yoga. She expired during the sub-period 
of Venus in the major period of Sun. Sun is the 
lord of 6 th house and is associated with the 7 th lord 
Mercury and Venus who is the 8 th lord occupies 
the 2 nd house as reckoned from Sun. The Sun and 
Venus are in dvidvadasa position whose major and 
sub-period ended her life and she attained akhanda 
saubhagya at 52 years of age, 9 th lord Mars Is 
exalted in the 1 1 th house and is placed under subha 
kartari yoga. Thus the 9 th house is strong. 7 th lord 
Mercury obtains own navamsa, lagna lord Jupiter 
who obtains vargottama navamsa, aspects the 8 th 
house and this aspect is free from affliction. 
Therefore, this has given akhanda saubhagya yoga 
to this ladv. 

Case No. 6.7 (Horoscope No. 41) 

Marriage - November 27 th 1966 during Rahu -

7 th house, Mars is associated with lagna lord Venus 
and yogakaraka Saturn is the 7 th house. It has been 
observed by us that placement of Mars in own sign 
Aries does not cause death to husband, on the 
contrary, the conjunction of the lagna and 7 th or 
the 2 nd and 8 th house gives rise to akhandia saubhagya 
yoga provided it is unafflicted, placed under

her death is indicated earlier than her husband. 
Venus is 8 th lord and Saturn is debilitated in 7 th 
house. From Saturn-Venus is debilitated in 7 th 
house. From Saturn, Venus is 2 nd and 7 th lord. Thus 
Venus and Saturn both turned maraka for her but 
made her fortunate to be blessed with akhanda 
saubhagya. 

Case No. 6.8 (Horoscopie No* 42) 

Marriage - November 28th 1972 during Sun - 
Venus dasa bhuktl 

Death - 1979 during Moon - Saturn dasa bhuktl 
The woman was suffering from Cancer and 
expired during the year 1979 during Moon-Saturn 
dasa bhukti at 29 years of age. Lagna lord Venus 
occupied the 8 th house over the axis of Rahu and 
Ketu in association with Sun, Saturn and Mercury. 
Venus is debilitated and combust. Thus the lagna 
becomes weak. The lord of 2 nd and 7 th house Mars 
joins the 2 nd house in own sign Scorpio. This means 
that the life of husband is well-fortified but the 
aspect of Mars over the 8 th house and formation 
of papakartari yoga around ascendant curtailed her 
life span. Lagna lord Venus who is debilitated, 
obtains . navarhsa of Moon and Moon falls in 3 rd 
house in r&si chart, therefore, Moon becomes a 
marakesa for her. The 2 nd and 7 th lord Mars obtains 
navarhsa of Saturn in association with Saturn. 
Moreover, Saturn falls in the 12 th house and from

Akhantfn Saubhagya Yoga for Females 303 

Moon Saturn becomes a marakesa and she died In 
the major period of Moon in the sub-period of 
Saturn in 1979. However, she had a very short span 
of life of only 29 years but she attained saubhdgya 
of reaching the end of her life journey before her 
life partner. Let me conclude the observation that 
the placement of 2 nd and 7 th lord in own sign in 
either of these houses, protects the life of the 
husband and gives akhanda saubhagya if 12 th , 6 th 
or l Bt house or their lords are afflicted.

dasa bhukti 

The subject belonged to a veiy rich and famous 
family of a politician. She was beautiful, lovely and 
had a love marriage on June 11 th , 1973 during 
Mars-Mercuiy period. She was blessed with three 
daughters and a son. Her husband was quite 
handsome but beautiful women were his weakness 
as he was always liked and appreciated by such 
women. After four children were born to the couple, 
her husband had no interest in her. He had a very 
powerful concubine. The above woman was an 
obstacle in their path, and they were charged for 
the execution of her murder on June 2 nd , 1995. 
There was prominent coverage of this news in all 
the prestigious newspapers, TV channels of the 
countiy. Though she was murdered but still she 
attained akhanda saubhagya. Husband and the 
concubine in question were prosecuted and 
imprisoned.

Saturn-Jupiter is shifted in 9 th and 3 rd house 
respectively. Thus Jupiter aspects the 7 th house and 
2 nd lord Saturn and the 7 th lord Mercury, which 
resulted into akhanda saubhagya. Placement of 
Mars in the 8 th house caused unnatural death by 
way of murder. The bhdgya yoga of the 9 th house 
should also be strong for obtaining' akhanda

Martian sign Aries and obtains navamsa of Mars 
as well. Saturn is marakesa for her and obtains 
navamsa of Jupiter. Jupiter is shifted in the 3 rd

She sacrificed not only royalty but also name, fame, 
honour, comfort, luxury and lavish life for the sake 
of her love Dodi Fayed. Earlier, she was married 
in the year 1981 during Rahu Mars dasd bhuktL 
She was blessed with the son named William on 
June 21 5t , 1982 during Jupiter-Jupiter dasd bhukti 
and another son, Hany on Sep. 15 th , 1984 during 
Jupiter-Saturn dasd bhukti. She died in a car 
accident on August 31 st , 1997 during sub-period of 
Rahu in the major period of Jupiter. However, this 
happened before the divorce with her husband. In 
this horoscope, the 7 th house is well fortified as 9 th 
and 7 th lord are conjoined in the 7 th house. 2 nd house 
is also well fortified because lagna lord Jupiter is 
conjoined with 2 nd lord Saturn In 2 nd house under 
retrograde motion. The aspect of Jupiter and Saturn 
over the 8 th house gave her akhanda saubhagya but 
shifting of Rahu in the 8 th house in bhdva chart 
and conjunction of 8 th lord Moon under the aspect 
of 12 th lord Mars resulted into unnatural and 
accidental death. Retrograde Jupiter in 2 nd house 
and Rahu in the 8 th house in bhava chart caused 
her sad demise at the age of 36 years during 
Jupiter-Kdhu dasd bhuktL In this case, 7 th and 2 nd 
house are strong but the ascendant is weak. The 
9 th house promotes the 7 th house that is of husband. 
Therefore* she attained akhanda saubhagya.

lord Mercury and Rahu. The 7 th house is occupied 
by 3 rd and 10 th lord Mars, 11 th and 2 nd lord Jupiter 
and KetiL The 9 th lord Venus occupies the 12 th house 
in association with 12 th lord Saturn. In Bhdva chart, 
Jupiter and Mars are shifted in 8 th house and both 
are retrograde as well. From here Jupiter aspects 
the 9 th lord Venus and lagna lord Saturn. Placement 
of Moon in 8 th house has given rise to viprita raja 
yoga. Thus the placement of lord of 2 nd house in 
the 7 th house under the aspect of 7 th lord Sun, has 
made the 7 th house strong. Therefore, such a woman 
should die before her husband or the husband of 
such a female should die after her. The 9 th house 
is also well disposed as 9 th lord Venus is associated 
with lagna lord Venus and 9 th house is aspected 
by Saturn as well. The 8 th house contains Mars, 
Jupiter and Moon. Here Jupiter gave akhanda 
saubhagya and Mars resulted in untimely death due 
to cancer. To attain akhanda saubhagya, the 7 th 
house should be stronger than the ascendant. The 
2 nd house should be aspected or associated by 
benefics and the 8 th house may be joined by 
malefics, as that will give rise to early death. If 
the 8 th house is also joined by benefics, she will 
live longer and attain akhanda saubhagya provided 
9 th house is well disposed and strong. In the case 
of Madhubala, 2 nd and 7 th house are strong and are 
under the influence of benefic planets whereas the 
ascendant and 8 th house are heavily afflicted and 
weak. She, therefore, died during the sub-period 
of Mercury in the major period of Jupiter at 36 years 
of age in 1968. Jupiter is marakesa as it owns 2 nd 
and 11 th house in association with Ketu but obtains 
own navamscu Mercury is 5 th and 8 th lord and joins 
the ascendant. Mercury is the lord of 2 nd house as 
reckoned from Jupiter and joins the 7 th house from 
Jupiter under the affliction of Rahu and Is combust

as well. Therefore, sub-period of Mercury in the 
major period of Jupiter caused early and tragic 
death of "Gifted* Madhubala. But her death was 
honoured with akhanda saubhagya. 

Case No, 6,12 (Horoscope No. 46) 

Marriage - 1983 during Saturn - Sun dasd bhukti 
Death - December 13 th , 1985 during Saturn - 
Mars dasd bhukti 

Smita Patil was married to Raj Babbar and 
expired while giving birth to a baby on 
December 13 th , 1985. Lord of the ascendant Jupiter 
falls in the 6 th house In friendly sign. The 2 nd house 
is aspected by its own lord Mars, lagna and 10 th 
lord Jupiter, the 5 th lord Moon, the 6 th . lord Sun, 
3 rd and 8 th lord Venus. Thus the 2 nd house is well 
fortified but the ascendant and 8 th house are weak 
and afflicted. 7 th lord Mercury is exalted in the 7 th 
house with 9 th and 2 nd lord Mars. Thus she was 
fortunate in respect of the matters of the 7 th house. 
It may be clearly seen that the lagna Is weak, 2 nd 
house and 7 th house are strong, the 8 th house Is 
afflicted and this is the main planetary configu- 
ration which should be judged in a birth chart for 
examination of akhanda saubhagya yoga. We have 
mentioned repeatedly earlier that Mars In the 7 th 
house may cause death to self or husband depend- 
ing upon various other factors, which we have 
applied In this work in a number of horoscopes. 
If the 7 th house is weak and afflicted but the 
ascendant is strong, 9 th and 2 nd house are either 
occupied by maleflcs or Influenced by malefic 
planets, loss of husband should be predicted. On 
the contrary, If the 7 th and 2 nd house are strong, 
9 th house Is also well-fortified but the ascendant 
and 8 th house are weak and afflicted, the wife will

predecease her husband but at an early age and 
her death may be due to some incurable disease 
like cancer, brain haemorrhage or cardiac arrest 
or otherwise she may be killed in an accident. 
The death of the woman may also occur while 
delivering a child or by suicide. In all such cases 
where early death of woman takes place, the 8 th 
house will be found afflicted. However, if the death 
takes place at the advance age as an akhanda 
saubhagyavati female, the 8^ will also be occupied 
or aspected by Jupiter. 

We have seen in a number of cases that 
widowhood took place in spite of the placement or 
aspect over the 8 th house. Jupiter could not prevent 
widowhood because the 7 th and 9 th house were weak. 
A strong 9 th house means that the woman is 
fortunate and if the 9 th lord has any relation with 
the 7 th house or 7 th lord, she is fortunate in respect 
of attaining akhanda saubhdgya. 



Chapter-7 

BIRTH IN JYESTHA NAKSATRA AND 
MARITAL DISASTER 



The foremost question after the birth of a child 
is whether the child is born in muld? The point 
of birth in mula is very much ignored by the 
research scholars of astrology though it is one of the 
important aspect of life. Mula sdnti is not sufficient 
for a boy who is born in mula naksatra but it is also 
essential to analyse the birth of mula naksatra, A 
child born in the earlier part of asvinu magha and 
mula naksatra, is called to be born in muld whereas 
child is born in the last part of aslesd, jyestha and 
revaH naksatra, is also called to be born in muld. The 
naksatras of mula-asvinu magha and muld are ruled 
by ketu whose beginning is more adverse, aslesa, 
jyestha and revati are ruled by Mercury whose last 
part is bad. It means that all mula naksatras are 
either ruled by ketu or by Mercury. It may also be 
said like that the person born in the last part of the 
constellation of Mercury or Ketu, will be said to be 
born in midas. The birth in rnulds is adverse and it 
is harmful for different aspects. 

If one is born in the adverse part of aslesa or 
magha naksatra, it is called rdtri gand\ if the child 
is born in the adverse part of jyestha and muld 
naksatra, it is called diva gaxvck if the child is born 
in the adverse part of the revati and asvini naksatra, 
it is called sandhya gand. If the birth of the child 



316 Foretelling Widowhood 

took place in the morning or in the evening and 
there sandhya gand is rising, it will be extremely 
adverse^ i.e., the birth in the last part of revati 
naksatra and early part of asvinl naksatra will be 
extremely bad. If the birth took place in the ratri 
gand, i.e., in aslesa or rnagha naksatra during night, 
that is quite adverse. Similarly the birth taken 
place in diva gand, i.e., in jyestha and mula 
naksatra, is also bad. It means that the birth in 
jyestha or mula naksatra is bad only when these 
naksatras are rising at day time and the birth took 
place at that time. Similarly if revati and asvini 
naksatra are rising and the birth has taken place 
in sandhya gand, it is harmful. The birth of sandhya 
gand is more dangerous for the child and the birth 
in ratri gand is more harmful for mother and the 
birth in diva gand is dangerous for father. 

Here, I humbly opine that the first 4 ghatis of 
asvtnu magha, mida are adverse rather than the 
total duration of the constellation. If the birth Is 
in the last quarter of jyestha constellation or it is 
in the first two quarter of mula, then it is called 
aviyukta mula. Birth in this naksatra is believed 
to be extremely adverse and the face of the child 
must not be seen by his father for 8 years. For 
minimizing the adversities, siva arcana must 
be done. 

For being precise as well as complete in my 
writing, I intend to write on jyestha naksatra rather 
than on all the six constellations of mu!d. In 
English, we call jyestha naksatra as antares and 
kalb in Parsi. It starts from 16°40'to 30°00' in 
Scorpio- In this naksatra, 3 groups stars form a 
specific design which is clearly visible. The nature 
of jyestha naksatra is satvagud.U three-faced, 
middle-eyed and sharp. 



Btrth in Jyestha. Naksatra and Marital Disaster 317 

According to sages, we can divide jyestha naksatra 
into 10 parts, according to its adversities caused to 
the native. 

I st part 0.00 - 1.20 Death of maternal grand- 
mother 

(226.40-228.00) or problems equivalent to 

death 

2 nd part 1.20 - 2.40 Death of maternal grand- 
father 

(228.00 - 229.20) or equivalent problems 

3 rd part 2.40 - 4.00 Death of maternal uncle or 

(229.20 - 230.40) problems

Moon - 233° 



318 Foretelling Widowhood 

Birth in these degrees affects the age of the 
native. Any work should not be started in these 
degrees even if planets are favourable. Native must 
also be very careful in these degrees. 

Here, I intend to write only about the birth in 
jye§thd naksatra. I have found that the birth in 
jyesthd naksatra is extremely adverse especially for 
the happiness of marriage and long lasting married 
life. This is bad for males and females, It has been 
observed by the study of inumerable horoscopes of 
the persons born in jyesthd naksatra that they did 
not have marriage or conjugal bliss. There was 
difference of opinion and at times it resulted into 
separation. In few cases, the females born in jyesthd 
naksatra lost their husband and suffered widow- 
hood. If the birth has taken place in jyesthd 
naksatra, 7 th house must be properly examined and 
care should be taken in settling down their mar- 
riage. If a girl is born in jyesthd naksatra, she must 
never be married with the boy who is jyesthd or 
eldest in the family and the marriage of the persons 
bom in jyesthd naksatra should not be performed 
in the month of jyesthd. 

Apart from these points, the horoscope of the 
partner must be examined carefully with regard to 
conjugal bliss, life of the partner and compatability 
of views etc. The background of the family should 
also be taken into consideration before the settlement 
of the marriage of the persons whose birth have 
taken place in jyesthd naksatra. 

Let me illustrate a few cases of the persons of 
male and female nativities who are born in jyesthd 
naksatra. Here I would like to point out that the 
birth In the last pada of jyesthd naksatra or during 
the last 4 ghatls of jyestha naksatra is not the only 



Birth in Jye^fhd Naksatra and Marital Disaster 319 

sphere where the birth will bring problems in 
marriage and marital life. But if the birth takes 
place in any part of the jyestha naksatra, it will 
bring adversity in marriage. 

Case -7.1 (Horoscope No. 47) 

She was born in the last part of jyestha naksatra 
and there was a balance of major period of Mercury 
for 3 years 3 months 23 days. She is a beautiful and 
loving girl having serious problems in her eyes. She 
is quite fair, tall and well educated. She had to 
compromise for her marriage due to her eye problem. 
Her eyes were operated four times but the vision 
remained poor. She was married on May 13 th , 2001 
during sub-period of Mercury in the major period of 
Venus with a very ordinary boy, black in complexion 
having low salary, working as a caretaker in a guest 
house. He was also having a poor family background 
and was extremely happy that he got such a nice 
and good looking wife. Soon after the marriage, 
differences started taking place and they were 
separated within 3 months on July 27 th , 2001 during 
the same dasa bhukti as it became beyond tolerance 
for the girl to live under that critical atmosphere 
full of vulgarity, criticism, scoldings and complaints. 
I had told the parents of this girl not to marry her at 
all because she was born in the last pada of jyestha 
naksatra and the lord of the 7 th house Saturn is placed 
in the 12 th house with 12 th lord Mercury and 4 th and 
11 th lord Venus. This is definitely a very adverse 
combination for lasting happiness of married life. 
The lagna is also hemmed in between Mars and 
Saturn giving rise to papakartari yoga. Any way, they 
were not in a position to follow my advice because 
marital adversity was destined to her.

Case - 7.2 (Horoscope No. 48) 

She was born in Libra ascendant when the 3 rd pada 
of jyestha. naksatra was rising. There was balance of 
Mercury maha dasa at the time of her birth for 4 
years 3 months 12 days. In this chart, much adversity 
is not indicated as such, as the lord of the lagna 
Venus is placed in the 10 th house and lord of the 2 nd 
and 7 th house Mars is placed in the 1 1 th house though 
it has shifted in the 12 th house in inimical sign. The 
lagna is aspected by Jupiter, yogakaraka Saturn is 
also in the 9 th house. The only adversity is that the 
7 th lord Mars is shifted in the 12 th house and is 
aspected by Jupiter from the 6 th house in bhava chart. 
She got married on February 2 nd , 1999 during sub- 
period of Saturn in the major period of Venus and 
lived with her husband till May 26 th , 2001 and 
separated thereafter during sub-period of Mercury 
in the major period of Venus. Her husband was not 
having any physical relations with her and used to 
criticize her all the time for her different activities. 
She did not tell any one that she is facing such 
problems but one day, she tried to commit suicide. 
Only thereafter, her parents came to know that she 
was living with her husband for 15 months without 
having physical touch. When it became unbearable 
for her, she tried to finish her life without informing 
anybody. This happened because she was born in 
the Jyestha naksatra, almost in the last pada. 

Case - 7*3 (Horoscope No, 2-vide p. 137) 

This is the horoscope of a very renowned and rich 
person. She is a multi-millionaire and got married 
with a very handsome, smart and decent boy on 
March 6 th , 1996. Her husband committed suicide on 
March 8 th , 1999, i.e., after 3 years of marriage. He 
had appeared in a competitive examination but could 
not succeed. The father of the boy scolded him

indecently. He could not bear the shock and took 
poison which resulted into end of his life on 
March 8 th , 1999. The native was born in Virgo 
ascendant and Jupiter is placed in own sign Pisces 
in the 7 th house. The astrologers had told her father 
that she will lead a very happy and prosperous life 
as Jupiter has given rise to Harhsa Mahdpurusa Raja 
yoga in the 7 th house. In my articles and in my book 
Predicting Marriage and Remediesjor Marital Maladies, 
I have repeatedly written that Jupiter's placement 
in the 7 th house in watery sign t i.e., in Cancer* Scorpio 
or Pisces is extremely adverse for conjugal bliss. Here 
the birth of the girl also took place in the jyestha 
naksatra* 3 rd padcu The girl is not mangll The lord of 
the lagfna Mercury is also well placed in the 5 th house. 
Jupiter aspects the lagna t the 5 th lord Saturn and 
the 1 1 th lord Moon. It is only papakartari yoga around 
the 7 th house which has been formed due to the 
placement of Sun in the 6 th house and Ketu in the 8 th 
house. That can not cause widowhood. In fact the 
birth in jyestha naksatra is responsible for the loss 
of life of her husband. The boy was the eldest son of 
his father. For the persons born in jyestha naksatra, 
the marriage with the eldest son of any family is 
harmful and must not be settled. 

Case - 7.4 (Horoscope No. 49) 

The native is a highly placed officer in the biggest 
organization of plastic trade in Asia. The native is 
handsome, smart, energetic and veiy dynamic person 
who rose to these heights due to his extraordinary 
merits only at the age of 36 years. He is drawing Rs. 
40 Lacs per annum. He is born in Taurus ascendant 
and yogakaraka Saturn is placed in the 10 th house 
in own sign giving rise to SasaMahapurusa Rqjayoga. 
This position of Saturn is responsible for professional 
elevation. Moon is placed in the 7 th house in jyestha

nak$atra 2 nd padcu Sun and Ketu are associated with 
Moon in the 7 th house, hemmed between beneflc 
planets like Venus and Mercuiy. Moon is the lord of 
the 3 rd house and joins the 7 th under the aspect of 
Mars and Saturn. This combination will curtail 
marital happiness. The native got married on 
November 8 th , 1987 during Venus-Rahu dasa bhukti 
with a beautiful girl who made his life hell. The 
placement of Moon in jyestha naksatra also plays its 
adverse role. It became impossible for the native to 
live with her. Ultimately the native divorced his wife 
and that too with great difficulty. He got married 
second time on August 23th, 1997 during Venus- 
Mercury dasa bhukti Here yogakaraka Saturn and 
7 th lord Mars are placed in friendly signs and both 
are aspecting the 7 th house which is owned by Mars. 
The aspect of Mars and Saturn have not harmed the 
native so much as much his birth in jyestha naksatra 

Case - 7.5 (Horoscope No. 50) 

She got married on October 26 th 2000 during Venus- 
Venus dasa bhukti. She was separated within 6 
months of marriage in the month of April, 200 L The 
7 th lord Mercury is placed in the 10 th house with 
Mars and Venus. Jupiter and Saturn both aspect 
the 10 th house, Mars, Mercury and Venus but the 
Moon is placed in the first pada of jyestha naksatra 
in the 12 th house. There appears no other reason for 
divorce except jyestha naksatra She belonged to a 
poor family and got married with the son of a Chief 
Engineer. He was quite handsome and smart* Soon 
after marriage, she created havoc in the family and 
started to torture her husband and parents-in-law. 
One fine morning on April 13 th , 2001, she went to 
her mother's place and did not come back. After three 
weeks, she lodged an FIR that she was being

put into serious trouble. Any way due to their

they could avoid jail. This all happened due to the 
birth of the girl in jye?fhd nak$atrcL Even the aspect 
of Jupiter over Moon could not curtail the adversity 
caused by Moon's placement in this most malefic 
constellation. 

Case - 7*6 (Horoscope No* 51) 

She was born in Sagittarius ascendant. The 7 th lord 
Mercury is placed in the 7 th house with 9 th lord Sun 
and 6 th and 1 1 th lord Venus. The combination of Sun, 
Venus and Mercury in the 7 th house is not as harmful 
as the placement of Moon in the 12th house in Scorpio 
in jyesthd naksatra 4 th padcL She is an exceptionally 
beautiful girl having charming physique but most 
unfortunate in respect of her conjugal life. The 
combination of Sun- Mercury is quite powerful in this 
horoscope in the 7 th house. The lord of the 7 th house 
placed in the 7 th should not create serious problems 
in marriage. She got married at 20 years of age during 
the year 1996 Venus-i?dhu dasd bhuktL For almost 
two years her husband did not touch her at all. He 
also used to misbehave with her. One day, she came 
to me and was crying like a child that her life and 
youth had been ruined. Her husband also came to 
me at the same time while she was sitting in front of 
me and started scolding and abusing her and also 
mishandled her. Due to this critical event, I could 
not help her at all. She faced this type of miserable 
life for two more years and thereafter she returned 
back to her parent's place and divorced her husband 
during Venus-Saturn dasd bhuktias he was impotent, 
rude and harsh.

7 th lord Sun is in the 12 th house and Moon is 
in the jyesthd naksatra in 10 th house alongwith the 
aspect of Rahu and Saturn. Mars and Venus have 
exchanged their navarhsa. This combination clearly 
indicates the tragedy in the married life which she 
had. All these combinations as well as, Moon in 
jyesthd naksatra played significant role in causing 
adversities.

left her husband on December 25 th , 2002 during 
Moon-i^dhu dasa bhukti and now she is living alone. 
Ascendant lord Moon gets debilitated in the 5 th 
house alongwith the aspect of malefic Mars and 
Saturn. Moon is on the axis of Rahu and Ketu. Mars 
and Saturn have mutual aspect with each other. 
5 th and 9 th house signify brother and sister of the 
husband. 5 th house is adversely afflicted and Mercury 
is debilitated in the 9 th house and Mars aspects 
it. Moon and Mercury are debilitated in 5 th and 9 th 
house respectively. This proved to cause cancer for 
her husband's elder brother as she was born in 
the jyestha naksatra in the 4 th quarter. This means 
that the female born in jyestha naksatra may prove 
to be adverse for her Jyestha brother-in-law. 

Case - 7,9 (Horoscope No. 25- vide p. 189) 

The native is born in Libra ascendant. 7 th lord Mars 
aspects 7 th house. Significator of husband Jupiter is 
in the 6 th house. Moon falls in Jyestha naksatra in 
4 th quarter in 2 nd house. After some time of her birth, 
her mother expired due to which her father married 
again. She didn't get the complete love and affection 
which was her due. She had to bear the pain of 
death of her brother as well. This was not all, her 
married life was also not very happy. She suffered 
the curse of widowhood on January 23 rd , 1969 when 
she was young. After bearing all these grieves, she 
herself expired on May 30th, 2001. The aspect of 7 th 
lord on the 7 th house could not save her spoiled 
married life. All this happened due to her birth in 
jyestha naksatra.

his talent, laborious nature, knowledge and

the 5 th house aspected by Rahu. Rahu aspects 7 th 
house and debilitated Moon is placed in the 7 th house. 
On his birth, Mercury's dasd of 2 years 4 months 
and 13 days was to be operated. 12 th house is aspected 
by Mars and Saturn which indicates extra marital 
relation. He had physical relations with a lady before 
marriage, they decided to marry after 4 years on 
Februaiy 1 1 th , 2003 during Moon-i?aftu dasd bhuktL 
This horoscope is clear" example of unbalanced 
marriage, due to his birth in jyestha nak^atra, I.e., 
the native was married but it was not accepted by 
the society. Due to his birth in jyestha naksatra, he 
had to face separation, enormous grief and this 
extremely talented man had lost all his comforts, 
glory and respect just because of a single lady* 

Case - 7.11 (Horoscope No. 55) 

This horoscope is of the youngest world heavyweight 
boxing world champion Mike Tyson, who has always 
been in controversy not only because of his boxing 
but for other things also. He was born in Libra 
ascendant. 7 th lord Mars is in the 8 th house in 
conjunction with Rahu and Venus, which spoiled 
his marital happiness. Saturn in the 6 th and Mars 
in the 8 th are under papakartari yoga. Mike had to 
first face divorce from his first wife, later on in 1992, 
he was jailed for raping a beautiful lady named Diseiy 
Washington. He was also in the papers for his brutal 
behaviour towards his opponent. He had bitten his 
ear. The birth in jyestha naksatra has aggravated 
the intensity of Mars.

but also in the field of love. The native is born in 
Aries ascendant with 7 th lord Venus in the 4 th house 
in inimical sign, 7 th house is also aspected by Sat- 
urn. Moon falls in jyesthd naksatrain 8 th house. Since 
Mars is in 2 nd house, the native is also mangoll He 
is the father of 3 children and enjoying all comforts of 
life. He has gained success in all walks of life except in 
love. He had an affair with a lady junior to him. He 
had spent lot of money on her with open hands. Lady 
left her husband for him but she could not become her 
wife. The native had spent more than a crore to at- 
tract her but he was not successful* The lady has left 
him and she is now living with another man. All this 
resulted into mental imbalance of the native. 

This is because of his birth in jyesthd naksatra, 
which resulted into the havoc in his married life 
and mental imbalance. 

Birth in jye&hd naksatra in the first quarter is 
adverse for elder brother, in second quarter for 
younger brother, in third quarter for die mother 
and in the fourth quarter for the native's father. 
The remedy for prevention of the adversity caused 
to the native due to the birth in jyesthd naksatra 
must be done by a learned, experienced and 
meritorious carya who is well-versed with such 
kinds of remedies, recitation of mantras and stotras 
etc. Following mantra of jyesthd naksatra should 
be recited 28000 times, at the rate of one thousand 
times every day from the day of birth of child to 
the day of muld sdntipuja (because midd sdntipujana 
is done on 28 th day after the birth of a child). Before 
commencing the muld sdntipujana, dasdrhsa, havana, 
tarpana, mdrjana etc. should be done by the same 
mantra of jyesthd naksatra. If sdnti pujana work will 
bp undertaken with proper procedure, faith and 
confidence, all adversities will be minimized to an 
appreciable extent. The mantras are as under:-

The root of circita tree should be purified by the 
concerning mantra in a proper way and should be 
worned around the right arm by males and left arm 
by females. 

If jyestha naksatra falls on Thursday or Friday 
and any kind of sickness starts on that day, the 
native will recover only after 10 days. If jyestha 
naksatra falls on any other day, the native will 
recover only after 15 days. 

The native born in jyestha naksatra must not do 
any transactions with the native born in piuvasatfhd, 
srdvana, satabhisa, drdrd, punarvasu and uttara 
phalgunl 

With these remedies mentioned above, one can 
nullify the adversity of jyetfha naksatra. 

Jyestha Naksatra and Marriage of Jyestha Boy 
with Jyestha Girl in Jyestha Masa 

Jyestha naksatra is 18 th as reckoned from asvird. 
jyestha means eldest. Jyestha is the third Hindi 
month as counted from caitra. So, there is a 
possibility of four jyesthas coming together. Eldest 
son, eldest daughter, birth in jye$fhd naksatra and 
marriage in Jyestha masa. If three jye$thas are 
combined in any marriage, the tragedy and 
mishappenings in their married life are bound to 
come. Mishappening covers a vast meaning, e.g., 
unhappy conjugal life, mental or physical separation, 



Birth in Jyesfhd Naksatra and Marital Disaster 339 

divorce, loss of either spouse etc. Here, I have 
discussed various cases of the natives who were born 
in jyestha naksatra and all of them suffered in one 
or the other way. Here I will discuss the case of my 
most affectionate, loving, exceptionally charming and 
most attractive daughterly girl. 

She is extremely close and very dear to me. She 
learnt astrology under my guidance with full 
dedication, faith, concentration and confidence and 
thus, I am very much concerned with her conjugal 
happiness which is eclipsed heavily due to negative 
role of three Jyesthas. Since she is my most loving 
and innocent child, I will explain both the phases 
of her life. 

Sometime ago, there lived a noble king of Awadh. 
He was an extremely pious monarch, renowned for 
his supreme judgement, esteemed, and adored by 
his people. He lived in a magnificent palace 
resplendent with luxurious grandeur. 

After some time, the king was blessed with a 
pretty female child. Even in her infancy, the young 
cherub was amiable, charming and incredibly 
enchanting in beauty. She was deeply adored and 
cared for her delicacy, with immense affection. She 
had numerous exquisite dolls to play with and a 
separate room for her toys and garments. Even at 
school, she soon became the most popular child. 
She always secured first position and later acquired 
high academic qualifications. 

Now we are discussing about gorgeous beauty and 
youth of the princess, which created historical 
sensation everywhere. That is a long story, though 
here that is out of context 

This is the study of the birth chart of this 
captivating baby who was adored by all. With her 
childlike appearance and innocence, she easily 



340 Foretelling Widowhood 

procured the admiration of all who came in her 
contact. With the passage of time, she blossomed 
into an ethereal nymph like beauty with a blooming, 
graceful and elegant figure. Her grace, charm and 
dignified appearance remained unexcelled. 

The passing years greatly enhanced the delicacy 
of her features. Her well-built supple figure was 
with oval face looked flushed and radiant like the 
freshness of the morning dew surrounded by the 
golden brown hair like crown. Her radiant smile 
revealed pearl like well set teeth and her laughter 
was like the twinkle of bells. Her large, lustrous 
and dazzling eyes were capable of attracting anyone's 
heart. Her courteous demeanor, soberness and 
etiquette had enhanced the graceness and grandeur 
of her appearance. Her perfectly poised and enam- 
eled figure, like an orchid under glasses, was 
exquisite without any blemish. Her rising beauty 
aroused a range of emotions and left a wealth of 
desires within a man's heart. 

The sharpness and extreme intelligence of the 
princess was shining and radiating over her innocent 
face and impressive personality. However, she 
never lacked with self-respect and self-confidence, 
which always made her most important and 
adorable. 

This exceptionally beautiful, charming and most 
captivating princess who was innocent, pious and 
absolutely free from the feelings or liking for 
anyone, got married with a good looking, smart, 
energetic and dynamic boy whose father was the 
friend of king of Awadh. The birth of her husband 
took place in jyestha naksatrct The princess and 
her life partner both were eldest in their families. 
The marriage was settled and engaged in jyestha 



Birth in Jye$tha Naksatra and Marital Disaster 341 

rnasa (month). Now four jyesthas were together in 
the marriage of the princess. Kalvdasa writes in 
Purva Kaldrnrtcc- 

i.e., the eldest child's marriage whether a boy 
or girl is prohibited in jyestha mascu Tryyestha 
means that three jyesthas should never be united, 
i.e., eldest son and eldest daughter which are 
termed as jyestha putra and jyestha putfi must not 
be married in Jyestha rnasa. If the boy or girl is 
born in jyestha naksatra, marriage must not be 
ceremonised in Jyestha masa, to avoid any kind of 
disaster and damage to their married life. 

There was a matching point of 24.50 points out 
of 36, there was no nadl dosa and graha rnaitrl of 
a high order was also present as the birth sign 
of the boy was Scorpio and that of Princess was 
Leo. Trfe gana dosa was present as the gana of the 
boy was raksasa and the princess was born in 
manu$ya gana. 

The princess had lot of sweet dreams and high 
expectations from her husband. Soon after marriage, 
the princess and her parents realised that they 
were terribly mistaken by granting this match. It 
was too late then. The princess got every thing there, 
except harmony, true feeling of belonging and love 
acceptance of her ambitions, desires and dreams. 
After sometime of her marriage, she was immensely 
criticised. However, she remained quite. Moreover, 
there was no one with who she could feel comfortable 
in sharing her feelings. The princess was introvert 



342 Foretelling Widowhood 

in nature. Therefore, she never complained to 
anyone. 

Meantime, one of her uncle who loved the princess 
as his own, could realise that she is unhappy. He 
took her in confidence and asked about her problems. 
She started crying like a small child and told him 
whatever she was facing. She felt protected, 
supported and secured under the shelter of her 
uncle. The husband of the princess also regarded 
that uncle like his father. The problems and 
tensions of their married life started reducing after 
the advice of the uncle. Later the princess started 
getting Inclined towards her uncle. So much so, 
that at times she even started ignoring few desires 
of her husband. Gradually her husband started 
misunderstanding the uncle and her relation with 
him became a strong point of conflict, confrontation 
and confusion between them. Their relationship got 
bitter. The uncle realised that the marital maladies 
of the princess has increased due to his intervention. 

On 6 th April 2002, when jyestha ndksatra was 
rising, the princess left her husband's house forever 
without even consulting the uncle. Thus, the role 
of jye$tha ndksatra once more created panic In their 
lives. She was seeking divorce. The negative role 
of birth in Jyestha ndksatra of her husband created 
unaccomodable miseries, problems, griefs, tension, 
frustrations and depression in their married life. 
It was a critical juncture when the husband of 
princess realised and learnt about her exaggerated 
and explosive attitude. Afterwards he began to 
improve his indecent behaviour. He sacrificed and 
tried to adjust with his wife. Initially the princess 
was not ready to adjust with him anymore. However, 
his continued decency and softness gradually made 



Birth in Jyestha Naksatra and Marital Disaster 343 

a place in her mind and a feeling of respect and 
attachment also crept In her heart for her husband- 
She Immediately took the decision to leave the 
palace, and patch up with her husband. 

We can see that she and her husband suffered 
a lot owing to birth in Jyestha naksatra both being 
jyestha in their families and settlement and engage- 
ment in jyestha masa. We advise all against such 
marriages and follow the suggestions of Kalidasa 
as mentioned earlier about jyestha naksatra. May 
God now bless the Princess conjugal bliss of a high 
degree and full of love. 

Many more illustrations may be given here to 
show the adversity caused by jyestha naksatra in 
respect of marital happiness but it will go beyond 
the scope of this book. In one case, 1 found that 
the native was an Engineer and within one year 
of marriage after the delivery of a child, his wife 
ran away with her boyfriend. All the persons of the 
family went to jail and had to stay there for many 
months and the Engineer Is still living without wife. 
In fact the husband was charged that wife com- 
mitted suicide due to his misconduct. He was born 
in jyestha naksatra 

Thus it has been observed by me that the birth 
In jyestha naksatra makes the married life quite 
critical, miserable and problem. At Many times it 
creates havoc, sometime one may suffer loss of his 
or her life partner and at times p he or she may 
be got married with a frigid girl or impotent person/ 
At times, the birth in jyestha naksatra causes 
separation due to misunderstandings or due to 
extra marital relationship. Thus the birth in jyestha 
naksatra is very adverse especially for the purpose 
of conjugal bliss. If any girl is born In jyestha 



344 Foretelling Widowhood 

naksatra, she should not be married with the boy 
born in jyestha naksatrcu 

Due to limited space, I am not giving the examples 
of those couples where both the partners were born 
in jyestha naksatra and the tragedy or death of one 
of them took place soon after marriage. This is a 
point of observation for the scholars of astrology 
and they may kindly give their humble opinion 
about it. Lot of work is required for the births which 
take place in mida naksatras. Scholars of astrology 
should come forward for finding out the views of 
those who are born in these asterism of mulas as 
it is most important for all of us. 



Chapters 
DETERMINANTS FOR DEATH OF WIFE 



Early loss of husband is the biggest curse for 
any woman, therefore, sages have enumerated 
number of planetary combinations for 
widowhood in their classical works but they have 
not given as much space for the combinations leading 
to the loss of wife. Second marriage in case of early 
death of wife is fairly common which Is not a common 
practice in case of a widow. It is seen that remarriage 
in males is not uncommon even after attaining the 
age of 50 or more. However, women are unfortunate 
in this respect because marriage of a widow is still 
not commonly acceptable. Here in this chapter, we 
will look into the combinations responsible for early 
death of wife among male natives. 

If maleflcs and evil lords, i.e., lords of evil houses 
influence 7 th house, 7 th lord and Venus by conjunc- 
tion or aspect, wife dies earlier than the husband. 
The strength of affliction decides early or late loss 
of wife. If 7 th house and its lord are afflicted by 
many maleflcs and by close degree of affliction, loss 
of wife is likely to come early. Death of wife may 
be, in a later age when such afflictions are checked 
by beneflc conjunction or aspect or when the degree 
of affliction is milder. 

Mars is the worst killer. When Mars joins lagna, 
2 nd , 4 th , 7 th , 8 th or 12 th , he is capable of killing the 
wife, particularly when he is in enemy's sign. When 
such a Mars is afflicted or 7 th house is afflicted 



348 Foretelling Widowhood 

and no benefic joins or aspects such a Mars, death 
of wife is certain, soon after marriage* When such 
a Mars is close to the bhava-madhya of any of the 
above-mentioned bhava, the death of the wife will 
be witnessed very early. When Mars is situated in 
any of the above houses from lagna, Moon, Sun or 
Venus, but he is yogakaraka or lord of trikona from 
the central point, he alone may not be the killer 
of wife. When Mars is svagrahi in friendly house 
in rnula trikona or in exaltation or is with, benefic 
association, then too he alone may not be the cause 
of death of the wife. 

When Mars is conjoined with Jupiter or with 
waning Moon, his evil qualities are checked unless 
influenced by any other malefic/When Mars is in 
7 th house, 7 th lord is in the 5 th house and Mars is 
in the navamsa of Venus, the wife of the native 
dies. When Mars conjoins with Venus in the 5 th , 
7 th , 9 th house, he causes the death of the wife of 
the native, if not aspected or conjoined by any other 
benefic provided 7 th house and its lord are weak, 
afflicted, debilitated and 7 th lord obtains malefic 
navamsa or ndvamsa of the 8 th or 2 nd lord. 

Before proceeding further, we quote hereunder 
few classical verdicts in regard to the death of wife 
for the benefit of readers. These aphorisms should 
not be applied verbatim but the horoscopes should 
be examined in the light of the combinations 
mentioned in these slokas. Conclusions should be 
drawn only after intelligent analysis of each and 
every aspect, signs, house, planets and their 
navamsa etc. Few of these aphorisms are as below:-

or with benefics, then the adversities are nullified 
but provides the native association with number 
of females.

by malefics, then it kills the wife of the native or 
it makes the wife of the native rude as a devil* 

Sorvailhacintcanani

In this horoscope, 7 th lord Mars occupies the 6 th house 
in association with 6 th lord Venus and 2 nd and 5 th 
lord Mercury and this combination is aspected by 
Saturn* The 7 th lord Mars is under the adverse 
influence and is heavily afflicted and indicates death 
of wife at an early age. The Sun occupies the 5 th 
house over the axis of Rahu and Ketu, hence 
papakartari yoga is formed because the Sun is 
hemmed between Mars and Saturn. Mercury is 
combust and is conjoined with inimical 7 th lord Mars 
and is aspected by Saturn. Therefore, the married 
life of the native was full of maladies. It may be 
noted that even the aspect of an exalted Jupiter over 
the 7 th and 9 th house could not prevent the disaster 
of loss of wife. 

\n Jyottsdn^ava Navinatama the author mentions 
in the sloka No. 204 of chapter 2 as under:- 

That the subject will lose his spouse early if the 
7 th lord, bereft of strength, is in the 6 th , 8 th or 12 th 
house while Venus is in debility. 

In the case discussed above, the 7 th lord is the 
6 th alongwlth afflicted Venus, which resulted into 
the death of his wife.

cated and loyal wife. This was the time of great 
struggle for the native when he was living with his 
wife and children in a small room. One day, the 
wife was cooking when she was caught by fire badly 
and as a result of which she died on April 17 th , 
1982 during the sub and major period of Jupiter. 
The native who claimed to love his wife veiy much, 
remarried in less than 3 months period on July 
13 th , 1982 during Jupiter-Saturn dasa bhuktL What 
kind of love it was that he remarried within a period 
of three months after the death of wife! He should 
have waited for at least a year. This is an irony 
of women that they are not supposed to remany 
after the death of their husband or even if they 
are remarried, they have to face lot of criticism and 
have to undergo immense struggle. I have rarely 
seen that any woman remarried within less than 
a year after the death of her husband and the 
remarriage in female is rare whereas among men, 
it is common. How do they forget their loving wife 
and adorable wife within a few days and start 
dreaming about their second marriage I 

However, the negative role of Jupiter in respect 
of early loss of wife can also be seen in this 
horoscope. The wife of the native died during the 
major and sub-period of Jupiter. 8 th and 11 th lord 
Jupiter occupies the ascendant. The 2 nd house, 
which denotes the death of spouse, is occupied by 
malefic Sun and Mars and is aspected by Saturn. 
There is mutual aspect between Mars and Saturn. 
Saturn aspects both 7 th house and 7 th lord. Thus 
the 7 th house is under the Influence of Mars, Saturn 
and Jupiter. In this horoscope. Jupiter, Mercury, 
Venus and Mars obtain the navdrhsa of dual sign, 
i.e., that of Mercuiy and Jupiter, which indicates 
two marriages. The lagna lord Venus falls in a fiery 



Determinants for Death of Wife 355 

sign Aries and obtains fiery navamsa Sagittarius. 
7 th lord Mars and lagna lord Venus both obtain 
navamsa of Jupiter and in navamsa chart, both 
aspect Jupiter as well. Mars is killer of wife who 
is 7 th lord and aspects 8 th house and obtains 
Jupiter's navamsa. Therefore the wife of the native 
died during sub and major period of Jupiter. The 
second marriage of the native took place on 
July 13 th , 1982 during the sub-period of Saturn in 
the major period of Jupiter with the younger sister 
of the first wife of the native. Saturn is yogakaraka 
planet and is aspected by Jupiter and Mars, Saturn 
is the 9 th lord which indicates the sister of wife 
and second marriage as well. In bhava chart, 
Saturn is shifted in the 6 th , Venus in the ascendant 
and Moon in the 10 th . Thus Moon and Saturn who 
are aspected by Jupiter are devoid of the same in 
bhava chart. The native is a high level contractor 
of civil works. All the concerning planets Jupiter, 
Mercury, Saturn, Mars and Venus obtain navamsa 
of dual sign which resulted into more than one 
marriage and early death of first wife.

personality. He got married in January 1936 but 
the wife of the native expired during 1939 due to 
liver cirrhosis. The native was blessed with two 
sons from his first wife, who also died during 
infancy due to liver ailment. The negative role of 
Jupiter may again be seen as Jupiter occupies its 
own sign Sagittarius in 7 th house under retrograde 
motion. The lagna lord Mercuiy and 7 th lord Jupiter 
fall in own and dual sign. This is a clear indication 
of two marriages. Venus is also hemmed between 
first-rate maleflcs Saturn and Rahm which also 
indicates the possibility of two marriages. 

um ^e^r "a^r torafai ^tsra 

it has also been mentioned that if Venus is 
hemmed between maleflcs, i.e., pdpakartri yoga is 
around Venus, there is a possibility of two mar- 
riages. Thus, in this horoscope, two marriages are 
indicated. 

The first marriage took place in January 1936 
during Mercury-Saturn dasa bhuktL Saturn is the 
9 th lord and aspects the 2 nd , 6 th and 9 th house. 
Mercury is the lord of lagna and 4 th house and has 
given rise to Bhadrika Mahapurusa RcgayogcL The 
first wife died after 3 years in December 1939 
during Ketu Moon dasa bhuktL Moon is the lord 
of 2 nd house and joins the 6 th house in the sign 
of debility under the aspect of 8 th lord and 9 th lord 
Saturn and 11 th and 6 th lord Mars. Thus Moon is 
heavily afflicted and caused death of first wife. It 
is not out of place to mention that death of wife 
is indicated by 2 nd house as it Is 8 th from 7 th . The 
2 nd and its lord are heavily afflicted due to joint 
aspect of Mars and Saturn. The death of wife, 
therefore, occurred during the bhukti of 2 nd lord 
Moon in the major dasa of Ketu. The 2 nd marriage 



358 Foretelling Widowhood 

took place in December 1941 during sub-period of 
Rahu in the major period of Ketu. Rahu is the 
dispositor of Jupiter who occupies the 7 th house, 
therefore, second marriage took place during sub- 
period of Rahu in the major period of Ketu with 
10 year younger female. The native suddenly lost 
his life on October 22 nd , 1969 in a sudden illness 
and his wife died on October 19 th , 1986.

The marriage took place on February 7**\ 1979 
during Jupiter Rahu period. Jupiter occupies 
the 10 th house and Saturn falls in 2 nd in the sign 
of exaltation under retrograde motion. 7 th lord 
Jupiter falls over the axis of Rahu and Ketu and 
is aspected by 8 th lord Mars. Jupiter also suffers 
kendrddhipati dosa and is badhakadhipati as well.

death of wife. Here the 2 nd house is occupied 
by 5 th and 6 th lord retrograde Saturn, 7 th lord Jupiter 
is aspected by Mars and falls over the axis 
of nodes which indicates premature death of wife. 
Since Saturn occupies the 2 nd house and is aspected

in the 2 nd house from Mercury. Therefore.

The native is a renowned scholar of mantra sastra. 
He is an author of around more than two dozen books 
on mantra, tantra and yantra sdstra* He has written 
more than 300 articles and has edited various 
journals. He is a saitoxka and simple Brahmin and 
has completely dedicated his life for the noble 
mission of promotion and propagation of peace and 
happiness in the live of fellow human beings. 

He was born when Cancer ascendant was rising. 
The wife of the native died during the sub-period 
of Mars in the major period of Rahu in July 1958. 
Rahu occupies the 7 th house in association with 
Saturn and Venus. Jupiter aspects the 7 th house 
and occupants of the 7 th . Here two marriages are 
indicated because Venus is hemmed between Rahu 
and Saturn. Mars is placed in the 8 th house from 
lagna lord Moon, Rahu falls in dhanistha naksatra 
which is ruled by Mars. 

In navamsa chart, Rahu and Mars are associated 
in Virgo, in bhava chart, Rahu is shifted in the 
8 th house and Ketu in 2 nd . Affliction of the 2 nd and 
7 th house and placement of Ketu in 2 nd indicates

off all her ornaments and valuables on her bed 
between 1.00 - 2.00 am and went out of her home 
leaving behind her husband and daughter. She 
jumped in a big canal and committed suicide. 
Native and all other members including his parents 
who were nearly 70 years old, were sent to jail. 
The native had to live behind the bars for many 
months. The wife died during the sub-period of Sun 
in the major period of Mercury. Mercury is combust 
and the Sun is the lord of 7 th house and falls in 
drdrd naksatra of RahiL The 7 th lord Sun is eclipsed 
due to association with Rahu. The Sun is associated 
with Rohm Mercuiy and Venus, therefore, the Sun 
is heavily afflicted. Moreover, the 2 nd house and its 
lord Jupiter are also heavily afflicted due to joint 
aspect of Saturn and Mars. This indicates death 
of wife since 2 nd house is 8 th from 7 th and rules 
death of spouse. Jupiter falls In revati naksatra 
which is ruled by Mercury and Mercury and Venus 
fall in naksatra of Mars whereas Mercuiy obtains 
navarhsa of Mars and the Sun obtains navarhsa of 
Jupiter, i.e., 2 nd lord. Therefore, the wife committed 
suicide when the native was passing through the 
sub-period of Sun in the major period of Mercury, 
the 7 th and 8 th lords, respectively. 

Here, I would like to draw the attention of readers 
towards the placement of Mars in the 7 th house of 
leo. It has been quoted at various places that the 
placement of Mars in Leo or Aquarius anywhere 
does not cause kuja dosa as given below. We humbly 
opine that this view about fcu/a dosa does not hold 
good. In the present case. Mars occupies the 7 th 
house identical to Leo sign but he faced lot of 
marital maladies, troubles, frustrations and even 
imprisonment. The native was compelled to give five 
lakh rupees to the parents of the wife for compro-

mise and withdrawal of the case. Even after 10 
years of this unforgettable tragedy, the native has 
not remarried as yet. He has decided never to 
marry. The native lost his service after prosecution 
and could not get any suitable job so far. All his 
education, intelligence, merits and influential per- 
sonality have been heavily eclipsed.

Marriage - June 11th, 1973 during Venus -

Death of wife - June 7th, 1995 during - Mars 
Mercury dasa bhuktl 

The native is a politician. He is very smart and 
handsome and used to be called a lady killer. Apart 
from his passion to make love with absolutely new 
females and switching over from one to another, 
he is rolling in money. He had a love marriage on 
June 11 th , 1973 during Venus- Mercury dasa bhuktl 
His wife used to be highly depressed and upset due 
to harsh behaviour and passionate activities of her 
husband. She jumped from the high roof and 
committed suicide on June 7 th , 1995. The native 
was charged for her murder and had to undergo 
imprisonment which was critically painful like 
death, according to his own statement. The wife 
committed suicide during Mars-Mercury dasa bhuktl 
Mars Is 8 th lord and joins the 7 th house, it means 
that he will suffer death like pain and trouble due 
to any woman. Mercury, the lord of 3 rd and 6 th house 
falls over the axis of nodes. Mercury obtains 
navarhsa of its debilitation. The 2 nd house which 
indicates death of spouse as It is 8 th from 7 th house, 
is aspected by Mars and Saturn, both of them 
indicate death of wife before the native. 7 th and 2 nd 
lord Venus is heavily afflicted due to conjunction

indication of death of first wife. However, the 2 nd

Saturn and Ketu. Affliction of Venus and its place- 
ment between malefics is clear indication of two 
marriages. Saturn and Venus both fall in jyestha

Marriage - December 4 m , 1973 during Saturn - 
Mars dasa bhuktL 

Death of wife - May 17 th , 2002 during Ketu- 
Saturn dasa bhuktt 

The native is an executive engineer who was 
married on December 4 th , 1973 during Saturn-Mars 
dasa bhukti Both the planets are conjoined in the 
9 th house. Saturn is the 4 th lord and Mars is the 
lord of the ascendant. Jupiter is lord of 2 nd house 
and is placed over the axis or nodes In the 
ascendant. 7 th lord Venus joins the 12 th house with 
Mercury and inimical Moon under the aspect of 
Mars. The 7 th lord Venus is hemmed between 
malefic planets and is aspected by Mars. Thus, the 
7 th lord is heavily afflicted and the lord of the 2 nd 
house has also been placed under affliction. There- 
fore, the combination of death of wife prior to her 
husband is present in this horoscope. Whenever, 
the 2 nd and 7 th house or their lords are afflicted, 
unless lagna is strong, the death of wife takes place 
before the native. The wife died on May 17 th , 2002 
when the native was passing through the sub- 
period of Saturn and the major period of KetiL Ketu 
falls in the ascendant and Saturn falls in the 9 th 
house in aslesa naksatra. Saturn is the 4 th lord and 
Joins the 9 th house with debilitated Mars and under 
the aspect of beneflc Jupiter. The combination 
occurred in the house of fortune, therefore, the wife 
of the native is fortunate enough to obtain akhanda 
saubhagya yoga after leading a long married life 
with the native. In fact, she suffered from cancer

of ovaries for 4 years. It was a troublesome and 
painful death of the wife of the native though she 
was blessed with mangalya. I had foreseen the 
death of this lady 8 or 9 years before the actual 
happening while preparing the life reading of the 
native and his wife. I had written that she will be 
suffering from any dreaded and incurable disease 
after August 1998 or so and she would be suffering 
till the middle of 2002 when she would depart for 
the final abode. However, cancer was diagnosed In 
October 1998 and in spite of the best endeavours 
and treatment, she could not be cured. Thus, the 
affliction of the 2 nd and 7 th lord resulted into the 
death of the wife of the native earlier to him. 

Case No. 8.14 - (Horoscope No. 70)

Death of wife - 1950 during Ketu Mars dasa

The native was born in Leo ascendant with 
yogakaraka Mars. The 7 th lord Saturn occupies the 
6 th house in own sign Capricorn over the axis of 
Rahu and Ket\L The lord of the 2 nd house Mercury 
is conjoined with inimical Jupiter, friendly Venus

in the 12 th house over the axis of Rahu and Ketu. 
Rahu obtains navamsa of Mars and Mars aspects 
the 7 th house. 8 th house is aspected by Mars and 
Saturn both, therefore, the death of wife took place 
during the year 1950 when the native was passing 
through the sub-period of Mars in Ketu, It may be 
noted that the planets, which afflict, conjoin or 
aspect the 7 th house adversely, may cause death 
of wife of the native during their dasa bhuktL Here

Determinants for Death of Wife 381 

Saturn is the 7 th lord which is afflicted by Rdhu 
and as Rahu obtains navamsa of Mars, death took 
place during the sub-period of Mars. Early death 
of wife can also be evaluated in this horoscope 
because the 7 th house is afflicted from lagna and 
from Moon as well. 

Combinations For The Death Of Wife 

We have following observations to make regarding to 
the death of wife earlier than the native. Those Eire 
fortunate women, who die when their husbands are 
alive, i.e., they attain mangalya or akhanda 
saubhdgya. The wife is fortunate if she attains 
mangalya. At the time of judgement of the horoscope 
of females, importance must be emphasized on the 
9 th house as well. If the 9 th house is afflicted, weak 
or placed under papakartari yoga or is occupied by 
the lord of the trikas or the lord of trikas join the 9 th 
house under affliction, the female may not attain 
akhan4a saubhagya in spite of well disposed 2 nd , 7 th 
and 8 th house* In case the 9 th house Is well fortified 
and Is occupied by benefics, lord of Kendras or 
Trikona, she will be fortunate to die before her 
husband provided the 2 nd house or its lord Is strong 
or occupied by benefics. In addition to the strong 
and well disposed 7^ house. If 8 th house is occupied 
by benefics like Jupiter, one may be blessed with 
mafigalya yoga provided the 9 th house is also well 
disposed. In the exhaustive study of mangalya and 
vaidhavya we have observed that in few case, when 
Jupiter was placed in the 8 th house in own sign or in 
the 7 th house In own sign, they suffered loss of their 
husband when 9 th house was weak, afflicted or ill 
disposed. In other cases under the similar placement 
of Jupiter, but with strong 9 th house, the women 
enjoyed mangalya yoga In the horoscope of the wife 



382 Foretelling Widowhood 

of the native of the horoscope No. 13. the wife was 
having Jupiter and Sagittarius in the 8 th house and 
was blessed with akhanda saubhagya because her 
9 th house was also strong. These considerations are 
very essential while examining the horoscope whether 
the husband will die before wife or his wife will die 
before her husband. In the horoscope of the native, 
if following combinations are present, the wife will 
die prior to her husband. The husband may or may 
not remarry, this is the other aspect of the astrology 
which we have not touched here. 

1. If the 2 nd house is afflicted, joined by malefics 
or the lord of 8 th . 6 th or 12* house are under 
the aspect of first-rate malefic planets, the wife 
will die prior to her husband provided 7 th house 
is also weak and ill-disposed* 

2. If the lord of the 2 nd house occupies the 8 th 
house with malefics, or with the lord of the 
Trikas or the 7 th lord is under the aspect of 
malefics, the wife will die before her husband. 

3. If malefics like Mars, Saturn, Rahu or Sun 
occupy the 7 th house, and the 2 nd house is also 
weak or ill-disposed, the wife will meet with 
end of her life earlier than her husband. 

4. If the 8 th house and ascendant are strong, well- 
disposed and occupied by benefics, the hus- 
band will live longer than his wife. 

5. The combination of Mars and Mercury in the 
7 th house is also adverse for the long life of the 
wife. If Mercury is the lord of the 8 th house and 
joins the 7 th house under malefic aspect or with 
the placement of the lord of the 7 th , 12 th or 8 th 
house the wife of the native will die early. 

6. If the 7 th lord is either Mars or Saturn and is 
under the mutual aspect with Saturn and Mars 
or Mars and Saturn are conjoined together, the 



Determinants for Death of Wife 383 

wife may die before the native, it will be most 
certain if the 7 th lord will fall in jyestha naksatra 
and Mars will also fall in any naksatra of mulas. 

7. Even retrograde Jupiter in own sign, Sagittarius 
or Pisces may kill the wife of the native, if such 
a Jupiter is aspected by Mercury of own sign 
from ascendant but it will happen so only if 
the second house is under heavy affliction of 
Mars, Saturn or Rahu and 2 nd lord is ill- 
disposed. The wife may die provided the 
ascendant is strong. 

8. The aspect of strong Mars on the 7 th house and 
Moon jointly may kill the wife at an early age 
provided the 7 th lord is combust, afflicted or 
placed under papakartari yoga. 

9. If Venus or 7 th lord is placed under papa kartari 
yoga, i.e., Mars, Saturn, Rahu or Ketu are 
placed around the 7 th lord or Venus, the death 
of the first wife will take place before the native 
even if benefics like Jupiter occupy the 2 nd house. 

10. if Rahu is placed in the 7 th house and Is 
aspected by maleflcs, then it kills the wife of 
the native provided the 2 nd house is occupied 
by Saturn or Mars. 

11. Combination of Venus, Saturn and Sun in the 
7 th house is quite adverse for long life of the 
wife. Similarly the combination of Rahu, Venus 
and Saturn is adverse for wife. She dies earlier. 

12. If Mars is the lord of 12 th or 8 th house and joins 
the 7 th house, and the 7 th lord Is conjoined with 
Venus or Saturn, the wife will die before her 
husband even if the 2 nd house is occupied by 
first rate beneflc Jupiter. Probability of death 
of wife, gains further strength soon after 
marriage, if in any of the above point, 7 th lord 
or Moon fall in jyestha naksatra. 



384 Foretelling Widowhood 

13, if the native Is born in Aries, and Mars joins 
the 7 th house, under the aspect of Saturn, the 
husband may kill his wife or may become cause 
of death of his wife provided the 2 nd and 7 th 
lord Venus fall in the sign of any of the 
luminary especially in Leo and is hemmed in 
between the luminaries, the Sun and the Moon. 

14, If Mars is placed 8 th from lagna lord Moon and 
the 7 th house from lagna is also under the 
influence of Mars or Saturn, the death of wife 
takes place in front of her husband. 

15- For Libra ascendant, Mars is lord of 2 nd and 
7 th houses and If it is placed In the 7 th house 
in Aries under the mutual aspect of Saturn, 
one becomes killer of wife and if Mars is placed 
under papokartari yoga with Mercury, the wife 
expires prior to her husband. 

16. In any of the above case, if the 2 nd house is 
occupied by maleflcs like Mars, Saturn, Rahu 
and Ketu and lord of the 2 nd house occupies 
any of the trikas, the death of wife will take 
place soon after marriage but if the 2 nd house 
is not much afflicted, the death of wife may 
take place in advance age. The judgement of 
the age should be made on the basis of the 
intensity of the affliction of .the 7 th and 2 nd 
house or their lords. 

17. If the lord of the 5 th house is located in the 
7 th and lord of the 7 th house is with malefic, 
and Venus is weak, the wife of the native dies 
as a result of pregnancy. 

18. If maleflcs occupy the 7 th and 8 th house and 
Mars is located in the 12 th house and if the 
7 th house is not aspected by its own lord, the 
native looses his first wife and has to marry 
second time. 



Determinants for Death of Wife 385 

19. The strongest planet responsible for death of 
first wife should be examined properly. The dasa 
bhukti of the navamsa lord occupied by that 
planet may kill the wife during its dasa bhukti 
The death of wife may take place during the 
dasa bhukti of 2 nd lord, planet placed in the 2 nd 
house or navamsa lord of the occupant of the 
2 nd house. The death of wife may also take place 
during the dasa bhukti of the lord of the 7 th house 
or occupant of the 7 th house or the navamsa lord 
of the occupant of the 7 th house. 



Chapter-9 

REMEDIES FOR MARITAL MALADIES 
AND WIDOWHOOD 



It is not sufficient to be able to know that a woman 
is likely to suffer widowhood at an early age due 
to unnatural and violent death of her husband. 
It is equally important to know the measures and 
remedies to prevent widowhood. Mainly there are 
following curative measures :- 

1. Matching of horoscopes of boy and girl before 
settlement of marriage. 

2. Selection of appropriate and most suitable 
muhurta for marriage. 

3. Recitation of appropriate mantra and stotra to 
prevent widowhood. 

4. Observation of vrata with full faith and 
dedication. 

5. Donation of suitable articles and money to the 
desirable persons. 

All these remedial measures have their own 
importance and benefits. The parents, who want 
their children to lead happy and ever lasting 
married life, should consult any knowledgeable,, 
meritorious, experienced and honest astrologer who 
is rarely available, who is well-conversed with the 
significance, importance of muhurta. Most appropriate 
muhurta for marriage can prevent marital disasters 
provided sincere efforts are made in selection of 
appropriate muhutta on the basis of the horoscopes 



390 Foretelling Widowhood 

of bride and bridegroom especially when indications 
of marital disasters, such as widowhood and divorce 
are present in the birth-chart. Selection of 
appropriate muhurta for marriage is not a simple 
work as it is made out to be now a days. It requires 
wide knowledge of the subject and experience. We 
shall be explaining about the art of selection of 
muhurta for the purpose of marriage in our 
forthcoming title Mars ; Remedies for marital Maladies 
and Widowhood. 

Matching of horoscopes to save all kinds of 
adversities, disasters and problems of marriage is 
most essential. This is usually taken into 
consideration by the parents of a boy and girl before 
fixing their marriage. Mostly they approach the so 
called astrologers and pandits who do not know 
much about the matching of charts for marriage. 
Importance is emphasized on matching points, nodi 
dosa and mangall dosa only. We regret to say that 
these so-called Pandits do not even know the basis 
of matching horoscopes of nadi dosa and mangall 
dosa, does not promise happy married life. We know 
couples, who are leading quite prosperous and 
happy married life with good understanding, though 
there are only three matching points present in 
their birth-charts out of 36. Points are matched on 
the basis of constellation of Moon, why other eight 
planets and their naksatras should not be taken 
into consideration? We have explained about the 
art of matching of horoscope in our voluminous 
work Predicting Marriage in the chapter M Does 
matching help?*' We have evaluated graha meldpaka 
and Bhava meldpaka in addition to naksatra meldpaka 
for accurate and appropriate matching of birth- 
charts for high degree of conjugal bliss. We are 
working on this most useful subject for the benefit 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 391 

of one and all. This work is entitled as Match Making 
Mystiques, which is written on the basis of various 
aspects of matching and practical study and 
illustrations of horoscopes of hundreds of couples. 

Recitation Of Suitable Mantra And Stotra To 
Prevent Widowhood 

Our sages were visionaries to advise IJie forthcoming 
generation of various suktas, stotras and jnantras to, 
prevent various kinds of miseries, mishaps and 
maladies of married life. We have a wide experience 
of the subject of curative measures and preventive 
art. We will be giving here various mantras and stotras 
which can certainly prevent the curse of widowhood, 
provided these remedial measures and mantras are 
followed properly with correct pronunciation* absolute 
faith, dedication and sattvika living with honesty and 
loyalty towards husband. 

Any mantra or stotra must be done after proper 
sodasopacara pujana of the concerning deity and 
taking proper sankalpa for the same. Sankalpa Is 
nothing but a pledge or promise to the concerning 
deity that the person will be reciting or chanting 
so many number of the particular mantra for so 
many days to please the deity to get the blessings 
for the fulfillment of one's wishes, that particular 
ambition and to nullify the adverse effect of malefic 
planets over the person etc. In sankalpa, one should 
pronounce his or her name along with the name 
of his father or her husband with gotra as well. 
The day and date, i.e., this vdr, samvat and place 
of worship should also be pronounced. In fact before 
taking up any worship anusthana, mantra jdpa and 
vrata etc. first of all we should introduce or define 
ourselves and the date, day and year should also 
be spoken alongwith the name of place. In the 



392 Foretelling Widowhood 

second half of the sankalpa, name of deity, purpose 
of sankalpa and number of mantra should be 
spoken. Mostly sankalpa is read in Sanskrit but 
it is not at all essential. The sankalpa may be read 
or spoken in any language in which one can easily 
and correctly express oneself. 

Mars plays a vital role in loss of spouse and 
especially to curse widowhood to a woman. It Is 
correctly believed that Mars is the significator of 
widowhood and Jupiter is the significator of 
saubhagya. Mangall girls are afraid of widowhood 
as placement of Mars in the ascendant, 7 th or 8 th 
house gives rise to the untimely loss of husband. 
We assure such mangall natives that widowhood 
can be prevented provided one is sincere to take 
up remedial measure as advised by our sages. 

Following are the most important preventive, 
most useful and appropriate mantras which a 
woman can recite regularly. It will be advantageous 
if mangall girls recited or read these mantra and 
stotra before finalisation of marriage. If the girl is 
having combination of widowhood in her birth 
chart, she must take up remedial measure soon 
after she has come of age. The most important, 
useful and tested mantras to prevent one from the 
adversities and evils of Mars are given below. Most 
of these remedial measures are rarely known and 
are not found anywhere in published books on the 
subject. The remedial measures should be followed 
veiy sincerely with full faith and belief if one is 
suffering from kuja do$a. The mantras are not for 
fun and frolic. Any kind of worship, mantra, japa 
and vrata etc. should not be undertaken during 
their menstruation periods by woman. The woman 
will be highly benefitted to prevent all marital 
disaster and mishappenings by proper, appropriate 
and correct use of mantra and stotra. 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood . 393 

Remedial Measures 

When Mars Is adversely placed In the birth-chart 
and such placement of Mars indicates any kind of 
marital disaster, divorce, widowhood or any other 
mlshappening such as murder, attack by criminals, 
accident, fight, conflict, confrontation, surgical 
operation or obstruction in child birth. One should 
recite the mantra of Mars in a proper way. Mantras 
of Mars are of various kinds but the Vedic mantras 
are most effective and give lasting results however 
everybody can not recite the Vedic mantra of Mars 
and therefore, there are other small and simple 
mantras. The recitation of these mantras are simple 
and can easily be undertaken by even those who 
can not read correct Sanskrit. 

We are making an honest effort to write all kinds 
of mantras relating to Mars for the benefit of readers 
and sufferers. 

Remedial Measure No. 1 

Recitation of mantra is most useful for the prevention 
of kufa dosa, widowhood, separation and marital 
maladies of all kinds, if Mars plays a negative role 
in birth-chart in regard to marriage. If one can not 
read lengthy mantras and stotras in Sanskrit, he can 
easily recite small Vedic, Paurartika or tantrika 
mantras for at least 10,000 times. It is advised that 
the number of mantras should be four times in 
Kaliyuga to get best results. So the subject should 
recite these mantras for 40,000 in total and should 
perform dasamsa, havana, torparza, marjana etc. 
either by himself or through a learned acarya.

Mangala Candikd Stotra 

One of the most powerful prayers is mangala Candikd 
stotra, addressed to goddess Candikd, an incarna- 
tion of Parvatl 

In our sacred Purdnas, an account goes thus, Lord 
Ndrdyana speaks to Narada: "Now listen to the 
sacred story of mangala Candikd which is agreeable 
to the Vedas and dearest even to those scholars 
who know of everything. The term Condi denotes 
Daksd (or the all skillful deity), mangala means 
auspicious. She is capable of causing any and every 
auspicious event. The term Condi further denotes 
Durgd while the term mangala denotes the planet 
Mars, the son of earth. Since the goddess is dear 
to Mars or Ku}a* she also is known as mangala 
Candikd She appears before her devotees as mercy 
personified and is the muse of women. Once upon 
a time, lord Sankara also obtained her blessings 
before slaying the fierce demon called TripurcC, 

Narrating the above account, lord Visnu reveals 
the following sacred and the most auspicious 
mantra, which should not be conveyed to hypocrites 
or to people who do not have any reverence for it.

400 Foretelling Widowhood 

This mantra's siddhi can be attained by reciting the 
same for ten lakh (10,00,000) times. O Brahmin 
(JVdrada) listen to me with attention! This widely 
acceptable prayer {dhyana, now being told) is 
honoured even by the devatas. Goddess mangala 
Candika, who is ever youthful, and always looks 
like a sixteen year old damsel. Endowed with 
wholesome beauty and virtues, she is soft bodied 
and heart robbing. Her complexion is akin to that 
of white campaka flower and her charming radiance 
Is equal to that of one crore Moons, She applies 
jasmine in her hair. Her lips are reddish, resem- 
bling the brilliant lotus of the spring season and 
adores a captivating smile. Both her eyes resemble 
the blossoming blue lotuses. She fulfils all the 
desires of everyone (who bows before her) and is 
a boat to cross the ocean of mundane journey and 
Is the Excellent one, I (Lord Visnu} always sing her 
gloiy. O sage, that was the mantra to please mangala 
CaridikcL Now listen to her stotra or praises (as 
told by Lord Siva). 

Stotra: Lord Siva says, "O mangala Candikel the 
mother of the Universe, you are the destroyer of 
all the dangers, and are ever ready to bestow 
ausplciousness. Protect me, protect me. The joyous 
mangala Candike, you distribute happiness and 
ausplciousness with open (or free) hands. You are 
the all auspicious subha mangala Candika and the 
ausplciousness of all other ausplciousness. O Devi! 
your nature is to bestow ausplciousness to virtuous 
people. You are the abode of ausplciousness for one 
and all. Devi you are the favourite deity of the 
planet mangala (or Kufa). You should be (unfailingly) 
worshipped on Tuesdays (as on other days). You 
are the honourable deity of Mangala, a king of Manu 
dynasty. O presiding deity of ausplciousness! you 
are auspicious even for the ausplciousness. All the 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 401 

auspiciousness of the universe takes shelter in you. 
You are the bestower of auspiciousness containing 
emancipation, O Devi! giver of auspiciousness on 
being worshipped on Tuesdays, you are the essence 
of the universe and are beyond all Karmas or deeds.** 

Lord Ndrayarta further says: Thus mafigala Candika 
has been first worshipped by Lord Siva on all 
Tuesdays, so also by Mars. One who recites or 
listens to this stotra T will never receive any 
inauspiciousness. He will beget auspicious results." 

When a man or a woman recites the above mantra 
and stotra regularly and with devotion, he or she 
will have no obstacles in his or her life, will be 
married early and will lead a happy life. The 
worship should be commenced on a Tuesday and 
be continued. 

This is extremely favourable for those natives 
(whether males or females) having kuja dosa of any 
magnitude. Such evils of Mars will completely 
vanish, marriage will take place and matrimonial 
life will be fully auspicious in every aspect. Also 
those without kuja dosa will also stand to gain 
timely marriage and attend happiness. 

Recitation of this rnangala Candika stotra (or the 
entire story) can be resorted to by those who are 
likely to be affected by transit of Mars. Those who 
are subjected to other kinds of blemishes by an 
afflicted Mars at birth (like disease, litigation etc.) 
can also undertake the recitation of this mafigala 
Candika stotra regularly.

of Narayana), Sandtanl (the Eternal, one who is 
beyond Gurids), the success giver, grant me 
auspiciousness, the all auspicious mother, my 
obeisance to you. In Durga - "Da" stands as an 
appellation for destroyer of demons; U stands as 
a synonym of destroyer of obstacles. The destroyer 
of diseases is implied by Ra while Ga denotes 
destroyer of sins. A- stands for destroyer of fear and 
foes (Thus she is the "destroyer" of all these evils). 
By mere recitation of name Durga, demons are 
destroyed. She is said to be the energy of Lord Visnm 
as stated by Sri Hari himself. The term "Durga" 
- without a long vowel at the end denotes "danger" 
while A denotes destroyer (^f + gTT = ^fl). Since 
she destroys dangers, she is known as Durga. 
Durgarndsura, the kind of demons is also denoted 
by the term Durga while A means destroyer. Hence 
she is known as Durga the destroyer of Durgamasura. 
In the term Stud, the character sa denotes 
auspiciousness, i denotes the best and va is for 
a giver. Thus Durga is a heap of auspiciousness 
and a giver of the best of the articles. And that 
is why, she is known as Siva. The meaning of 
abhaya is destroying fear (i.e., fearlessness) and 
A means giver. Hence she is known as Abhagcu 
In the term Maya, Ma denotes the kingdom and Yd, 
the obtainer of a kingdom. Again in Mdyd, Ma 
denotes emancipation and Yd the obtainer. Thus 
Mdyd means one who will obtain emancipation by 
worship of the mother. This goddess dwells in the 
body of Lord Narayana and is akin to him in 
radiance, hence she is revered as Nardyani. Sandtana 
denotes one who is everlasting and beyond gunas. 
Jaya means success. A denotes the given So she 
is known a Jayd, the success giver, Sarva Mangala 



430 Foretelling Widowhood 

denotes wholesome wealth giver. So she Is the giver 
of wholesome wealth or auspiclousness. These eight 
names of the Mother are full of quintessence and 
this stotra contains the meanings of such names. 
Lord Narayana taught these to Lord Brahma seated 
on a Lotus emanating from the navel of Lord VisniL 
After the discourse. Lord Narayana went into sleep 
taking shelter in yoganidra (Lord Visnu*s sleep at 
the end of a yuga ; Meditatlonal sleep* Lord Visnu's 
sleep personified and said to be a form of Goddess 
Durga) when the two demons, Madhu and Kaitabha, 
struck the scene to extinguish Lord Brahma. Then 
Brahma praised Mother Durga with these names.

For Happy and Early Marriage 

Janata, krta Parvati stotra - Many times, marriage of 
girls gets appreciably delayed or denied due to adverse 
placement of planets including Mars. Those girls 
would be married decently, happily and would enjoy 
high degree of conjugal bliss if they would read Janaki 
krta Parvati stotra. This stotra has been written by 
Mata Janaki as a prayer of Maid Parvati. They will be 
blessed with akhanda saubhagya who will read it 
regularly. It is best to read the stotra during the 
vrata of Mata Gauri after performing proper 
sodasopacara pujana of Gauri.

beloved, and only He is my fortune. Please give him

Those women who after performing Gauri vrata, 
read this stotra of Pdrvatl (as told by Janakil and 
bow before the Mother, will obtain one like Lord 
Hail as their husband. They will enjoy happiness 
with their husband in this world and after quitting 
this world, aboard the divine air-borne vehicle 
(Pnspaka Vimana) and reach the abode of Lord 
Sri Krsna. 

This Is the end of Gauri Vrata as told by Lord 
Narayana. The recitation of the praises showered 
by Sitd on Pdrvatl as a concluding part of the Vow 
is thus essential. Every aspirant will recite it 
without fail in order that results in full are obtained 
without delay.

For Happy and Intact Marriage - Radhika Sri krsija 
stotra - Tliis is highly useful stotra for all aspects of 
married life. A girl who is unmarried even after 
following various recttficational measures, will 
definitely be blessed with decent husband and happy 
married life, should she read Radhika Sri Krsna stotra 
thrice every day. Divorce and miseries of married 
life can also be ruled out by regular use of this stotra. 
The Importance of this stotra has been explained 
hereunder. 

Sarasvati, Laksmu Gangd, Durga, Veda Mata Savitri 
[Sruti prasuh = the progenitor of the Vedas) have all 
attained admiration by offering prayers at your feet. 
Such feet, I adore my lord again and again. I bow 
down before that Lord even by mere touch of whose 
servants, i.e., devotees and penance the (already) 
sacred shrines become purified (or become more 
sacred)". 

Whoever reads this stotra three times a day during 
three junctions, he becomes the servant of Lord Hari 
and attains the same good luck as Radhd did. 

If one who is in danger recites this stoiy with 
full devotion, then one will immediately attain 
wealth (of happiness and lucre). One will recover 
even such articles that have been lost or stolen 
long ago. His kinsfolk will progress and he will 
obtain mental happiness. 

If a worried person recites this (regularly), he will 
be relieved. 

Differences with husband, progeny and friends 
will be resolved by reciting this stotra for a month 
and the Lord will appear before the devotee. 

If an unmarried girl listens to this account (or 
she herself reads this account) for one full year, 
she will get a husband who is as charming and 
as virtuous as Lord Krsna. 



434 Foretelling Widowhood 

So concludes Lord Narayana in his discourse to 
Brahmarsi Ndrada. 

The aspirant, whether a female or a male, reading 
this part of vrata, as narrated by Lord ATordyaria 
will have all these desires fulfilled including getting 
an auspicious marriage. There are other benefits 
of reciting this stotra addressed to Lord Kr$na as 
reflected in the above translation. This being one 
of the most important ancient vows, I have fully 
explained all the details not bothering for space.

"We seek shelter in Lord Ganesa who possesses 
a virtuous nature, who is the source of beginning

indicative of the inconceivable thought of, I am that

"We seek shelter in Lord Ganesa who is the

"We seek shelter in Lord Ganesa who is sportive 
with the reflections of his own form, whose illusion 
can be directly seen, who has many forms and who 
gives his own strength (to the seekers)."

widowhood, that is the loss of husband most 
effectively. 

Once Pdrvatyi was very hungry, in spite of 
her repeated requests provide some edibles. 
Bhagavan Sankara asked her to wait for a 
while. Parvaiyl could not bear the hunger any 
longer and losing all her patience engulfed 
Bhagavan Sankara. Thus, she lost her husband 
and suffered the curse of widowhood. 
However, Bhagavan Sankara, with the help of 
yogamaya became alive again. But lot of 
smoke was coming out of the body of POrvatyi 
She prayed Bhagavan Sankara to pardon her 
for this stupid act. Bhagavan Sankara relented 
and said that she will be worshipped in 
this world as Dhiimavati. Those who will 
worship her with dedication and faith, will 
be blessed with victory over enemies, good 
children, wealth, prosperity and saubhagya. 
This is the worship of Matd Parvatl personified 
as widow. Those who are likely to suffer such 
curse of widowhood in their lives, must 
worship Dhiunavafi Devi so that they may never 
suffer loss of husband. This should be done in the 
following manner.

Pauamana Su/cta : Remedy for marital disharmony, 
separation and other adversities of conjugal disorder. 

There is difference between stotra and sukta. Stotra 
is a prayer while sukta is a verdict which gives more 
lasting and quick results. Pavamana sukta have been 
taken from Atharva Veda under Paippalada Samhita. 
These 21 slokas are mentioned there as pavamana 
sukta, for elimination of all adversities of married 
life. The women who read it with firm faith get rid of 
all problems connected with their family and conjugal 
life. We had given pavamana sukta in our first book

for the benefit of readers. I received hundreds of 
letters from women who followed this remedy for 
happiness of their family life and to overcome the 
differences with their husband owing to one or the 
other reason. These women obtained astonishing 
results after reciting pavamana sukta which is given 
below. Those women who are suffering or are likely 
to suffer from vagaries of married life, are advised to 
read this stotra atleast once every day in regular pa/a

husband due to affliction of concerning planets and 
houses in their concerning birth charts. Pavarnana 
siikta is best for preventing misunderstandings, 
difference of opinion, conjugal disharmony, mental 
or physical separation and divorce. 

In order to stop/control the severe clashes and 
conjugal disputes in married life, pavarnana sukta 
proves to be immensely powerful, energetic and 
effective. It has remarkable potence to show positive 
results. If the situations in marital relationships 
are uncontrollable and all efforts fail to show 
results, usage of ordinary mantras prove ineffective, 
this sukta must be used. Positive results are bound 
to come. 

This sukta is written in Paippalada Samhita of the 
Atharvaveda. It contains twenty one slokas in which 
Lord Pavarnana is worshipped because the whole 
universe, air, earth, water, heaven, days, night, all 
directions, Sun, Moon, planets, fire, altar, altarages, 
mountains, rivers, seas, oceans, clouds, past, future 
and even God Prqjapati are purified by him, hence 
devotee prays for his/her purification also. 

Timing events are operated by dasa bhukti of 
planets. Any particular planet for a particular subject 
may be rndraka if it is adversely placed in the birth 
chart. Therefore, propitiation of that planet is also 
essential which is out of the scope of this work. 
However, we are giving hereunder the Vedic, 
pauranika and tantrika mantra of all nine planets, 
which should be recited by the native himself or by 
any learned and experienced acarya or pandits. The 
mantra of all planets should be recited for specific 
number of times such as the Vedic mantra of Saturn 
and Mars are to be recited 23,000 and 10,000 times 
respectively. In Kaliyuga the number of recitals 
should be four times as ordained for best results.

Indrdksl stotra (Prevents untimely widowhood and

effective and as good as mahd rnrtywyaya, sanjivanl

than that The sodjxsopacdra pujana is done of 
Indrdksl Devi before reciting the Indrdksl 
stotra, which is given below. This is rarely known 
stotra and not commonly used by the astrologers, 
partdits, and dcdryas. We have experienced 
the wonderful results of Indrdksl stotra where 
other measures failed or were not much effective. 
It is always advisable to recite Indrdksl stotra 
if the 5 th house is under the influence of Venus 
either by occupation, ownership or by strong aspect. 
Dasamsa, Havana, tarpana, rnarjana should 
essentially be done for best beneflc results and for 
absolute recovery of the patient.

We have given several preventive and remedial 
measures regarding the rectification of marital 
disorders, unhappy married life, conjugal disasters, 
separation, suppression, suspicion, setbacks, 
widowhood, loss of wife, and sufferings of spouses 
by serious and incurable ailments. We would like 
to invite the attention of our readers towards 
effectiveness of these mantras, stotras, suktas etc. 
We are research scholar of astrology and have come 
across the birth charts of more than a lakh of 
natives seriously and sincerely and have seriously 
and sincerely advised these measures as and when 
required. Most positive results have been experienced 
both by us and the devotees. Many families who 
were ruined due to marital mishaps, they have 
astonishingly regained their happiness, love and 
their sweet home by following suitable measures 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 463 

applicable to them. To select a suitable measure 
for a particular native also requires lot of knowledge 
and experience. It is beyond the scope of this book 
to discuss the selection of appropriate and suitable 
deity, concerning mantra, stotra etc. We are planning 
to discuss it quite exhaustively in a separate cover 
captioned as Remedies for Marital Maladies. 

Remedial Measure No. 32 

Vrata (Strong Remedial Measure) : Vrata is one of 
the most important, easier and common ways of 
rectification of various kinds of maladies. If a planet 
is adversely placed in a birth chart, the gems of 
the planet will enhance the adversity of that planet 
for example if Mars is placed in any of the sensitive 
houses giving rise to kuja dosa, wearing of coral 
or moonga must not be advised as that will enhance 
the intensity of Jcu/a dosa In such case, vrata, 
donation and prayer are the only ways to eliminate 
or curtail the adverse effects of the concerning 
planet. 

Generally in our country, innumerable persons 
both male and female observe vrat but they don't 
know many important factors to be adopted during 
the observance of vrata. Here 1 will explain the 
method of observance of a vrata immaculately, so 
that one can get the best results of the vrata in 
form of accomplishment of ambitions. 

The first and most important basis of vrata Is 
faith. A vrata will be fruitless without faith and 
belief in its efficiency. The ordained vrata should 
be undertaken with full faith and belief that the 
God or Goddess so evoked would be pleased by ones 
reverence. Vrata is to dedicate your particular day 
to the deity. The day has to be passed with full 
sanctity and piousness and devotion to Almighty 



464 Foretelling Widowhood 

God and Goddess along with sincerity, honesty and 
simplicity with faith, confidence and holiness in 
addition to absolute involvement in spiritual and 
religious thinking and devotion. Generally any kind 
of meal is avoided during vrata. In present era our 
sages allow us to partake of little and special food 
without any kind of salt, only once during the day 
so that the routine activities may not be disturbed 
and one may not experience physical weakness. The 
scanty food, i.e., alpahdra is taken only to provide 
essential strength and energy to the body and not 
for taste. In almost all the vrata use of salt in the 
food has been prohibited because its usage 
determines the taste of food. 

The norms of vrata should be followed prior to and 
during the vrata. It is essential that no extra meal 
be taken to hide over the difficult times during the 
vrata. Normal meals should be taken the previous 
evening and in case of married ladles as well as 
gentlemen, there should be a complete abstinence 
from sexual acts on the days preceding and following 
the vrat period. Otherwise the vrata will be blem- 
ished. The person observing the vrata should not 
even sit or lie on the bed during the vrata. Even 
the touch of others' clothes should be avoided. 

One should purify oneself with a good cleansing 
bath and wear clean inner garments and apparels 
on the proposed day. The subject should face either 
north or east direction and undertake the oath of 
vrata or sankalpa according to following steps: - 

1 st Step: Sankalpa (Pledge): 

Face North or East direction while holding water, 
rice, whole betel nut, money and flowers in hand. 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 465 

2 nd Step: 

Identification of the person, place and time. The per- 
son should speak his own name followed by father 
or husband's name. Specify the date, day, pak$a> 
month and naksatrcu The person should also state 
the gotra and name of place. 

3 rd Step: 

State the name of the vrata and the name of deity 
connected with the vrata. This should be followed by 
stating the special wish or objective. 

It is important that the process of pledging is 
performed while undertaking any kind of vrata. This 
is called safikalpa in which one promises or pledges 
to observe vrata on any particular day. 

During the Vrata following precautions are 
prescribed: 

tecttdj of tJoofrcT I I 

In GarudLa Parana, it is stated that those who 
observe vrats. should always keep in mind that 
about the loss of temper, laziness, greediness and 
temptation etc., otherwise the vrata will be broken. 
In that case* one should not have meal for three 
consecutive days and start the vrata afresh. 

The person should remain silent as much as 
possible, should not converse especially with an 
atheist, disbeliever, a critic of the vrata, a contemp- 
tuous person or with women who are menstruating. 
The person should avoid common gossip, anger, 
jealousy, hatred, etc. He should not lie at all during 
the vrata, prayers etc. otherwise the vrata will 
automatically be violated. 

After sankalpa and other pu/d activities, one 



466 Foretelling Widowhood 

should always touch the place on the ground, where 
one sat, with both hands and then with the 
forehead otherwise the major part of the effect of 
the worship and vrata will go to Indradeva. 

If by any mischance, any of these rules is broken, 
the vrata can be started again by making due 
correction etc., by donating money, cloths, fruits, 
flowers, grains etc. (The original rule of correction

In Vi$i)\t Parana, it has been mentioned that one 
should not drink water again and again or sleep 
during day time or eat tobacco or betel during vrata. 
One should not also indulge in any kind of sexual 
act during vrata, otherwise the vrata will be broken. 

Meals may not be taken altogether or may be 
taken once a day during vrata but only in company 
of one's same generation, or after setting apart 
meals for Brahmin. Sleeping is normally prohibited 
during vrata, eating of betel, nuts, chocolates, 
mouth freshners and any kind of tasty food even 
if does not contain salt or cereals is strictly 
prohibited. It is so because little food Is taken to 
maintain routine strength for work. And as far as 
possible the person should pray the God or Goddess 
invoked and read good and purifying literature etc. 
one should meditate and think about God. Vrata 
may also get broken by repeatedly drinking water 
or juice etc. 

It is very difficult for. a normal working person 
to undergo a 24-hour vrata these days, so it may 
be substituted by vrata that is only up to the 
evening. Whatever be the case, it is necessary that 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 467 

the vrata is undergone and completed with full 
adherence to the rules and regulations, if at all 
undertaken. 

Undertaking a vrata means that you are pledging 
to the God or Goddess that you would be concen- 
trating or praying, thoughts would be virtuous, 
avoiding all sorts of indulgence, including food and 
water. It is dedication to the God or Goddess of 
your faith and belief with complete devotion. 

Before breaking the vrata in the evening, one 
should sit on an dsana (mat) and concentrate on 
God or Goddess invoked and repeat one's wish and 
the fact that one observed vrata on such a date 
and for such a purpose and that now one is 
breaking the vrata. One should plead forgiveness 
for any mistakes that may have been committed 
during the vrata. 

Vratas are of several kinds and all of them can 
not be discussed here, however, the brief explanation 
of the concept of vrata should clear the understand- 
ing of vrata. Vrata are veiy effective if undertaken 
properly and definitely prove fruitful* Besides, using 
them to pacify planets, please Gods and Goddesses 
and to attain a special desire, vratas are also veiy 
effective when used as preventive measures against 
evils and impending misfortunes etc, 

Vrata should be observed by those persons who 
are truthful, honest, kind hearted, religious, wise 
and sincere. 

For examples, It has been rightly said :

It means that a woman should serve her husband 
only. She should neither observe any vrata nor she 
should perform any worship without the consent

of her husband, A woman can get heaven etc, only 
by serving her husband and remain loyal towards 
him. No worships, religious yqjna or vrata is more 
important for woman than serving her husband. 
Vrata should neither be started nor be closed 
within three days of the rise or combustion of Venus 
and Jupiter, for getting best and early results. 

Before commencement of any vrata, worship of 
Ganapatu Matrika and Pahcadevata, must be done 
and thereafter Ndndi Sraddha should be performed. 
A small statue, in gold, of the deity for whom vrata 
is being undertaken, should be got made. Thereafter 
sodasopacara pujana of the deity should be done.

If one can not observe vrata due to some problem 
or obstruction or being on journey, one should get

wife, elder son, Purohita, brother or friend. If none 
of these is available, vrata can be got done by 
Brahmins, 

Our rsis and sages had foreseen the mental 
status and intellectual inclination, education, 
dedication, discipline, faith, concentration, 
pronunciation arid other aspects of the natives of 
Kaliyuga. They have prescribed very easy as well 
as very tough mantra and stotra etc., for different 
categories of the knowledge of the natives based 
on their knowledge, merits and abilities to read, 
recite and to perform the same. They have given 
a very easy and simple remedy, which can be 
obtained by sincere adherence vrata, But, however, 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 469 

vrata is commonly advised to them who have strong 
faith and will but they can not read text in Sanskrit. 
Vrata can be kept even by those who have language 
problem or by those who are highly educated but due 
to difference in culture, their pronounciation in 
Sanskrit is incorrect. Vrata can also be kept by those 
who can read and recite mantra and stotra and they 
further want to get quick results and can also afford 
to keep vrata in addition to adhering to remedies 
arising from mantras and stotra. Selection of appropriate 
and suitable vrata is not a tough job. Mostly the vrata 
of Tuesdays is required by all mangali women and 
men. In this vrata intake of salt is absolutely 
prohibited. Before proceeding further towards the 
details of specific vratas, we are giving few important 
and essential points which should be remembered 
and followed by all during keeping of vrata :- 

1. There must be a feeling of true and absolute 
dedication towards the concerning deity, that 
is Almighty. The day of vrata is not just to keep 
fast or to eat nothing but Is a day of living 
with pious minds and deeds. A day is dedicated 
to the deity. One surrenders himself and goes 
in the shelter of concerning power for his or 
her blessings for the accomplishment of am- 
bitions. One should eat little so that routine 
may not be disturbed but the food should be 
pious, i.e., sattvika and sak§ma 

2. Women are advised not to observe vrata during 
menstrual periods. Most Important urata of 
Karaud Cautha should also not be observed 
during the period of Impurity. Sages have veiy 
strictly stressed this point. One should otherwise 
donate 380 cows with mounting of gold on their 
horns. If the sariftalpa has been taken, vrata 
should be completed if menstrual periods begin 



4 70 Foretelling Widowhood 

after sankalpa has been taken and the mantra 
of prdyascttta should be done when the menstrual 
period Is over. 

3. If possible, cleaning of teeth with toothpaste 
made of chemicals is also not advisable. 

4. One should not meet any woman who is having 
menstrual periods provided it Is known. 

5. One should not make a contact with any correct 
male or female If known. 

6. One should utilize his time by reading books 
or magazines on auspicious subjects or by 
listening or doing bhajana etc. One should not 
read any murder or mystry novels, books, 
stories and one should also avoid such type 
of serial on television so that the purity of mind 
may not be disturbed even for a short period. 

7. Evening meal as prescribed in various vratas 
should be taken with the person of equal status 
such as husband, wife, brother, sister, sister- 
in-law etc. but not with mother, father, son, 
daughter or parent-in-laws, complete meals 
like pardfftd, sabju should be prepared. How- 
ever, In the evening meals of vratas other than 
Tuesdays, only one cereal should be taken as 
food but there may be several vegetables. 

8. In the vrata on Tuesday, one should take sweet 
food, fruits, milk etc. during 12 noon to 3 PM. 
Curmd is the best intake for the Tuesday. 

9. The commencement and ending any vrata is the 
toughest task. No vrata should be started 
verbatim and it should not be closed without 
proper procedure. Otherwise, the subject will 
have to suffer by the curse of concerning deity. 
Any vrata should be commenced only after firm 
faith, appropriate advise of any competent and 
meritorious astrologer. The selection of suitable 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 471 

vrata be done only by a good astrologer. 
Essentials as mentioned above should be 
followed during vrata. Generally, the vrata 
should be stopped only after the fulfilment of 
desires. However, the vrata can be closed due 
to any other reason, if it becomes essential, 
But vrata should never be stopped without 
proper procedure, which is called udydpana. 
Udydpana is to pray and thank at the feet of 
concerning deity for the fulfilment of ambitions 
and to beg excuse for shortcomings, errors, and 
faulty worship. This is done after comprehensive 
§odasopacara piijana of the deity for which any 
standard book of vrata can be referred. 

Udydpana of Vrata 

Udyapana means to make prayers for accomplish- 
ment of ambitions and to be excuse for the mistakes, 
errors and shortcomings, defects which might have, 
occurred during vratas, at the time of completion or 
the total duration of urata as said in Saftkalpa. 
Udydpana is done when any particular vrata is to be 
closed, i.e., to be discontinued. Starting and closing 
of the vrata should be done after repeated thinking 
and after making a strong determination. If a urota 
is started and that gets discontinued due to one or 
the other reason, that becomes fruitless until unless 
udyapana is done. Udydpana is a particular and 
specific process of worship of the concerning deity 
at the moment of completion of vrata as suggested 
by sages and saints in various tales such as uratarfca. 
Vrata is observed for fulfilment of any desire or 
will. Udydpana is mostly done when the period of 
sankalpa is over. It is a process of worship in which 



472 Foretelling Widowhood 

we offer thanks to the deity for the blessing we 
receive and desire gets fulflled as an outcome. One 
has to express his gratitude and obligation to the 
concerned deity. After so^asopacdra pujana, i.e., 
sixteen-fold worship one must beg excuse for any 
known or unknown shortcoming and faults, which 
might have occurred during the duration of vrata. 
These are a few important 10 points to be 
seriously observed during vrata. We have discussed 
a lot about procedure about vrata in our forthcoming 
book Mars : Marital Maladies and Remedies.

We are now giving in this chapter this story and 
the manner of undertaking this vrata (vow), in full 
containing mantra, dhyana and stotra (the three 
essential limbs of a worship), as given above for 
mangola Coridifcd stotra, ignoring space restraints, 
in order that a wider section of deserving readers 
stands to benefit (even by merely reading it every 
day). Since a vow is not complete without an 
example, we are giving Sitd's stotra of Durga as part 
of Gauri Vrata, whereby SUd acquired lord Rama 
{Vtsnu} as her beloved husband which is also a part 
of Gauri vrata narrated by the Puranas. Thus, what 
is being given below is a complete account of the 
Gauri Vrata 

Once sage Ndrada asked lord Narayana about the 
method of performing Gauri vrata (the vow to 
propitiate Devi Gauri), the articles to be given away 
In charity, the secrets revealed at the end and such 
other details. 

Lord Narayana narrates to Narada as under: - 

"The vow called Gauri vrata is now being explained. 
Initially, women (of ancient times) had performed 
this vrata in the month of Mdrgasir§CL Men also 
will attain the four ends (viz. dharma, artha, kdma 
and rnok$di apart from devotion to lord Sfikr§na by 
performing this vrata. This is famous in various 
lands. It is deemed that this vrata has been in place 
since remote past by tradition. By this vrata, a 
woman obtains a highly affectionate husband, A 
girl, i.e., the aspirant should fast on the previous 
day, he., before commencement of the month 
concerned), wash off the clothes (to be used the 
next day) and lead a restrained life. On the next 
day, i.e., on the day the month of Morgas\r§a

bath in near by river and wear the previously 
washed robes. In a sacred pot the six prescribed 
deities, viz., Ganesa, Stay a, Agni (fire), Visiim Siva 
and Durga should be invoked. These deities should 
be worshipped with various articles offering the five 
kinds of upacaras (oblations like clothes and 
ornaments). Before the kala&a (sacred pot), a square 
vedu i.e., square area of ground to serve for 
sacrificial altar, having receptacles for the sacrificial 
fire) should be prepared. Sandal, incense, kasturi 
(musk) and kumkuma (saffron) should be applied 
on the vedl An idol of Durga with ten arms should 
be got made of sand, A mark of saffron should be 
applied on the forehead of the idol, and an offer 
of camphor and sandal should also be made on the 
other parts of the body of the Idol. (In genuinely 
difficult cases, as in these days, a normal picture 
of Pdrvail will be sufficient as an aid for unflinching 
concentration). The goddess should be invoked with 
prayers. Then the following mantra should be 
recited. 

1. Mantra

^ankara, just as you are the beloved of Sahkara, 
you the giver of auspiciousness, make me the 
beloved wife - such a wife that will not be so easily 
available for a charming man" 

The idol of Durga should be worshipped with the 
above cited mantra, after taking a sankalpa (or vow 
to complete the worship) alongwith the following 
miila mantra, stipulated in Soma Veda.

Meaning : Om, obeisance to Sri Durga, the 
destroyer of all obstacles). 

Reciting these mantras, the goddess should be 
prayed with the most secretive prayers enjoined in 
the Samaveda (being described below) which is not 
available even to the most excellent of sages. Men 
of attainment pray to DurgcL the destroyer of evil 
manifestations, on these lines.

Ghata Vivaha or Visnu Pratima Vivaha : 

Muhurtganpati Mahilaye Jyotisa, P. 70 

If the combination of widowhood or vtshangana 
is present in the horoscope of a woman,, then she 
must observe Vata Savitri vrotcu This falls on new 
Moon day of jyestha masa every year. Her marriage 
should be ceremonised with the Piped tree, VisrjLU 
Pratima, Saligrama or Kumbha to nullify the evil 
results and adverse happenings after marriage. 

If the girl is suffering from mangali dosa, kumbha 
vivaha or ghata vivaha or Visnu pratima vivaha is 
done so as to nullify the adversity caused by Mars. 
Visnu pratima vivaha should be done with full rituals 
just like the actual marriage. It Is believed that 
Lord Visnu, becomes the first husband of the girl, 
all adversities caused by Mars to the female 
resulting into marital disasters, mishaps or widow- 
hood will go to lord Visnu since lord Visnu is the 
supreme power, i.e., the God, so these adversities 
will automatically be nullified and he will not be 
harmed. Kumbha vivaha is usually but wrongly 
done after the settlement of the marriage of the 
girl with someone. In fact, kumbha or ghata vivaha 
should be done before the settlement of any kind 
of engagement of the girL However, in this marriage 
kanyaddna Is prohibited. This is a gandharua vivaha 
with lord Visnu, which she does herself secretly. 
Kanyaddna of one girl can not be done twice by 
the parents otherwise they will have to face the 
results of this sin for giving their daughter to 
different husbands one after another. So the girl 



478 Foretelling Widowhood 

takes up the safikalpa. of marriage with lord Visnu. 
After the completion of performance of marriage 
rituals, the girl takes out her bangles, sari and 
other garments which she was wearing at the time 
of Visnu pratima vivaha. She should hand over her 
clothes to the Acarya who got the marriage done. 
The bangles should be broken thereafter and the 
kolasa or kumbha should be immersed in a river. 
Thereafter, she will pray to lord Visnu to permit 
her for the second marriage with so and so* It is 
believed that lord Visnu has granted the permission 
to the girl for the second marriage. The girl should 
always keep the idol of lord Visnu with her. On all 
auspicious occasions and celebrations, she should 
pay her regards to that idol of lord Visnu or if the 
idol is not there or the same has not been used 
in Visnu pratima vivaha, she should Imagine lord 
Visnu as her first husband to pay her regards and 
prayers to him. At the time of Visnu pratima vivaha, 
brief sodasopacara pujana and prana pratistha of the 
idol of gold, copper or brass should be done before 
the commencement of the ritual* We have suggested 
in a number of strong mangali females to perform 
Visnu pratima vivaha before the settlement of their 
marriage. Out of hundreds of such cases, so far 
only one girl whose horoscope has been explained 
in earlier chapter, lost her husband in an accident 
after about ten years of marriage in spite of Visnu 
pratima vivaha. We believe that she lead a high class 
and happy married life in spite of strong 
combinations of widowhood in her horoscope due 
to Visnu pratima vivaha However, except for this 
case, many strong mangali women in whose 
horoscope even widowhood is indicated are leading 
happy married lives with their husband. This kind 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 479 

of ghata vivaha protects widowhood in early age of 
the female.

Donation For Mars : We believe that donation is the 
most powerful rectificational measure to nullify all 
adversities caused by various planets. There is 
nothing parallel to it provided that it is done 
according to one's capacity. Donation should be quite 
a lot in quantity and amount. In fact, we have 
forgotten completely about donation. In earlier age, 
people used to donate villages, unaccountable gold, 
wealth, eatables, silver, gems etc. Donation should 
be so much that the donor should be extremely 
satisfied by giving a part of property or wealth. The 
sankalpa should be done in any language by the 
donor that he Is donating such articles to the person 
mentioned by name followed by mentioning the name 
of his father, gotra, date, purpose and the place 
where sankalpa is being taken. The person who is 
accepting the donation, should utter loudly that he 
accepts the donation from the donor mentioned by 
name etc. Any donation is incomplete without money 
without which one does not get the benefit of 
donation. Donation should be given to the deserving 
person and one has to make efforts in finding out 
the suitable recipient for donation. 

The donation for Mars can be given to Brahmins 
and Ksatriya natives. One should donate liberally 
with faith and dedication in the power of the 
Mangala Deva. Following sloka should be quoted in 
connection of the donation to please Mars and to 
get the best advantage and results for the attainment 
of saubhagya, high degree of conjugal bliss, wealth, 
children, prosperity, popularity, sound health , 
elimination of enemies, conquer of rivals, criminals, 



480 Foretelling Widowhood 

opponents, and to get rid of ailments and untimely 
death etc. Once again, we strongly emphasize on 
the remedies of Mars and all other planets etc. by 
way of donation frequently and liberally. This will 
certainly make the life happy, prosperous, loving, 
caring, adjusting and healthy. 

Sloka 

U<$Qrci' 4lot4J 

1 . Gura, Gram, red masura, red cloth, copper,

red flower, money, wheat, red bull may be 
donated on Tuesday to please Maftgala devata, 

2. 1.25 Kg. of revadi may be dropped in the river 
or any water stream flowing south hard, to 
please Maftgala devata. The money can always 
be donated in lieu of these articles as all such 
articles can be purchased by means of money. 
Donation is the strongest measure to solve all 
problems, tensions, failures, dissatisfaction, 
disharmony and diseases but one must know 
the art of donation and for that, one must have 
full faith and intense desire and inner conscience 
to help the deserving person by donating money 
and articles to them. 

We have given here 38 strong remedial measures 
to get rid of most of the problems of life caused 
by Mars and for prevention of widowhood in 
particular. Before taking up any remedial measures, 
one should consult any worthy astrologer or acarya 
or the measure should be undertaken after his 
guidance or supervision to avoid mistakes and 
faults. Pronounciation must be absolutely correct 



Remedies for Marital Maladies and Widowhood 481 

and proper procedure must be followed for obtaining 
best results and quick effects of these preventive 
measures. 

A sincere and honest approach has been made 
to explain various tested remedies for marital 
maladies so as to prevent discord and miseries of 
conjugal life and most of all to nullify every 
probability for the loss of life partner and attaining 
Akhanda Saubhagya by all means* I believe 
honourable readers will be highly benefitted by 
learning rare combinations and aphorisms on this 
most important branch of marriage which had been 
continuously ignored and not taken seriously and 
religiously so far. 

We strongly trust that our readers will be largely 
and widely benefitted and that will be a true reward 
to the work on specialised branch of the subject.
