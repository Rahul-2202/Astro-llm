FOREWORD 


BY 


Bangalore Suryanarain Rao, BA, M.R.A.S., F.R.H.S.,“ete., 
Editor, Astrological Magazine, 


It gives me great pleasure to write a few 
words by way of a Foreword. 

The writer of this work Dr. B. V. Raman,. 
is my eldest son's eldest son, i.e., my grandson. 
I was on the look-out for a competent successor 
to the special line of researches, viz., astrono- 
mico-astrology in which I have spent the major 
portion of my active life and have found my 
grandson, a competent youth to take up my 
work. 

He has made an intelligent study of mathe- 
matical and predictive astrology and has been 
able to compose some treatises on this important 
subject. 


The necessity of accurate mathematical 
knowledge is placed beyond a question; and no 
astrologer of any pretensions, can ever hope to- 
become a successful predictor, unless he is com- 
petent in his astronomical knowledge of correctly 
casting the horoscope and finding out the 
various sources of strength and weakness of the 
Planets and the Bhavas. 


This work, I am proud to say has been 


X11 
done by my grandson, with considerable skill 
and ability. He has put his ideas in a flowing, 
convincing and easy style and the illustrations 
he has given, will be found to be of immense 
use to the readers. 

I have been, during the last 60 years, of my 
activities in the astrological line, dealing more 
or less with the judicial portion of astrology, 
and did not give as much attention as the 
subject of mathematical calculations demanded. 
Probably fate ordained, that, while I have fully 
treated in my own inimicable style, the predic- 
tive portions of astrology, the astronomical 
portions have been reserved to be elaborated by 
my own grandson, adding a feather to the line 
of my succession. 


As this book deals with the essential 
aspects of Mathematical Astrology, necessary for 
correct computation of horoscopes, according 
to the Hindu system, the selection of the name 
as "A Manual of Hindu Astrology" is quite 
appropriate. 

There has been a very great demand for 
such a book and I am proud to say that my 
grandson Dr. B. V. Raman has supplied the 
want with credit to himself. 


This book is written with a view to help all 
those who are attempting to grasp the fundamen- 
tal principles of Hindu Astronomico-astrology. 


xXul 


To write a book on mathematical portion 
requires patience, diligence and devotion, all of 
which, my grandson, has displayed in a com- 
mendable manner. 


I pray to God earnestly that he may live to 
a long age, as God has been pleased to give me 
longevity, and do as much service to the 
public as possible. Blessing him with all my 
heart and praying to God to make him 
successful and prosperous :—

PREFACE 


Last year I wrote a comprehensive “book 
entitled "A Text Book of Hindu Astrology", 
the major portion of which has been devoted 
to the exposition of the predictive branch of the 
science. But later on, I realised the need for a 
book devoted to the mathematical side of the 
subject too, by the constant pressure brought to 
bear upon me by students of astrology. In cast- 
ing horoscopes according to approved rules 
of Hindu Astrology, nothing but a series of 
mathematical calculations are involved; and 
hence the present manual is more or less devoted 
to the exposition of the important and essential 
principles of Hindu Mathematical Astrology. 
The mathematical portions dealt with are of a 
very elementary nature. It is hoped the present 
work will supply a long-felt want. All neces- 
sary and superfluous information § constantly 
employed by writers on Mathematical Astrology, 
which are not only cumbersome but also un- 
important from the point of view of correct 
predictions, has been omitted. Ignorance of 
even the elementary principles of Mathematical 
Astrology is sure to lead one to the obvious 
misconception of the fundamental postulates 
of the judicial system and, at the same time 


Xvi 


too much indulgence in mathematics alone, 
is equally harmful as completely atrophying 
one's judgment faculty and power of induction. 
Hence to cast and read a horoscope, a moderate 
knowledge of Mathematical Astrology would be 
simply invaluable. 


I propose to issue two other books on the 
"Strengths of Planets" and “Longevity" so 
that these three books contain all the infor- 
mation necessary to enable the student to 
prepare a_ suitable ground for venturing 
predictions. This book deals with such aspects 
as the determination of the longitudes of 
planets, house-cusps, sunrise and sunset and 
other information essential for constructing a 
horoscope. “‘The strength of planets" and “Ayur- 
daya " deal with the planetary relations, shad- 
balas, periods and sub-periods and longevity. 


A separate chapter, exclusively devoted to 
describing the method of casting the horoscope, 
etc., according to the western system and its 
reduction to the Hindu, has been included and 
this is sure to enhance the value of the book by 
making it accessible to the Eastern and West- 
ern students alike. 


The book is intended both for the beginner 
and the advanced. 


The book may have its own defects, 


XVi11 


and any suggestions for its improvement will be 
gratefully appreciated. 

Original books on  Varshaphal (Annual 
reading of horoscopes) based on Tajaka, Kala- 
chakra Dasas, etc., are in the course of prepara- 
tion and they will be released for publication in 
due course, for the benefit of the astrological 
public. I am specially indebted to my grand- 
father Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao, to whom this 
work is dedicated for his valuable instructions 
to me in Astrology. 

I have relied to some extent on the English 
translation of Sripathi Paddhati by Mr. V. S. 
Subrahmanya Sastri for information on Dasa- 
mabhava Sphuta and my thanks are due to 
him. [ cannot but appreciate the labours of my 
wife Srimathi Rajamma Raman for re-writing the 
entire Manuscript and making it suitable for the 
press. My thanks are also due to Dr. M. C. 
Srikanta Pandit for having financed the publi- 
cation, and to Mr. Mir Abdul Huq and the staff 
of Modi Power Printing Works for evincing 
special interest in printing the work. 


I feel certain that my humble endeavours in 
expounding Astrology will be appreciated by all 
well-wishers of knowledge and understanding.

AN INTRODUCTION 


BY 


Jyothirbhnshan Dr. V. V. Ramana Sastrin, M.A., Ph.D., ete. 


I am asked to write a few words by way of 
introduction, which I do with extreme pleasure, 
even in the face of poorly health. 

The present volume is devoted to the 
astronomical basis of Hindu Astrology, not 
without occasional side-lights on the theory of 
Western Astrology, but the manner in which 
the relevant findings are marshalled, and the 
methods, expounded, will not fail to hold the 
attention of the reader. 


To the beginner with the merest acquain- 
tance with the astronomical preliminaries, the 
presentation is bound to make a_ fascinating 
appeal, but to the trained student, the book as a 
whole, cannot but serve the purpose of a stimu- 
lating repertory of the leading facts or concepts 
of Astrological Mathematics. 

The Author, Dr. B. V. Raman has already 
made his mark in the astrological world, and 
bids fair to hold his own in the future, as a 
first-rate expounder of Hindu Astrology. He 
is none other than the grandson of Prof. B,,. 
Suryanarain Rao, the venerable doyen of Indian 
Astrologers of repute, whose personal teaching 


XX 


and example have gone not a little to make of 
the grandson what he is. 

This book is intended to be the first of a 
serier, planned to embrace the several depart- 
ments of astrology, one after another, and I 
sincerely bid him God-speed in the successful 
materialisation of his plans.

AUTHORS INTRODUCTION 


The mathematical basis of astrology’ is so 
precise and exact that even its greatest enemies 
cannot but be convinced of its scientific nature. 
The noble art of predictions assumes a fair 
amount of knowledge in the mathematical part 
of astrology. It cannot be denied, that such an 
ability, imposes a great strain on the limited 
mental acumen of the average astrologer, that 
his pretensions to make correct predictions are 
really baseless. It would be better to draw a dis- 
tinction, between mathematical astrology and 
astronomy. By the former, we mean, the rela- 
tion of mathematics to astrology in so far as it 
s concerned with the correct determination of 
the longitudes of planets on the basis of reliable 
ephemerides or almanacs, cusps of the various 
houses, the different kinds of Balas or Sources 
of strength and weakness of each planet and 
house, and such other details which are ascer- 
tainable with the aid of mathematics so that a 
sound basis for making correct predictions may 
be obtained. In other words, mathematical 
astrology deals with nothing but correct casting 
of horoscopes. And we classify the methods of 
computing the longitudes of planets indepen- 
dently, determining the periods of eclipses and 


XR 


such other details as the measurement of the 
dimensions of the various celestial bodies and 
their internal and external peculiarities, etc., 
under astronomy. The ancient Hindus always 
regarded astrology and astronomy as_ synony- 
mous so that a bad astronomer was also 
considered a bad _ astrologer. In _ fact the 
qualifications laid down by great and illustrious 
writers like Varahamihira and Bhaskaracharya 
are so rigorous, that, we fear, that none of us 
to-day, would be deemed to be called an astro- 
loger at all. Bhaskara stresses on the need of 
a clear knowledge of spherical astronomy, for 
one, who wishes to be an astrologer and a 
comprehension of the doctrine of sph@ucal 
projection and allied theories for locating the 
true positions of planets, etc. But for our 
purpose, we shall maintain this distinction, we 
have called attention to above, in regard to 
mathematical astrology and astronomy; and 
deem that a fair acquaintance with the princi- 
ples of mathematical astrology are absolutely 
essential for successful predictions. 


A noteworthy sign of this century seems to 
be a general awakening in the minds of the 
educated classes to institute a scientific inquiry 
into ancient subjects like astrology and 
astronomy. It is, however, deplorable to note 
that, in their over-enthusiasm to benefit the cause 


XXi111 


of the science, many of the modern English 
Educated Hindus of to-day are adopting an 
undesirable attitude towards Hindu astronomical 
calculations in rejecting them altogether as incor- 
rect or inconsistent and replacing them entirely 
by modern ones, as being quite accurate and 
precise. The arguments advanced by them, in 
favour of such a theory, are generally unsound 
and cannot stand the test of actual demonstra- 
tion. Are we to reject the Hindu astronomical 
calculations formulated and adopted by such 
celebrated exponents of the celestial science as 
Varahamihira, Bhaskara, Sripathi and others, 
because they seem to clash with modern ones, 
whi accept the ancient astrological principles? 
A Varahamihira or a Kalidasa, who has 
bequeathed to us such master-pieces as Brihat 
Jataka and Uttara Kalamritha could not have 
been so ignortant or indifferent as to give room 
for such fallacies, inconsistencies and errors 
which we are trying to find out in their writings. 
It would be the height of folly and absurdity to 
estimate their conclusions in matters of 
astronomy and astrology in the light of our own 
developments or achievements in those branches 
of knowledge. Modern decisions and_ con- 
clusions cannot be taken as criteria for judging 
the accuracy or otherwise of the ancient Hindu 
Astronomers. The extreme accuracy and 


XXIV 


precision to which we lay claim are often times 
questionable. It is true that no _ satisfactory 
agreement could be found between the writings 
of any two people even, in ancient books. But 
what of it? Do all modern calculations tally 
with each other? Certainly not. Take for 
instance the measurement of terrestrial lati- 
tudes. Each reference book, an authority in 
its own way, differs decidedly from the other. 
Bangalore is located on 13°, 12°57’and 12° 58'N. 
Lat; which of these is correct ? Therefore it 
is useless to reject the ancient methods of 
calculations completely, because they clash 
with ours and replace them entirely by those of 
modern times. 

Most of the theories of to-day are simply 
tentative ; they have not, as yet, been established. 
The statements of some of the astronomers are 
really ludicrous and excite sympathy in the 
hearts of sober men for such perverted views. 
Modern calculations alone cannot be accepted 
as correct or accurate (for astrological purposes) 
and the ancient ones rejected. Moreover the 
ancient Hindu astronomers dreaded — secular 
interference in matters of astronomy for 
astrological purposes. 

The ancient Maharishis were past masters 
of the first magnitude in almost all branches of 
knowledge. That they discoveved many 


XXV 


phenomena by mere observation alone cannot 
be vouchsafed. The plane of observation 
employed by them was certainly quite different 
from that of the modern scientists. The art of 
Yoga is peculiar to them. Not being satisfied 
with the nature of the phenomena revealed by 
glasses and other material objects, they dived 
deep into the unfathomable depths of Yoga by 
means of which they were able to see things in 
their reality, face to face. The first sutra in the 
Grahanirnaya Prakarana of the  Bhoutika 
Sutras is ‘“DarpanemithyaVadaha,” meaning 
that objects at a distance, viewed through glasses, 
always present forms, which really do not 
represent their true state or nature. This 
clearly suggests, that to get at truth, so far as 
the celestial and distant objects are concerned, 
we must view them by something other than 
glasses, as there are many media between them 
and the earth, whose refracting and dispersing 
powers, we do not know much about. Thus they 
had the gift of Yoga, the fragments of which we 
see even unto this day, which helped them to a 
great extent in their expeditions in unveiling the 
mysteries surrounding the phenomenon of the 
celestial bodies. 


» There may be still other causes for the 
existence of differences between modern and 
ancient astronomical observations. For instance 


XXVI1 


the eqnation of the Sun's centre according to the 
Indian tables is 2° 10%’ whereas according to 
modern observations it is only 1° 554’. Is the 
first figure wrong because it differs from the 
second ? It cannot be ; for “the eccentricity of the 
solar orbit on which the equation just mentioned 
depends was greater in former ages than it is 
at the present time because, of the consequence 
of natnral disturbances of planets." Hindn 
calculations require consideration of Hindu 
figures and tables and we have to consider 
Hindu methods alone in matters of Hindu 
Astrology. Prof. Wilson observes that " The 
Science of astronomy at present exhibits many 
proofs of accurate observation and deducef6én, 
highly creditable to the science of the Hindu 
Astronomers." Take for instance eclipses. The 
Hindu method yields as correct results as the 
modern method. 


The sciences of Hindn Astronomy and 
Astrology have got into disrepute by the igno- 
rance of the fake and quack astrologers and 
astronomers, whose mercenary nature make 
them impervious and indifferent to the grave 
responsibilities that lie on their heads, and such 
an attitude of these people is directly traceable 
to the lethargic mentality of many of our 
indolent Rajas and Maharajas who, while 
spending immense sums on_ useless and 


XXVN 


chimerical purposes, are completely deaf towards 
rehabilitating such useful sciences as astrology 
and astronomy. 


The perfection of predictive astrology 
among the ancient Hindus was really marvellous; 
and to-day, we have lost that power. Even with 
sound mathematical basis, our predictions are 
generally vague and indefinite—except for a few, 
made by the real experts in this science. Is it 
because, our inductive faculty is marred by the 
too much precision we aim at, or are we on the 
wrong tract. Are we not wasting much of our 
precious time by entering into profitless discus- 
sions and controversies as regards house division, 
ascrrbing rulerships to the so called newly 
discovered planets, finding the rationale of the 
significations of the different houses of the 
Zodiac, etc. The greater portion of our time 
must be devoted to the practical study of 
astrology. This requires a moderate knowledge 
of astrological calculations. For instance, in 
determining Ayurdaya, Maraka Grahas (death 
inflicting planets) and the time of death, we 
should ascertain the relative sources of strength 
and weakness of the different planets. This 
requires a fair knowledge of Shadbalas. And 
with our present knowledge in the predictive 
art, we do not require to be so precise as to 
find out .000067" of an Arc. We had better 


XXVU1 


maintain what can be termed “minute preci- 


sion", and then adopt “second precision”, 
after we have attained proficiency in the art of 
predictions consistent with our present precision 
in calculations. 

Bearing this in mind, if the reader goes 
through this volume, without any bias or prepos- 
session, he will really find much useful informa- 
tion presented in quite an intelligible manner. 
Throughout the book, in the examples worked 
out, fractions less than half a Ghati or 30" of Arc 
have been rejected. If the reader is patient 
enough he can consider the minutest divisions 
and maintain the degree of accuracy he wants 


In the determination of Madhya L&agnz 
(10th Bhava), the Hindus do not consider the 
Sidereal Time of Birth. Instead, the Sun's 
Sayana Longitude at birth moment and the 
interval between meridian-distance are taken 
and the Dasamabhava Longitude determined 
by considering the Sidereal Time of _ the 
ascension of the Rasimanas on the equator 
according to the prescribed rules. Besides, 
the Bhojya and Bhuktha portions of a sign 
are found out by the application of rule of 
three assuming that equal arcs ascend at equal 
times. These two are considered, by some 
recent writers as fallacies or errors. But they 
are not fallacies at all astrologically because, 


perhaps the ancients thought, that it would not 
make much difference, whether the ascension of 
Arc was calculated arithmetically or by more re- 
fined modern methods for astrological purposes. 
They had their own reasons which remain 
inexplicable to assume so many things, which 
look controvertible to-day. We have not the 
slightest justifiable ground to label them as 
incorrect and eulogise our own conclusions as 
eminently correct. We have lost the power of 
Yoga, we cannot see things face to face by 
physical aids. And hence we can neither 
depreciate the one nor appreciate the other. 
Each has its own faults and perfections and 
we must as far as possible adopt the Hindu 
method of calculations for applying Hindu 
astrological principles.

Dr. B. V. RAMAN 


CHAPTER I. 


THE 20DIAC AND THE PLANETARY SYSTEM 


1. The Zodiac.—It is a broad band or belt 
in thé heavens extending 9 degrees on either side 
of the ecliptic, and known to the Hindus as 
Bhachakra or the Circle of Light. It is a circle 
and as such it knows no beginning or end. In 
order to measure the distance, an arbitrary point 
is established, which is called the first point 
of Aries. The zodiac revolves once in a day 
on its axis, from east to west. 

2. The Ecliptic.—The ecliptic is the Sun's 
path. This is known as a@famandalaor Ravi 
marga in Sanskrit. It passes exactly through 
the centre of the zodiac longitudinally. 

3. The Signs of the Zodiac.—The ecliptic 
is divided into twelve equal compartments, the 
signs of the zodiac, each being thirty degrees in 


2 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


extent. Each sign has its own peculiar qualities 
attributed to it by the ancient Maharishis, 
after careful and profound observation and 
meditation. As already observed above, the 
commencement of the zodiac is reckoned from 
the first point of Aries. Each degree is divided 
into sixty minutes and each minute is further 
subdivided into sixty seconds, so that, the total 
extent of the zodiac is 21,600 minutes or 129,600 
seconds. 

4. The Constellations.—The ecliptic is 
marked by twenty-seven constellations or Nak- 
Shatras, often called lunar mansions, because 
the Moon is brought into special connection, 
with them, as traversing twenty-seven corstel- 
lations and making a complete round of the 
ecliptic in a lunar month. Each constellation 
contains four padas or quarters and each quarter 
is equal to 3%° of the celestial arc (rekha). In 
other words the whole zodiac consists of 108 
padas so that each constellation measures 
13° 20' of arc. The Rasis and the Nakshatras 
are both reckoned from the same point, viz., the 
zero degree of longitude of Mesha (Aries), i.e., 
the initial point of Mesha* (See Chap. II) is the 
first point of Aswini. 

5. The Planetary System.—The planetary 
system otherwise known as the solar system, 


* See Varaha Mihira's Brihat Jataka—English translation by 
Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao, B.A., M.R.A.S. 


THE PLANETARY SYSTEM 3 


headed by the most glorious Sun—the Jagat- 
chakshu—consists of seven important planets 
(including the Sun himself). All the planets, 
save the central luminary, are held by the gravi- 
tation of the Sun and they all revolve round 
him, the period of revolution varying with 
reference to each planet. Along with these 
are included Rahu and Kethu—considered 
as Aprakashakagrahas or shadowy planets; 
and moreover their importance does not seem 
to have been stressed upon by writers on 
Mathematical Astrology, for they partake of the 
characteristics of the signs which they occupy, 
whilst writers on Judicial Astrology, 
invatiably recognise their influences in the 
analysis of a horoscope. 


Saturn is the most distant planet from the 
earth ; Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury 
and the Moon, come next in the order of their 
distance* 

6. Rotation and Revolution.—These plane- 
tary orbs, which the ancients recognised as 
having powerful influences on the terrestrial 
phenomena, perform the double function of not 
only rotating on their own axes (Brahmana) 
from west to east, but also revolving round the 
Sain (Bhagana). The latter is comprehended 
in the astronomical nomenclature as the orbital 

* See Suryasiddbanta. 


4 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


revolution of the earth and the planets, which 
for the sake of simplicity, we have preferred to 
call as revolution. 


7. Velocities of Planets.—Each planet 
has its own rate of motion or velocity depending 
upon its nearness to or distance from the earth. 
For instance, the Moon is our nearest planet and 
consequently she has a very swift motion. She 
travels round the zodiac once in 30 lunar days ; 
whereas, Saturn who is the most distant from 
us, has got the slowest motion and accordingly 
performs one revolution round the ecliptic once 
in thirty years. The planets do not maintain 
a uniform rate of movement, for various causes. 
The following are the approximate périods 
taken by each planet to make a circuit round 
the zodiac. 


The Sun moves at the rate of roughly one 
degree a day or 3654 days for one complete 
revolution. The Moon takes 27 days 7 hours 
and odd for a similar circuit. Mars takes 18 
months for one revolution. Mercury fequires 
a similar period as the Sun but his closeness to 
the Sun makes Mercury rather unsteady with 
the result that he often takes 27 days to pass 
through one sign. Jupiter requires roughly twelve 
years for a circuit. Venus has more or less the 
same velocity as the Sun. And Saturn moves for 
thirty months in a sign. Rahu and Kethu take 


RETROGRESSION AND ACCELERATION ) 


18 months each in a sign or 18 years for a 
complete revolution. All the planets have savya 
or direct motion, while Rahu ard Kethu have 
Apasavya gathi, ie., they move from east to 
west.

The above information is culled out from 
an ancient astronomical work and the reader 
is referred to more advanced works on Astro- 
nomy for fuller and more detailed information. 


8. Retrogression and _  Acceleration.— 
When the distance of any one planet from 
the Sun exceeds a particular limit, it becomes 
retrograde, i.e, when the planet goes from 
perihelion (the point in a planet's orbit nearest 
to the Sun) to aphelion (the part of a planet's 
orbit most distant from the Sun) as it recedes 
from the Sun, it gradually loses the power 
of “the Sun's gravitation and consequently, 


6 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


to gain it, it retrogrades ; and when the planet 
comes from aphelion to perihelion, nearer and 
nearer to the Sun the gravitation of the Sun 
grows more and more powerful, so that the 
velocity of the planet is accelerated, 1e., the 
state of Athichara is entered into. Al the 
planets are subject to retrogression and 
acceleration excepting the Sun and the Moon, 
let alone the Aprakashakagrahas. Hence we 
find that there 1s no uniformity in the velocities 
of planets, that they are different at different 
parts of the orbits and that the planetary orbits 
are elliptical. The vakra, athichara, etc., are 
caused, according to Surya Siddhanta, by the 


invisible forces Seegrochcha, Mandochcha and 
Patha. 


The importance of vakra, etc., of planets, 
so far as it is necessary for astrological purposes 
will be dealt with in its proper place. Those 
who wish to soar into the higher regions of 
astronomy will do well to study such celebrated 
works as Surya Siddhanta, Panchasiddhantika, 
etc., of illustrious authors of yore, in whose 
luminous expositions of this celestial science, 
the inquiring mind is sure to find much more 
than what is sought for.

The above table may be interpreted thus. 
It will be seen that there are 27 constellations 
comprising the 12 signs. For instance, take 
Aries. You will find that 4 quarters of Aswini 
(13° 20’), 4 of Bharani (13° 20') and 1 of 
(3° 20') Krithika—on the whole 9 quarters 
constitute it. Again, the remaining 3 of 
Krithika (10°), the 4 of Rohini (13° 20') and 
2 (6° 40') of Mrigasira make up Taurus and 
so on. What use this table will be of, the reader 
will realise after he has gone through some 
more pages. For the present suffice it to say 
that he must be quite familiar with it in order 


10 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


to understand the information set forth in the 
subsequent chapters. 


Note.—In the characteristics of the signs 
and “planets which I am giving below, such 
information as has a direct bearing upon 
and involved in the mathematical calculations, 
has been included. All other details necessary 
for predictions, which can be gathered from any 
astrological ‘work has been scrupulously omitted. 


11. Movable Signs.—Aries, Cancer, Libra 
and Capricorn. 


12. Fixed Signs.—Taurus, Leo, Scorpio 
and Aquarius. 


13. Common Signs. — Gemini, Virgo, 
Sagittarius and Pisces. 


14. Odd Signs.—Aries, Gemini, Leo, 
Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius. 


15. Even Signs.—Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, 
Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces. 


16. Signs of Long Ascension.—Cancer, 
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius. 

17. Signs of Short Ascension.—Capri- 
cornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus and 
Gemini. 

18. Strodaya Signs.—(Rising by Head) 
Gemini, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and 
Aquarius. 


PECULIARITIES OF SIGNS 11 


19. Prustodaya Signs.—(Rising by hinder 
part) Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius and 
Capricorn. 

The Sirodaya signs excepting Gemini are 
powerful during the day. The Prustodaya signs 
including Gemini are powerful during the night. 
The former are also called the Nocturnal signs 
and the latter the Diurnal signs. Pisces forms a 
combination of the two and is called Ubhayodaya 
Rasi. 


20. Quadrants—-Kendras—1, 4,7 and 10. 

21. Trines.—Trikonas—l1, 5 and 9. 

22. Succeedent Houses.—Panaparas—2, 
5, 8and 11. 

23. Cadent Houses.—Apoklimas—3, 6, 9 
and 12 (9th being a trikona must be omitted). 


24. Oopachayas.—3, 6, 10 and 11. 


25. Planetary Ownerships.—Aries and 
Scorpio are ruled by Mars; Taurus and Libra 
by Venus; Gemini and Virgo by Mercury; Cancer 
by the Moon; Leo by the Sun; Sagittarius 
and Pisces by Jupiter and Capricorn and 
Aquarius by Saturn. 


25 a- Exaltations.—The Sun has his deep 
exaltation in the 10th degree of Aries ; Moon 3rd 
of Taurus; Mars 28th of Capricorn ; Mercury 
15th of Virgo; Jupiter 5th of Cancer; Venus 
27th of Pisces and Saturn 20th of Libra. 


12 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


26. Debilitations—The 7th house or the 
180th degree from the place of exaltation is the 
place of debilitation or fall. The Sun is debili- 
tated in the 10th degree of Libra, the Moon 3rd 
of Scorpio and so on. 

27. Good and Evil Planets.—Jupiter, 
Venus, Full Moon and well associated Mercury 
are good planets and New Moon, badly as- 
sociated Mercury, the Sun, Saturn and 
Mars are evil planets. From the 10th bright 
half of the Lunar month the Moon is full. He 
is weak from the 1|O0th of the dark half. 

28. Sexes.—Jupiter, Mars and the Sun 
are males: Venus and the Moon are females: 
and Mercury and Saturn are eunuchs. 

29. Moola Thrikonas. — Sun's Moola 
Thrikona is Leo(0°-20°); Moon—Taurus (4°-30°); 
Mercury—Virgo (16°-20°); Jupiter—Sagittarius 
(0°-13°); Mars—Aries (0°-18°); Venus—Libra 
(0°-10°) and Saturn—Aquarius (0°-20°). 

30. Planetary Relations.—By friendship 
we mean that the rays of the one planet will be 
intensified by those of the other, declared as his 
friend, while the same rays will be counteracted 
by a planet who is an enemy. 

Friendship will be both permanent (Nai- 
sargika) and temporary (Tatkalika). (Sée 
my “Potencies of Planets and Bhavas” for 
Tatkalika friendship).

The practical applicability of some of these 
characteristics of planets and signs will be

made perfectly clear in chapters dealing with 
the calculation of Shadbalas, Ayurdaya, etc. 


31. Karakas.—Each planet is supposed to 
be the karaka of certain events in life. Many 
function as producing, rather promoting the 
incidents ascribed to them.

32. Bhavas—These correspond roughly 
to the “ Houses" of Western Astrology. The 
most powerful point in a Bhava is tts Madhya 
Bhaga or mid-point whereas the first point is the 
most powerful in a “Western House." There 
are twelve Bhavas and each controls rather 
signifies certain important events and incidents.

33. The Astrological Measure. — The 
various sources of strength and weakness of the 
planets and Bhavas are estimated by certain 
units or measures. They are Rupas, Virupas 
and Prarupas. 60 prarupas are equal to 1 
Virupa and 60 Virupas make 1 Rupa. 


ASTRONOMICAL TERMINOLOGY 


34. The Axis and Poles of the Earth.— 
The axis of the earth is that diameter about 
which it revolves from west to east with a 
uniform motion. The poles of the earth are 
its points where its axis meets its surface and 
they are the North Pole and the South Pole. 


35. The Earth's Equator (Vishavarekha) 
This is an imaginary line running round the 
earth half way between the two poles. The 
equator divides the earth into a northern and 
a southern hemisphere. 


ASTRONOMICAL TERMINOLOGY 17 


36. The Latitude (Akshamsa).—The 
latitude of a place is its distance North or South 
of the equator, measured as an angle, on its 
own terrestrial meridian. It is reckoned in 
degrees, minutes and seconds from 0° to 90°, 
northwards or southwards according as the place 
lies in the northern or southern hemisphere. 


37. The Longitude (Rekhamsa).—The 
longitude of a place is its distance East or West 
of the meridian of Greenwich (Ujjain according 
to the Hindus) measured as an angle. It is 
expressed as so many degrees, minutes and 
seconds, East or West of Greenwich according to 
where the place lies. It is also reckoned in time 
at the' rate of 24 hours for 360° or 4 minutes for 
every degree. 


38. The Celestial Equator (Nadivritta).— 
This is a great circle of the celestial sphere 
marked out by the indefinite extension of the 
plane of the terrestrial equator. 


39. The Celestial Latitude (Kshepa).— 
This is the angular distance of a heavenly body 
from the ecliptic. 


40. The Declination (Kranti).—This is 
the angular distance of a heavenly body from 
the celestial equator. It is positive or negative 
according as the celestial object is situated in 
the northern or southern hemisphere.

CHAPTER III. 


THE AYANAMSA 


41. The Equinoctial Points.—The celes- 
tial equator and the ecliptic intersect each other 
in two points; because, twice a year the Sun 
crosses the equator. On these two days the 
duration of day and night will be equal all the 
world over. These two points are known as the 
equinoctial points or the Vernal Equinox and 
the Autumnal Equinox. 


42. Precession of the Equinoxes.—It has 
been observed and proved mathematically, that 
each year at the time when the Sun reaches his 
equinoctial point of Aries 0° when throughout 
the earth, the day and night are equal in length, 
the position of the earth in reference to some 
fixed star is nearly 50%” of space farther west 
than the earth was at the same equinoctial 
moment of the previous year. It is not merely 
the earth or the solar system, but the entire 
zodiac that is subjected to this westward motion. 
This slight increment—retrograde motion of the 
equinoxes—is known as the Precession of the 
Equinoxes. 


» 


43. Movable and Fixed Zodiacs.— We have 
seen from the above that the Vernal Equinox 


MOVABLE AND FIXED ZODIACS 19 


slips backwards from its original position— 
recognised as the star Revati—by the Hindus. 
The zodiac which reckons the first degree of Aries 
from the equinoctial point which has a precession 
every year is the Movable Zodiac—whilst, in 
the case of the Fixed Zodiac, the first degree of 
Aries begins from a particular star in the Revati 
group of stars which is fixed. The movable 
zodiac is also termed as the Zodiac of Signs 
while the fixed zodiac is known as the Zodiac 
of Constellations, as its signs are almost identical 
with the constellations bearing the same names. 

44. The Sayana and the Nirayana Systems. 
The system of astronomy which recognises the 
movable zodiac belongs to the Sayana_ school 
while that which considers the fixed zodiac is 
termed as the Nirayana system. The Sayana 
is the one employed by western astrologers for 
predictive purposes while the Hindu astrologers 
use the fixed zodiac. 


45. The Ayanamsa,—The distance bet- 
ween the Hindu First Point and the Vernal 
Equinox, measured at an epoch, is known as the 
Ayanamsa. 

46. Varahamihira’ s Observations.— Even 
Varahamihira, one of the most celebrated of 
anpient writers in India, perpetuates and carries 
on the teachings of his far more ancient pre- 
decessors in marking the distinction between the 


20 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


two zodiacs and referring all the astrological 
observations to the fixed zodiac. He states, that 
in his time, the summer solistice coincided with 
the first degree of Cancer, and the winter solistice 
with the first degree of Capricorn, whereas at 
one time the summer solistice coincided with the 
middle of the Aslesha. 

47. Exact date of Coincidence not known. 
The exact period when both the zodiacs 
coincided in the first point is not definitely 
known and accordingly the Ayanamsa—the 
precessional distance—varies from 19° to 23° . 
The star which marked the first point seems to 
‘have somehow disappeared though some believe 
that it is 11’ east of the star Pisces. A number 
of dates is given as the year of the coincidence, 
viz., 361 A.D.,498 A.D., 394 A.D., 397 A.D., 559 ALD., 
etc.; which to accept, and which to reject, has 
been a matter of considerable doubt. No definite 
proof is available in favour of any one of the 
dates given above. No amount of mere specu- 
lation would be of any use, especially in such 
matters. Some attribute these differences to the 
supposed errors in Hindu observations. What- 
ever they may be, it is not our purpose here 
to enter into any sort of discussion which 
would be purely of academical interest and 
absolutely outside our limits. As such without 
worrying the reader with the technicalities 


USE OF AYANAMSA 21 


involved in the discussion a most vital 
question like that of the Precession of the 
Equinoxes we shall directly enter into setting 
below, a simple method for ascertaining the 
Ayanamsa, which will serve the purpose of any 
scientific astrologer and which would enable the 
reader to thoroughly understand and follow the 
principles described in the following pages. 

48. Use of Ayanamsa.—The Indian adepts 
in the celestial science, realising, that the degrees 
of the fixed zodiac have a permanent relation 
with the star—points, and that the movable 
zodiac does not give us a definite position both 
for observation and experiment and to arrive at 
logical conclusions, have been advocating the 
Nirayana positions of planets for all predictive 
purposes, which should be arrived at after the 
necessary calculations are made according to 
Sayana and then the Ayanamsa subtracted from 
such positions. For astrological purposes, it 
would be quite sufficient, if we know howgto 
determine the Ayanamsa for any particular year. 
Since the object of this book is not to enter into 
any discussion about the superiority of this or 
that system, or the justification of adopting any 
particular value as the Ayanamsa, but to clearly 
describe and expound principles necessary for 
correct computation of a horoscope mathema- 
tically, according to the prescribed rules and 


22 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


determine the various sources of strength and 
weakness of planets and discover other details 
that, are within the reach of mathematical 
astrology and thus clear the way for making 
correct predictions, we do not, propose to lay 
any further stress on this question of Ayanamsa. 


The Longitudes of the Houses (Bhava 
Sphutas), Rasimanas (Oblique Ascensions) and 
other important calculations are all computed 
for Sayana Rasis. From these the Ayanamsa 
is subtracted and thus the Nirayana Bhavas, 
etc., are obtained. In other words, every one 
of the Hindu astrological calculations which is 
at first based upon the Sayana Rasis, iseeven- 
tually subjected to Nirayana reduction. All 
these indicate the absolute necessity for Aya-

AYANAMSA FOR ODD DAYS 23 


The slipping back of the movable zodiac 
in a year is so small that for odd days, we can 
conveniently neglect it. But the Ayanamsa 
for the moment can be determined by consider- 
ing the precession for the odd days also. 


CHAPTER IV. 
RASIMANAS 


50. Geographic and Geocentric Latitudes. 
The latitudes of places marked in any ordinary 
atlas are the geographical latitudes. Because 
they are calculated on the supposition that the 
earth is a perfect sphere, while on the other 
hand, the flattened ends at the two poles, make 
it aspheriod, so that, the latitude measured from 
the true centre of the spheriod, is the geocentric 
latitude. For astrological purposes, it would be 
hardly worthwhile making any _ distinction 
whatever between the geocentric and geographic 
latitude of a place. For instance, the geogra- 
phic latitude of Bangalore is 12° 57’ and its 
geocentric 12° 52'. We can adopt the former 
alone for astrological calculations. 


51. Rasimanas.—Rasimanas mean _ the 
rising periods of the twelve signs of the zodiac. 
It is impossible to find out the actual Lagna 
(Ascendant) in a horoscope or the different 
Bhavas (Houses) or the sunrise and sunset in any 
place without a knowledge of the Rasimanas,,. 
which vary from Akshamsa _ (latitude) ‘¢o 
Akshamsa. It must be noted that the Rasimana 
is always given Sayana (with precession), that is 


CHARAKHANDAS 25 


to say, the time of oblique ascension is computed 
for the signs of the movable zodiac. From this 
is subtracted the Ayanamsa and the appropriate 
time of oblique ascension and thus is gdt the 
Nirayana Rasimana. If the division of the zodiac 
into 12 signs be taken to commence from the 
equinoctial point, their rising periods for any 
particular place will not vary from year to year. 
52. Charakhandas.—The duration of the 
signs of the zodiac varies in the different degrees 
of latitude which can be ascertained by the 
Charakhandas (ascensional differences) of the 
particular latitude. Say, for instance, two men 
are born at the same time, one in Bangalore 
and *the other in Berlin. Their latitudes are 
different. The rising periods of the signs in 
Bangalore must be quite different from those 
in Berlin. The sunrise and sunset in both 
the places cannot be the same. Therefore the 
rising periods in the different latitudes must be 
definitely known before casting a horoscope. 


These Charakhandas, (ascensional differ- 
ences) referred to above, in Indian sidereal 
time, the unit of which is an Asu (which is the 
equivalent of four seconds in English sidereal 
time) are, in accordance with certain definite 
rules, added to or subtracted from, the time 
of the Right Ascension (Dhruva) of the 
various Sayana_ Rasis, in order to get their 


26 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


Oblique Ascension (Chara). Since the Chara 
(period of oblique ascension) and the Dhruva 
{period of right ascension) are identically the 
same* for the Vishavarekha (equinoctial latitude) 
the ascensional difference is zero (shunya) for all 
the places situated on the equator. The ascen- 
sional difference is the same, in respect of the 
same sign, for places situated in the same latitude. 

To be more clear, the rising periods on the 
equator where the Charakhanda is zero—being 
known, it is possible to calculate the Rasimanas 
for any latitude, provided, its Charakhandas 
are also known. 


53. Rising Periods on the Equator.--The 
rising periods of the zodiacal signs reckoned 
from Sayana Mesha are thus distributed on the 
equator (O° latitude.) "

Taurus Leo 1725 Scorpio Aquarius 
*Gemini Cancer 1931 Sagittarius Capricorn 


(6 Asus = 1 Vighatika = 24 Seconds.

The above means that it takes for Aries, 
Virgo, Libra and Pisces, 1674 Asus or 4 Gh. 39 
Vig. to rise at the eastern horizon on the equator 
and so on. : 
54. Determination of Rasimanas.—From 
or to the rising periods on the equator, the 


DETERMINATION OF RASIMANAS 27 


Charakhandas of the required place from Aries 
to Gemini and from Capricorn to Pisces are 
subtractive* and from Cancer to Virgo and 
from Libra to Sagittarius are additive. That 
is, in the case of from Aries to Gemini and from 
Capricorn to Pisces, subtract the Charakhandas 
and from Cancer to Virgo and from Libra to 
Sagittarius add the Charakhandas of the required 
place and the rising periods of signs there, are 
obtained. These must be applied to any one 
of four triads as given above, into which the 
zodiacal signs are divided—commencing always 
from the Sayana Mesha, i.e., the first 30° from 
the equinoctial point.

ascension in N. Latitudes are signs of long 
ascension in S. latitudes. 


CHAPTER V. 
SUNRISE AND SUNSET 


56. Apparent Time of Rising and Setting 
of the Sun.—The exact moment when the Sun 
first appears at the eastern horizon of a place is 
the time of sunrise there. Since the Sun has a 
definite diameter, the interval between the 
moment of the appearance of the.first ray at 
the horizon, and the moment at which the Sun 
is just clear off the horizon, is some 5 or 6 
minutes. If this is so, which represents the 
exact moment of sunrise ? It has been acknow- 
ledged that it 1s the moment at which the centre 
of the solar disc rises at the eastern horizon, that 
marks the sunrise at the particular place. It must 
also be noted that on account of the refraction 
of the solar rays, due to the various strata 
enveloping the earth, the Sun is not really at the 
horizon when he appears to be so but is really 
below the horizon by about a few minutes of 
arc (Rekha). But we can take the apparent time 
as almost correct and need not worry ourselves 
with the so called delicate correct time of rising. 


57. Apparent Noon.—This is marked 
when the centre of the Sun ts exactly on the 


AH AS AND RATRI 31 


meridian of the place. The apparent noon is 
almost the same for all places. 


58. Ahas and Ratri.—Ahas is the duration 
of the day, i.e., the duration of time, from sunrise 
to sunset, and Ratri, is the duration of time, from 
sunset to sunrise. On the equator, the Ahas 
and Ratri are always 30 ghatis or 12 hours 
each, while in other latitudes, the sum of Ahas 
and Ratri will be 24 hours, whereas the interval 
between sunrise and sunset and _ vice versa, 
varies, this variation depending upon the decli- 
nation of the Sun and the latitude of the place. 


The duration of Ratri in a place expressed 
in arc corresponds to the Sun's nocturnal arc 
and that of the day to his diurnal arc. If we 
knew either of these arcs, we could find out 
sunrise and sunset. 


In dealing with the question of the Preces- 
sion of the Equinoxes, we have called attention 
to the fact that on the days when the Sun 
occupies the equinoctial points, ie., twice a 
year, he is visible for 12 hours at all places and 
invisible for a similar period. On these two 
days the declination (kranti) of the Sun is zero. 


During his northerly course, when he will 
haye a north declination, the duration of days is 
longer than that of nights, i.e., he is visible for 
longer periods in north latitudes, while the 


32 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


reverse holds good for south latitudes. During 
his southerly course, when he will have a south 
declination, the duration of days is longer than 
that ‘of nights in’ south latitudes, and_ the 
reverse holds good for north latitudes. 


59. Hindu Method of Determination of 
Sunrise and of Sunset.—First of all note the 
latitude of the place for which sunrise and 
sunset are to be determined and then its chara- 
khandas. Find out the position of Nirayana 
Sun* at approximate sunrise on that day. This 
can be done from any local reliable almanac. 
(See Chapter VII for determining longitndes of 
planets). 


To this add Ayanamsa and the Sayana Ravi 
at sunrise is obtained: or the position of the 
Sayana Sun can be obtained by means of any 
modern ephemeris in which the positions of 
planets are to be found for Greenwich Mean 
Noon. By converting the approximate time 
(local) of sunrise to Greenwich mean time, the 
position of Sayana Surya—for sunrise can be 
found out. (See Chapter VI for Conversion of 
Time). Then find out the Bhnja (distance from 
the nearest equinoctial point) as follows :— 

If the Sayana longitude of the Sun be less 

than 90° (¢.e., the first three signs) ‘it 


*The solar date marked in the Hindu almanacs may be roughly taken 
as representing Sun's Nirayana longitude at sunrise on the 
particular day. 


DETERMINATION OF BHUJA 33 


itself represents the Sun's Bhuja; if it 
is more than 90° and less than 180°, 
subtract it from 180° and the result is 
Bhuja; if it is more than 180° anedless 
than 270° (4.e., more than 6 signs and 
less than 9 signs) subtract 180° from 
the Sun's sayana longitude, the result 
represents Bhuja; and if the sayana 
longitude of the Sun is more than 270° 
and less than 360° (more than 9 signs 
and less than 12 signs) subtract it from 


360° and the result is Bhuja of the Sun. 


If the Sun's sayana longitude is—Bhuja is 
(1) between 0° 90° Sun's sayana long itself.

(3)¢ | = 180 270 Sun's sayana long—180 
(4) » 270 360 360°—Sun’s sayana long. 


The Charakhandas given in three numbers 
are called the Adi (first), Madhya (middle) and 
Anthya (last) Charakhandas. The Adichara- 
khanda itself will be the first khanda ; this plus 
the madhya, the second khanda; and the sum 
of the three (Charakhandas), the third khanda. 

Now divide the Bhuja (if it is more than 
30°) by 30. The quotient represents the 
khanda. Keep the remainder as it is and then 
apply the rule :-— 

As 30 degrees : the remainder ‘ + the Charakhanda 
(Madhya, if Bhuja ts more than 30° and less than 
60° and Anthya if it is more than 60° and less 
than 90°) : the required quantity. 


34 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


This required quantity must be added 
to the equivalent of the khanda represented by 
the quotient obtained by dividing the Bhuja 
by 3G. The result is chara. 

lf the Bhuja is less than 30° then apply the 
rule :— 

As 30 degrees : the degree (represented by Bhuja) : - 

the Adicharakhanda : the required quantity. 

Then the required quantity itself will be chara. 

lf the Sayana Sun is in Uttara (north) 
Gola (hemisphere), i.e., from Aries to Virgo, 
add chara to [5 ghatis (6 hours). If he is in the 
Southern Gola (from Libra to Pisces) subtract 
this from 15 ghatis. The result is Dinardha 
(half diurnal duration). Twice this is the length 
of day. This deducted from 60 ghatis (24 hours) 
gives the length of night. Convert Dinardha 
into hours, etc., and add and subtract this figure 
to and from 12 noon. The apparent time of 
sunset and of sunrise respectively of the place 
are bbtained.

MODERN METHOD 37 


I have given above the Hindu method of 
finding out the apparent time of sunrise and of 
sunset. Some say, that this method is riddled with 
certain errors. I have spoken sufficiently about 
the supposed errors that have crept into Hindu 
calculations in the Introduction to this book. I 
shall also give below, the modern method of the 
calculation of sunrise and of sunset and the 
reader can adopt whichever he prefers. I shall 
apply this method to the examples worked out for 
the Hindu method so that the results in both 
the cases may be compared. Those who want 
to adopt the Hindu method may do so: and 
those who are in a position to work out problems 
in trifonometry may employ the modern method. 


60. Modern Method of Determination of 
Apparent Time of Sunrise and of Snnset.-* First 
convert the local approximate time of sunset (or 
sunrise) into Greenwich Mean Time (see next 
Chapter) for which ascertain Sun's declination 
from the Ephemeris. Note down the latitude 
of the place and apply the following formula. 

Log. Tan. Dec. of Sun + Log. Tan. Lat. of place 

= Log. Sin. Ascensional Difference. 


Subtract ascensional difference from 90° if Dec. is 
South and add Asc. difference to 90° if Dec. is 
North. 
* (The reverse holds good for places in south latitudes). 
* There is a slight difference between the results obtained accordin 


to Hindu and modern methods which may be safely overlooke 
for astrological purposes, 


38 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


Convert the resulting degrees into hours, minutes, 
etc., at 15°=] hour. The result is local apparent 
time of setting. This subtracted from 12 hours 

e. gives local apparent time of sunrise. 


Example 7—Find the apparent time of sunrise and ‘of 
sunset at a place on 13° N. Lat. and 5h. 10m. 20s. 


E. Long. on 16th October 1918. 

Approximate time of sunset=6 PM. 

This converted to G.M.T. H. M. S. 
(Greenwich Mean Time) = 12 49 40 (P.M,) 

The difference between Greenwich Mean Noon and 
G. M. T. is only 49 m. 40 seconds. Therefore, 
we may take the declination of the Sun at 
G. M.N. on 16th October. The declination may 
be determined for 12h. 49m. 40s. or 12-50 P.M. 
by considering Sun's motion (in dec.) in 24 
hours and thus his proportional motion for 50 m.

latitude is 36° N. and Long. 90° E. 
Approximate time of sunset=6 PM. 
This converted into G.M.T.= 12 noon. 
Since G.M.T. corresponding to 6 P.M. has become 
the same as Greenwich Mean Noon, we may take 


the declination of the Sun at G.M.T. on 7th 
January.

“12h—-4h. 49m. 568.=7h. 10m. 4s.=Local

61. Equation of Time.—This is the differ- 
ence between Mean Time and Apparent Time. 
We obtain by the above methods the apparent 
time of sunrise. For this must be applied the 
equation of time in order to get the mean 
time, i.e. 


Equation of Time=Mean Time — Apparent Time at 
any moment. 
(vice versa if A.T. is >M.T.) 


40 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


The equation of time at a moment is positive 
or negative according as the apparent time 
is less or greater than Mean Time. 


62. Method of the Determination of 
Equation of Time to get, Mean Time from 
Apparent Time.—From any ephemeris find 
the Sidereal Time and the longitude (sayana) of 
the Sun for the G.M.N. or the G.M.T. 
corresponding to the approximate time of 
sunrise or sunset at the required place, on the 
required date. Find the Sidereal Time at which 
this particular degree (of Sun's sayana longitude 
referred to above) is on the cusp of the tenth- 
house of Greenwich or any place. This will, give 
the Right ascension expressed in time of the 
Sun ; or we shall call this, for the sake of con- 
venience, the Sun Time. Take the difference 
between the Sidereal Time and the Sun Time, 
and this represents the Equation of Time.* 


If the Sun Time is less than the Sidereal 
Time, the Equation of Time must be subtracted 
from the Apparent Time (of sunrise or of sunset) 
in order to obtain the Local Mean Time of rising 
or of setting). If the Sidereal Time is less than 
Sun Time, add the Equation of Time for 
obtaining the Local Mean Time. 


Example 9.— Find the Equation of Time on _ 16th 
* It will do if the Equation of Time is found out for G.MN.

44 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


Those who are not familiar with the 
method of consulting the trigonometrical and 
Logarthmic Tables, a knowledge of which is 
essefitial for applying modern methods are 
requested to adopt the following rules :— 


1. Calculate the Apparent Time of sunrise 
and of sunset according to the Hindu 
method (as given in Article 59). 


2. Then instead of working’ out the 
problem for ascertaining the Equation 
of Time, the reader may conveniently 
find out the Equation of Time by 
referring to Table III, given at the end 
of the book. P 


3. Then apply this Equation of Time to 
get the Mean Time of sunrise and of 
sunset by adopting the rules contained 
in Article 63. 


CHAPTER VI. 
MEASURE AND CONVERSION OF TIME 


65. Hindu Chronology.—The division of 
time is peculiar to the Hindus. It begins 
with a Tatpara and ends in a Kalpa (equal to 
4,320,000,000 Sidereal years). The Hindu day 
(an apparent solar day) begins from sunrise 
and ends with the next sunrise. The division 
of time is thus— 


60 Tatparas = 1 Para 
60 Paras = 1 Vilipta 
60 Viliptas = 1 Liptha 
60 Lipthas = 1 Vighati 
60 Vighatis = 1 Ghati 
60 Ghatis = 1 Day. 


I shall also introduce to the reader the 
three kinds of days now in vogue, though it is 
not worthwhile wasting any time over remem- 
bering them. 


(a) Sidereal Day.—This is equal to 23 h. 
and 56m. of Mean Solar Time. This 
is known as Nakshatra Dina among 
the Hindus and this is the time the 
fixed stars take to come round the 
Pole once. 


46 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


(b) Apparent Solar Day.—This is known 
as the Savana Dina. This is longer 
than the Sidereal day by about four 
minutes. 

(c) Mean Solar Day.—This is reckoned by 
considering the average length of all 
the days in a year. 

Two kinds of months are generally in 
vogue among the Hindus, viz., Chandramana 
and Souramana. The Chandramana is based 
upon the movements of the Moon in the celestial 
circle. The Solar month is the time, the Sun 
takes to move in one sign. The month varies 
in duration according to the number of 
days the Sun takes to move in a sign. When 
the Sun enters into the new sign during 
the course of the lJlunation, the month 
is intercalary (Adhika Masa) and is baptised by 
the name of that which precedes or succeeds it 
with some prefix to distinguish it from the 
regular month. 

The “Hindus have a Solar rather Sidereal 
year, which is their astronomical year, and a 
Lunar year which is their civil year. 

‘The lengths of the various years are as 
follows according to modern calculations :—

LOCAL MEAN TIME 47 


66. Local Mean Time.—The local mean 
time of birth is very essential for the calcula- 
tion of the horoscope. When the Sun is 
crossing the meridian of any place, it is Cfwelve 
o'clock or midday at that place according to 
"Local Time". It is noon of local time on 
any day when the Sun reaches its highest point 
in the day. It is to be specially noted that the 
time shown by clocks and watches at any 
particular day is hardly the correct local mean 
time. Such times are subject to rectification by 
observing the course of events in one's life. Great 
care should be taken to see that watches and 
clocks, from which birth-times are recorded are 
accurate. Therefore, the first thing is to ascertain 
the correct local mean time of birth. The local 
mean time of a place depends upon its longitude, 
evidently terrestrial. In all Hindu astrological 
calculations the meridian of Ujjain was being 
taken when reckoning time or longitude, but now 
Greenwich is taken as the centre for such pur- 
poses. The local time of a place (L.M.T.) say 
4 degrees east of Greenwich, will be 16 minutes 
later than Greenwich Mean Time (G.M.T.) 
In other words, if it is 12 noon at Greenwich, 
it will be 12h. 4m. (P.M.) in a place 1° E. to it, 
11,56 A.M. in a place 1° W. to it and so on. 


To reduce longitude into time, simply 
divide the number of degrees, minutes, etc., by 


48 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


I5 and the quotient will be the time. For 
instance, the longitude of Bangalore is 77° 35' 
East of Greenwich. Dividing this by 15 we get 
5h.°10m. 20s. The place being East of 
Greenwich, it will be 5h. 10m. 20s. (P.M.) at 
Bangalore—(otherwise termed as L.M.T.)when 
it is 12 noon at Greenwich or 8h. 10m. 20s. 
(P.M.) when it is 3 P.M. at Greenwich and so on. 


The local mean time can be obtained by 
adding to or subtracting from the Greenwich 
Mean Time, four minutes to every degree of 
longitude, according as the place is East or 
West of Greenwich. 


The L.M.T. always  sychronises with the G.M.T. 


L.M.T.=G.M.T. + Longitude 

ns 1a” 
+ if the place is East of Greenwich. 
— if the place is West of Greenwich. 


Example 13.—-Whatis the L.M.T. of a place at Long. 78° 
West when it is 12 noon at Greenwich ? 


0 
L.M.T.=12 noon—- i572 noon—5h.12m. 


=6h. 48 m. (A.M) 
(—because place is West of Greenwich). 


67. Standard Time.—It is usual to choose 
for each country, or for each part of a large 
country, a standard time for use over the whole 
country. This standard time, as a rule, is the 
local time of some most important town in the 


STANDARD TIME 49 


country. If the birth is recorded in L.M.T. 
well and good; otherwise, the Standard Time of 
the country must be converted into the Local 
Mean Time. The time when Standard Zimes 
were introduced into different countries must be 
ascertained (See Table IV). In India Standard 
Time was introduced on 1-7-1905 andit is about 
5h. and 30 m. past (in advance) of Greenwich 
Mean Time. Before this, probably the Sun Dial 
Time was in existence, in which case, this can 
be converted into L.M.T. by applying the 
Equation of Time (as applied to sun dial time). 
For births that have occurred after 1-7-1905, if 
the time is recorded in Standard Time, it must 
be cqnverted into L.M.T. Generally our clocks 
show Standard Time. For instance, Bangalore 
is Sh. 10m. 20s. East of Greenwich; when 
it is noon at Greenwich the L.M.T. at Bangalore 
is 5h. 10 m. 20s. (P.M.) whilst the clock at this 
time shows 5h. 30m. P.M. (Standard Time). 


L.M.T. = Standard Time + Difference between local 
and standard longitudes 
(expressed in time) 

+ if local longitude is > Std. Long. 

— if local longitude is <

It is customary among the Hindus to mention 
the time of birth as ‘“Suryodayadi Jananakala 
Ghatikaha”’, i.e., the number of ghatis passed 
from sunrise up to the moment of birth. First 
ascertain the local mean time of birth and 
of sunrise and then apply the following rule. 
(24 seconds=l vighati; 24 minutes=1 ghati; 1 hour= 
23 ghatis.) :

GRAHA SPHUTAS 
(PLANETARY LONGITUDES) 


70. Hindu Almanac.—It requires a con- 
siderable amount of familiarity with the 
advanced portions of astronomical principles, in 
order to find out the longitudes of planets 
independently, i.e., without reference to any 
almanac. As such I have reserved discretion 
to expound those principles in a separate book, 
and for the present, simply describe the method 
commonly adopted by all astrological students 
and adepts. Any reliable almanac will serve 
our purpose. There are still a few standard 
Panchangas (almanacs) which can be trusted for 
astrological purposes. 


71. Method of Making Graha Sphutas.— 
If the panchanga is available for the place of 
birth then no trouble of conversion of time Is 
involved ; otherwise, birth time must be convert- 
ed into local time of the place, for which the 
almanac is calculated, in order to find out the 
planetary positions. 


Find out the date of the birth in the 
almanac and note down all the details given for 


PLANETARY LONGITUDES 53 


that day. If no planets are marked on the day 
of birth, then trace back and find out the position 
of the planet on the date, nearest to that of birth. 
It will be found that the planet's position will have 
been marked in Nakshatras (Constellations) and 
Padas (Quarters), with time of entry in ghatis 
into the particular Pada. Find out the time 
at which the same planet enters the next quarter 
of the constellation. Mark the interval in ghatis 
between the entry of the planet into these two 
quarters. Mark also the interval between the 
first entry and the birth time and proceed as 
follows :— 


Formula (a) For all Planets. 
The interval between the first entry and birth 


x 34 


= The number of degrees traversed in that particular 
quarter. 
Formula (b) For the Moon. 


The interval between entry into the 1st degree of 
the sign and birth

Add this to the number of degrees the planet has 
passed, up to the first entry. Its Nirayana 
longitude is obtained.

This distance, the Sun has passed in the second pada or 

quarter of Chitta. We know that the last three 
quarters of Uttara, the four of Hasta and the 
first two of Chitta constitute Kanya (Virgo). Up 
to the second of Chitta, the number of quarters 
passed in Virgo is:—

LAGNA SPHUTA 


(THE ASCENDANT) 


73. Lagna or Ascendant-—Lagna or the 
ascendant is that point of the cliptic, which is at 
any time on the eastern horizon, and is expressed 
in signs, degrees, etc., of Stellar Aries. 


74. Solar Months.~-The earth is egg- 
shaped and rotates once in a day on its axis 
from west to east, and thus, all the zodiacal signs 
are invariably exposed to the solar influence. 
The twelve solar months are named after the 
twelve zodiacal signs. On the first day of Aries 
the first degree of that particular sign is at 
the eastern horizon, and the remaining signs 
are gradually exposed till the next day when at 
the sunrise, the second degree of Aries will 
be at the eastern horizon. The sunrise 
takes place on the last degree of the Zodiac 
in the 30th day of Pisces when the solar year 
closes, i.e., the Lagna is that particular place or 
point, which is on the eastern horizon at any 
particular time. The sunrise determines the 
Udaya Lagna and the degree and the sign in 
which the Sun rises, will be the Ascendant at 
that moment. 


58 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


75. Determination of Lagna.—First find 
out the true Nirayana position of the Sun and 
add the Ayanamsa to it sothat the Sun's Sayana 
Longitude is obtained. Ascertain the sign of 
the ecliptic the Sun is in, the degrees he has 
traversed in it, and those he has yet to pass 
through. The number of degrees he has gained 
are the Bhukthamsas, and those to cover, the 
Bhogyamsas. Now from the Rasimanas of the 
place, find out the Bhogya Kala, i.e., the time 
required to pass through the Bhogyamsas, thus: 


Formula (a) 


Period of rising sign where the Sayana Sun is 
__§_——_———_ Bhogyamsas 


30° = Bhogya‘Time. 
Now from the Iskta@ Kala (the time for 
which the Lagna is to be found) subtract the 
Bhogya time and from the remainder subtract 
the periods of rising of the next successive signs 
as long as you can. Then at last you will find the 
sign, the rising period of which being greater than 
the remainder, you will not be able to subtract and 
which is consequently called the Ashuddha sign 
and its rising period the Ashuddha rising. _ It is 
evident that the Ashuddha sign is of course on 
the horizon at the given time. The degrees of 
the Ashuddha sign which are above the horizon, 
are the passed degrees and hence called the 
Bhuktha—are thus found.—

known as the Madhya Lagna. It is on the 
correct determination of this that rests the 
entire fabric of the horoscope. In fact, all the 
other Bhavas (Houses) are very easily arrived at, 
after the longitude of the Dasama Bhava has 
been definitely ascertained. In the astronomical 
language, the Madhya Lagna may be described, 
as the culminating point of the ecliptic on the 
meridian. Astrologically speaking, the Dasama 
Bhava plays a very important part in the profes- 
sion, rather the means of livelihood of a person— 
otherwise known as Karma. 


78. Rasi Chakra—A broad distinction 
must be maintained between the Rasi Chakra 
(see Art. 76) and the Bhava Chakra (see Art. 81) 
so that the reader does not mistake the one for 
the other. The Rasi Chakra is simply a figure 
of the Fixed Zodiac with the limits and occu- 
pants of its 12 signs as well as Lagna clearly 
marked. Each sign is just one-twelfth part of 
the zodiac made up of 30 ecliptic degrees. 


62 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


79. Erroneous Conception of Bhava 
Chakra——The conception prevalent amongst 
some astrologers, that after the Lagna Sphuta 
has been made, the other Bhavas can be easily 
determined, by assuming, that the influence of 
Lagna extends 15° on either side and then com- 
mence the succeeding and the preceding Bhavas, 
is erroneous, wholly unscientific and equally 
misleading: for, by doing so, we will be ignoring 
completely the importance of the variation of 
the influence with regard to each degree and 
minute of terrestrial latitude and longitude, let 
alone other things of more serious importance. 
In other words, the Rasi Chakra is passed off 
for the Bhava Chakra and _ accordingly the 
predictions made. 

The reader is now aware of the definition 
of the Rasi Chakra and from what follows on 
the definition of the Bhava Chakra, he will 
realise the blunder, one would commit, if he took 
the former for the latter and the consequences 
that would inevitably follow. 


80. Bhaskara’s Definition.— Bhaskara- 
charya, describes a Bhava Chakra thus. " The 
point where the ecliptic cuts the horizon in the 
East is known as the Rising Lagna, and the 
point where the ecliptic cuts the horizon in the 
West is known as the Setting Lagna and the 
points where the meridian of the place cuts the 


MID-HEAVEN DETERMINATION 63 


ecliptic are known as the Zenith Lagna and the 
Nadir Lagna." 

81. Bhava Chakra.—This is an unequal 
marking of the ecliptic into twelve djvisions 
(Houses) with reference to the latitude of the 
place and the moment of birth. (See next Chap- 
ter for the definition of a House). The Bhava 
Sphutam involves elaborate processes such as 
the determination of the limits—cusps of the 
various Bhavas (Houses)—comprehended as 
Bhava Sandhis and other details connected 
with them, which evidently form the subject 
matter of the succeeding chapter. 

82. Method of Determination of the Mid- 
heaven.—The interval between the midday and 
the time of the day indicated by the position of 
the Sun is termed as Natha, i.e., the meridian- 
distance. This Natha may be either Prag, i.e., 
eastern or Paschad, t.e., western. It is Prag 
between midnight and midday and Paschad 
between midday and midnight. The Prag 
Natha comprehends two conditions : viz., 

(1) the distance between the Sun and the 
Meridian when the birth occurs after 
sunrise; and 

(2) the distance between the Meridian and 
the Sun when the birth occurs before 
sunrise, i.e., when the Sun is still below 
the eastern horizon: 


64 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


Similarly the Paschad Natha also includes 
two cases, viz., 

(1) the distance between the Meridian and 
the Sun if the birth happens within 
sunset and 

(2) the distance between the Meridian and 
the Sun after he has set. Natha when 
subtracted from 30 ghatis gives 
Unnatha. 

Here it must be noted that Meridian refers 
to apparent noon and the Sun refers to the birth 
time. 

After clearly understanding the meaning and 
significance of the words Natha and Unnatha, 
ascertain, if the birth has fallen in Pragnatha 
or Paschadnatha: In Pragnatha, 


(a) If the birth has occurred after sunrise, 
deduct the birth time from Dinardha 
(half-diurnal duration). 

(6) If it has occurred before sunrise add 
Dinardha to the ghatis elapsed from 
the birth time up to sunrise. 


The result in both the cases is Pragnatha, 
4.¢., Pragnatha is indicated by the time elapsed 
between birth-moment and local apparent noon. 
In Paschadnatha, 

(a) If the birth has taken place in the after- 

noon and before sunset, deduct Dinar- 
dha from the birth time (in ghatis). 


MID-HEAVEN 65 


(b) If the birth has occurred after sunset, 
add Dinardha to the interval befween 
sunset and birth moment; the duration 
of paschadnatha is obtained. 

The above observations may be summarised 

thus :— 
Rule 71.—When Birth is between Midnight and Midday. 


(a) Dinardha — Suryodayadi Jananakala Ghatikaha = 
Pragnatha Period. 
(b) Dinardha 4- interval between birth and sunrise = 


Pragnatha Period. 
Rule 2.—When Birth is between Midday and Midnight. 


(a) Suryodayadi Jananakala Ghatikaha—Dinardha = 
Paschadnatha Period. 

(b) Dinardha 4- interval between sunset and birth = 
Paschadnatha Period. 


Rule,3.—30Ghatis — Natha = Unnatha. 


Example 19.—Find the nature of the Natha and its 
duration in the Standard Horoscope. 


It comes under " birth between midday and midnight " 
and Rule 2 (a) can be applied to it as the birth 
has occurred after midday and before sunset.

logical purposes,

CHAPTER X. 


BHAVA SPHUTA 
(LONGITUDES OF HOUSES) 


83. Bhava or House.—According to the 
Hindus a Bhava means one-third of the arc of 
the ecliptic intercepted betwcen any two 
adjacent angles, viz., the Udaya Lagna (Eastern 
Horizon), the Patala Lagna (The Lower meri- 
dian), the Asta Lagna (Western Horizon), and 
the Madhya Lagna (Upper Meridian). 


84. Bhava Madhyas.—The points of 
trisection of the ecliptic arcs referred to above 
are the Bhava Madhyas or the mid-points of the 
Bhavas. 


85. Kendra Bhavas.—These are the four 
angular houses in a horoscope, viz., the Udaya 
Lagna, the Pathala Lagna, the Asta Lagna and 
the Madhya Lagna, (Article 83) and they are 
considered very important astrologically. 


86. Determination of Kendra Bhavas.— 
The preceding two chapters deal exhaust- 
ively with the method of determining the Ascen- 
dant and the Mid-heaven—two of the Kendra 
Bhavas. The Asta Lagna (Descendant or 


NON-ANGULAR HOUSES 69 


Western Horizon) and the Pathala or Rasajhala 
Lagna (Lower Meridian) are determined thus: — 


Rule 1.—Udaya Lagna (Ascendant or East Horizon) + 
180° = Asta Lagna (Descendant or West Plorizon.) 


Rule 2.—MadhyaLagna + 180° = Rasathala Lagna. 
(Upper Meridian) + 180° =(Lower Meridian). 


Example 22.—\determinethe Longitudes of the Asta Lagna 
and Pathala Lagna in the Standard Horoscope ?

“. Asta Lagna 114° 57! 
Pathala Lagna = 34° 55! 


87. Non-Angunlar Houses.—These are the 
houses between the angular ones. For instance 
angular houses are the I (Eastern Horizon)—IV 
(Lower Meridian)—VII (Western Horizon)— 
and X (Upper Meridian). The rest, viz., II, III, 
V,VI, VII, 1X, XI and XII are the Non-angular 
houses otherwise known as the Panapara Bhavas 
(Succeedent Houses), and the Apoklima Bhavas 
(Cadent NHouses)—see Articles 22 and 23. 
The Madhyas of these bhavas are the points of 
trisection referred to above (Articles 83 and 84). 

88. Determination of Bhava Madhyas of 
Npn-angular Houses.—There are four angles in 
a Bhava Chakra. First ascertain—rather deter- 
mine the ecliptic arcs between these four angles, 


70 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


Viz...(a) the arc between the Eastern Horizon 
and the Lower Meridian; (b) between the 
Lower Meridian and the Western Horizon; 
(c) between the Western Horizon and the Upper 
Meridian ; (d) and between the Upper Meridian 
and the Eastern Horizon.

A, B, C, D. = Angular Houses. 
a, b, c, d. = Ecliptic arcs. 

Trisect each arc: for instance, trisect arc a. The 
result is $a = a/3. Add this to the Longitude of 
the Bhava Madhya of the Udaya Lagna and 
that of the II Bhava (Madhya) is obtained. 
To the Longitude of the II Bhava add a/3; 
that of the III is obtained. Again trisect arc b. 
The result would be 6/3 ; add 6/3 to the Longi- 
tude of the Lower Meridian; that of the V 
Bhava is obtained. Similarly deal with the other 
arcs for obtaining the Madhyas of the rest of the 
Bhavas. The four arcs may thus be determined. 


ECLIPTIC ARCS 71 


Arc a = Longitude of Lower Meridian — Long. of 
Eastern Horizon. 
Arc 6 = Long. of Western Horizon — Long. of Lower 


Meridian. 

Arc c = Long. of Upper Meridian — Long. gf West. 
Horizon. 

Arc d = Long. East Horizon — Long. of Upper 
Meridian. 


Example 23.—Determine the ecliptic arcs between the 
four angles in the Standard Horoscope ?

89. Bhava Sandhis.—These are the junc- 
tional points of the two consecutive Bhavas. 
The potency of the Bhava will be at its full in 
the Bhavamadhya and hence, it must begin 
somewhere and end somewhere. The influence 
of a planet will gradually rise when approaching 
Bhavamadhya, while it gradually diminishes 
from Bhavamadhya till it is practically nil at 
the Bhava Sandhi. The place or the point 


BHAVA SANDHIS 73 


Where the influence of the Bhava begins is the 
Arambha-sandhi and the place where it “Stops 
is the Virama-sandhi. The arambha-sandhi 
may be termed as the first point gf the 
house, and the virama-sandhi, the last point. 
For instance the arambha-sandhi' of the 
Ist Bhava will be the end-point of the 12th 
Bhava. Similarly the virama-sandhi of the first 
Bhava will be the end-point of the Lagna and 
the arambha-sandhi of the second house and so 
on. In other words the Sandhi of a Bhava 
represents the beginning of the influence of one 
Bhava and the termination of the influence of 
the Bhava preceding it. 

fci order to know the exact amount of the 
influence that a planet exercises, as a result of 
its position in a- particular Bhava, it 
becomes necessary to determine the Sandhis- 
of the varions Bhavas. 

90. Determination of Bhava Sandhis.— 
Add the longitudes of two consecutive Bhavas. 
and divide the sum by 2. The result represents 
sandhi. For instance, in the Standard Horos- 
cope adding the longitudes of first and second 
Bhavas and dividing the sum by 2, we get:— 

294° 57'_ 0" 4- 328° 16’ 20"

of thé I Bhava is 311° 36' 40" and the Arambha- 
sandhi of the IJ Bhava is 311° 36' 40". It will be 
sufficientif Sandhis of 6 Bhavas are determined 
as those of the rest could be obtained by ' 
adding 180° to each of them.

CHAPTER XI. 


CASTING THE HOROSCOPE ACCORDING TO THE 
WESTERN METHOD AND ITS REDUCTION 
TO THE HINDU 


92. General Observations.—Hitherto we 
have exhaustively treated the processes involved 
in the act of casting a horoscope according to 
the Hindu method. Realising the fact that to 
a number of people who are anxious to apply 
the Hindu method of astrology, the Hindu 
almanacs will not be either accessible or intelli- 
gible, we have thought fit to include a chapter 
dealing with the method of computing the 
longitudes of planets, etc., according to the 
western method and their reduction to the 
Hindu. It must be borne in mind that unless 
one is unable to apply the Hindu method, one 
need not adopt the method chalked out in this 
chapter. 


93. Hindu and Western Methods.—The 
Hindu method of casting a horoscope is always 
Sayana though finally it is reduced to the 
Nirayana for predictive purposes, so that, we 
want Nirayana Longitudes of planets and 
Bhavas, for analysing a horoscope according 


THE MODERN EPHEMERIS 77 


to the rules given in books dealing withthe 
Phalit Bhaga (judicial portion) of astrology. 

The westerners base their calculations as 
well as predictions on the Shifting Zodiac, Le., 
the longitudes of planets, etc., given by them 
correspond to those of Sayana amongst us, so 
that by subtracting the ayanamsa from such 
positions, the Nirayana Longitudes can be 
obtained. 

94. The Modern Ephemeris.—In order to 
cast a horoscope according to the western 
method, a reliable Ephemeris must be secured. 
An ephemeris will contain such information as 
the longitudes of planets, their latitudes and 
declirfations and the Sidereal Time marked out 
for each day and calculated to Greenwich Mean 
Noon. In some, the Equation of Time referred 
to in the preceding chapters will also be given 
in addition to the daily motions of planets. 
A modern ephemeris roughly corresponds to a 
Hindu almanac with the difference that while 
the former is exclusively Sayana, among the 
latter, some are Sayana and besides, a Hindu 
Panchanga, contains much more useful infor- 
mation like fthithi, yoga, karana, etc., whose 


importance, it is out of place to make mention 
of here, than an ephemeris. 


95. Table of Houses.—These are abso- 
lutely necessary for ascertaining the ascendant 


78 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


and. other Houses knowing before hand, the 
Sidereal Time at the birth moment. The lati- 
tude of the birth place must be sought for in a 
“Table of Houses” and then the ascendant, 
etc., traced for the Sidereal Time. The cusps 
of the Houses of the western system correspond 
to the Sayana Bhava Madhyas of the Hindus 
and by the subtraction of the Ayanamsa, their 
Nirayana Bhava Madhyas can be obtained. 

Cusp of the Western House — Ayanamsa = Nirayana 

Bhava Madhya of the Hindus. 

96. Local Mean Time of Birth.—If the 
birth moment is marked in Standard Time 
convert it into Local Mean Time (L.M.T.) 
(see Article 66). _ 


97. Greenwich Mean Time of Birth.— 
As the Sayana Jongitudes of planets are given 
for Greenwich Mean Time (G.M.T.) generally 
for Greenwich Mean Noon (G.M.N.),_ the 
L.M.T. of Birth must be converted into the 
corresponding G.M.T. of Birth thus :— 


G.M.T.-L.M.T. + Rongitude of place 


— if place is E. of Greenwich. 
Tr »% W. of - 


Example 28.—Miss N. born on 3-5-1932 at 5-45 AM. 
(L.M.T.) Lat. 13° N., Long. 75° 0' E. Find the 
G.M.T. of Birth. 


(This will be called the Illustrated Horoscope). 


GREENWICH MEAN TIME INTERVAL OF BIRTH 79 


G.M.T. = (5-45 AM) — £8 
(5-45 AM) - 5 AM. = 0-45 AM. 
G.M.T. of Birth = 0-45 AM. 

98. Greenwich Mean Time Interyal of 
Birth. As already observed above, the longi- 
tudes of planets will be given for Greenwich 
Mean Noon (sometimes for midnight also). 
In order to find out their positions at the 
moment of birth, we should ascertain the elapsed 
time rather the interval between the G.M.N. 
and the G.M.T. If the G.M.T. of Birth falls 
after the noon (i.e, G.M.N.) then take the 
interval between the two: if the G.M.T. of 
birth is before the noon, then take the interval 
between the preceding noon and G.M.T. of 
Birth. The result is Greenwich Mean Time 
interval of birth. 


Example 29.—Find the G.M.T. interval of birth in 
the Illustrated Horoscope. 


The G.M.T. of Birth=0-45 AM. 
*» Take preceding noon (noon of 2-5-1932) 
’. G.M.T. interval of birth is 12 h. 45 m. 


99. Daily Motions of Planets.—The celes- 
tial arc traversed by the planets in a day is their 
dally motion. Take the arc that each planet 
has traversed from the noon preceding birth 
to the noon succeeding birth.

100. Hindu Nirayana Longitudes of Pla- 
nets.— We know the daily movements of all the 
planets, i.e., the arc they pass through’ in 24 
hours. Now find by proportion or with the aid 
of Logarthmic tables, the arc covered by each 
of them in the G. M. T. interval of birth and 
add this to their respective longitudes at the 
noon previous to birth. The result would 
represent their exact Sayana positions at the 
birth moment. If a planet is in retrograde, 
instead of adding the arc traversed in a day, 
to its previous longitude, the arc must be 
subtracted from it. In case of Rahu, the arc 
must always be subtracted. In the case of the 
Sun and the Moon the arc must always be 
added. In the case of the other five planets, 
the arc 1s additive or subtractive according as 


NIRAYANA LONGITUDES OF PLANETS 81 


the planet is direct or retrograde. From éhe 
Sayana longitudes so obtained, subtract “Aya- 
namsa for the year of birth (See Art. 49) and the 
Hindu Nirayana Longitudes of the plangts are 
obtained.

THE SIDEREAL TIME AT BIRTH 83 


Now we have obtained the positions of 
grahas; we shall proceed to find out the 
different Bhavas. 


101. The Sidereal Time at Births—This 
is very essential for finding out the ascendant 
and other houses. You will see the Sidereal 
Time marked for G. M. N. everyday in the first 
column of the Ephemeris, i.e., next to week day. 
The Sidereal Time for birth must be obtained 
as follows :— 


First ascertain the Sidereal Time at the 
previous Greenwich Mean Noon. 
From or to this deduct or add at the 
rate of 10 seconds for every one hour 
of longitude, this being the correction 
for the difference of time between place 
of birth and Greenwich. Deduct if the 
place of birth is East of Greenwich, add 
if it is West of Greenwich. The 
Sidereal Time for the previous Local 
Mean Noon is obtained. Now add to 
this the Mean Time interval (i.e., the 
number of hours passed from previous 
local noon to birth) and also add 
10 seconds per hour since noon as this 
represents the difference between the 
Sidereal Time and the Mean Time. Ex- 
punge multiples of 24 hours. The result 
represents the Sidereal Time at Birth.

102. R.A.M.C. at Birth.— Convert Sidereal 
Time into arc. The result represents the 
R.A.M.C. at birth, i.e., Sidereal Time X 15° = 
R.A.M.C. at birth. 


Example 33,--Find the R.A.M.C. at birth given Sidereal

52 s. = 0 13~«O 
R.A.M.C. at birth = 306° 58' 0" 


103. Sayana Longitudes of Angular 
Houses.—Since there is a slight difference 


THE HOUSES" 85 


between the Hindu and western methods of ¢om- 
puting the longitudes of the non-angular houses, 
we shall ascertain those of the angular houses 
from the Modern Table of Houses, reduce them 
into Nirayana ones and then find out the longi- 
tudes of the non-angular houses according to the 
rules described in Article 88. 


Consider the " Table of Houses" for the 
latitude of the birth place ; if no Table of Houses 
for the birth place is available, then refer to 
that which is nearest to the latitude of birth. 
Find the nearest time corresponding to the 
Local Sidereal Time of Birth (under the column 
Sidereal Time). Next to that we see the 
cusp of the Tenth house; mark its longitude; 
trace further and you will see a column marked 
as " Ascend" ; mark its longitude also. Deduct 
from these two, the Ayanamsa. Their Nirayana 
Bhava Madhyas are obtained—.e., the longi- 
tudes of Udaya Lagna (Ascendant) and the 
Upper Meridian (Madhya Lagna) are obtained. 
Adding 180° to each of these two, the Nirayana 
Asta Lagna (Western Horizon) and the Pathala 
Lagna (Lower Meridian) are obtained. Now 
apply the rules contained in Articles 87, 88, 89, 
90 and 91. You have got the horoscope ready. 


Example 34.—Findthe Sayana Longitudes of the cusps of 
the ascendant and the 10th House in the illustrated 
horoscope and reduce them to those of the Nirayana ?

length of each Bhava in the Illustrated Horoscope and 
locate the planets in a map of the heavens. 


P.S.—In considering the Longitudes of planets and Bhavas, 
omit less than half a minute of arc and consider more 
than half a minute as equal to one minute.

CHAPTER XII. 
THE SHODASAVARGAS 


105. The Vargas.—The Zodiac or the 
Bhachakra is composed of 360 degrees of the 
celestial space. 30 degrees constitute one sign 
of the zodiac. Each of such signs is further 
subdivided into a number of other divisions, i.e., 
into certain kinds of divisions. These kinds 
of divisions are known as the Vargas. These 
are based on the assumption that planets get 
increase or decrease in their capacity to produce 
good or inflict bad, in a horoscope, according 
to their particular positions within a sign. They 
become highly potent by occupying certain- 
kinds of divisions, owned by them, or by planets 
declared as their intimate friends, or by such 
divisions being their own places of exaltation 
or fall. These various relations, like elevation 
(Oochcha), fall (Neecha), etc., have been already 
discussed elsewhere.* 

106. The Shodasavargas.—These kinds 
of divisions are really sixteen in number. Butthe 
number adopted by the different astrologers 
varies according to how they are used. For 
instance, for finding out the Sthana_ Bala 
* For further information see my book " Graha and Bhava Balas ". 


90 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


{Pogitional strength) of a planet, the Sapta- 
Vargac are considered. For making predictions, 
the Shadvargas are employed, some consider 
Dasa-Vargas and so on, the choice often 
depending upon the prevailing custom. We 
shall, for purposes of determining the Sthana 
Bala of planets, go in detail into Sapta Vargas 
and scan through all the sixteen-vargas rather 
superficially. 


107. The Shadvargas.—They are (1) Rasi, 
{2) Hora, (3) Drekkana, (4) Navamsa, (5) 
Dwadasamsa and (6) Trimsamsa. 


108. The Saptavargas.—(1) Rasi, (2)

Thrimsamsa. 


110. The Shodasavargas.—(1) Rasi,

(13) Shodasamsa, (14) Thrimsamsa, (15) 
Shashtiamsa and (16) Ghatikamsa. 


RAS] AND HORA 91 


We shall now describe the various vaygas, 
and the methods of locating the planets im each 
one of them. 

111. Rasi—Rasi means sign. The 12 
signs of the Zodiac are the 12 Rasis. The limits 
and the lordships of the various rasis are named 
in the second chapter. 

Example. 36.—Findthe Rasis of the different planets and 


the Lagna in the Standard Horoscope and the lords

112. Hora.—23 Ghatis constitute 1 Hora 
15 degrees are equal to | hour in time so that, on 
the whole, there are 24 horas of 15° each in the 
entire zodiac. Each sign contains 2 horas, 
namely, the Surya Hora (Sun's) and _ the 
Chandra Hora (Moon's). In Oja Rasis_ or 
odd signs the first hora is governed by the Sun 
and the second by the Moon. In Yugma Rasis or 
even signs the ruler of the first hora is the Moon, 
and second hora is governed by the Sun. Odd 
signs are Mesha, Mithuna, Simha, etc. Even 


92 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


signs are Kataka, Vrishabha, Kanya, etc., For 
instartce, the first hora in Mesha is governed by 
the Sun, while the second is presided over by 
the Moon. Similarly so with reference to 
Mithnna, etc. In Vrishabha, Chandra presides 
over the first hora and the Sun over the next.

We shall omit Rahn and Kethu for the 
present, as they are considered Aprakashaka 
Grahas or shadowy planets and as they simply 
reflect the results of the lords of the houses 
which they occupy. 


113. Drekkana.—The Zodiac is divided 
into 36 drekkanas so that each gets !0°. The 
Lord of the first drekkana in a rasi is the lord 
of the rasi itself, that of the second, the lord of 
5th from it, that of the 3rd, the lord of the 9th 
from it.

114. Chaturthamsa.—When a sign is 
divided into four equal parts, each one is 


called a Chaturthamsa. The Zodiac contains 
48 Chaturthamsas and each is equal to *## 
or 7° 30' of the celestial space. The lord of 
the first Chaturthamsa is the lord of the 
Rasi itself; that of the second, the lord of 
the fourth from it, that of the third, the lord 


94 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


of the seventh and that of the fourth, the lord 
of thé 10th. Thus the lord of each Kendra 
Rasi (quadrant), will become the lord of each 
Chaturthamsa. 


115. Panchamsa.—Each Panchamsa—+# of 
a sign — is 6° in extent, ie., the Zodiac is 
divided into 80 panchamsas. In odd signs the 
first panchamsa is governed by Mars; the 
second by Saturn; the third by Jupiter; the 
fourth by Mercury; and the fifth by Venus. 
The reverse holds good in even signs. 


116. Shastamsa.—There are 72 shasht- 
amsas in the whole of the Bhachakra. Each 
Shashtamsa is equal to five degrees and a 
Rasi is divided into 6 Shashtamsas. In odd 
signs the lords of the six Shashtamsas are the 
lords of the six houses from Aries and in even 
signs the lords of the six Shashtamsas are the 
lords of the six Rasis from Libra. 


117. Sapthamsa.—When a _ sign is 
divided into seven equal divisions each is called 
a Sapthamsa and gets **= 4° 14 177" 
The  Bhachakra is divided into 84 — sap- 
thamsas. In odd signs they are governed by 
the lords of the first seven Rasis and in even 
signs by the lords of the seventh and following

118. Ashtamsa.—An ashtamsa measure 
3° 45' and the Bhachakra is divided into 96 
ashtamsas and each Rasi, therefore, contains 
8 compartments - Ashtamsas. In movable 
signs (Aries, Cancer, etc.), the lords of the 8 
ashta*msas are the lords of the 8 signs from 
Aries. In Sthira Rasis or immovable signs 
(Taurus, Leo, etc.), the lords of the 8 ashtamsas 
are those of Leo and the succeeding signs. In 
Dwiswabhava Rasis, (common sign like Gemini, 
Virgo, etc.), the 8 Ashtamsas are governed by 
the lords of Dhanus and the next succeeding 
signs. 

119. Navamsa.—This is the most impor- 
tant subdivision among the Hindus. The 
successful forecasts made by them have this 
system as the basis. This has been formulated 
in view of the relationship between the 
dégrees of the ecliptic and the stellar points 
or Nakshatras. The Nakshatras are 27 in number 


06 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


(Art. 10). Therefore each Nakshatra gets 134. 
Each ‘Nakshatra is further subdivided into four 
padas or quarters, so that one pada is equal to 


° 
13812340 0f the ecliptic arc. Similarly a 


Sign 1s divided into nine equal parts and each 1s 
a Navamsa. The Bhachakra is divided into 
108 navamsas and each navamsa corresponds to 
a Nakshatra Pada. Reference to the schedule 
of Nakshatras given in Article 10 will tell 
you that 4 quarters of Aswini, 4 of Bharani, and 
1 of Krittika make up Mesha. By knowing the 
Nakshatra padas of Grahas we can readily 
Jocate them in their precise Navamsa Vargas. 


Take Mesha and divide it into nine equal 
parts. The first part (Navamsa) is governed 
by the lord of Mesha, viz., Kuja; the second 
by the lord of the second, viz., Sukra; the 
third by Budha lord of the third; the fourth 
by the lord of the fourth, viz., Chandra, and 
so on till the last or the ninth navamsa which 
is governed by Jupiter, lord of the ninth from 
Mesha. Now divide Vrishabha into nine equal 
parts. We have left counting of the navamsa at 
Dhanus, viz., the ninth from Mesha. There- 
fore, the first navamsa of Taurus (or the 10th 
Navamsa from Mesha) is governed by the lord of 
the 10th from Mesha, viz., lord of Makara—Saz.j; 
the 2nd navamsa (in Vrishaba), by the lord 


NAVAMSA 97 


of the 11th from Mesha, viz., Sani, the 3rd by 
the lord of the 12th, viz., Guru, the 4th, 5th, 6th, 
7th, 8th and 9th by Kuja, Sukra, Budha, Chan- 
dra, Ravi and Budha respectively. Then the 
first navamsa of Mithuna is ruled by the lord of 
the 7th from Aries, viz., Sukra. Thelast navamsa 
of Gemini is governed by the lord of the ninth 
from Gemini, Mercury. Again the first of 
Cancer is governed by the lord of Cancer and 
the last navamsa of Cancer by the lord of the 
ninth from Cancer, viz., Jupiter, so that the 
first navamsa in Leo is ruled by the lord of 
tenth from Cancer—Aries, viz., Mars. It 
invariably follows, that for Mesha, Simha 
and Dhanus, Navamsas must be counted from 
Mesha to Dhanus ; for Vrishabha, Kanya and 
Makara from Makara; for Mithuna, Thula 
and Kumbha from Thula and for Kataka, 
Vrischika and Meena from Kataka. Thus we 
see four distinct groups :— 


(a) Mesha, Simha, Dhanus — from Mesha. 
(b) Vrishabha, Makara, Kanya — from Makara. 
(c) Mithuna, Thula, Kumbha — from Thula. 
(d) Kataka, Vrischika, Meena — from Kataka. 


Take for instance a planet whose longitude 
is 114° 26’ 15 “or 24° 26' 15" in Cancer. Note 
this belongs to group (d) so that the navamsas 
mpst be counted from Kataka. 24° 26' 15"+3%=7 
and odd Navamsas. The planet has passed 7

98 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


navamsas in Cancer and is in the 8th. The 
8th n&évamsa in Cancer is ruled by the lord of 
the 8th Rasi from Cancer, viz., Aquarius— 
Saturn, Thus the planet is in Saturn's 
Navamsa. 

In group (a) the lords of the nine navamsas 
will be the lords of Mesha and the succeeding 
signs. Similarly with reference to other groups, 
the Navamsas must be considered. 


Example 40.—Find the Navamsas occupied by the 
planets and the Lagna, and the lords of such navamsas, 
in the Standard Horoscope.*

120. Navamsas and Nakshatra Padas.— 
Now that we have learnt, how to find, 
in which Navamsa a planet is situated, we 
can also readily find out the particular constel- 
lation and the particular pada the planet is in. 
For instance, take the Sun. He occupies the 
9th navamsa in Kanya, ie., he is in the Sth 

* Include Rahu and Kethu also. 


NAVAMSAS AND NAKSHATRA PADAS 99 


pada of Kanya rasi. The schedule of constella- 
tions in Chapter II will tell you that the last three 
padas of Uttara Phalguni, Hasta and the first 
two padas of Chitta make up Kanya. See 
to which padam (Quarter) and nakshatram 


(Constellation) in Kanya, the 9th navamsa 
corresponds. 


Uttara 3. Padas. 
Kanya Hasta 4 93 
. Chitta 2 


>> 


Therefore, the last navamsa of Kanya 
corresponds to, rather is the sameas, the last pada 
in Kanya, i.e., the second of Chitta. Therefore 
you say that the Sun is in the second padam 
(Quarter) of the nakshatra (Constellation) 
Chitta. Ascertain for all the planets, the 
nakshatras and the padas corresponding to the 
navamsa positions. 


Example 41.—Findthe Nakshatra Padas occupied by the

“121. Navamsa Chakra—As navamsa 
combinations are too often referred to in Hindu 
predictive astrology, it would be better to mark 
the Grahas in a navamsa diagram for purposes 
of convenience and reference.

Standard Horoscope in a Navamsa Kundali :—

122. The Dasamsa.—When a sign is 
divided into ten equal parts, each is called a 
Dasamsa, meaning zveth of it. The whole 
Zodiac gets 120 Dasamsas of 3° each. 

In odd signs the lords of the Dasamsas 
commence from the owner of the sign itself, 
while in even signs the rulers are the lords of 
the ninth* and the following houses respectively.

narain Rao. Stanza 21, Chap. [. 


EKADASAMSA AND DWADASAMSA 101 


123. Ekadasamsa. — Each Ekadasemsa 
measures #£=2s% or the Bhachakra céntains 
132 Ekadasamsas. The lords of the 11 
Ekadasamsas are the lords of the elevgn signs 
from the 12th Rasi, counted backwards. Thus in 
Aries the first Ekadasamsa is ruled by Jupiter, 


the lord of the 12th from it and so on. 


124. Dwadasamsa.— When a sign is divided 
into 12 equal parts each is called a dwadasamsa 
and measures 21°. The Bhachakra can _ thus 
be said to contain 12*12=144 Dwadasamsas. 
The lords of the 12 Dwadasamsas in a sign are 
the lords of the 12 signs from it, i.e., the lord of 
the first Dwadasamsa in Mesha is Kuja, that of 
the second Sukra and so on. 

Example 43.—Find the Dwadasamsas occupied by the 


various planets and the Lagna in the Standard Horos- 
cope and the lords of such Dwadasamsas.

125. Shodasamsa.—When a sign is divid- 
e/1 into 16 equal parts, each is called a Shoda- 
samsa. The Bhachakra contains 16* 12=192 


102 A MANUAL OF HINDU ASTROLOGY 


Shodasamsas. In odd signs the lords of the first 
12 signs govern them and the 13th, [4th, 15th 
and 16th parts are ruled by Sani, Budha, Kuja 
and Rayi. In even signs, the planets govern 
them in the reverse order. 

126. Thrimsamsa.—When a sign is divid- 
ed into 30 equal parts each is called a 
Thrimsamsa measuring 1° each. In odd signs, 
the Thrimsamsas are governed thus :— 


Mars Saturn Jupiter Mercury Venus 
5 5 8 7 5 =. 50; 
In even signs the order must be reversed: — 
Venus Mercury Jupiter Saturn Mars 
5 7 8 5 5 = 30. 


The above may be interpreted thus :— 

In Mesha, Mithuna and such other Oja 
(odd) rasis, the first 5 Thrimsamsas are 
governed by Mars, the second 5 by Saturn and 
so on. In Yugma Rasis (even signs) like 
Vrishabha, Kataka, etc., the first 5 are govern- 
ed by Venus, the next 5 by Mercury, etc., as 
mentioned above. 

Example 44.—¥ind the number of the Thrimsamsas

Shastiamsa.— When a sign is divided 


into 60 equal parts, each is called a Shastiamsa. 
The Bhachakra contains 60*12=720 Shasti- 


amsas. 


In case of odd signs, the sixty Shasti- 


amsas are thus named :— 
(1) Ghora, (2) Rakshas, (3) Devabhaga, 


(4) Kubera, (5) Rakshogana, (6) Kin- 
nara, (7) Hrusta, (8) Kalagnana, (Q)

(56) Ashuba. (57) Atishuba, (58) 
Sudhapayodhi, (59) Dhyumani, (60) 
Indurekha. 


In case of even signs, the order of naming 
must be reversed. 

128. Ghatikamsa.—Each Rasi is divided 
into 150 ghatikamsas and each is again sub- 
divided into two parts so that each Rasi is 
divided into three hundred equal parts, each 
amsa being equal to 6’. Chara, Sthira and 
Dviswabhava Rasis are considered in naming 
these Ghatikamsas, which it would not be Worth- 
while worrying with at this stage. 

129. General Remarks.—We have said 
above that of all the Shodasavargas, it is the 
Saptavargas (108 Art.) alone that are of special 
importance to us as contributing to the 
positional strength (Sthanabala) of the different 
planets. The Saptavargas of planets, together 
with the lords of the Saptavargas can be 
tabulated as follows for our future use. Their 
importance and applicability has been elaborate- 
ly explained in my book "Graha and Bhava 
balas ". 


Example 45.—Tabulate all the Saptavargas of the plane\s. 
and the Lagna in the Standard Horoscope ?

Rows * horizontal indicate the planets and 
tows longituclinal—the vargas. Take for 
instance., the row under the heading Drekkana. 
Tracing downwards we find the lords of Drek-

of the Drekkanas. For instance take the Sun, 
and tracing horizontally we find under the 
column Rasi the symbols ™ and 8. This 


means that the Sun is in Kanya (Virgo) 
Rasi having Budha as the lord. The table
