My father-Guru Revered Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa 
Sastri was a pioneer who struggled to search for and 
discover astrological and other classics. Beginning from 
1927 he meticulously and authentically edited and publis- 
hed Saaraavali, Sarvaartha Chiritaamani, Jaataka 
Tattvam and Paraasara Samhitaa with Tamil transla- 
tion and comments. 

This book is an English transcreation/rendering of 
JAATAKA TATTVAM and is brought out to serve 
a wider public. We propose to bring out the other 
classics Jataaka Alankaaram and Jinendramaalai. 

We will be failing in our duty if we do not acknow- 
ledge the encouragement given to us by KARC Advisory 
Committee. 

We are particularly indebted to Professor B. Ardha- 
nareeswaran for all his help and encouragement. 

We are highly appreciative of the expeditious and 
efficient service done by the enthusiastic printer and 
Publisher Mr. M.A. Jaishankar, proprietor of Jaishankar 
Printers, Madras-17, (India), grandson of Revered 
Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri. 

We will gratefully receive suggestions for improve- 
ment of this book.

ACHARYA KADALANGUDI 

"Cowards die many times before their deaths; 
The valiant never taste of death but once." 

How true these*words of Shakespeare in the mouth of 
Julius Caesar were in the case of Revered Pandit Brahma- 
sri Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri. -Here was a valiant man 
who braved poverty, braved the ridicule of the athe-ists 
atheists, braved the obstruction of the orthodox, and the 
prejudice which some vernacular scholars had been enter. 
taining against Sanskrit, and with unique and single- 
minded devotion rendered a. single service in the spread 
of the supreme B haaratiya wisdom. 

Revered Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri, whose 
Tii'rth centenary was celebrated in 1978, had a great share 
in the religious and cultural Renaissance since his main 
work was in bringing the valuable treasures embedded in 
the ancient literature to the attention of the general public 
and making them available in a language understood by 
the layman. It is an evidence of his broad culture and a 
significant sign of the changing times that he put before 
one and all without distinction of caste or community or 
religion, Vedic Mantras such as those in the Taitreeya 
Aaranyakam. He had dedicated his life to this noble 
cause by translating the almost entire religious classics 
into Tamil and publishing more than 50 books along with 
the original texts in Devanagari script. 

BIRTH AND EDUCATION: 

Born on 5th October 1878 of the couple Rama Saas- 
tri and Meenakshi Ammal at Kadalangudi Village near 



Kumbakonam in Tanjavur District in Tamil Nadu (India) 
he learnt Kaavyas, Naatakas, Alankaaras, Vyaakarana, 
Vedanta, Astrology and Mantra Saastras. His Guru Bha- 
kti was such that in every publicaticn of his he got it 
printed that the rendering was by Mahaamahopaadhyaaya 
Vedantakesari Brahmasri Pangaanadu Ganapati Sastri's' 
disciple Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri. 

ROLE OF EDUCATOR: 

In 1908 he started giving discourses atTirunelveli on 
Advaita Vedanta. From 191 4 to 1916 he gave Vadanta 
lessons in Travancore Samasthaanam. During the period 
ha specialized in the study of and discussion on Bhaa- 
gavatam and Hindu Astrology. He was honoured by the 
Maharajah of Travancore. On 25th July 1910 he was 
honoured by the Maharajah of Mysore. While introduc- 
ing him to the Maharajah, Dewan V. P. Madhava Row 
remarked : 

"Though young he is a man of exceptionally brilli- 
ant parts and wonderful grasp of the principles of 
the Vedanta. /derived much benefit from his dis- 
courses. What I consider to be a special merit in 
the young man is his spirit of tolerance/' . 

The Sankaracharyas of Kanchipuram and Sringeri Mutts 

also had conferred titles on him. 

THE TIMES IN WHICH HE EMERGED: 

At the beginning of the century Hindu orthodoxy 
was, to use Shelley' words about Catholicism, "only ado- 
ration, faith, submission, blind admiration; not a rule for 
moral conduct;" and Hindu Dharma was "a passion/ 



Ill 



persuasion, an excuse, a refuge, never a check according 
to the temper of the mind which it inhabited." The stal- 
warts of the Hindu fold were unwilling to deal in a sym- 
pathetic spirit with the growing desire of those educated 
in English schools and colleges to get at the rationale of 
Hindu custom and usages; and in fact, they refused to 
encourage any such quest. 

These led to the deplorable result of alienating the 
English educated Hindu altogether from that interest in 
ancient Indian knowledge which one would gladly have 
seen in their mental equipment and from the observance 
of those rites and ceremonials which form the indispen- 
sable discipline making for purity of thought and body, 
necessary for any spiritual development. Their example 
easily began to spread this lack of interest even among 
non-English educated men; for the former were taken to 
be the repositories of modern wisdom whom it would be 
unfashionable not to follow. But, fortunately, the tide 
has turned. 

National leaders like Swami Vivekananda, Tilak, 
Aurobindo and Mahatma Gandhi highlighted the salient 
points of India's hoary civilization and glorious culture 
inspired by the spiritual insight of her sages, and showed 
how a departure from which had resulted in her slavery to 
foreign domination. At such a time emerged on the 
scene the great Kadalangudi. 

JOURNALIST PAR EXCELLENCE : 

Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri settled down in 
Madras on 27th November 1917. Without much capital 
on hand he set up his own Press and launched his monthly 



Kumbakonam in Tanjavur District in Tamil Nadu (India) 
he learnt Kaavyas, Naatakas, Alankaaras, Vyaakarana, 
Vedanta, Astrology and Mantra Saastras. His Guru Bha- 
kti was such that in every publication of his he got it 
printed that the rendering was by Mahaamahopaadhyaaya

Madras on 27th November 1917. Without much capital 
on hand he set up his own Press and launched his monthly 



IV 



journal AARYAMATA SAMVARDHANEE, which met a 
long-felt need of the public. He popularized through his 
journal the rare ancient religious classics through the 
medium of reliable Tamil translation and propagated a 
knowledge of the significance of Hindu rituals, method of 
workship, etc. 

GRAND PUBLICATIONS: 

• The period 1923 to 1928 saw the publication of 9 
Vedic books, 6 Upanishads, 4 Vols of Brahmasuutra San- 
kkara Bhaashyam, 7 Vols, of Srimad Bhaagavatam 12 
AstrokJgy books and more than 12 Stotra books. Each 
book carried a scholarly Preface as lengthy as Bernard 
Shaw's detailed contents and an Index of Slokas to be of 
*help to the users of the book; the Rt. Mon'ble Srinivasa 
Sastri echoed the thought of the other readers when he 
said Kadalangudi's footnotes were imaginative and con- 
siderate of the reader's difficulty. 

The value of each book was enhanced by the 
author's collateral references which bring together 
all the learning on the subject and critical commen- 
tary at once admirable and most helpful. In the as- 
trology books'judgement based on the author's experience 
is also given wherever there are conflicting schools of 
thought. The meaning of the text is clearly and succinc- 
tly explained; the exposition is complete and authori- 
tative. 

* No wonder his books are used for research guidance. 
His astrology books continue to be used as basic refer- 
ence books by Tamil-knowing people all over the world.

THE GREATNESS OF KADALANGUDl'S 
TRANSLATION; 

Only those who are engaged in translation work can 
realize how arduous the work is; while the difficulty of 
communicating the ideas in one language through the 
medium of another is always difficult, itis still more diffi- 
cult to translate a valuable abstruse work from Sanskrit 
in to Tamil. Thiru Vi. Ka. opines thus:- 

"Many will flinch from even undertaking the trans- 
lation of such abstract and scholarly treatises. But this 
is what the learned Kadalangudi Sastriar has dared to do 
in a spirit of dedication and service, regardless of praise 
or blame. And it is wonderful how well he has done 
this superhuman task. Our mind does not permit us to 
state that Acharya Kadalangudi Natesa Sastriar is work- 
ing at the translation purely from the standpoint of lear- 
ning. But we can confidently affirm that he is labouring 
also from the standpoint of love that transcends all 
"knowledge. 

This swelling flood of translation flows from a source 
full of knowledge and love and it is the bounden duty of 
every Tamilian to drink it. ..South India was all the poorer 
for want of accurate translation of the great classics. But 
this want has now been supplied and the ideas in the 
classics made accessible to the Tamil public by the Tamil 
translation so nobly undertaken by Acharya Kadalangudi 
Natesa Sastri, that veteran scholar. We in the South owe 
him a deep debt of gratitude for this labour of love."

What is not widely known is that he was a great poet; 
. he has left behind him a large number of Sanskrit verses 
which constituted his diary. 

Around 19"40 Kulapati K. M. Munshi invited him to 
become Principal of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Sanskrit 
College in Bombay; Kadalangudi declined it with thanks 
since, he wanted to be self-employed and enjoy the accru- 
ing freedom to pursue his studies. 

RAJAJI'S TRIBUTE: 

While speaking at Kadalangudi's 'Sataabhishekam' 
function (completion of 81 years 4 months of age equiva- 
lent to 100 lunar years) at Siva-Vishnu Temple In Madras 
on October 11, 1958 Rajaji (who was of the same age) 
expressed as follows : 

"The public need not bother to arrange ano- 
ther grand celebration of my ' Sataabhishekam' , 
I deem it to have been celebrated along with this 
function in honour of the veteran scholar Revered 
Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri/' 

Such was the mutual admiration and affection between 
the two intellectual giants. 

HIS END: 

The Revered Pandit who laid the Indian public under 
deep obligation to him by publishing and propagating 
ancient works and making the most valuable contribution 
to the study of Advaita Vedanta, Srimad Bhaagavatam, 
and Hindu Astrology attained immortality at the holiest 



VII 



of holy moments: at 1 1-30 p.m. on Mahaasivaraatri in 
1961 (on Feb. 14,1961 at the Lingaavirbhava Lagna). 

HIS MISSION: 

Bo^h in the several books and in his numerous lectu- 
res he had stood for the consolidation based on ths Vedas 
of the Hindu Dharma by ensuring social unity along with 
individual purity. He had been and continues to be a 
source of inspiration to many of his disciples who have pro- 
fited by learning the gems hidden in the ancient classics 
both philosophical and didactic, and which have a direct 
bearing on the practical conduct of everyday. 

- He had no sons and therefore he chose to give inten- 
sive training i*n the practice of Astrology to his youngest 
daughter K. N. Saraswathy, and training in exposition of 
epics and ' Naaraayaneeyam to his eldest son-in-law 
Anantaraama Deekshitar. 

The great Pandit had no patience or time to lose with 
indifferent disciples or those without intuition, as far as 
astrology was concerned. Astrological study required 
more intertse concentration, capacity for application, and 
intuition. So the only disciple who completed the course 
and internship in astrology under Kadalangudi was 
K. N. Saraswathy. Even after the course he was happy to 
have her as apprentice and collaborator in republishing 
the astrology books.

EFFECTS OF THE 1st (Ascendant) HOUSE 

The body comforts should be ascertained 
from the lord of the ascendant being placed in 
the degree of its own exaltation, or its own 
Navaamsa and associated with or aspected by the 
benefic. The benefic lord of the ascendant be- 
ing strengthened and placed in J,4,?br 10 or in 
I, 5 or 9 and not being aspected by any malefic 
the physical comforts of the native. The native 
is bestowed with fame and very good fortune if 
tells the Sun is the lord of the ascendant and is 
strong and is in the degree known as Devalo- 
kaamsa and the lord of the 9th is in exaltation. 

/— 1 



2 First House 

The native gets good fortune, fame, wealth 
and long life, if the lord of the ascendant is very 
much strengthened, associated with benefic class 
(Subha varga), is in its exaltation or in its 
Navaamsa associated with its friendly planets, 
associated with the lords of the 1st, 4th, 7th 
or 10th house. There will be discomforts to- 
the physique of the native if the lord of the 
ascendant is associated with a malefic. So is 
the result of the lord of the ascendant placed in 
the 8th house. But even in the above cases, if 
the lord of the ascendant is aspected by the be- 
nefics, the results will be contrary to what is 
said before. That is, there will be no lack of 
physical comforts. 

The native is prone to suffer fresh diseases 
if the lord of the ascendant or the ascendant is 
associated with the lord of the 6th, 8th or 12th. 
The native will not suffer from diseases if the 
lord of the ascendant, even though weakened, 
is placed in house 1,4,7 or 10 or in 1,5 or 9. 

The native will have a weak body if the 
lord of the house wherein the lord of the ascen- 
dant is placed is house 6, 8 or 12. Likewise it is 
generally said that the lords of the bhaavas 
when placed in 6, 8 or 12 harm their own bhaa- 
va. The native is cheated by others, lives under 



Jautaka fattvam 3 

fear of thieves, etc. if the malefics are in the 1 
ascendant associated with Gulika, or if the lord 
of the ascendant is associated with a malefic, or 
if Rahu is in the ascendantr There will certainly 
be fear of thieves, royal disfavours, cheating by 
others if the ascendant is associated with or as- 
pected by Saturn. 

The elders opine that the native will have a 
large kidney if Rahu is associated with Mars 
and is placed in the ascendant or if Rahu is 
associated with Saturn. The kidney of the native 
will be enlarged if the lord of the ascendant is 
in the 8th house, or if Rahu and Gulika are in 
(he 8th house. The kidney is large if Rahu is 
in the ascendant, Gulika is in the 5th or the 
9th house Mars in association with Gulika is in 
the 8th house. The kidney will be large if the 
lord of that house ( wherein the Navaamsa of 
the lord of the ascendant is placed) is associated 
with Rahu, Mars and Gulika. The kidney 
will be enlarged if the lord of the house housing 
the lord of the 8th house is associated with 
Rahu. ; \ 

It is said that the native will have head in- 
juries caused by the pelting of stones or by a 
knife etc., if Mars is the lord of the ascendant 
land is placed in the ascendant, and associated 



4 First House 

with or aspected by a malefic. If Saturn is 
placed as said before (i.e. Saturn being the lord 
of the ascendant and is placed in the ascendant 
and is associated with or aspected by a malefic) 
the native will suffer head injuries due to wind, 
fire of weapon or falling On the ground. 

The astrologists proclaim that the native 
will have a big head if 5 ghatis .are past at the 
time of birth in the Lagna, will not have a big 
head if only 2\ ghatis are past, will have a small 
head if less than 2i ghatis are past. They say 
that the native will have a lean body if a dry 
sign (Raasi) is the ascendant and therein is 
housed a dry planet. The native will suffer 
much and have a lean thin body if the lord of 
the ascendant is associated with a dry planet or 
housed in the house of a dry planet, and the 
lord of the ascendant is in the 8th house and an 
ascendant is a dry sign. If the lord oftheNava- 
amsa of the house occupied by the lord of the 
ascendant is in dry sign the body of the native 
will also be dried up. It is said that the native 
will have a thin body if the dry sign is the 
Lagna and associated with many malefics. 

The native will have a fat body if the 
ascendant is a wet sign and associated with 
the benefics. They teach that the physique of the 
native will be well-built if the ascendant is a 



Jaataka Tattvam 5 

wet planet, is strengthened and is associated 
with gentle planets. The physique of the native 
will be well-built if the lord of the ascendant 
is in a wet sign, is associated with a wet planet 
or aspected by a wet planet, the ascendant being 
the sign of a benefic, the lord of the Navaamsa 
of the house occupied by the lord of the ascen- 
dant placed in a wet sign. 

The physique will be well-built as said 
above if the sign (Raasi) of the benefic is ascen- 
dant and devoid of the aspects of any malefic. 
The body will be healthy if Jupiter is in the 
ascendant or the ascendant is aspected by Jupi- 
ter or a planet having a wet sign, or the ascen- 
dant is a wet sign. It is said that the body will 
be very stout if there are benefics in the as- 
cendant and aspected by other benefics. It is 
said that the native will suffer from evils caused 
by the witches if Saturn or Rahu is in the 
ascendant. 

The native will suffer from breathing trou- 
ble, tuberculosis, stomach-ache, etc. if the Sun 
is in the ascendant and is being aspected by 
Mars. The native will undergo sufferings caused 
by weapons if Mars is in the ascendant and as- 
pected by Saturn and the Sun. There will cer- 
tainy be fears caused by thieves and witches

(devils) if Ketti is in the ascendant and is aSf J 
pected by many malefics. The native will loiter 
much if the ascendant is in a movable sign or 
the lord of the ascendant is in a movable sign. 
They say that the native will travel much if the 
movable sign is an ascendant and the Navaamsa 
ascendant also is a movable sign. The native 
will visit foreign countries if the movable sign is 
the ascendant and the lord of the ascendant is in 
the movable sign and aspected by the movable 
planets. If the ascendant is a fixed Raasi, the 
native will earn much fortune in his own native 
land. The native will be very wealthy if the 
fixed sign is the ascendant and therein are hou- 
sed fixed planets. 

When the fixed Raasi becomes the ascen- 
dant and therein are posited fixed planets or a 
movable planet and a fixed planet the native 
gets great fortune and fame; and with fame and 
fortune he moves to many places, steps in ill- 
ways (in order to get high positions). The 
native is serious-minded if the lord of the 
ascendant is strengthened and is in its exalta- 
tion. If the lord of the ascendant is weak the 
native is opposite of what has been said t above, 
(i.e. he is not serious-mindedj and is also an 
idiot. But if the lord of the ascendant is aspec-i 



Jaataka Tattvam 7 

ted by or associated with or the ascendant is 
aspected by or associated with benefics, the 
native will not be an idiot. The native leads 
a comfortable life since his childhood if the 
benefics are in the ascendant and aspected by 
other benefics. If in such positions there is any 
relation CyogaJ with any malefic, the native will 
not have a comfortable life right from his child- 
hood. The native is always grief stricken from 
his birth to his death, if many malefics are 
placed in the ascendant. The native is blessed 
with comforts till his death if the lord of the 
ascendant is in the ascendant. The native is 
blessed with comforts till his death if the lord 
of the ascendant is in Vargottamaamsa or in 
its own exalted Navaamsa, or in the trintal 
(treshkaana) of its friendly house and aspected 
by or associated with benefics. 

The native begets happiness in his early and 
middle stages of life if the ascendant fat the 
birth) and benefics are in 12 and 11 and the lord 
of the ascendant is strong and is placed in a 
quadrant and Jupiter is in Simhaasanaamsa. 
Similarly those born at a time when the ascen- 
dant, the 2nd "and 3rd houses are aspected by 
benefics, and the lord of the ascendant is bene- 
fic and benefics are in the amsaa called Paaraa-

dle stages of their lives. 

The person enjoys his childhood if at his 
tfrnerof birth the ascendant is strong and Jupi- 
ter occupies the 1st, 4th ? 7th or 10th house- The 
person enjoys comforts and pleasures thro- 
ugh wife, off- spring and friends when the lord 
of the ascendant is in what is called Paaraavata- 
amsa. The native enjoys comforts in his middle 
and old ages if the lord of the ascendant is in 
what is called gopuraamsa, Venus is in what 
is termed as Devalokaamsa, and the ascendant is 
aspected by benefics. There will be first suffer- 
ings and then comforts in the lives of those 
whose horoscope contains a benefic in the ascen- 
dant, a malefic in the 2nd house and 1,4,7 and 
10 is occupied by malefics and the: lord of the 
ascendant Jn Vargottamaamsa. 

The childhood will be comfortable and the 
later stages will be Ml of hardships if the 
ascendant is occupied by a malefic, benefics in 
the 2nd and 9th, and the lord the ascendant 
in Devalokaamsa, The great sages of astrology 
proclaim that the native will enjoy a high repu- 
tation far and wide if the lord of the ascendant. 
is in the 10th, the Sun in the ascendant and 
aspected by" or associated with benefics, or the 
lord of the Lagna is placed in its exaltation

time of his birth malefics are in the ascendant, 
Rahu is coupled with the lord of the Navaamsa 
in 1,4,7 or 10, a malefic in the 10th, a debilita- 
ted (or malefic) planet occupying the ascend* 
ant and even aspected by the Sun. The lord of 
the ascendant and the lord of fortune eVen 
when placed in debilitation but moving towards 
their exaltation bestow worldwide fame on 
the native. When aspected by or associated 
with benefics, both the lord of the ascendant 
and the lord of fortune give worldwide fame). 
If Venus occupies the 1st half of the ascendant 
the native enjoys happiness in the earlier stages 
of his life and sorrow in the later stages. There 
i s also sorrow and grief if malefics occupy the 
4th and 5th houses. 

The native is blessed with a good fortune, 
fame, wealth, prosperity and a long life if the 
lord of the ascendant is aspected by or associa- 
ted with benefics and is placed in exaltation 
or in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th house, or in 
the 5th or 9th aspected by a benefic, or in its 
own house along with the lord of Karma. The 
lord of the ascendant bestows a steady pros-

mature death when it is highly strengthened 
and aspected by benefics and not by any male- 
fics and is placed either in 1,4,7 ot in 10. The

through the lord of that house or the significa- 
tor of the house with whom the owner of the 
9th house is conjoined or aspected. The native 
inherits the wealth of his father when the Sun 
occupies the 4th house. The native gets money 
from the direction (Dik) in which the owner 
of the 11th is placed. The man gets wealth 
from that direction (Dik) signified by that sign 
which occupies the 11th house. There is gain 
of'Wealth if the lord of the 11th house occupies 
an angular- triangular house and a malefic occu- 
pies the 11th house. There will be gain of 
wealth when the. lord of the 11th house is in the 
2nd house and the lord of the 2nd house is in

lord of the 11th house is sandwiched between 
the two benefics (i.e. the 2nd house to the 11th 
house and to the 12th house have benefics res- 
pectively). When the lord of the amsa of the 
lord of the house of profit gets a combination 
with a benefit the native gets wealth. Mercury 
and Venus bestow wealth when they occupy the 
2nd house, A benefic placed in the 6th house 
gives wealth. In the 6th house if the Moon is

corn, and the Sun in Sagittarius, the native will 
not inherit his father's wealth. 
Yoga for loss of wealth

through his relation with other's wives if in the 
9th house to the ascendant of the Navaamsa is 
Rahu. Mercury placed in the 12th house causes 
the loss of wealth through the disputes of the 
relatives. The lord of the 12th house conjoined 
with a malefic ru?.ns the existing black or tain- 
ted money. (This in general will be applicable 
to those who maintain a current account in a 
commercial bank and indulge in underhand 
businesses). 

Yoga for loss of wealth caused by the royal 
decree . '-* 

••14—71) There, will be loss or wealth tje- 



22 Second House 

cause of a decree from the king of the country 
if the lord of the ascendant has very little 
strength, is combined with the Sun and the lord 
of the 2nd house is either in the 12th house or 
is debilitated and is aspected by a malefic. 
There is also loss of wealth caused by a decree 
of aJking when the lord of the 1 llh house is pla- 
ced in the 12th house and lord of the 12th house 
in the 2nd house and the lord of the 2nd is in 
either the 6th, 8th or 12th ^ house and is also 
debilitation. There is loss of wealth due to the 
punishment imposed by the king if the lord of 
the 2nd house is placed in the 6th house, con- 
joins with a malefic, is debilitated and even is 
associated with a significator for the king (Raja 
Karaka). There is loss of wealth by the punish- 
ment imposed by the king when the lord of the 
2nd house occupies the 12th house, and the lord 
of the J2th is in the 2nd house, and the ascen- 
dant is conjoined with a malefic and occupies 
the 6th house. 

78—81) If the lord of the 10th house occu- 
pies the 11th house along With the lord of the 
ascendant and has an evil shashthyamsa (60th 
part of the sign). There will be loss of wealth 
through thieves, fire, and the king when the 
lords of the 2nd and 11th houses are aspected 
by Mars, are even associated with the malefics, 



Jaataka Tattvam 23 

are weakened and are in evil amsa. There will 
be \6is of wealth caused by rumours and hear- 
says when the lord of the 10th house conjoined 
with malefics and is placed in the 6th house and 
the owners of the 2nd and 11th houses are in 
Kroora Shashthyamsa. There is also loss of 
wealth through thieves, fire and the king when 
the lord of the house occupied by the lord of 
the 2nd house is associated with a malefic and 
holds the 6th, 8th or 12th house and is also as- 
pected by the lord of the ascendant. 

Yoga for being pauper

the lord of the house occupied by the lord of 
the house of wealth conjoins with the malefics 
of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses and is in Kroora 
Shashthyamsa. The native becomes a pauper if 
the 2nd house, or the lord of the 2nd house or 
thotofthe 11th house is associated with male- 
fics. The lord of the house occupied by the 
owner of the 12th house gets an association of 
the lord of the house of wealth or an aspect 
thereof. The Sun being debilitated and conjoi- 
ned with the malefics and occupying an angular" 
house makes the man poor. The lord of the 
house housing the lord of the 2nd house placed 
in the Shashthyamsa called 'Kaaladanda' makes 



24 Second House 

the man pauper. When the 11th house is occu- 
pied by the lord of the 11th or has any evil 
relation with any malefic the native is poor. 

Yoga for the loss of wealth through evil deeds

* Disposition in one another's sign, con- 
junction with each other mutual aspect, mutual 
exchange of angular or triangular houses are 
said to be five means of association. 



Jaataka Tattvam 25 

wife if the lord of the 12th house is in Kroora- 
shashthyaamsa, is weak and, is associated with 
the owner of the 7th house. There will be loss 
of wealth through brothers when the lord of the 
12th house is weak and associated with Mars. 
When the owner of the 12th house is a weak- 
ling and is in association with the lord of the 
5th house through sons the native will suffer 
loss of wealth. The father will be the cause 
for loss of wealth if the lord of the 12th is 
in association with the lord of the 10th house.

J~4 



26 Second House 

Saturn are the dispositors of the~2nd house and 
are conjoined with Venus and the Moon and 
with the lord of the 2nd house. The native 
suffers a loss of wealth through theft or fire 
when Mars occupies the 2nd house! 

102 — 104,) There will be much expenses on 
providing meals to others if Jupiter occupies a 
triangular bouse. The native loses money on 
account of his expenses of his'becUcomfotts and 
loiters penniless on the earth when Rahu occu- 
pies either the 6th, 8th or 12th house. The 
planet that occupies the 2nd house and is con. 
joined with the lord of either the 6th, 8th or 
12th house and is associated with the lord of a 
triangular house causes loss of wealth, t 

Yoga for poverty

lord of the 1st house occupies the 8th house, the 
lord of the 8th house is in the 1st house, and 
is conjoined with a Maaraka planet. The native 
becomes poor when the lord of the 6th house 

t Generally in such cases when the loss of 
wealth etc is mentioned it must be taken to 
mean that such results are possible only when 
the planet concerned is operative in its per- 
iod which is the 3rd, 5th, 7th or 9th dasaa. _. 



Jaataka Tattvam 27 

occupies the ascendant, and the lord of the 1st 
house is in the 6th house and is conjoined with 
Maaraka-lord. The native becomes a pauper 
when both the Sun and the Moon are in the ascen- 
dant and are aspected by or conjoined with 
Maaraka-lord. Malefics placed in 2,4 and 5 to 
the significator of wealth make the person a pau- 
per. One will become a pauper if the lord of 
wealth has a benefic in 3 and 6, if a benefic is in 
10 and a malefic is in 2. 

Yoga for utter poverty 

111 — 113) The native suffers from utter 
poverty if the lord of the 9th occupies the 12th 
house, the lord of the 12th in the 2nd, and male- 
fics in the 3rd house. The Moon, Jupiter and 
Saturn in angular houses, Gulika and Mars in 
the 5ih> 12th or 8th house make the person 
utterly poor. The Moon and the Sun placed in 
each other's amsa and in the same sign make 
the native a pauper for ever. 

Yoga for a prince to become a pauper 

114 — 116) Even a prince will be a pauper 
if the Sun and the Moon are in Aquarius and 
the rest of the planets are in debilitated houses. 
The prince becomes a pauper when Mercury, 
the Moon, Mars and Saturn are debilitated and 



28 Second House 

Venus is in Capricornus, The debilitated Sun 
occupying the 1st, 5th or 9th bouse and Mars 
in the 8th house make even a prince a pauper. 

Yoga for prosperity 

117 — 125,) The lord of the ascendant con- 
joined with Jupiter, Mercury and Venus and 
occupying an angular house bestows all kinds 
of prosperity. The lord of the ascendant placed 
in the house of a benefic or in its own exaltation 
or camped in its friend's house and being aspec- 
ted by the benefics makes the native prosperous. 
The native is prosperous when the 2nd house 
or ah angular house is occupied by the lord of 
the house of wealth and Jupiter, The person is 
prosperous if the Sun is in what is called deva- 
lokaamsa and the ascendant is strong. The 
lord of the ascendant being strong and located 
in a Subha varga, and conjoined with the lord 
of the angular house makes the person prospe- 
rous. The native is prosperous when the Sun 
is in the ascendant, is aspected by the benefics 
and the lord of the ascendant is in the 10th 
house. All will be well if the benefics occupy 
the 11th and 5th houses. The native becomes 
prosperous if the lord of the 9th is in the 
1st house and the lord of the 4th and 9th houses 
aspect the 2nd house. 



Jaataka Tattvdm 29 

Yoga for becoming a family man 

126 — 127) The person will have a family 
if the lord of the 2nd house is in the 2nd or in 
an angular house along with the benefics. The 
2nd house or the lord of the 2nd house conjoi- 
ned with the benefics indicate a family life to 
the native. 
Yoga for being a leader of 50, 20 and 30 people 

128—131) The native will be a leader of 
50'people if the lord of the 2nd house is in 
Gopuraamsa and the lord of the house occupied 
by the lord of the 2nd house is a benefic and is 
in what is called Simhaasanaamsa. The person 
will be a leader of 20 people if the lord of the \ 
wealth is associated with a benefic and is in an 
amsa called Paaraavatamsa. The native will 
protect the lives of many if Jupiter is in Simhaa- 
sanaamsa, Venus in Gopuram, and the lord of 
the house of wealth in Airavataamsa. The native 
protects 30 people when the lord of wealth is in 
Simhaasanaamsa or in Paaraavatamsa and is 
associated with or aspected by Jupiter. 

Yoga for being disgraced 

132) The lord of the 8th house is associa- 
ted with or aspected by malefics or is located in 
a sign of a malefic or is in between two malefics 



30 '• ' • Second House 

or in the 8th house, the native has to suffer 
much disgrace. If not so, the native will not 
face any disgrace. 

Yoga for being in want of wealthy family etc. 

133—135) The native suffers from want of 
wealth if the Sun is in Taurus, the Moon in 
Pisces, Saturn in Aries, and Mars in Cancer. 
The native lacks wealth etc when the lord of 
fortune is placed in the 12th house and malefics 
occupy the angular houses., There will be utter 
loss of members of one's circle if all planets 
occupy the ascendant or the 12th or 7th house. 



EFFECTS OF THE 3rd (brothers 1 ) HOUSE 

Yoga for many brothers and happiness through 
brothers 

1—5) If Lagna or Lagna-lord has in the 
3rd or 1 1th house Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and 
the Moon, several brothers will be born; if Ketu 
is there (in the 3rd or 11th), several sisters 
will be born. If the lord of the 3rd is in own 
house and aspected by a benefic, the native will 
have brothers. If the lord of the 3rd is conjoi- 
ned with a benefic in a Kendra, brothers will be 
favourable to the native. If the 3rd house is 



Jaataka Tatlvam 31 

conjoined or aspected by a benefic and if the 
lord of the 3rd is strong, the native will gain 
brothers. If the lord or the Kaaraka of the 3rd 
is strong and has relationship with a benefic, 
gain of brothers is predicted, 

6 — 11) If the lord of the 3rd is in Gopura- 
amsa and the Kaaraka (of the 3rd) is in Simha- 
asanaamsa, and if it happens to be a benefic's 
house, brothers will be born. If the lord of the 
3rd is in Paaraaavatamsa in Kendra and is asp- 
ected by a benefic or conjoined with him, there 
will be brothers. If the lord of the 3rd is in 
Sowmyaamsa, brothers are to be predicted. If 
the lord of the 3rd is strong and is in the 3rd 
itself," brothers are certain to be born. - In case 
the lord of the 3rd is in a Mridvamsa and is 
conjoined or aspected by a benefic, brothers 
will be there. In case the lord of the 3rd is in 
Vaiseshikaamsa and has association or aspect 
of a benefic, the native will have brothers. 

Affection or enmity of brother 

12—13) If the lord of the 3rd and the lord 
of Lagna are friends, the native will have affec- 
tionate brother(s), and if they are enemies, the 
brother(s) will be inimical. If, the Kaaraka of 
the 3rd and the lord of the 3rd are in the amsa 
of a masculine Raasi and are aspected by a mas- 



32 Third House 

culine planet, there will be gain \ of brother(s). 
Otherwise, there will be gain of sister(s); and 
if mixed conditions exist, there will be gain of 
both brother(s) and sister(s). 

Yoga relating to tfie number of brothers 

14—17) The amsa rising from the 3rd 
house indicates the number of brothers. The 
amsa of the planet occupying the 3rd house will 
indicate the number of brothers. From the amsa 
of the Raasi occupied by the lord of the 3rd and 
the Kaaraka of the 3rd bhaava we can know the 
number of brothers. From the amsa of the 
Raasi occupied by the planet associated with the 
lord of the 3rd house, we can know the number 
of brothers. 

Knowing if it is going to be brother or sister 

18—19) If female planets are in the 9th, 
sisters will be born; and, if malefic planets are 
there, brothers will be born. If Mercury and 
Jupiter are in the 2nd house and Rahu is in 
Virgo, there will be three brothers. 

Yoga for brotherlessness and loss of brothers 

20—25) If the lord of the 3rd and Mars 
are in the 6th, 8th or 12th house, there will be 
no brothers. If Mars and the lord' of the 3rd 
are in the 6th and if it is a malefic's house, bro- 
thers will be born but will die. If the Kaaraka 



Jaataka Tattvam 33 

of the 3rd is debilitated or in a 'NcecaNavaam- 
sa 1 and is aspected by a malefic, and is in an 
Shashthyamsa, there will be loss of brothers. 
If the 3rd house gets association or aspect of 
evil planet(s), loss of brothers will happen. If 
the lord of the 3rd is hemmed between evil pla- 
nets, loss of brothers is to be predicted. Loss 
of-brothers will be there if the 3rd house is in 
the midst of evil planets or is conjoined with a 
debilitated planet, and has no aspect of any 
benefic. 

26 — 33) If the lord of the amsa occupied 
by the lord of the 3rd is in the 6th which is a 
debilitated, 'astangata', or inimical (house), 
harm to brothers is to be foretold. If the Kaa- 
raka of the 3rd bhaava ('Sahodara-Kaaraka'J is 
in the midst of malefics, harm to brothers is the 
effect. If the lord of the 3rd is in the 3rd in 
Kroora-Shashthyamsa and aspected by male- 
fics, there will be harm to brothers. If the lord 
of the amsa, in which the lord of the 3rd is 
posited in Navaamsa, is posited in the 6th, harm 
/to brothers will be the effect. If the lord of the 
Navaamsa, in which the lord of the amsa occu- 
pied by the lord of the 3rd is debilitated, 'astan- 

J-5 



34 Third House 

gata'j or in mimical house, the native's bro- 
thers will be harmed. If the lord of the 3rd or 
the concerned Kaaraka is in the 6th, 8th or 12th 
house, or has conjunction or aspect of a male- 
fic, and is in his exalted house, the native's bro- 
thers will be harmed. If malefics are posited 
in the 3rd house, there will be harm to brothers 
in youth. If the lord of the 3rd or the concer- 
ned Kaaraka is conjoined with malefics, the 
native's brothers will be harmed. 

Yoga for brother less ness 

34—56) If Saturn is in the 3rd and aspec- 
ted by Mars, the native will be brotherless. If 
Leo is the Lagna and the Sun is posited there, 
the native will have no brothers. If evil planets 
are in the 2nd and Rahu is in the 3rd, the 
native is brotherless. 

Yoga for brothers illness 

37—39) If the 3rd house is the Moon's 
Varga and is aspected by Mars, the native's 
brother will suffer from diseases. If a malefic is' 
in the 3rd house from Mars, brothers will nor 
have good health. If there is a malefic in the 
12th from Lagna, a younger brother will 
be there. 



Jaataka Tattvam 35 

Yoga for becoming government employee and 
for earning daily wages 

40 — 44) If the Lagnaamsa isaspected by 

Venus and the Sun, the native will become a 
government employee. If the 10th from Lagna- 
amsa has association or aspect of Mercury, the 
native will become a government employee. If 
Mars, Saturn and the Sun are in the 10th with- 
out any benefic's aspect, the native will earn 
daily wages. The native will earn daily wages, 
if Saturn is in Lagnaamsa, Venus in debilita- 
tion, and the Sun and the Moon in the 12tb. If 
the planets in the 10th are aspected, by planets, 
the native will earn daily wages. 

Yoga for having slaves 

45—48) If the lord of the 6th is in the 
10th, and if the lord of the 10th is conjoined 
with Saturn and is in Kendra, the native will 
have slaves. If the lord of Karma has Saturn 
as his amsa lord and has association with the 
lord of the 6th, he will have several slaves: 
If the Sun is aspected by the lord of the 9th 
and the 10th, and is in a male Raasi, the native 
will have several slaves. If there is a great 
deal of beneficial aspects on the 10th house, 
slaves will be there. 

Yoga for heroism 

49—51) If there is a lot of beneficial asp- 



36 s Third House 

ect on the 3rd, or if the 3rd is conjoined with a 
malefic, or if the 3rd lord is strong, the native 
will be heroic. If the lord of the 3rd is in 
Kendra or Trikona, the native is heroic. If the 
lord of Lagna and the lord of the 3rd conjoin, 
the native will have heroism, 

Yogafor living on noted work, quarry /firewood 
work 

52 — 53; If Saturn is Lagna-amsa, the nati- 
ve will live on a work which is much noted. If 
the lord of the 6th is the 3rd, one will live on 
selling firewood or stone. 

Yoga for begging 

54 — 57) If the Moon is in Aries and aspec- 
ted by Mars, the native is a beggar, t If the 
Moon has no benefic's aspect, the native will be 
a slave or beggar. If all the planets have attai- 
ned Neecaamsa, or have 'set' (reached 'Asta- 
mana'J in the Sun in the 10th or 11th house, 
the native is a beggar. If Jupiter is in the 12th, 
Saturn in Kendra, and the Moon in Lagna, the 
native is a beggar. 

t Some wealthy persons born in this Yoga 
have been observed begging. 



Jaataka Tattvam 37 

Yoga for dishonourable job 

58—60) If Jupiter is in the 2nd or 5th 
from the Moon and a benefic or malefic occu- 
pies the 8th, the native has a dishonourable 
job. If a planet is in a friend's house, the native 
is a parasite. If Lagna lord is in the 10th, Sat- 
urn is in the 2nd or Trikona, and a malefic is in 
the 8th, the native is in,a despicable job, (Even 
a government job, however high, becomes at 
sometime br other despicable,) 

Yoga for gain of wealth from others 

61) If in the 10th from Lagna or the Moon 
(respectively) the Sun and other planets are 
posited, gain of wealth will respectively be from 
father, mother, enemy, friend, brother, woman, 
servant, * 

Determining native's career 

62—65) The lord of the amsa which s is 
occupied by the lord of the 10th from Lagna- 
place of the Sun, and place of the Moon, deter, 
mines the native's career. Ref: Sloka 62 : If 
it is, the Sun's amsa the career will relate to 
medicine", aromatic articles, gold, wool, pearl, 
gem, agency, emissary, mantras, cure for illness 

* Refer our translation of Brihat Jaata- 
kam ChX Sloka 1. 



38 Fourth House 

chemistry and dramatics. If it is the Moon's 
amsa, the career relates to conch, pearl, coral, 
agriculture, soil, mimicry, government service, 
and dependence on Woman, If it is Mars' amsa, 
the career will relate to 'manosilaa' fi haritaala J 
'hingula' ('kunkilya') and gold, sword, wheel, 
axe; bow and crusher, police officer, medical 
doctor, rail engine driver, rice mill operator, 
cook, and any job which depends on his own 
strength. 

66 — 69J If it is Mercury's amsa, compo- 
sing, typing, shorthand, accountancy, *yantra\ 
poetry, painting, books, pictures, fireworks, 
wreaths, and scents — will be the careers. If it 
is Jupiter's amsa, career will relate to service 
done to 'devas', brahmin and pandit, gold, salt, 
inks, elephant, law, donation, holy waters, fast- 
ing and service in 'mutts'/monasteries. If it is 
Venus's amsa, precious ' stones, silver, iron, 
cows, class buffaloes, gold, elephant, and horse 
will be the trade of the native. If it is Saturn's 
amsa, the career will relate to travelling agency, 
postal courier, butchery, circus, load-carrying, 
ahd a job not suited to his tribe. 

Yoga for daily tasks 

70—72) The daily progress depends on the 
lord of the Navaamsa in which the lord of the 



Jaataka Tattvam ' 39 

10th from Lagna is posited in Gochara. If the 
wealth-giver. is the Sun and if he is posited in 
exalted place, he will confer wealth on the 
native. If benefic planets are in 1st, 2nd and 

1 1th houses, the native will obtain wealth in 
various ways. 



EFFECTS OF THE* 4th (relations) HOUSE 

1 — 6) If the native is born under the Scor- 
pio sign, the mother will have no breast milk to 
feed the baby. If Mars \s in the 10th and Jupi- 
ter in the 8th and both are strong the native 
" will get no comfort from the mother. The same 
will happen when the Moon is in either 6th or 
8th and Mars in the 7th associated with a male- 
fic. If either the Moon or Venus is associated 
with or aspected by or caught between malefics, 
there will be no comfort from mother. Similar 
is the fate when either the 4th sign or the lord 

,. of the 4th is associated with, aspected by or 
caught between malefics. 

6 — 1U If Venus is posited in the 7th place 
from the Moon and is associated with a malefic, 
there will be comfort from the mother. If Sat- 
ufh isin the 4th and aspected by -a malefic, the 



40 Fourth House 

' mother will die soon. With Saturn in the 4th 
and aspect of a benefic, the mother's death 
will take place after a very long time. If Sat- 
urn is in a malefic sign associated with a male- 
fic, the death of mother is certain. If the Moon 
is in the 5th place there will be comfort from 
the mother. Likewise is the case when the 
Moon or Mars is in the 10th or 9th house. 

12—18) If the Mooiris in the 7th associa- 
ted with a malefic, there will be no comfort from 
the mother. The same will happen when Jupi- 
ter is in Lagna, Saturn in the 2nd, and, Rahu in 
the 7th. The mother will not survive if Jupiter 
is in Lagna, Saturn in'the 2nd, and Rahu in the 
3rd, If the Sun is in the 3rd or 7th and Mars 
in Lagna, the mother will not live long. If the 
lord of the 3rd is in the 6th, 8th or 12th place 
and associated with the Moon, the native will 
be suckled by his step-mother. If the Moon is 
between malefics or if the malefics are at the 4th 
or 7th place from the Moon, the mother will 
die. If the lord of the 1st, 4th or 9th is in the 
1st, 5th or 9th house or in Kendra position, 
the mother and father will die together. 

19—25) When Saturn is in the 1st, 5th or 
9th place from the Moon, the native born in the 
night will lose his mother. If a benefic is in the 



Jaataka Tqttyam 41 

4th house or if the Maatru Kaaraka is strong 
associated with a benefic and posited in the 4th 
the mother will live for a long time. The mother 
will live long if the Moon is strong and Venus 
is associated with or aspected by a benefic. The 
same is the case when Venus or the Moon is in 
a benefic Navaamsa or in a Kendra. Find out 
the lord of the Navaamsa occupied by the lord 
of the 4th. If the lord of the Navaamsa occu- 
pied by that lord is in Kendra and strong, the 
native's mother will live long. 

More about mother 

24~^32J If the lord of the 4th is in Lagna 
and strong, the mother will be chaste. If the 
lord of the 4th is in 'Vaiseshika' amsa and 
aspected by a benefic, the mother will be chaste. 
The same is the case when the lord of the 4th is 
aspected by either a benefic or the Sun. If the 
lord of the 6th is associated with Mars and the 
Moon in the 4th aspected by a malefic, the 
mother will be unchaste. If the lord of the 4th 
together with Rahu is associated with a malefic, 
the mother will be unchaste; (maybe only men- 
tally.) If the lord of the 4th and the lord of 
the Lagna are mutually friendly and either asso- 

J~ 6 



42 ' Fourth House 

ciated with or aspected by a benefic the person 
will be friendly with the mother. Likewise is 
the case when the lord of the 4th is in Kendra 
and aspected by either the lord of the Lagna or 
a benefic. If there are malefics in the 4th house, 
the native will have two or more mothers; but 
if a benefic, only one mother. 

Happy with animals 

32 — 39) He who is born in a Taurus Nava- 
amsa will be happy with animals. If the aspect 
of benefics on the 4th house is great the person 
born in that Yoga will be happy with animals. 
A person will be happy throughout his life, if 
the lord of the Lagna is in Vargottama amsa, or 
own Navaamsa, in exaltation, or in a friendly 
decanate, and is aspected or associated with a 
benefic. If benefics are within the 4th house 
from Lagna, the baby will be happy in his 1st 
year. If Jupiter is in Kendra, and the lord of 
the Lagna in the Paaraavata amsa, the child 
will be happy in his younger years. With a bene- 
fic in the 9th, a malefic in the Lagna, and a bene- 
fic in the 2nd, and if they are in 'Devaloka 1 
amsa, the native will be happy in his childhood. 
If Venus is in Lagna, the native will be happy 
in the first half of his life. If the lord of Lagna 
is in a benefic's sign or aspected by a benefic 



Jaataka Tattvam 4$ 

and is in Gopura-amsa, the native will be 
happy in the 4th part of his life. 

Happy when? 

40—47) If either the lord of Lagna, or the 
lord of the Navaamsa is occupied by the lord of 
Lagna, or the lord of the 11th house is in Sagit- 
tarius , happiness will be after the 20th year. 
Happiness comes after the 30th year when either 
the lord of the Navaamsa occupied by the lord 
of Lagna or the lord of the Navaamsa occupied 
by the lord of the 11th is in Kendra, If bene- 
fics are in the 8th place from the 5th (i.e. in the 
12th house), happiness will be in middle age. 
Happiness will be in youth time, when Jupiter, 
the lord of the house occupied by the Moon, 
and the lord of Lagna are in Kendra. If bene- 
fics are in the 1st, 11th and 12th, and Jupiter in 
Kendra in the Simhaasana amsa, happiness to 
the native comes in his early and middle years. 
When benefics aspect the 1st, 2nd and 3rd signs 
and if Jupiter is in Paaraavata amsa in Lagna, 
a beneficial sign, there will be happiness of the 
native in his early and middle years. If malefics 
are in the 2nd, and benefics in the Kendra, and 
the lord of Lagna in Vargottama amsa, the per- 
son will be unhappy in his early years but happy 
later. If benefics are from the 9th to the 12th 



44 Fourth House 

houses, the person will be happy in his later life. 
If Venus is in Devaloka amsa and if Gopura 
amsa is rising in the Lagna and aspected by 
benefics, the person will be happy both in mid- 
dle and later years, 

Happiness 

49 — 60) If a benefic is in Lagna and is 
aspected by a benefic and unassociated with a 
malefic, the person will be happy. If five planets 
are in their own houses, the person will be extre- 
mely happy. If Jupiter aspects the lord of the 
4th the perspn will be happy. If a benefic is 
in the 4th, the person will be happy. He will be 
happy if the lord of the 4th is in the middle of 
benefics. If Jupiter being strong is associated 
with the lord of the 4th, the person will be 
happy. When the lord of the 4th is in Kendra 
or in the 1st, ,5th or 9th place associated with a 
benefic, the person is happy. If the lord of the 
4th is in Mrit amsa, the person is happy. If 
Jupiter is stronger than the lord of Lagna, the 
person will be happy. If the lord of the 4th and 
Jupiter are in Gopura amsa, the person will be 
happy. When the lord of the 4th is in the 2nd, 
6th, 3rd, 10th and 11th in benefic amsas* the 
person will be happy. If the Moon is in between 
two benefics, the person is happy. 



Jaataka Tattvam 45 

Sorrow 

61 — 74) He who is born in Aries amsa 
will be- sorrowful due to a cat or rat. He who is 
born in Leo Navaamsa will have sorrow from a 
dog. He who is born in Virgo Navaamsa will 
have sorrow from a spark of fire. When Mer- 
cury, Rahu and the Sun are in the 5th, Mars in 
the 4th and Saturn in the 8th ? the person will 
be sorrowful. If malefics are in Lagna, the per- 
son will be sorrowful, A malefic in the 4th and 
a weak Jupiter cause sorrow though the person 
is rich. The same is the case when the lord of 
the 4th is either weak or associated with a 
malefic. 

If the lord of the 4th is in the Navaamsa 
of a malefic or in a debilitated sign he will be 
sorrowful in spite of riches and sons. Mars 
associated with the Sun, and the lord of the 
4th , both being in the Navaamsa of malefics 
and unaspected by benefics, cause sorrow 
throughout life. When the Sun and Mars in the 
amsa of a debilitated sign or in the amsa of an 
inimical sign, although posited in the 4th, are 
aspected by a malefic from an evil amsa, there 
will be loss of house and property due to lack of 
care and attention. Further, the person will 
be unhappy. When the lord of the 8th is in 1 1th, 
the person will be unhappy in childhood. With 



Fourth House 

Saturn in Lagna, Rahu in the 8th and Mars in 
the 6th the person will be sorrowful. If the 
Moon is between malefics, the person w ju be 
unhappy. If the lord of Lagna is in the 12th 
and a malefic in the 10th and if Mars and the 
Moon are associated, the person is unhappy: 
Predictions about the house 

75—82) If the Moon and Venus are in the 
_ n place from the Navaamsa Lagna, the person 
wi]l have a multi-storied house. If a planet in 
exaltation is in the 4th place from the Nava- 
amsa Lagna, the native will have a multi-storied 
house. The same is the case when Rahu and 
the Sun are in the 4th house from the Navaamsa 
Lagna. If Ketu and Mars are in the 4th place 
from the Navaamsa Lagna, the person will have 
a brick house. A house made of timber will be 
there, if Jupiter is in the 4th place from the 
Navaamsa Lagna. If the Sun is in the 4th place 
from the Navaamsa Lagna the person will have 
a hut (made of grass). If the lord of Lagna is 
in the 4th and the lord of the 4th in Lagna, the 
person will have a house of his own. 

82-89) If the lord of ^e 4th is strong and 
in, Kendra and aspected by a benefic, the person 
w get a house. There will be gain of a house 
if the lord of the 4th is i n Vaiseshika amsa or 

m a most exalted position. If the lord of the 



Jaataka Tattvam 47 

Navaamsa occupied by the lord of the 4th is in 
Kendra, there will be gain of a house. With 
the lord of the 9th in Kendra, the lord of the 
4th in own exalted house or in a friendly sign, 
and a planet in exaltation in the 4th house, the 
gain of a beautiful house can be predicted. A 
benefic in the 3rd sign, the lord of the 4th and 
the lord of the Navaamsa occupied by the lord 
of the 4th, both being strong, give to the native 
a storied house with compound. If the lord of 
the 4th is to the amsa of Simhaasana, Gopura 
or Mrit amsa the above Yoga will result. If the 
lord of the 4th is in Paaraavata amsa and the 
Moon in Gopura amsa aspected by Jupiter the 
person will get a house blessed by the gods. If 
the lords of the 4th and 10th are associated with 
the Moon and Saturn, a most pleasing house 
will be obtained. 

90—97) If the lords of the 4th and Lagna 
are in the 4th sign, there will be gain of a house 
in a most unexpected fashion. The number of 
malefics that are with the lords of the 10th, 4th, 
2nd and 12th and are posited in the 6th, 8th or 
12th will be the number of houses consumed by 
fire. If Rahu and the Sun are in the Nayaamsa 
Lagna and aspected by Mars, the person's house 
will be burnt to ashes. If the Sun is in Kendra 
or in the 1st, 5th or 9th, the person's house will 



48 



Fourth House 



fall down due to decay and degeneration. There 
will "oe destruction of the house, if the lord f 
the 4th is in the 6th and aspected by a malefic. 
If the lord of the Navaamsa occupied by the lord 
of the 4th is in the 6th sign, the destruction of 
the house can be predicted. If the lord of the 
4th is in the 8th, the house will fall down to 
pieces. The number of malefics with which the 
lords of the 4th 5 2nd and Lagna are associated 
will be the number of houses which will meet 
with destruction. But if they are aspected by 
benefics, such a destruction will not take place. 
Living in same or several houses 

98—101) If the 4th is a moveable sign and 

if the lord of the 4th or the Kaaraaka of 'griha' 

^in a fixed -sign, the person will have to live 

in, several houses. But if the 4th is a fixed sign 

and if the lord of the 4th or the Kaaraka of 

'griha* [ s [ n a fixed sign, the person will live 

in the same house. If in the 4th sign a benefic 

Shadvarga is rising the native will remain j n the 

same house. Of the lords of Lagna, the 2nd and 

4th the number of planets that are in Kendra, 

the 1st, 5th or 9th give the number of houses 

which will give benefit to the native. 

House with fittings 

102— Hi; If the lords of the 11 th and 2nd 
are in the 4th and the lord of the 4th is in 



Jaataka Tattvam 49 

Vaiseshika amsa and aspected by a benefic, the 
person will obtain a house with a lot of property 
(or fittings). If the lord of the 4th is in the 10th 
and the lord of the 10th in the 4th, and Mars is 
strong, the person will have much landed pro- 
perty. If the lords of the 10th and 4th 
are strong and mutually friendly, the person 
will have much landed property. The same is 
the case when either the 4th sign or the lord of 
the 4th is associated with a benefic. Similar 
result comes when the lord of the 4th is in x t,he 
sign Gopura amsa of the 5th sign. If the lord 
of the 4th is associated either with the lord of 
the 3rd or with the Kaaraka of the brother the 
person will obtain land from brother. If the 
lord of the Lagna is strong and is in the 4th and 
the lord of the 4th is strong and is in Lagna and 
aspected by benefics, the person will purchase 
land by self-effort. If Venus, the Kaaraka of 
spouse, is in the 4th and the lord of the 4th in 
the 7th and are mutually friendly, the person 
will get land through his wife. If the lord of the 
6th is in the 4th and the lord of the 4th is in the 
6th and the latter is stronger than the former, 
the person will get land through his enemy. If 
the lord of the 4th is strong and in own house, 

/— 7 



50 Fourth House 

or in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th and aspected by 
a benefic, there will be gain of landed property. 

Loss pr destruction of land 

112 — 12l> If the lord of the 4th is in a 

debilitated sign, or in an inimical house, or 
eclipsed, or between malefics, or aspected by a 
malefic, there will be destruction of land. If 
Mars is between malefics or aspected by a male- 
fic, or in a malefic Navaamsa, there will be loss 
of landed property. If the lord of the 4th is in 
an evil Shadvarga or a malefic is in the 4th sign 
the land will be lost. The same fate will over- 
take if the lord of the 4th is in the 6th, 8th or 
12th sign. If the lord of the 4th is in the 2nd 
sign associated with a malefic, or in a debilitated 
sign or in an inimicial sign, the person will lose 
his landed property. If the lord of the 10th 
associated with a malefic is in the 4th, there will 
be loss of land. If the lord of the 10th is in the 
malefic inimical or cruel amsa or in bad Shad- 
varga of the 4th house there will be destruction 
of land. When the lord of the 4th is in the 10th 
along with the Sun, the land will be lost due to 
the anger of the king. A similar fate comes 
when the lord of the 4th associated with a 
malefic also comes together with the lord of the 



Jaataka Tattvam 51 

Navaamsa occupied by the lord in whose Nava- 
amsa the lord of the 2nd is posited. 

Sale of land 

117) If the lord of the 4th is in exaltation, 
and the lord of the 2nd is a malefic and is in a 
debilitated inimical sign, the person will sell 
his land. 

Predictions about friendship 

122—126) If the lord of the Lagna and the 
lord of the 5th are friendly the Sun will be fri- 
endly towards the father. If the lord of the 
Lagna and the lord of the 7th are friendly, there 
will be friendly relationship between husband and 
wife. If the lord of the Lagna and the lord of 
the 4th are friendly, there will be friendship 
with many people- If the lord of the Lagna 
and the lord of the 4th are in a friendly sign, 
the person will be supported by his friend. If 
there are several benefics aspecting the 4th sign, 
the person will be a friend of many people. 

Being worshipped by relatives 

127 — 130) If a beneficial planet is in the 
4th sign and aspected by a benefic, and theKaa- 
raka of the bhaava is also strong, the person 
will be worshipped by his relatives. The same is 
the case when there is Jupiter in the 4th sign 



52 Fourth House 

and the lcftd of the 4th is associated with a bene- 
fit If a planet is in an exalted sign, in a frien- 
dly sign, in the 4th sign, and aspected by Jupi- 
ter, the native will be worshipped by his rela- 
tives . A similar result comes when three 
planets are in their own houses. 

Being helpful to relatives 

131-134) If the lord of the 4th is in Ken- 
dra, or in the 1st, 5th, or 9th, or in the Vaise- 
shika amsa, and not aspected by any malefic, or 
associated with a- malefic, the person will be 
very helpful to his relatives. If the lord of the 
2nd is in the 11th, or in Trikona (1,5,9), and if 
the 4th sign is aspected by a benefic, the person 
will be very helpful to his relatives. Similar is 
the result when the lord of the 4th is in Kendra 
or in his own Navaamsa which is beneficial. 

To be forsaken by relatives 

135—138) If the lord of the 4th is associa- 
ted with a malefic and in a cruel Shadvarga and 
is weak, the person will be forsaken by his rela- 
tives. The person will be reviled by his rela- 
tives, if the lord of the 4th or the Kaaraka of 
the 4th bhaava is associated with many malefics. 
If the 4th is a malefic sign, or if a debilitated 
planet joins with an eclipsed planet and not 



Jaataka Tattvam 53 

aspected by any benefic the person will deride 
his relatives. If four planets are in a good sign, 
the person will be fostered by his relatives. 

About beds 

139_144) If the lord of the 12th is asso- 
ciated with a benefic, or in a benefic Varga or 
in its own exalted sign, the person will sleep on 1 
a cot. There will be no comfort in the bed if 
the lord of the 12th is associated with a malefic. 
Even if the lord of the 12th is a malefic, if he is 
in the Vprga of a benefic, there will be comfort 
in affairs of the bed. There will be no comfort 
in the bed if the lord of Lagna is in the 6th, 8th 
or 12th place. The same is the case when the 
lord of Lagna is in debilitation. If the lord of 
Lagna is associated with Saturn, Maandi or 
Rahu, there will be no comfort in the bed. 

EFFECTS OF THE 5th (Children's) HOUSE 

Intelligent man 

1—5) If the 5th house is that of a benefic, 
or aspected or associated with a benefic, the 
native will be intelligent. If the lord &f the 5th 
is in exaltation or flanked by benefics the person 
will be intelligent. If Jupiter is In a quadratit 



54 i Fifth House 

or in Lagna, the 6th or 9th house the person 
will be intelligent. If the lord of the 5th house 
is in a beneficial sign, and Jupiter is in the 5th 
the native will be intelligent. If Mercury is in 
the 5th and the lord of the 5th is in a quadrant 
and is strong, the person will be intelligent. 

Of memory 

6 — %) If the lord of the 5th is in a quadr- 
ant associated with a benefic, the person will 
not be forgetful; he will have a tenacious 
memory. If the lord of the 5th or the Kaaraka 
is posited in an inimical amsa and aspected by 
a benefic, the person will not be forgetful. 
When the lord of the 5th Is in the Gopura amsa 
the native will be more watchful and have a 
good memory. 
Good remarks 

9—15) The Kaaraka of the 5th bhaava 
posited in Gopura amsa makes the person con- 
siderate to others' points of view and intelli- 
gent. If the Sun and the Moon are in the 5th 
or 9th house the native will be fickle-minded. 
Even if Jupiter is in a quadrant, the person will 
be unsteady. If Mercury, the Moon and Mars 
are aspected by strong planets, the native will 
be alert and quick-witted. With Mercury in the 
2nd and aspected by a weak malefic the person 



Jaataka Tattvam 55 

will be fickle-minded. If Mercury and the lord 
of the 3rd are associated together, the person 
will be good-natured filled with saatwik quali- 
ties. If the lord of the 12th is in Lagna, the 
native will speak charmingly expressing gooci 
sentiments. 

16 — 21) With the Moon in Lagna and the 
aspect of Saturn and Mars, the person will fee 
mean-minded. With the lord of the 5th in a 
cruel 6$ amsa, the person will be petty-minded. 
If Saturn, Mars and the Sun aspect the Moon, 
the native will be a fool. With the Moon in 
the 6th, 8th or 12th house and aspected by 
Venus, the person will be astonishingly good. 
If the lord of the 5th is associated with a male- 
fic, similar result is expected. If the Kaaraka 
for offspring is associated with a malefic or is 
in an evil amsa, the native will have a surpri- 
sing nature. 

Regarding idiots 

22—28) If Saturn, the Moon and Gulika 
are in quadrants the native will be a dull-witted 
fool. With Gulika in the 2nd associated with 
the Sun and aspected by a malefic or with the 
lord of the 3rd associated with Saturn, the 
native will be an idiot. If the lord of the 2nd 
is associated with a malefic and posited in the 



56 Fifth House 

lOfb, the person will be shy in public and be- 
have foolishly. If the lord of the 3rd is asso- 
ciated with Rahu, the native will be an idiot. 
The same result happens when Saturn is in the 
5th and the lord of Lagna is aspected by Saturn 
and if the lord of the 5th is associated with a 
malefic. If Gulika and Saturn are in the 5th 
and are not associated with a benefic, the native 
will be idiot. If Jupiter is in the 5th house, 
even an intelligent person will forget his know- 
ledge. 

Regarding learned and wise men 

29—34} If Ketu is in the Navaamsa Lagna 
and aspected by Venus the person will perform 
sacrifices or officiate in sacrifices. If two male- 
fics are. in the 5th and the 9th places from the 
Navaamsa Lagna the native will be a necroman- 
cer or magician. If two malefics are in the 9th 
place from the Navaamsa Lagna, and aspected 
by an evil planets the native will be an exorcist. 
With malefics in the 5th and the 9th places from 
the Navaamsa Lagna and aspected by benefics, 
the person will be of assistance to others. If 
the Navaamsa Lagna is aspected by Mercury, 
the Moon and Venus and if the lord of the 2nd 
is in the 7th house, the native will be a phy- 
sician. If Venus and the Moon aspect the Nava- 
amsa Lagna, the person will be an alchemist. 



Jaataka Tattvam 57 

35—40) If the 5th house from the Nava- 
amsa Lagna is occupied by the Moon and Jupi- 
ter who are associated with malefics, the person 
will write sacred books. If Jupiter is in the 2nd 
or 5th place from Navaamsa Lagna the person 
will be a grammarian. If Mercury or Jupiter is 
in the 2nd, 3rd or 5th place from the Navaamsa 
Lagna, the person will be learned in the Miraa- 
amsaa literature. He will be a logician if Jupi- 
ter and Mars are in the 5th, 2nd or 3rd place from 
the Navaamsa Lagna. He will be learned in 
saankhyaa philosophy, if Jupiter and the Moon 
are in the 2nd, 3rd or 5th place from Navaamsa 
Lagna. He will be learned in Vedaanta and 
music, if Jupiter and the Sun are in the 2nd, the 
3rd or the 5th place from Navaamsa Lagna. 

Mathematical skill 

41—45) With Jupiter and Ketu in the 2nd, 
3rd or 5th place from the Navaamsa Lagna the 
person will be skilled in Mathematics. The 
same happens when Mars is in the 2nd and as- 
pected by a benefic. If the Moon and Mars are 
associated and aspected by Mercury, or if Mars 
or Mercury are in quadrants, the native will be 
a mathematician. The same is the prediction 

J— 8 



58 Fifth House 

when Mercury or Jupiter is the lord of the 8th 
and is strong and posited in Lagna, and Saturn 
is in the 8th house. A strong Jupiter in qua- 
drant or in the 1st, the 5th or the 9th house with 
Venus or Mercury in the 2nd makes the person 
a mathematician. 

Astrological skill 

46 — 42) If Mercury and Venus and in the 
3rd and the 2nd houses the person will be 
proficient among astrologists. The same result 
comes when the lord of the 2nd is strong and 
Mercury is in a quadrant, the 11th, the 1st, 
the 5th or the 9th house. If Jupiter is in its 
high exaltation or in the 2nd house, the person 
will be the best among astrologists. 

General remarks 

49* — 54) If Mercury associated with Mars 
is in a benefical sign the person will give delight 
to learned men. If Mercury and Mars are in 
the Saturn signs of Capricorn and Aquarius and 
aspected by the Sun, the person will delight the 
official pandits (i.e. learned men of the Govern- 
ment). If the lord of the 5th is strong and is in 
a quadrant, the 1st, the 5th or the 9th house 
the person will be a Vidwaan. If the lord of 
Lagna is in the 2nd or the 11th house, the per- 
son will not only be learned in arts but also in 



Jaataka Tattvam 59 

the Saastras/sciences. The lord of the 5th in 
the 10th or the 11th house makes the person a 
learned one. The lord of the 10th in Lagna 
makes the person a poet. 

55—60) The lord of the 1 1th in own house 
(i.e. the 11th) will also make him a poet. If 
the lord of the 4th is in Lagna or the 7th house, 
the person will be very learned but dumb in 
public. If Jupiter is in the 5th or 9th house 
from the Moon and Mars is in the 5th or the 
9th house from Mercury, the person will be 
skilled in all arts. If Jupiter or Venus is lord 
of the 2nd and aspected by the Sun or Mars 5 
the person will be a logician. If Jupiter and 
Venus are in their exaltation, own house or in 
Moolatrikona, the person will be skilled in 
logic. If Jupiter is strong and the lord of the 
house occupied by Jupiter is aspected by the 
Sun and Venus, the person will be skilled in 
seven saastras (i.e. several sciences). 

Knowledge ofVedaanta 

61—65) If Mercury is the lord of the 2nd 
house and in exaltation, and Saturn is in Gop- 
ura amsa Jupiter in Simhaasana amsa, the per- 
son will be learned in the Vedaana philosophy. 
With Saturn in Paaraavata amsa and aspected 
by. Mercury and Jupiter, the person will be lear* 



60 Fifth House 

ned in Vedaanta. The same is the result when 
Jupiter is in a quadrant or in the 1st, the 5th or 
the 9th house. Venus in Vargottama amsa posi- 
ted in Lagna makes the person a Vedaantist. The 
same is the case when the Moon is in Devaloka 
amsa or Vargottama amsa and Venus is in a 
quadrant. 

66 — 69) With Jupiter in a quadrant, Venus 
in Simhaasanaamsa and Mercury in Navaamsa 
or Gopura amsa of the lord of the 2nd house, 
the person will be skilled in six Saastas/sciences. 
Determine the lord of the Navaamsa occupied 
by the lord of the sign where is posited the lord 
of the 2nd house. If this lord is Saturn or 
Mars and associated with malefics in a quadrant, 
the 1st, 5th, or 9th house, the person will be 
proficient in six Saastras. If the lord of the 
Navaamsa occupied by the Sun is in Vaiseshika 
amsa is strong and is in the 2nd house the per- 
son will be skilled in six Saastras. A strong 
Jupiter in the 2nd house and the lord of the 
Navaamsa occupied by the lord of the 2nd in a 
quadrant and aspected by a benefic make the 
person master of six Saastras. 

Mastery ofVedaanta 

70—73) If the lord of Lagna is in the 2nd 
and the lord of the 2nd in Paaraavata amsa the 



Jaataka Tattvam 61 

person will be learned in Vedaanta philosophy. 
The same is the case when Mercury is in exal- 
tation and in Lagna, the lord of the 2nd inPaa- 
raavata amsa and Venus in the 12th house. If 
the Kaaraka for offspring is in a quadrant or in 
the 1st, the 5th or the 9th house arid aspected 
by a benefic, the person will be able to anti- 
cipate and predict coming events. If Jupiter is 
in his own Navaamsa or in M ridvarnsa the per- 
son will know the past, the present, and the 
future. 

74—78) The same in the case when Jupiter 
is ill Gopura amsa and aspected by a benefic. 
With the lord of the 10th in Devalokaamsa and 
aspected by a benefic, the person will be absor- 
bed in contemplation of brahmam. The same is 
the case when the lord of the 9th is in Paaraa- 
vata amsa and aspected by a benefic. If Jupiter, 
Ketu, Rahu and Saturn are associated together 
in a sign and aspected by Venus, even a low- 
born will become a Vidwaan. Rahu and the 
Sun associated with a benefic and posited in 
their Navaamsa Lagna together with a malefic 
planet will make the person proficient in 
poisonous cures. 



62 Fifth House 

Lack of children due to snake curse 

. ■. 79 — 83) If all planets are weak, the person 
will be childless. If Rahu is in the 5th and 
aspected by Mars, the person will be childless 
due to the curse of snake-god. The same is the 
case when Saturn is in the 5th house and aspec- 
ted by the Moon and the lord of the 5th is 
associated with Rahu. If the Kaaraka for off- 
spring is associated with Rahu and the lord of 
the 5th is weak and Mars is associated with the 
lord of the Navaamsa, the person will be child- 
less due to snake curse. If the Kaaraka for off- 
spring is in the 5th house, Rahu is associated 
with the lord of Lagna and the lord of the. 5th 
in the 6th, the 8th or the 12th place, the person 
will be child less due to snake curse. 

84— 87) With Mars in own t Navaamsa and 
Mercury being the lord of the 5th associated 
with a malefic, the same result will occur". The 
same is the case when Mars is lord of the 5th 
and Rahu is in the 5th aspected by a benefic. 
Also when the lords of Lagna and the 5th house 
are weak and malefics are in the 5th. If the 
lord of Lagna is associated with Rahu and the 
lord of the 5th with Mars, childlessness results 
due to snake curse. 



Jaataka Tattvam 63 

Childlessness due to Pitru- curse 

88—92) If the Sun is lord of the 5th and 
is posited between malefics or in t£e 1st, the 5th 
or the 9th house and aspected by a malefic the 
person will become childless due to the curse of 
Pitrus (deceased forefathers). A similar fate 
comes when the Sun is in the 5th arid is flanked 
by malefics, and Saturn and Mars are debilita- 
te d. Also when Jupiter is in Leo and the lord 
of the 5th is associated with the Sun, and male- 
fics are in Lagna and the 5th house. With the 
Sun in the 8th, Saturn in the 5th, and the lord 
of the 5th associated with Rahu, the person will 
be childless due to Pitru curse. The same is 
the case when the lord of the 12th is in Lagna, 
the lord of the 8th in the 5th, and the lord of 
the 10th in the 8th. 

Childlessness due to maternal curse 

93—96) If the Moon is lord of the 5th and 
is weak and is between two malefics and if evil 
planets are in the 4th and the 5th houses the 
person will be childless due to the curse of 
deceased mother's spirits. If Lagna is Scorpio 
and Saturn posited therein, malefics in the 4th 
and the Moon in the 5th, the same fate over- 
takes the person. A similar misfortune happens 
when the lord of the 5th is in the 6th, the 8th 



64 Fifth House 

or the 12th house, the lord of Lagna is debili- 
tated, and the Moon is associated with malefics. 
Also when the Moon is the lord of the 5th and 
associated with Saturn, Rahu and Mars. 

97—100) If Mars is lord of the 4th and 
associated with Rahu and Saturn, and the Sun # 
and the Moon are in Lagna, the person is cursed 
with childlessness by mother's spirit. The same 
prediction can be made if the lord of the 4th is 
in the 8th, if the lords of Lagna and the 5th are 
in the 7th, and the lords of the 10th and the 
6th are in Lagna. Also when Rahu, the Sun, 
Mars and Saturn are in the 5th, the 1st, the 8th 
and the 6th houses, and when the lord of Lagna 
is in the 6th, the 8th or the 12th house. If 
Rahu, Mars and Jupiter are in the 6th, the 8th 
and the I2th houses, and Saturn and the Moon 
are in the 5th, a similar misfortune occurs. 

Childlessness 

The person is childless ; 

101 — 103> If the Sun is in Lagna and Mars 
in the 5th. Also when the lord of the 5th is in 
the 6th, the 8th or the 12th house from Jupiter 
and the lords of the 5th, the 9th and Lagna 
are in the 6th, the 8th, and the 12ih- places from 
Lagna; or when Jupiter is in the 5th and male- 
fics in the 5th place from Jupiter.

Conceptionlessness 

There will be no conception ; 

KM— 106) ,With the Sun in Lagna and 
Saturn in the 7th, or with the Sun and Saturn 
in the 7th, and Jupiter aspect ing the 10th house; 
also when Saturn and Mars are in the 6th or in 
the 4th house; or when Saturn is together with 
the lord of the 6th and occupies the 6th house, 
and the Moon is in the 7th. 

Death of children 

107—111) If either the 5th house or the 
lord of the 5th is flanked by malefic planets; or 
the Kaaraka for offspring associated with a 
malefic. When the lords of Navaamsas occu- 
pied by the lords of the 7th, 9th and 5th houses 
are in evil amsas and associated with malefic 
planets. If the lord of the 5th is an evil Nava- 
msa, or in a debilitated sign, or in the 7th 
house and aspected by malefics. When the lord 
of the 5th is associated with or aspected by the 
lord of Triamsa where the lord of the amsa 
occupied by the lord of the 12th is. 

Ailment for son 

If the lord of the 5th -is in an evil Shasbth-

yamsa aspected by a malefic, the son will suffer 
from ailment. 

Destruction of family tree 

There will be an end to the family line .• 
112 — \23) If Mercury and the lord of Lagna 
are in quadrants other then the Lagna quadrant. 
When evil planets are in the 12th, 5th and the 
8th houses; also w&en the Moon and Jupiter are 
in Lagna and either Mars or Saturn is in the 
7th; or if a malefic planet is in the 4th house. 
If malefics are in Lagna, the 12th, the 5th or 
the 8th place. The Moon is in the 5th and 
malefics in the 8th, Lagna and the 12th house. 
If Mercury, Venus and Saturn are in the 12th, 
malefic planets in the 4th, and Jupiter in the 5th; 
if malefic, planets are in the 8th place from the 
Moon; with a malefic in Lagna, the Moon in 
the 4th, the lord of Lagna in the 5th, and the 
lord of the 5th weak. When malefics are in the 
5th house; also when Venus is in the 7th, the 
Moon in the 10th, and a malefic in the 4th 
house; so also when Mars is in Lagna, Saturn 
in the 8th, and the Sun in the 4th house. 

Unhappiness due to childlessness 

124-133) If the lord of the 3rd and the 
Moon are in quadrants, the 1st, the 5th or the 
9th place; when the lord of the 5th is in the 



Jaataka Tattvam 67 

7th house or Lagna and is strong" and associated 
with the lord of the 6th, or aspected by it. If 
the lords of the 5th and the 9th are associated 
with the lord of the 7th and posited in the 6th, 
the 8th or the 12th house and are weak, and the 
5th house is not aspected by a benefic. If Saturn, 
Venus and Mars are in the 7th house. If Saturn 
and Mars are in the 9th or 1 Oth house childless* 
ness will result. If Saturn and Mars are in Leo 
(which happens to be 5th house), and the lord 
of the 5th is in the 6th house. If Aries or 
Scorpio (the house of Mars) happens to be the 
5th house and Rahu is posited therein, and 
aspected by Mars. The same is the case when 
Jupiter or Venus is in a weak sign, Mercury in 
an even sign, and the Sun in an odd sign. 

Loss of children 

134— L 138) If the 5th is either associated 
with or aspected by an evil planet, there will be 
abortion. If the Sun in all its rays is in the 5th 
house, the person will lose every child that is 
born. ,A similar fate overtakes the person if a 
malefic is in the 5th house. He will be child- 
less, if Saturn is in the 5th house. There will 
be loss of children if the Sun is in the 5th house. 
The same is the fate if the lord of the, 3rd is in 
the 12th, the 1st, the 2nd or the 5th house. If 



68 Fifth House 

malefics are in trines, and the waning Moon in 
Lagna, and Jupiter in eclipse posited in Saturn's 
house, the person will get children; but the 
children will not last long. A similar fate is 
predicted when Mercury is in the 5th, and male- 
fics are in Lagna and the 4th house. 

Childlessness 

139—146) If Sagittarius or Pisces happens 
to be the 5th house, there will be no child born. 
Childlessness is the result of Saturn and Mercury 
being in Lagna, and Venus and Jupiter in Scor-. 
pio. If the lord of Lagna is in the 6th and 
aspected by Mercury and the Moon, and if the 
Sun is in the 6th or the 12th house. When the 
lord of the 5th is in the 7th amsa and is asso- 
ciated with a malefic. Also when Jupiter ox 
the lord of the 5th is weak and associated With 
a malefic. Again when the lord of Lagna is 
associated with a malefic, and the lord of the 
5th is in the 6th, the 8th or the 12th house. And 
when Jupjter is in the 1st, the 5th or the 9th 
house associated with a malefic. Or when the 
lord of Lagna is in the house of Mars (Aries 
or Scorpio), and the lord of the 5th. in the 
6th house.

tutelary god; this will be indicated in his horo- 
scope by ^Saturn posited in the 6th houre and 
aspected by Mercury, the Moon and the Sun 
and the Lagna being aspected by a malefic, A 
similar fate is indicated when the Sun is in' 
Saturn's house. (Aquarius or Capricorn) and 
aspected by a malefic, and the Lagna is in a 
malefic Shadvarga, If Rahu, the Sun and Mars 
are inthe 5th house, the person will get a child 
after performing purificatory ceremonies.. The 
person will be childless if the lord of the 12this 
either in the 10th or Lagna position. Also 
when Virgo is the Lagna where is posited the 
Sun, and Mars is in the 5th house. 

Yoga for having children 

151 — 158J If the lord of Navaamsa occu- 
, pied by the lord of the 7th is aspected by the 
lords of the 1st, the 2nd and the 9th the person 
will have progen; the same fortune conies when 
the lord of the 5th is either associated with or 
aspected .by the benefics and posited in either 
Lagna or the 5th house; also when the lord of 
Lagna is in the 5th and Jupiter and the lord of 
the 5th gain strength; and again when a strong 
Jupiter is in the 5th aspected by the lord of 
Lagna; or when Jupiter and the lord of the 5th. 



fO Fifth House 

are in Vaiseshika amsa and aspected by bene- 
fics; and when then , the lord of the 2nd is strong 
and occupies the 5th house and aspected by 
Jupiter; when the lord of the 5th and the lord 
of Lagna aspect each other; when the lord of 
the 5th and the lord of Lagna occupy each 
other's house despite association with other 
planets or aspects by them; 

159-166) When the lords of the 5th and 
Lagna are in quadrants aspected by benefics; 
Wten the lord of the Navaamsa occupied by the 
lord of the 5th is either associated with or as- 
pected by benefics. When the lord of the 9tb 
and Lagna are in the 7th and the lord of the 2nd 
in Lagna; when the lord of the 5th is in Mrk 
dvamsa; when the lord of the 6th is in Gopura 
amsa; when the lord of the Navaamsa occupied 
by the lord of the 5th is in Lagna and the lord 
of Navaamsa occupied by the lord of Lagna is 
in the 5th house; when the lord of Navaamsa 
occupied by the lord of Lagna is in the 5th 
house; when the lord of Navaamsa occupied by 
Jupiter is in a quadrant; and when the lords of 
the 9th, the 1st and the 5th are in paaraavata 
amsas and aspected by benefics. 

Birth after long delay and difficulty 

167—170; If the lords of the 1st, the 9th 



Jaataka Tattvam 71 

* 

and the 5th are associated with benefics and 
posited in the 6th, the 8th and the 12th houses, 
the person will have progeny after along delay. 
There will be delay in getting children if the 
5th house happens to be Aries, Taurus or Can- 
cer, and Rahu or Ketu occupies it. If a bene- 
fic is in the 10th and a malefic in the 5th the 
baby will be born after long delay. If the lord 
of the 5th is in debilitated house, the lord of 
the 9th in Lagna, and Mercury and Ketu are in 
the 5th 5 the child will be born after great 
difficulty. 

Year of birth 

171 — 173) If a malefic or Jupiter is in the 
4th house, and the Moon in the 6th or the 5th,' 
the person wil 1 get a baby in his 30th year. With 
a malefic in an evil sign and a powerful Sun 
in Lagna and Mars in an even sign, one can pre 
diet the birth of a baby after the 30th year. If 
the Moon is in Cancer and aspected by a male- 
fic or associated with it, and the Sun is aspected 
by Saturn, the person will get his son in his 
60th year. 

Male or female determination 

: ' 174—176) If the lord of Lagna is in the 
1st or the 3rd house, the person will get bis 1st 
born as a son. This is the case if the Moon, 



72 . Fifth House 

* Mars and Venus are in dual signs. If a malefic 
is in the 11 th, and the Moon and Venus in the 
5tb, the 1st born will be a female. 

Determination of number of children 

177—182) If Cancer is in the 5th heuse 
and the Moon is posited there, the person will 
have daughters or few sons. As many male 
planets aspecting the 5th house will be the num- 
ber of sons born to a person. The number of 
girls will be determined by the number of fem- 
ale planets aspecting the 5th house. If Rahu 
is in the 11th house the person will get progeny 
in his old age. If the lord of the 5th is weak 
and is in the 6th, the 8th or the 12th house and 
associated with a malefic, the wife will bear 
only one child. The same is the case if the lord 
of the 5th is weak and associated with Saturn. 

183—190) If the 5th house is not aspected 
by either Mars or Venus, the person will have 
no childy although he marries twice or thrice. 
If the sign of Venus (Taurus or Libra) is a trine 
and is occupied by the Moon, the person will 
have only one son. If Rahu or Ketu is in the 
5th house, the person will have a bad son. If 
the Sun is in the 5tb and aspected by a benefic 
the person will have three sons. If Capricorn 
is the 5th house and Saturn is posited there the 



Jaataka Tattvam 73 

person will have three sons. The same is the 

case if Mars is in Capricorn which happens to 

be the 5th house. With Aquarius as the 6th 

and Saturn posited there, the person will have 

five sons. If the Sun, Mars or Jupiter is in the 

5th house, the person will get 1, 3 or 5 spns 

respectively. 
/. 

Birth of many daughters 

191—195) If the Moon, Mercury, Venus 

or Saturn is in the 5th house the person will get 

2, 3, 5 or 7 daughters respectively. If Mercury is 

in the 5th and.the lord of the 5th is in the 6th 3 

the person will lose his sons and have only 

daughters. There will be many daughters born 

if Mercury is in the 5th or the 7th house. If the 

lord of the 5th is in Samarksha Varga in an even 

sign and associated with Mercury and Saturn 

and aspected by either Venus or the Moon, the 

"person will have only daughters. If the 5th 

house is an even sign and is the Varga of Venus 

or the Moon, and is aspected by Venus and the 

Moon, the person will have many daughters born 

to him. 

Yoga for many children 

/ 196— 20 1) If the 5th sign is odd, and in the 

/— 10 



74 Fifth House 

Varga of Venus and the Moon, and is occupied 
by Venus and the Moon, the person will have 
many sons. If the 5th is the house of Venus 
(Taurus or Libra) or the Navaamsa of Venus, 
and aspected by Venus, the native will have 
many children. With Mercury, Venus or the 
Moon in the 11th house the person will have 
many daughters. The same is the case if the 
lord of the 5th is either in the 2nd or the 8th 
house. If the 5th house happens to be the Lagna 
or the Moon's Lagna, and is a beneficial sign, 
and associated with a benefic, the person will 
have sons; if otherwise, he will have no son. If 
the lord of the 5th is a male planet and in a 
male sign and in a male Navaamsa, the person's 
first-born will be a son. If otherwise, i.e. the 
lord of the 5th being a female planet in a female 
sign and female Navaamsa, the first-born will be 
a daughter. 

Determining the character of children 

202—219; If the lords of the 5th and Lagna 
are equal, the person will have an indifferent 
attitude to his son. If the lords of the 5th and 
Lagna aspect each other, the son will be obedi- 
ent to the father. The same is the case if the 
lords of the 5th and Lagna are in each other's 
Navaamsa. If the lord of the 5th is in Lagna 



Jaataka Tattvam % 75 

and the lord of Lagna is in the 5th the son will 
obey his father. The same is the case when the 
Lagna is aspected by the lord of the 5th and the 
5th house is aspected by the lord of Lagna. If 
the 51b house is occupied either by the Moon or 
Venus, the person will have a daughter. There 
will be no progeny, if Saturn associated with 
the Moon is in the 11th house. If the 5th house 
is one of the Vargas of Jupiter and is also a 
beneficial sign, the person will have legitimate 
children. ] 

If the 5th sign is the house of Saturn or the 
amsa of Saturn and is occupied by the Moon, 
and associated with Mars or Saturn, the person 
will have an adopted son. With Mars and Saturn 
in the 4th, adoption of a son can be predicted. 
He who is born in Vamsa Viccheda (destruction 
of the line) Yoga will have an adopted son. If 
Saturn is in the 5th with Mercury and the Moon, 
the person will have an adopted son for a price. 
Danger to pregnancy is proportionate to the 
number of malefic planets and the. absence of 
benefics aspecting the Navaamsa occupied by the 
lord of the 5th. -No child will be born if male- 
fics are in the 5th place from that occupied by 
Jupiter; and conversely, if benefics are in the 
w 5th position from Jupiter there will be the ble- 
ssing of children. If Ketu is in the Navaamsa 



76 " Fifth House 

» 
Lagna and aspected by Mercury and Venus, the 
person will have a son born to his concubine. 
The same is the case when Venus is in the 
Saturn amsa of the 12th house. 



EFFECTS OF THE 6th (Enemies) HOUSE 

1) If the lord of the 6th is in the 6th the 
relative will be his enemy. If the lords of the 
5th and Lagna are inimical to each other, and 
the lord of the 4th is in the 6th and aspected by 
the lord of Lagna, the person will have his son 
as an enemy. 

Relations with son 

2—3) If the lord of the 5th is in the 6th 
or the 12th the son will be the native's enemy. 

Inimical to mother 

4-6) If the lord of the 4th and the 11th 
are inimical to the lord of Lagna, the person 
will be inimical towards his mother. The same 
will be the effect if the lord of the 4th is either 
associated with or aspected by a malefic. If the 
lord of the 4th is in the 6th or in the 6th house 
from the house occupied by the lord of the 
4th the person will be inimical towards his 
mother. 



Jaataka Tgttvam 77 

Relations with father 

7—9) If a planet malefic to the lord of 
Lagna or to the lord of the 10th occupies the 
10th house, or is in the 6th from Lagna or the 
house occupied by the lord of . Lagna, the 
father will be the enemy of the native. If the 
lord of the 5th is in the 6th, the 8th or the* 12th 
and aspected by the lord of Lagna, the native 
will revile his father. The same is the case when 
the lord of the 5th is in the 6th, the 7th or the 
12th and aspected by Rahu or Mars. 

Affliction by enemies 

10 — 12,) There will be affliction by enem- 
ies if the lord of the 6th is in a quadrant and 
aspected by a malefic. The is the case if the 
6th is occupied by a malefic, the lord of Lagna 
is in the 6th and the lord of the 6th in Lagna. 
Also when the lord of the 6th is weak and is 
flanked by malefics or aspected by a malefic. 
Woman* s enmity - 

13) A woman will be the enemy, if the 
lords of Lagna and the 7th are inimical to each 
other. 

Affliction by wounds 

14 — 17J If Mars is in Scorpio and unaspec- 
ted by Jupiter or Venus, the 1 ! person will suffer 



78 Sixth House 

from septic affliction. The same affliction 
comes, when Ketu and Saturn are in the 7th

9th. If the lord of the 7th is together with a 
malefic the native will specially be a debauchee. 
If the Moon and Saturn are together in the 7th 
the couple will be profligates. Mercury in the 
7th makes the person a debauchee. He will be 
a rake, if Venus and Jupiter are together with a 
malefic in the 2nd, the 7th or the 6th house. The 
same misfortune comes if the lord of Lagna is 
associated with a malefic. If the lord of Lagna 



Jaataka Tattvam 99 

is in Lagna itself the person will have two wives 
or be a debauchee. 

Incest 

28—39) If either the Moon or Venus is in 
a quadrant and is aspected by or associated 
a malefic and posited in an evil amsa is going 
towards a debilitated planet, the native will 
have incestuous relations with his mother. If 
the Sun and the Moon are associated with or 
aspected by a malefic and are in a quadrant, 
mother-incest is predicted. Incestuous relations 
with one similar to mother is predicted, if the 
lord of the 4th is associated with or aspected by 
-a malefic, and unaspected by a benefic, and if 
the lord of the Lagna is weaker than the lord 
of the 7th. 

Incest with sister is predicted if the lord of 
the 7th is either associated with or aspected 
by a malefic, is posited in the 4th or in an 
evil amsa. The same is the case when Saturn 
aspected by a malefic is in the 4th house. If the 
Sun is in the 7th, the person will have sexual 
relations with a barren woman. If Mars is in 
the 7th the person will have union with a barren 
woman and a woman in periods. If. Saturn and 
Mercury are in the 12th the union will be 
with a prostitute. If Jupiter is in the 7th the 



100 Seventh House 

union will be with a high class woman. Union 
will be with a pregnant woman if either Rahu 
or Venus or Saturn is in the 7th house. Union 
with a black hunchback is predicted if Saturn 
is in the 7th, 

Incest with Guru^s wife 

40 — 45,)« If the Moon associated with a 
malefic is in the 9th ? the person will have sexual 
relations with the wife of his preceptor. The 
same is the case if Venus together with a malefic 
is in the 9th, Also when the M°on and the 
lord of the 9th or Venus and the lord of the 
9th are associated with a malefic. Again when 
the lord of the 9th is debilitated and is in a 
debilitated amsa and is together with Venus, If 
the Moon is in the 9th the person will have 
union with an old woman. If the lord of the 
9th is debilitated the person will have union 
with a woman related to the preceptor. 

Abnormal relations 

55 — 60) If either association with or as- 
pect by a malefic to the 1st, the 4th , the 7th or 
the 10th house is noted, the person will have 
abnormal union with a cow. The same is the 
case when Saturn is associated with a malefic 
or Gulika. Also when the Sun is in the 7th and 
Mars in the 4th. Again when Rahu is in the 



Jaataka Tattvam 101 

7th and Mars in the 4th. And when the lord 
of the 7th is in the house of Mars and aspected 
,by Venus, Ifmalefics are in three quadrants 
the person will have relations with his wife as 
Well as with a cow. 

Titillating clitoris 

61—63) If Venus and the lord of the 7th 
are in the house of Mars the person will have a 
tendency to clitoral titillation. The same is the 
case when the lord of the 10th is in the house 
of Mars and is together with Venus and aspec- 
ted by Saturn. If the lord of Lagna or the lord 
of the 2nd is in debilitated sign, and in a debili- 
tated amsa and is weak, the same tendency 
prevails. • • -*. 

Size of clitoris 

130— 131) If the lord of the 7th is together 
with a malefic the woman will have a long 
clitoris. The clitoris will be short if the 7th is 
the house of Mercury, the Moon or Saturn. 

Wet genitalia, 

132-136) If the lord of the 7th is in a 
watery sign, the woman's genitalia will be wet. 
The same is the case when either Venus or the 
7th house is a wet sign. Also when the 7th 
house is aspected by the Moon or when Venus 



102 ' '., Seventh House 

is in a wet sign. Again when Mercury is in ,a 
wet sign and aspected by Saturn. The same 
prediction is given when the Moon is either in 
the 7th or in the amsa of a watery sign. 

Number of marriages 

64—67) The number of marriages will be 
the number of very strong planets occupying 
the 7th house or being aspected by the lord of 
the 7th or as many planets in the 8th house or 
being aspected by the lord of the 8th. Only 
one marriage is predicted if the lords of the 7th 
and the 2nd are in debilitated signs, and bene- 
fics are in quadrants. There will be only one 
marriage for the period if in the amsas of Mars 
and the Sun, Mercury and Jupiter are posited. 
Also when the 7th Navaamsa is that of Jupiter 
and Mercury is posited there. 

Number of wives 

68-87, 98, 145) If the lord of the 8th is in 
Lagna or the 7th the person will have two 
wives. The Lagna lord is in the 6th, the native 
will have two wives. He will have two wives 
if the lord of the 2nd is in the 6th and a malefic 
is in the 7th, Also when the lord of the 7th is 
together with a benefic and occupies an enemy's 
house ^or a debilitated one and a malefic is in 
the 7th. The Kaaraka of the spouse (Venus) 



Jaataka Tattvam 1 03 

associated with a malefic, occupying debilitated 
house, or enemy's house or the house of an 
eclipsed planet or in their amsa gives tfie per- 
son two wives. If there are several malefics in 
the 7th house the person will have two wives. 
Three wives the person will have, if malefics are 
in the 2nd house and aspected by the lord of 
the 2nd. If many malefics are in the 7th and 
ituol aspected by the lord of the 7th the person 
Will have three wives. The same is the case 
when malefics are in the 1st, the 2nd, and the 
7th houses and the lord of the 7th is debilitated 
or eclipsed or in enemy's house. i 

The person will have several wives, if the 
planet in Lagna is in high exaltation and the 
lord of Lagna is also in its exalted house. The 
same is the case when the Moon and Venus are 
* together and strong. If the 7th house is aspec- 
ted by strong Venus, the native will have several 
wives. The same prediction is given if the lords 
of the 1st, the 2nd and the 6th are together with 
malefics and occupy the 7th house. Also when 
Saturn is the lord of the 7th and is associated 
with malefics. If a strong Moon is in the 3rd 
from the lord of the 7th many wives can be pre- 
dicted. Again when the lords of the 2nd and 
tix6 12th are in the 3rd house and ^aspected by 



104 Seventh House 

Jupiter or the lord of the 9th. The same pre- 
diction also when the lord of the 7th is either in 
a quadrant or a trine, and is in benefic f Shad- 
varga' and is aspected by the lord of the 10th and 
is in full strength. There will be several wives, 
if the lords of the 7th and the 11th are associa- 
ted together or aspect each other. Also the same 
prediction when the planets occupying the 7th 
and the 11th are strong and are in trines. If the 
lord of the amsa occupied by the amsa-lord of * 
the owner of the 7th house is together with a 
benefic or with Mercury and is strong and in 
Paaraavata amsa the native will have a hundred 
wives. The number of amsa occupied by the 
lord of the 7th determines the number of wives 
the person will have. When Venus is together 
with either the lord of the 7th or the lord of 
the 9th , the person will lose as many wives as 
the number of malefics aspecting the Venus 
planet. 

Beautiful wife 

88) If in the 7th place from the Navaamsa 
Lagna Jupiter and the Moon are posited, the 
wife of the person will be very beautiful. 

Older wife 

89) If Saturn is in the 7th place from the 
Lagnaamsa, the wife will be older than the 



Jaataka Tattvam 105 

husband. 
Handicapped wife 

90) If Mars is in the 7th place from 
Lagnaamsa, the wife will be defective in limb. 
Scholarly wife 

91) If Mercury is in the 7th place from 
Lagnaamsa, the wife will be learned and scho- 
larly. 

jLi ting wife 

92—95) If Mercury and Ketu are in Lagna 
the Wife will be ailing. The wife will have an 
ailment in the nose, if Saturn and Mars occupy 
the house of Mercury or Mars or are in Lagna. 
But if the lord of the 7th is in the 8th the wife 
will be an angry and ailing woman. 
Marrying a married woman 

96—97) If Saturn and Mercury are in the 
7th the bride who comes will already be a mar- 
ried woman. (In experience, it is noted that 
the woman was engaged to one but later marr- 
ies another,) The same is the case if Saturn 
and the Moon are in the 7th house. 

Good wife 

94, 99-108; If the lord of the 7th is in the 

/— 14 



106 Seventh House 

4th or the 10th the wife will be very chaste. If 
either the lord of the 7th. or the Kaaraaka 
(Venus) is either together with or aspected by 
a Benefic or is posited between benefics, the 
person will have a chaste wife. If the 7th house 
is that of a beneficial planet, the person will 
get a good wife. The same is the case when 
Venus is in its exaltation or in own Shadvarga 
or in the 'Gopura' amsa. The wife will be 
very chaste if the lord of the 7th or aspected 
by a Jupiter and is strong. If the Sun is the 
lord of the 7th and aspected by a benefic, the 
wife will be chaste. The same is the case if 
Venus is the lord of the 7th and is aspected by 
a benefic. If Jupiter is in the 7th, the wife will 
be philanthropic and chaste. The wife will be 
chaste, if the lord of the 7th is in. a quadrant or 
in a beneficial amsa and is either together with 
or aspected by a benefic. If the 7th house is 
aspected by Jupiter, the woman will be of very 
good character. 

Widow 

109) If Rahu is in the 7th from Lagnaamsa 

(it can also be stated as the 4th from Lagnaamsa) 

'the woman will become a widow. (Here it may 

also mean one who lives apart from her frus- 

bandj 



Jaataka Tattvam 107 

Whore • t ' /.. 

, ;: ; 110— 117; Ifthe lords ofthe 6th, the 8th 
and, the 9th are associated with and aspected by 
malefics, the woman will be a whore. If the 
lord of the 8th is in the 8th the woman will be 
a whore. If Saturn is in the 7th house, the per- 
son will get a bad woman. If the lord of amsa 
occupied by the lord ofthe 7th is a malefic, the 
woman will be of bad character. The same is 
the case if the lord of the 7th is in an 'evil' 
Shashthyamsa. Also when the lord of the 7th 
or the Kaaraka (Venus) is in a debilitated sign 
or debilitated amsa. Again the woman will be 
bad, if the Sun is the lord of the 7th and occu- 
pies a malefic sign or amsa, and is either associ- 
ated with or aspected by a malefic. If the Moon 
is the lord ofthe 7th and is an evil amsa, the 
woman will be bad. 

Servant-maid' 

* 11) Ifthe Moon is in the 7th house the 
wife will be like servant-maid. 

Barren woman 

U9J If Saturn in Lagpa is in 'Rukshaa' 
sandhi (i.e. the end portion of Cancer or Scor- 
pio or Pisces) and Venus is in the 7th house 
the wife will be barren. 



108 Seventh House 

Eunuch 

120) If the lord of the 3rd and Venus are 
in the 7th the woman will be a eunuch. 

Another wife 

121 — 124) The native marries another wife 
when the lord of the 7th is weak in the 7th 
house and is aspected by a malefic. The same 
is the case when the lord of the 2nd is occupy- 
ing the 2nd house and is associated with or 
aspected by a planet with a malefic. Also when ' 
malefics are in the 7th and the 8th and Mars is 
in the 12th, Again the second wife is predicted 
when the lord of the Lagna or the lord of the 
7th is weak and occupies a 'Muudha' amsa. 

Early marriage 

125 — 127) If the lord of the Lagna is near 
the lord of the 7th early marriage even as a boy 
is predicted. If a benefic is near the lord of the 
Lagna or the lord of the 7th early marriage 
will take place. The same will be the case when 
the lord of the 7th is in 'Paaraavata' amsa and 
is strong, and also when the lord of the 7th is in 
the 2nd house and is strong. 

Mflrriage in distant land 

128) Marriage will take place in a distant 
country if either the Kaaraaka (Venus) or the 



Jaataka Tattvam 109 

lord of the 7th is together with a malefic in 
a trine. 
Wife's bosom 

4 129) If the lord of the 7th is with a bene- 
fie, the wife will have a buxom bosom. 

Death of wife 

137— 154) When Venus is together with 
.either the lord of the 7th or the lord of the 9th, 
jtfce person will lose as many wives as the num- 
$>pt of malefics aspecting the Venus planet. The 
wife will die if the Sun is in Lagna and Saturn 
is mthe 7th. If the 8th or the 4th place from 
Yjenus is flanked by malefics, the wife will die 
by rope (hanging). Death .by hanging (rope) 
is indicated if Venus is neither associated with 
nor aspected by a benefic. If Venus is together 
With a malefic and unaspected by a benefic, the 
wife dies of fire burns. Fire accident to wife is 
predicted if malefics are in the 4th and 8th pla- 
ces from Venus. If Venus and the Sun are in 
the 9th, the 7th or the 5th house, the person 
loses his wife. The native loses wife when 
Saturn and Mars are in the 7th house from the 
Moon and are associated jwith Venus. The same 
is the case when Saturn is in the 8th, Mars in 
the 6th and Rahu in the 7th. Death of wife is 
also indicated when a debilitated planet is in 



110 Seventh flouse 

4 

Lagna or the lord of Lagna is debilitated. The 
wile's death is caused by public calumny if 
Rahu and Saturn are in Lagna. Death of wife 
is indicated if the Sun is in Virgo and Saturn in 
Pisces. Death due to a fall from high place is 
possible if malefics are on either side of Venus. 
Danger to wife is predicted when the lord of the 
6th is associated with Venus. If the lord of the 
5th is in the 7th and Venus as lord of the 7th is 
associated with a malefic mid is weak, the wife 
dies in confinement. Death of wife isindicated 
if either Venus or the Moon is debilitated and 
occupies the 4th house. The same is the case 
if the lord of the 7th is in a cruel Shashthyamsa. 
Affliction to wife 

155 — 161) If any of the planets Saturn, 
Mars, Rahu or Ketu is in the 7th house the 
wife will be afflicted by ghost possession. A 
malefic weakened and in eclipse occupying the 
7th house causes death of wife. Also when 
Venus and Mercury are in the 7th house. 
Death is also indicated if the* Moon is in the 
12th and Venus in the 7th. If the Sun in 
full strength occupies the 7th, death of wife is 
likely. Also when Mars is in the 7th and the 
lord of the 2nd is in the 6th house. If a malefic 
is in the 7th place from Venus or if Venus is 



Jaataka Tattvam 111 

associated with a malefic, the wife's face will 
be disfigured. 
Happiness to wife 

162,) If Venus occupies the house of a 
retrograde planet the person will give happi- 
ness to wife in bed. 

Conjugal bliss 

146,163-164) When the 7th house either 
from Lagna or from the Moon is aspected either 
by a benefic or the lord of the 7th or associated 
with it, the person will have a happy married 
life. If the lord of Lagna aspects the planet 
occupying own house and Venus in in the 7th 
house, the person will have a happy married 
life. He will have conjugal bliss if Saturn and 
the Moon are in the 10th or the 4th place from 
the Moon. 

Trade I business 

165—167) If Saturn and the Moon are in 
the Libra amsa, the person will be engaged in 
trade and merchandise. The same is the case 
when the above planets are in the amsa of Mer- 
cury or in Cancer amsa; also when Mercury 
and Mars are together. 



**2 Seventh House 

Female horoscope effects 

1 — 7) Whatever effects have been stated 
for male horoscopes are also applicable to 
female horoscopes. Whatever is not applicable 
to women is attributed to their husbands. By 
looking at the Janma Lagna and the Moon's 
Lagna in a woman's horoscope her appearance, 
and from the 7th house her married welfare and 
from the 8th, her widowhood or otherwise can 
be determined. The woman will have feminine 
characteristics if her ascendant or the Moon's 
Lagna is in an even sign; if aspected by bene- 
fics, her character will be very good, and her 
behaviour nice. If the ascendant or the Moon's 
Lagna is in odd sign, she will be masculine in 
nature and appearance; and if aspected by or 
1 associated with malefic S/ she will be sinful and 
characterless.. Whichever is stronger of the 
two — the ascendant or the Moon's Lagna-^the 
effects of their trimsaamssa. are narrated below ; 
The girl born in the Mars trimsaamsa in the 
house of Mars Will be roguish, even when young; 
in Mercury trimsaamsa (in Mars house), she 
will be charming; in Jupiter trimsaamsa very 
good-natured; in Venus trimsaamsa will he of 
bad character; and in Saturn trimsaamsa a 
servant.

good character; born in Mercury trimsaamsa, 
will be artistic; in Jupiter trimsaamsa will be 
of good character; in Saturn trimsaamsa will 
marry again; and in Mars trimsaamsa will be 
roguish. 

In the house of Mercury, the girl born 
in Mars trimsaamsa will be a cheat; in Mercury 
trimsaamsa, will be of good character; in Jupi- 
ter- trimsaamsa, will be chaste; in Venus trimsa- 
amsa, will be lusty; and in Saturn trimsaamsa, 
will be bold by nature, 

'The girl born in, the Mars trimsaamsa in the 
sigh of Cancer will be a prostitute; in Mercury 
trimsaamsa, will be a sculptor; in Jupiter tri- 
msaamsa, will be of very good character; in 
Venus trimsaamsa, an unchaste woman; and one 
born iri Saturn trimsaamsa, will kill her hus- 
band. 

11 — 13) One born in the house of Leo in 
Mars trimsaamsa will have a manly bearing and 
behaviour; in Mercury trimsaamsa the girl will 
be playful like a boy; in Jupiter trimsaamsa, 
will be proud; in Venus trimsaamsa, will be in- 
cestuous with her own son; and in Saturn trim- 
saamsa, will have failed her family and clan. 

J— 15 



114 v Seventh House 

In the house of Jupiter (Sagittarius and 
Pisces) the girl born in Mars trimsaamsa, will be 
of good character; in Mercury trimsaamsa, will 
be specially intelligent; in the Jupiter trimsa- 
amsa will be philosophical and wise; in Venus 
trimsaamsa, will be chaste; and in Saturn trimsa- 
amsa, will be unchaste. 

In the house of Saturn (Capricorn an d 
Aquarius) the girl born in Mars trimsaamsa, 
will be a prostitute; in Mercury trimsamsa, will 
be roguish; in Jupiter trimsaamsa, will be mild 
and sweet in manners; in Venus trimsaamsa/ 
will be barren; and in Saturn trimsaamsa, will 
be unchaste. 
Lesbian 

14) If Venus and Saturn are in each other's 
amsa, or aspect each other, and if the house of 
Venus happens to be the Lagna, and if the 
Lagnaamsa happens to the the amsa of Aqua- 
rius, the girl born in such a Yoga will indulge 
in lesbian activities. 

Bad husband 

15—16) If the 7th house is unoccupied 
and is weak and unaspected by any benefic, the 
woman will have a bad husband. If either Mer- 
cury or Saturn is in the 7th house, the woman 
will have a eunuch for her husband. 



Jaatoka Tattvam 115 

Wandering husband 

17) IftheLagnais a moveable sign, the 
husband will be wandering all over the country. 

Divorce 

18,22) If the Sun occupies the 7th house, 
the woman will be deserted by her husband. 
(This is applicable to the horoscopes with 
Cancer or Leo as Lagna.) With a weak malefic 
in the 7th and aspected by a malefic, divorce is 
predicted. 

Widow 

19, 39, 47-48, 52*55; If Mars is in the house 
and aspected "by malefics the woman will be a 
widow in her young age. (This is applicable to 
Gemini or Virgo Lagna horoscopes.) If male- 
fics are in the 8th house, she will become a 
Widow during the daasa of the lord of the amsa 
occupied by the lord of the 8th. If malefics are 
in the Ascendant, or the Moon's Lagna, or in 
the 7th or 8th house, she becomes a widow. She 
becomes a widow also when either the 7th, the 
8th or the 12th house happens to be that of Mars 
and Rahu occupies it. If a malefic is in Lagna 
or the 7th house, the woman will be widowed 
in the 7th year of her marriage. She will be 
Widowed in the 8th year of her marriage, if the 



116 Seventh House 

Moon is in the 6th or the 8th house. If the 
lord of the 8th is in the 7th and the lord of the 
7th in the 8th and aspected by malefics, the bride 
is widowed soon after marriage. The same is 
the case if the lords of the 6th and the 8th are in 
either the 6th or the 12th house and aspected 
by malefics. 

Remaining married * 

1 20) If Saturn is in the 7th and aspected by 
malefics, the girl will not be married, (This 
has to be inferred carefully,) 
Re-marrying 

21, 23-24) If both malefics and benefics are 
in the 7th, she will marry again. If Mars and 
Venus occupy each other's amsa, the* woman 
will be interested in another man. If the Moon, 
Mars and Venus, or the Moon and the Sun are 
in the 7th, the woman will have relations with 
another man at the command of her husband. 
Bad daughter of bad mother 

25—26) Both mother and daughter will be 
prostitutes, if the Lagna is in the house of Sat- 
urn or Mars, and Venus and the Moon are posi- 
ted .therein, and aspected by malefics. If the

and aspected by Saturcr, the woman will have a

Woman causing bad name 

: r 46, 49-51, 57, 60) With Rahu in the 7th, 
she will be unhappy and bring infamy to

Visha-kanyaa. Also one with the Sun in the 
5th, Saturn in Lagna and Mars in the 9th. The

lord of the 10th being strong, the native will

sign and the lord of Lagna too in a mixed sign 
aspected by a planet of a mixed nature. Incre- 
ase in fortune is indicated if ■ the lord of the 11th 
is together with the lord of the 12th or aspected 
by it and is posited in the 9th. Similar is the 
case if the lord of the 9th is in the 2nd house 
associated with or aspected by the lord of the 
10th. If the lords of the 5th and the 9tb are 
together and aspected by or associated with 
benefics, increase of fortune through son are

9th signs are aspected by or occupied by the lord 
of the 9th. Also when the 9th sign is aspected 
by or occupied by Jupiter and Venus, As also 
when the lord of the 9th is aspected by or asso- 
ciated with Jupiter and Venus. Or when the 
lord of Lagna and the lord of the 2nd sign is in 
the 5th. Again when the lord of Lagna is in 
the 9th and the lord of the 9th in Lagna. The 
same if the lord of the 9th occupies the 11th 
sign. Or if the lords of the 9th and the 11th

the 10th or the 11th place or in the 7th sign, the

quadrant. Or if the lord of the 2nd, Jupiter 
and Venus are in exaltation. Or if Mercury

arid is aspected by benefics, the native is lucky

benefics aspect the 9th sign and the lord of the 
9th are in a quadrant or in the 5th, the 9th or 
the 11th house. Or if the lord of the 9th 
from the Moon Lagna is in a quadrant. Or if 
the 9th Raasi from the Moon is aspected by or 
associated with several benefics, 
Sanyaasa yoga, different c orders' etc. 

103 — 1 10) If four planets are in the same 
sign, the native will take to sanyaasam (asceti- 
cism). The extent to which as many planets 
acquire strength, so much will be the quality of 
asceticism of the native. The Sun makes that 
ascetic a 'taapasan', the Moon to a f Kapaali% 
Mars to a 'Raktabhata* (wearer of red tunic), 

/— 19 



146 Ninth House 

Mercury turns him to an 'Aajeevee', Jupiter to 
a Tridandee', Venus to a 'Chakradhara 1 and 
Saturn to a 'Nagna' (wearer of no clothes). If 
the planets are in an eclipsed state, the ascetic 
will have only devotion (bhakti). If the Moon 
is in the trimsaamsa of Saturn or in the Nava- 
amsa of Saturn and Mars, and aspected by 
Saturn, the native will become a sanyaasi. Also 
if Saturn and the lord of Lagna are weak. 

With drawalfrom 'order* 

107-108, 111-113) The planet which urged 
him on to take to asceticism, if defeated in 
war, will make the native too give up asce- 
ticism. He will give up asceticism if Saturn 
aspects the lord of Lagna. If the Moon and 
Rahu are together or if Gulika is in a cruel 
amsa, the Sanyaasi will give up asceticism and 
turn house-holder. The native cannot become 
a great ascetic if Ketu is in Navaamsa Lagna and 
aspected by Saturn. He will be a nominal asce- 
tic without doing 'tapas' (penance) if Jupiter 
is in the 6th and the Sun in the 4th. 
Ascetic eminence 

114) But the native will become an emin- 
ent ascetic like Brahma Gupta and Kaanaada, 
being born in the Raaja Yoga with Saturn as- 
pecting the Moon, Jupiter and Lagna, and Jupi- 
ter in the 9th sign.

Obstacles to kingship I Raajayoga 

The Raajayoga becomes useless, if the lords 
of 9,11 and 10 are debilitated. Raajayoga for- 
med in the 2nd, the 7th, the 12th and 'Vyatee- 
paata' yoga, and at the birth of months. If the 
Moon is very much debilitated, the effect is use- 
less. When exalted planets reach their lowest 
amsa, the effect is nil. If the exalted Sun gets 
the lowest amsa, even a prince will fall low. If 
the Sun becomes highly debilitated, Raajayoga 
becomes useless. When debilitated Venus is in 
Thrbne amsa or in its own amsa. If the planets 
conferring Raajayoga are in debilitated or ini- 
mical signs, or eclipsed, Raajayoga becomes 
useless. 

If a child is born at the time of earthquake, 
lightning , and other dangers , Raajayoga be- 
comes useless. If a debilitated planet is in the
