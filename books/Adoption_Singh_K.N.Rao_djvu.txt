Acknowledgement 


| offer deep sense of gratitude and indebtedness to 
Shri K.N. Rao ji, who considered me capable of undertaking research 
on ‘adoption’ and inspite of his busy schedule always gave valuable 
advice and guidance. The subject of research was indeed a 
challenging one and collection of horoscopes of adopted children 
was a tough task and project of research in itself. 

In modern times, who else but Shri K.N. Rao ji can inspire 
students to undertake research based on classical astrological 
principles in modern context and get proper conclusion. 

| am highly obliged and express heart-felt gratitude to Shri 
Manoj Pathak ji who has personally helped in improving, editing 
and presenting this book in this present form. 

| am also thankful and indebted to members of my family 
especially my son Ashutosh for their active co-operation, patience 
and appreciation of my work. 

An expression of great gratitude and thankfulness to Shri 
Rajendra Singh and Shri Bharat Singh for their support and 
suggestion in proper presentation of the book, will be a mere 
formality. 

| am highly thankful for financial aid granted for publication by 
‘The Society for Vedic Research and Practices’, which hold a very 
prominent place in publication of simitar researches in Vedic 
literature. 

My humble contribution is now before lovers of astrology for 
their valuable suggestion.

Adoption and Law 


The only codified law available for adoption in India, is THE 
HINDU ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE ACT (HAMA) This Act 
came into force in 1956 and is applicable to: 

> any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or 
development. 

> any person who is a Buddhist, Jain or Sikh. 

> any person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Farsi or Jew. 

> any child legitimate or illegitimate whose parents are Hindus, 
Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs. 

rany child legitimate or illegitimate one of whose parents are 
Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs and has been so brought up. 

rany abandoned child, legitimate or illegitimate of unknown 
parentage brought up as a Hindu, Buddhist, etc. 

> any person who is a convert to the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or 
Sikh religion. 


YOU CAN ADOPT IF... 


1. You are a Hindu male, over twenty one years, single and of 
sound mind. 
2. Ifyou are a married Hindu Male, then you can adopt only with 
the consent of the wife. 
3. if you are a female Hindu of sound mind and single viz. either 
married widowed or divorced. 
WHO CAN YOU ADOPT 
1. A son-if you do not have a biological son, grandson or great 
grandson. 
2. A daughter - if you do not have a biological daughter or a 
son's daughter. 
Tne adopted child enjoys all the rights of the biological child. 
THE GUARDIAN AND WARD ACT (GWA) 


Personal law of Muslims, Christians Parsis and Jews does not 
recognise complete adoption. As non-Hindus do not have an

Adoption and Law Adoption 
enabling law to adopt a child legally, those desirous of adopting a 
child can only take the child in ‘guardianship under the provisions 
of The Guardian and Wards Act, 1890. 

This however does not provide to the child the same status as 
a child born biologically to the family. 


Unlike a child adopted under the Hindu Adoption and 
Maintenance Act, 1956 the child cannot become their own, take 
their name or inherit their properly by right. This Act confers only 
a guardian-ward relationship. This legal guardian-ward relationship 
exists until the child completes 21 years of age. 

Foreigners who seek to adopt an Indian Child, can do so under 
this Act to assume legal Guardianship of the child, after giving an 
assurance to the court, that they would legally adopt the child as 
per the laws of their country, within two years after the arrival of 
the child in their country.

Preface 


Adoption means a child changing its house from that of its 


biological parents into adoptive parents. Here the original parents 
severe their parental responsibility. 


It is generally well known in some families in India though it 


may be kept a secret in some cases. Often, information about 
biological parents is also not available in some cases. 


= 


Adoption can be for many reasons: 


. A childless couple who wants to have children of others for 


their families. 


From country to country,may be different but generally the 
legal and social pattern of such adoptions are generally the 
same with a recognizable pattern. 

In recent years, we have many cases of children from 
orphanages being adopted by Indians and even foreigners, in 
these cases, we cannot obtain correct birth details and therefore 
unless sure of the birth details, we have not included them in 
this study. 

In India, we do not have known cases of unwed mothers 
abandoning their children generally and even in those cases 
where t is known, birth details are always uncertain. Such 
horoscopes fall outside this research. 


In India, we have not generally heard of same sex couples 
adopting children. 


Slowly, Indians are waking to the reality of not having children 
if one of the parents has some incurable or inheritable disease. 


This is an astrological study of the horoscopes of children who 


went into adoption sometime after their birth and some of them 
immediately after birth. 


In India, the general arrangements in families is that the child 


of one brother or sister will be adopted by another sibling and this 
is done immediately after birth. The dasha at birth becomes relevant 
for this purpose. 


For this purpose we are applying uniformly on the data before 


Adoption Preface 
us, the following parameters: 

1. The condition and placement of the ninth lord in the birth 
horoscope of the child- The ninth lord becomes important 
because legally the adoptive father becomes an important 
person in cases of adoption. 

2. These are seen in three varga charts: birth horoscope, 
dwadashamsha and chaturthamsha. 

3. The relevant dasha shows the movement of the child from 
one house to another or one parent to another. 

4. In all these cases, the eighth, twelfth and the third house 
seem to gain importance. 

The horoscopes used in this study are reliable since they have 
been collected from families known to Shri Rajbir Singh. 
How to see adoption in a horoscope? 
Adoption can be of various types. 
A total change of house meaning moving into a new house, 
with a new mother and a new father. 
Part change meaning moving into a new house with a new 
father but the same mother who is also the child’s biological mother. 
Moving into a new house/surrounding after the death of mother 
and going to the house of a relation with the biological father 
remaining legally also the father of the child because there is no 
legal adoption of the child though the child has a new mother. 
To see it, examine the following. 
Houses and lords to be examined 

1. The fourth house and the fourth lord in the birth horoscope. 

2. Examine the ninth house and ninth lord in the birth horoscope. 
Importance of dwadashamsha 

3. Examine these in the dwadashamsha. 

4. Where necessary examine them in the chaturthamsha. 
Role of dashas 
The role of the dasha is very important. Generally, adopt on 


takes place early in childhood or in sub teens. Therefore the dasha 
at this age is important factor in this research. 

The application of these parameters are being illustrated with 
the help or the horoscopes of two famous men of the world, Bill 
Clinton of USA and P.V Narasimha Rao, the former Prime Minister 
of India.

Dasha at birth was Sun-Sun-Sun 

Notable features here are the combination of the ninth lord 
with the eighth lord which is aspected by Saturn which had and did 
prove fatal for his biological father.

president of USA. The birth time was not known but the rough 
indication was that he was born in the morning. In such cases, 
some undisputed fact helps you to fix the lagna. In this case, one 
valuable information available was that he was a posthumous child 
as his biological father died three or four months before his birth. 
The second.useful bit was that his mother remarried and Bill adopted 
the name of his step father, going into adoption in a way. 

In the birth horoscope it is the dasha of twelfth lord with the 
ninth lord afflicted and with the eighth lord. 


In the dwadashamsha, the ninth lord Venus is in the eighth 
house. 


The dasha at birth of Sun shows a highly afflicted Sun again the 
twelfth lord here. 


In the Chaturthamsha the fourth house is again afflicted and 
the dasha at birth is of Sun, the twelfth lord, showing his movement 
from the place and home of his birth to that of his adoptive father.

Prelace Adoption 
P.V. Narasimha Rao 

P.V. Narasimha Rao, the late prime minister of India went into 
adoption after his birth. Here the ninth lord is in the eighth house in 
the birth horoscope. He was born in the dasha of Saturn/Sun/ 
Jupiter. Sun is the twelfth lord while Saturn and Jupiter are in the 
twelfth house. He went into adoption immediately after his birth. 

| have asked Shri Rajbir Singh to examine these cases on such 
lines.

Introduction 


"Child" is a pivot. Around which happiness, joy, prosperity & 
future of the entire family and society revolves. 

In metropolitan citieis, these days. Life has become very tense 
and hectic especially for people working in call centres and M.N.C. 
These people are forgetting and ignoring the basic traditional values 
of proper settlement in marriage and importance of child in the 
family. Such life full of mental tensions becomes an obstacle in 
expansion of family. Some couples, however, don't have children 
due to lack of blessings of God. Later on when medical aid is also 
not conducive for child birth, such couples plan to adopt ‘child.’ 
Sometimes, affluent people in our society adopt a ‘child’ even 
without getting married as Sushmita Sew and Engelina Jolly have 
done. Usually average couple adopts a child for happiness of their 
family. 

Couple, desirous of adopting a child, can adopt the child from 
their own family or from other family known to them or from an 
orphanage or private institution. 

As instructed by our Jyotish Guru Shri K.N. Rao Ji, I started my 
research on adoption since last two years. For research on this 
topic I collected many horoscoples of parents, who did not have 
their own child and adopted the child, from outside. 

A thorough analysis of the horoscopes of parents revealed not 
only the causes of childlessness but also the compinations for 
adoption in their charts. Besides the horoscope of the adopted 
child had promise of being adopted by shousing change of parents. 

Adopted children can be divided into 3 Categories:— 

(i) Child, whose mother is changed 
(i) Child, whose father is changed 
(iit) Child, whose father & mother are changed 

During my research on this topic I noticed that parametres for 
going abroad were generally found in horoscopes of adopted 
children. In some horoscopes, however, all these parametres 
appiled, but children didn't go in adoption on further enquires it

was found that these children went to hostels at young age for 
studies and got care, love and affection of their teachers & not their 
own parents. While doing this research. Some of my misconception 
were cleared the results were really satisfactory.
