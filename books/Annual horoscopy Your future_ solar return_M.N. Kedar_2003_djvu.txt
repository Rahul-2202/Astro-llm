It is rather difficult to pay ones gratitude to the 
Almighty God and his Guru. However I gathering a little 
courage venture to pay my gratitude according to my 
ability. It was the expectation of my Teacher that I should 
teach Jyotish to one person as a token of Guru Dakshina. 
It became a problem for me to find out that one person. 
.Where should I find him to pay back my guru Dakshina? 
The study of Jyotish and the research thereof was going 
on continuously for seven years between 1980 and 1987

under the blessings, care and guidance of my Guru. I 
was waiting for an opportunity to repay the debt holding 
the hope in me that if I tend to have faith unto the Lord 
a day will definitely dawn for such an occasion. The: 
firm belief in me that the blessings of my Guru and 
that of the Almighty would create an atmosphere never 
failed. I was made the Chairman of the Delhi Chapter I 
of the Indian Council of Astrological Sciences, established 
in the year 1985, that paved the way for starting 
Astrological Classes at Delhi for the first time in 1987. 
I felt I have found the avenue for repayment of the debt. 
The Almighty showed the way and I felt the tool is in 
’ my hands now and I should show the way for others to 
lead their light through the Divine Science. You are the 
‘ Creator and also the Protector. “Tvadiyam vastu govinda 
tubhyameva samarpaye.” In spite of several hurdles that 
came in the way the Astrological classes are going on 
at Delhi. How would one get any obstacle if the 
Almighty's blessings were with him?

A DISCUSSION ON ANNUAL 
HOROSCOPE 


There are three different systems of Astrology viz., 
1. Parasari (as told by Sage Parasara) and the erudite 
commentators, who have written treatise on Astrology 
under this system — Varahamihir, Venkatesh Daivangna, 
Kalyan Verma etc., 2. Jaimini a unique system provided 
by sage Jaimini) and 3. Tajik (or Varsha Phal) a system 
propounded by Sri Nilakanthacharya or Kesava Daivagna. 


The events in life of a native can be foretold through 
Jyotish Sastra. Dr. B.V. Raman, the doyen of Astrology, 
quotes in his Astrological Magazine 


“Phalani grahacharena soochayanti Manishinahah 
Ko Vakta tartamyasya tamaikam Vedhasam Vina” 


An astrologer can only indicate the events to occur 
‘according to his ability but who else than Brahma, the 
creator of the world can state with certainty? 


If these are the words coming out of a scholar it 
must be accepted by one and all that the “Daiva Kripa” 
is absolutely necessary besides an in depth study of 
Jyotish Sastra. This would facilitate in giving a full- 
fledged prediction. 


. A basic knowledge of ais Sastra especially the 
Mathematical and Predictive astrology under the Parashari 
System is necessary that we have obtained so far. It is 


'. Annual Horescopy 11 


necessary to yearn for the learning of the other systems 
of Astrology too, to have a more meaningful and 
purposeful use of the system of Parashari already acquired 
by us mainly for finding out the timing of events. 


A native has a free will to act according to his state 
of Mind. It must be noted however, that he has to repay 
what he has sown in the previous birth termed as 
“Rinanubandhan” in this birth besides his own Karma 
Phal during the present birth. We have many systems 
in Jyotish shastra to know the type of events, one has 
to undergo during a particular year. In this the three 
systems aforesaid viz., Parashari, Jaimini and the Tajik 
come in handy. While the life events can be ascertained 
through the first two systems of astrology, Tajik deals 
. with the events that may occur in a particular year. Prasna 
Jyotish deals with the mundane problems of an Individual 
and the solutions thereof by casting a horoscope for the 
moment of the question put forth by the querrent. 


I shall deal with the construction of an annual 
horoscope and the results yielded by it in this book. It 
must be borne in mind that the annual] horoscope is a 
part of and depend on the Birth Horoscope even though 
it has independent and elaborate system of 
prognostication. In order to understand this system one 
must have a thorough knowledge of Parasari system of 
astrology especially the method of casting horoscope. The 
casting an annual horoscope is based on the Longitude 
of the Sun and the Ishta Kaal of birth time. Matters 
relating to business, profession, service, transfers, 
promotions, demotions, health, marriage and progeny can 
be ascertained through an analysis of annual horoscope. 


12 Annual Horescopy 


The word ‘TAJIK’ is derived from the word ‘taji’, 
a Turkish language. 


‘Taji’ means a horse, a fast mode of transport of 
those days. May be the name for this system is so given 
as one can study the life events in too short span of 
time. The advent of Greek Astrologers called the 
‘yavanas’, gave the term Tajik to this system derived 
from the ancient system of astrology commonly known 
as “Jataka”. It is also a considered opinion of scholars 
that this is a system copied from the Greeks and Arabs 
since the names of Yogas in this system are retained as 
named by the Yavanas. It is also probable that India is 
the originator of this system and later copied by the 
Greeks or the Arabs. Since trade and commerce between 
our country and these countries was going on in those 
days is a history and as a result there was exchange of 
this knowledge of the system. Instead of delving deep 
into the origin let us now concentrate on a discussion 
of this system in the following pages. 


CHAPTER 1. 


“Introduction to different facets of 
Annual Horoscope 


1.1 Progressed Horoscope 


The annual horoscope is otherwise called a 
progressed horoscope since the planetary positions are 
advanced to the following years level since the birth of 
a native. The first annual horoscope would of course 
be the birth horoscope itself since predictions can be - 
given not only for the year of birth but also for the entire 
- duration of life. Hence casting of an annual horoscope 
arises from the second year onwards. The subtle 
difference between the birth horoscope and an annual 
horoscope is that the planets would have advanced to 
another sign or may be in advanced degrees in the same 
sign in the following year while the planetary positions 
are static in the birth horoscope. The slow moving planets 
viz., Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu would be more or less in 
' the same sign in advanced degrees or may be in the 
following sign according to their movement. Other fast 
moving planets would be more or less in the same sign 
or nearby after a year’s orbit. However, the Sun, on whose 
movement the annual horoscope is depended upon, has 


14 


Annual Horoscopy 


a fixed movement and would be back to the same sign 
and longitude as he was at the time of birth. Since the 
preparation of an annual horoscope is a continuous 
process year after year on a progressive basis it is called 
a progressed horoscope. 


1.2 Important points to be borne in mind for 


a) 


b) 


c) 


d) 


e) 


understanding an Annual Horoscope. 


Annual Horoscope is a part of a birth horoscope. 
This is cast for the moment of return of the Sun to 
the same longitude and Sign as he was at the time 
of birth. 


The Birth Horoscope duly prepared according to 
Mathematical exactitude should be with us. 


There may be difference in the ascendant signs in 
respect of birth and an annual horoscope. However 
the Sun Sign and his longitude should be one and 
the same in both the horoscopes. 


In order to create a linkage between the birth and 
annual horoscope our sages have introduced 
“Muntha,” otherwise called a Progressed Ascendant. 
The movement of Muntha is one sign annually and 
the Sign and longitude of Muntha would be same 
as that of Lagna or birth ascendant 

There are only male and female planets in Tajik 
Sastra unlike Parasari system where planets are 
categorized into male, female and hermaphrodite. 
The male planets are the Sun, Mars & Jupiter while 
female planets are Venus, Moon, Mercury and 


_ Saturn. The male planets are strong during the day 


and female planets during the night. 


Annual Horoscopy . 15 


1.3 Planetary strengths through Harsha Bala and 
Panchavargeeya Bala 


a) Harsha Bala is calculated taking into consideration | 

the state of the planets from four different situations 
that are respectively Sthana Bala, Uchcha/swakshetri 
bala, Stri Purush Bala and Diva/Ratri Bala. For every 
situation gets five points. Total points are twenty. 


i) 


Sthana Bala: If in the annual horoscope the 
Sun is in 9th house, Moon in the 3rd, Mars in 
the sixth, Mercury in ascendant, Jupiter in the | 
llth, Venus in the 5th and Saturn in the 12th 
house and each of the planets so situated would 
get 5 points as strength as they are assumed to 
be happy in such situations. 


* iii) 


. es 
- [Mercury | Saturn | Jupiter 


Uchcha—Swakshetri Bala: Planets in own sign 
or in exaltation would get 5 points each. 
Stri—Purush Bala: If male planets are posited 
in the 4th, Sth, 6th, 10th, 11th and 12th houses 
in an annual horoscope and female planets in 
the Ist, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 9th houses would 
get 5 points each for such position.. 


b) 


Annual Horoscopy 


iv) Diva~—Ratri Bala: In an annual horoscope that 
is cast for a day time birth, the male planets 
would get this strength of 5 points while Female 
planets would get this strength of 5 points if 
the annual horoscope is prepared for the night 

‘time birth. The duration between Sunrise and 
Sunset is considered as daytime birth and the 
time between Sunset and sunrise of the following 
day is considered as night time birth. 


The total of Harsha Bala would therefore be measured 
on a twenty point scale. 


Panchavargeeya Bala contains Kshetra Bala, Uchcha 
Bala, Hadda Bala, Dreshkon Bala and Navamsa Bala 
and it is calculated to ascertain the strength of the 
planets in five different situations. Details and 
methodology are discussed in Chapter Five. 


1.4 Aspects 


Aspects are from sign to sign and the planets also 


aspects according to the sign. The details are hereunder: 


a) 


b) 


¢) 


Friendly aspects: The 3rd, 5th, 9th and 11th aspects 
are classified as friendly. The 5th and 9th aspects 
or the trinal aspects are openly friendly. The 3rd and 
11th aspects are secretly friendly. 

Inimical aspects: The Ist, 4th, 7th and 10th aspects 
are inimical in nature. Of these four, the 4th and 
10th aspects are secretly inimical and lst and 7th 
are openly inimical. 

Neutral aspects: The 2nd, 6th, 8th and 12th aspects 
are considered neutral. (Reference: Tajik Nilkanthi 


Annual Horoscopy 17 


— Chapter I) 
i) The benefic/ malefic nature of the planets is also 
taken into consideration in regard to seventh aspects. 


ii) The 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th and Ist, 4th, 7th and 10th 


1.5 
a) 


b) 
c) 


1.6 


aspects alone are considered and 2nd, 6th, 8th 
and 12th aspects are not considered at all. 


Mutual Relationship of Planets 


The Sun, the Moon, Mars and Jupiter are friends 
among themselves 


, 


Saturn, Venus, Mercury and Rahu are mutual friends 


Planets in para (a) are enemies to those in para (b) 
and vice versa. (Refer: Dr. B. V. Raman’s Book 
on Varsha Phala.) 


Selection of the Lord of the year 


One of the five contenders detailed below, who is 


strong in Panchavargeeya bala and aspecting the lagna 
would be chosen as the lord of the year. The Five 
Contenders (Panchaadhikari) are: 


a) 


b 


— 


c) 


d) 


€) 


Janmesh (The Lord of the Ascendant of the horoscope 
at Birth) 

Varshesh (The Lord of the Ascendant of the annual 
horoscope) 

Munthesh (The Lord of Muntha in the annual 
horoscope) 

Rashipati (The Lord of Sun’s sign in case of day 
birth and Lord of Moon’s sign in case of night birth) 
Trirashipati (Refer table 7.3 in Chapter VII for details) 


18 Annual Horescopy 


1.7 Table of Deeptamsa (Planetary Orbs) 


Deeptamsa | 15° 9° 


Rules Regarding Deeptamsa: 


‘When the difference between the longitudes of the 
two planets involved in yoga falls within the average 
of the relative planetary orbs of influence then they are 
said to be within the deeptamsa range. 


1.8 Planetary strength 


a) Harsha Bala 

b) The strength of the Lord of the year is measured in 
two ways: 
i, Panchavargeeya Bala 


ii. Dwadasavargeeya Bala 
1.9 Dashas in Annual Horoscopy 


There are three kinds of dashas in Tajikasastra. The 
duration under each of these dashas are for a period of 
one year while the first two dasas is reckoned on the 
basis of 360 days a year and the third one is calculated 
upon 365 days. They are: 

(a) Vimshottari Mudda Dasa 
(b) Yogini Mudda Dasa 
’ (c) Patyayini Dasa 
1.10 Yogas 


a). The yogas here are different from Parasari. Only 16 
of the yogas have been mentioned. These sixteen 


Annual Horoscopy 19 


yogas are configured as a result of intermingling of 
rays, aspects and deeptamsas of the seven planets. 


b) Shri Khankhanah Nawab Saheb, a scholar in astrology 
who wrote classics titled “Kheta Kautukam” and 
“Dwatrimsadyogaavali” in a mixed language - 
containing Sanskrit and Persian has emphasized the 

_ importance of 28 such yogas based on his experience. 


1.11 Sahams 


It is imperative to study an annual horoscope in 
comparison with the birth horoscope as the former is 
depended upon the latter. 


Saham is one of the unique features of Annual 
Horoscopy. Nowadays the use of Saham is restricted or 
seldom used. There may be two reasons for it. 


a) Sahams are not calculated in birth horoscope. 
b) In many of the cases Sahams do not fructify. 
{t is possible, however, if Sahams are calculated 
in both the Birth Horoscope and Annual Horoscope and 
compared, better results could be achieved. 
While Acharya Nilkanta has discussed around 50 
sahams, Acharya Venkatesha has explained the role of 


48 sahams. But Acharya Kesava has restricted his 
discussion to 25 sahams only.

d) 


The date, time, Thithi, day, month, year and place 
of birth both in Hindu calendar as well as English 
Calendar.(Samvat and Christian era). The time of birth 
is required in Hours, minutes, seconds and Ghati, 
Pal, Vipal.

birth. 


The Solar Return (Varsha Pravesh) Time for casting 
the progressed Horoscope (obtained by adding the 
constant for the Number of completed years given 
in Solar Return Table* with the day or time of birth) 


Note: *Solar Return Table is given on Page 117 of 
Lahiri’s Indian Ephemeris for the year 2002. 


2.2 Completed Years 


Completed year is obtained by deducting the year 


of birth from the current year. For example if the year 
of birth is say Samvat 2000 and the Samvat under 


Annual Horoscopy , 23 


consideration is 2058 then completed years would be 
58 {Current year (Samvat) — Year (Samvat) of birth = 
2058 — 2000 = 58}. 


a) Rule— 1: Constant for the completed years 


i) 


ii) 


According to traditional method a year consists of 
365 days, 15 ghati, 31 pals and 30 vipals. If this 
figure is divided by seven (7) to convert it to weeks, 
we obtain a reminder of 1 day, 15 ghati, 31 pals 
and 30 vipals per year. We should find out how 
many days are left as reminder if the completed 
year is 58. Hence multiplying the yearly reminder 
of 1 day, 15 ghati, 31 pals and 30 vipals by 58 we 
obtain the figures as under: 


Day Pa 


Converting the sub units into days by dividing them 
by 60 and adding to 58 days we get : 

Day — Ghati Pal Vipal 
00 27 00 


Dividing the number of days by 7 (number of days 
in a week, we get a reminder of : 


Ps ofa fo | 


Therefore the constant for the completed year under 
this method is day 3 i.e. Tuesday at ghati—pal—vipal 
00-27-00. 


Adding the day and time of birth to this constant 
we get the time for casting the Varsha Pravesh 
Kundli (Annuai Horoscope). , 


24 ; Annual Horescapy 


iii) We may also obtain the time by using the Traditional 
Table of Solar Return (Table 2.3) given hereunder 
for casting Varsha Pravesh Kundli. For example 


completed years are 58. Referring to the table 2.3 


Tol | to | 00} 27 | 0 | 
ee 3 00 | 00 | 


Note: We have obtained the same constant as before 
for the completed years under (7) and (ii). 


b) Rule— 2 


We can obtain the same constant for the completed 
years 58 through a different process, which is given below: 


1th times of 58 
completed yrs in days 


1% times of 58 
completed yrs in pals 


Reducing multiples of 7 


No. of days ina weck)| 7 


The constant is the same as before.

(b) Calculation of Solar year 


The Sun takes 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes and 36 
seconds to complete one rotation and return back to 
the same sign, degree, minutes and seconds. There 
are different views in this regard. According to “Surya 
Siddantha”, the Sun takes duration of 365 days 15 
ghati 31 pals and 30 vipals to complete one rotation 
of the Zodiac. Modern observatories have found the 
time to be 365 days 15 ghati 23 pals (or 365 days 6 
hours 9 minutes and 12 seconds). In this way it can 


be observed that a difference of 8 pals and 30 vipals 


(or 3 minutes and 24 seconds) exist between the two 
reckoning in a year. This would pave way for an 
enormous difference in the calculation of the constant 
for the completed years if this difference were allowed 
to prevail. 


Modern Scholars adopt 365 days, 6 hours 9 minutes 
and 12 seconds. 


(c) What are we to do? 


Different rules and methods were discussed. Naturally 


‘we are put on caution as to which one of these is to 


be adopted by us for our calculation. The scholars 
have suggested the modern method after considering 


the present situation and the changes. 


The following constant numbers have been given for’ 
counting the weekdays: 


1— Sunday 2— Monday 3— Tuesday 
4— Wednesday5— Thursday 6— Friday

(e) Calculating the Thithi and Lagna for the Varsha 
Pravesh Kundli 


The Thithi at birth of the model horoscope is Krishna 
Paksha Tritiya i.e. 18th Lunar Day and the completed 
years is 58. 
The Annual Lunar Day (Thithi) 
Illustration: 


Multiply the completed years 58 by 11 and divide 
by 170. 


Annual Horoscopy 29 


58 x 11 = 638 + 170 we get a quotient of 3 and reminder 
128. Add the quotient to the product of 58 x 11 i.e. 638 
(638+3) we get a total of 641. Add to this the lunar day 
on which the native is born. In our case it is 18(Shukla 
Pakshadi Janam Tithi i.e. 15+3). Hence 641+18 = 659. 
Divide this figure 659 by 30 we would get a quotient of 
21 and a reminder 29. The reminder represents the Thithi 
of Varsha Pravesh Kundli. Thus the Thithi would 
therefore be Krishna Paksha Chaturdasi (29-15 = 14). 


The Annual Ascendant : 


Multiply the completed years (58) by 3 and write 
in two places as shown below: 
Illustration: 

Divide the First number by 30 and add the quotient 
to the Second number. Divide the sum so obtained by 
12. Add the reminder to the number of the birth ascendant. 
You will get the number of the Varsha Pravesh Ascendant. 

1.-1 58 x 3 = 174 

174+ 30 Q=*5 R= 24 
2-1 58 x 3 = 174 
174+ *5=179+12Q=14R= 11 

In the first step we got a quotient of 5. Add this to 
the second 174. We get a total of 179. Dividing this by 12 
we get a quotient 14 and a reminder 11. Thus the reminder 
number represents 11 signs away from the birth ascendant. 
Suppose the birth ascendant is Gemini i.e.3 the annual 
ascendant for the 59th year would be 3 + 11 = 14. Deducting 
12 signs we would get 2 meaning the rising sign for the 
~ §9th annual horoscope would be Taurus.

Annual Horoscopy 


f) The auspicious and inauspicious time of Varsha 
Pravesh : 


Thithi: The year will be auspicious if the lunar day 
is not 4th, 9th, 12th, 14th or Amavasya during waning 
fortnight and the Ist lunar day of waxing fortnight. 


Weekday: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday 
are auspicious. 


Nakshatra: Ashwini, Mrigsira, Hasta, Pushya, 
Punarvasu, Swati and Revati are considered 
auspicious for Varsha Pravesh. 


Forbidden periods: Days commencing with 
inauspicious yoga coupled with Bhadra Thithi do not 
augur well, If the birth ascendant and the annual 
ascendant are one and the same sign it is called 
“dwijanma” year. It becomes more inauspicious year 
if the 6th or 8th lord is in Kendra from Lagna. The 
native would experience physical troubles like fever, 
cough and nervous pain during the commencement 
of the year.

3.2 Calculating Lapsed Years 


We have to prepare the annual horoscopes for the 
years 1954-55, 1955-56 and 1956-57 1.e. for the periods 
respectively falling between 10th June 1954 and 9th June 
1955, 10th June 1955 and 9th June 1956 & 10th June 
1956 and 9th June 1957) equivalent Samvat years being 
2011, 2012 and 2013. In other words the 22nd, 23rd and 
24th progressed horoscopes are to be prepared on the 
native completing his 21st, 22nd and 23rd year of birth. 


The completed years should be reckoned in the 

following manner: 
Completed year = Current year — year of birth 
4) In 1954 the completed year would be 1954— 
1933 = 21 years (Relative Samvat weuld 2011- 
1990 = 21) 

ti) In 1955 the completed year would be 1955-— 
1933 = 22 years (Relative Samvat being 2012— 
1990 = 22) 

ii) In 1956 the elapsed year would be 1956-1933 
= 23 years (Relative Samvat being 2013-1990 
= 23) 

Note: Ifthe Completed year were 21 the progressed 
horoseope would be 22nd (2]+1), Likewise 
if the native has completed twenty-two years 
of age then the 23rd progressed horoscope 
would be prepared and so on.

B. Rule 2: 


In accordance with the table of traditional method 
vide Para 2.3 (a) we get the dhruwank for the 22nd and 
23rd year respectively 5-26-01-30 and 6-41-33-00. 

Thus the dhruwank obtained under rule A & B are 
one and the same. 


Adding the day and time of birth to these constants 
(Dhruwank) we would obtain the time (Istha Kaal for 
varsha pravesh) for reckoning the Varsha Kundlis for 
the 22nd and 23rd year. 


C. According to Modern method vide Para 2.3(d) we 
obtain the following constants for the 22nd and 
23rd year respectively:

(i) The lunar day (Thithi) at the time of birth was 
Krishna Paksha Tritiya or 18th lunar day. The 
completed years are 21 and 22. 


Multiply the completed | 22nd year 23rd year

Adding the quotient 

to the product 242+1 
= 243 

Now add the lunar 

day (Thithi) of birth to 

this total we get 243418 
= 261 

Divide this sum by 30 261 + 30 

Reminder is 21 

Remainder represents ishna Paksha 

(the tithi at the time of Shashti

Note: The Thithi of Varsha Pravesh can be advanced or behind 
in some years (we need not bother).

4.3 Muntha and its Implications 
A. Calculation of Muntha 


Muntha is one of the unique features of varshaphala. 
The longitude of Muntha is the same as that of the 
Ascendant at the time of birth and it progresses one sign 
every year bearing the same longitude. Hence it is called 
the progressed ascendant. Longitude of lagna of the 
model chart is Cancer 15°29'. Therefore, the longitude 
- of Muntha at birth is same as that of the ascendant i.e., 
Cancer 15°29' or otherwise 3°15°29'. Since we have 
considered three annual horoscopes with the completed 
years 21, 22, 23 respectively Munthas for these annual 
horoscopes will be placed in Mecsha (3*/15°29'+2 15=0/ 
15°19"), Vrishabha (3°/15°29'+22%=1/15°19"), Mithuna 
(3°/15°29'+23%=2/15°29") for the years 1954, 1955, 1956. 
Please refer to the model horoscopes given in chapter 
3.

C. The influence of planets on Muntha 


The effects of PAC of planets on Muntha causes 
their influence on Muntha. Generally the following effects 
of planets are seen: 


Sun: 


Moon: 


Respects in society, favour from government, 
improvement in business, gain of wealth, 
Formation of Dhan yoga, progress in 
employment, fame and name, victory over 
enemies, Pilgrimages being undertaken and 
victory in political activities 

Good health, Name and respects, Improvement

Mars: 


Annual Horoscopy 


happiness, profit in business, fulfillment of 
desires, Promotions in employment, 
Acquaintances of religious and noble people. 


Unexpected accidents, Weakness and bodily 
strains, Many worries, mental tensions 
Unhappiness and fear of being wounded by 
weapons, wind and bilious diseases. 


However if aspected or associated with 
benefics, such Muntha would tend to give gain 
of wealth and gain through courageous 
activities. 


Mercury: Improvement in business, Happiness and joy 


in the entire family, Students getting through 
examinations, gainful employment, help of 
income to unemployed, all round fame and 
name; However if afflicted dangerous and 
painful bodily troubles and undesired results 
are foreseen. 


Jupiter: Auspicious events at home, Family happiness, 


Venus: 


prosperity of wife and children, unmarried 
getting married, birth of a child, acquisition 
of good and tasty food, glorious life, 
availability of valuables, jewellery and gem 
stones 


Gain of wealth and grain, contacts with ladies 
and children, luxurious and glorious life with 
physical enjoyment, meeting lover or company 
of women, Passionate activities and possibility 
of getting married. If afflicted with malefics 
by association or conjunction, it gives rise to 


Annual Horoscopy 49 


Saturn: 


Rahu and 


Ketu: 


scandals, affairs and disgrace on account of 
women, Mental restlessness and loss of 
reputations. 


Blood disorder, intensity in disease, mental 
problems, disappointments, undesirable 
activities, loss of wealth, If aspected or 
associated with Jupiter then the bad effects 
are mitigated. If however Mars has relation 
with Muntha or Saturn the intensity of bad 
effects inereases. 


Rahu gives good effect during the first half 
of the year while Ketu gives good effect during 
the second half of the year. As a corollary it 
can be said the bad effects of Rahu could be 
seen during the second part of the year and 
Ketu during the first part of the year. In general 
Rahu or Ketu would give the effects such as 
Loss in business, and Loss of wealth due to 
ingratitude on the part of a near relative. 


D.  Muntha in the face or Mouth of Rahu 

Access to wealth, fame, doing charity, and if 
connected with Jupiter or Venus they give good position 
and precious stones.. 


E. . Muntha on the Hind Part or Prishta Part of Rahu 


It is quite inauspicious and the native can expect 
danger from enemies, all sorts of difficulties and troubles 


and financial losses.

B. Calculation of Uchcha bala in the annual. 
horoscope 


It may be observed that the maximum elongation 
between the exaltation and debilitation point of any planet 
is 180°. Twenty units (Bisuba bala) of strength are allotted 
to a planet that is in exaltation point. A planet in 
debilitation point would get only zero unit of strength. 
However, if planets are posited in between its exaltation 
and debilitation points then the following steps are to 
be adopted for calculating the strength of Uchcha bala. 


Deduct debilitation point of the planet from its 
longitude. If the balance arrived is more than 180 degrees 
(6 signs) reduce again from 360 degrees (12 signs). It 
should be noted that the remainder should always be 
less than six signs. Divide the remainder by 9 and we 
get Uchcha bala of the planet. 


Note: 
(a) We divide by 3 while calculating exaltation 
strength in Shadbala that is used for arriving 


56 Annual Horoscapy 


at Shashtyamsa. Here we divide by 9 to get 
vimsopak bala. (180 + 20=9). , 
(b) Reducing the debilitation point of a planet from 
its longitude also we get the Uchcha bala 
strength. For example- 
Sun’s Longitude (i) 15 - 25° - 53' 55° - 53' 
Debilitation point of 
~ Sun (i) 6°- 10° - 00' 190° - 00' 
Deducting {(i)-(i)} 78 - 15° - 53' 225° - 53' 
Since the remainder is more than six signs 
we should reduce this from 360° or 12 signs. 
{125 (-) 7%-15°-53' = 48-14°-07'} or say the 
remainder is 134°-07'. Divide the remainder 
by 9. We get 14°-54.1' as Uchcha bala of Sun, 
which we may denote as 14.9.

Harsha Bala 


6.1 Introduction and rules for calculation 


It is necessary to ascertain the Harsha Bala of the 
planets if one desires to know the dasha results of the 
concermed planet. It is but natural a strong planet would 
render its significations in full measure during the dasa 
period of the planet. 


Harsha Bala is of four kinds. as detailed below. A 
planet gets five units of strength for each kind of bala 
if it is situated accordingly. If the planets gct all the 
four types of balas then it would get a twenty units of 
strength and that is considered quite strong. Every kind 
of bala is to be ascertained separately and finally totalled 
to assess the strength of Harsha Bala of the planets. 


6.2 Kinds of Harsha Bala 


First — Sthana Bala 
In an annual horoscope if the Sun is in ninth house, 
’ Moon is in the third house, Mars is in the sixth house, 
Mercury is in Lagna, Jupiter is in eleventh house, 


Annual Horoscopy 61 


Venus is in the fifth house and-Saturn is in the twelfth 
house each one of them gets five units of strength 
for Sthana Bala. 


Second — Uchcha - Swakshetri Bala 


When a planet is in its own sign or in exaltation in 
an annual horoscope it gets five units of Uchcha - 
Swakshetri Bala. 


Third — Stri - Purush Bala 


The Ist, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th, 9th houses of a Varsha 
Kundli are considered female houses and the 4th, 
Sth, 6th, 10th, 11th, 12th houses are considered male 
houses. Hence a male planet posited in a male house 
and a female planet in a female house gets five units 
of strength in this kind of bala. Male Planets are 
Sun, Mars and Jupiter; and Female are Moon, 
' Mercury, Venus and Saturn. {vide chap] para 2(e)} 


Fiurth — Diva - Ratri Bala 


If the Varsha Pravesh occurs during the day time 
then all male planets would get five units of strength 
and female planets would get this strength if the 
Varsha Pravesh occurs during the night time. Here 
Day time means between Sunrise and Sunset and 
Nighttime means Sunset of a day and Sunrise of the 
following day. 


Note: If the planets were not situated in the 
aforementioned places or positions then such planets 
would get zero units of strength.

CHAPTER 7 


Selection of Lord of the Year 


7.1 Definition 


Every year one of the planets would become the 
Year-Lord in a horoscope, If that planet is very strong 
in Panchavargeeya bala then the year would be prosperous 
for the native. On the other hand if the lord of the year 
is weak, the year would bring in miseries, difficulties 
and distress. The following steps are to be undertaken 
to determine the lord of the year. 


7.2 The five contenders for Lord of the Year 


1) Munthesh: 
The Lord of the sign in which Muntha is posited 
in the relevant year. 
ii) Janmesh: 
The Lord of the ascendant sign at birth. 
iii) Varshesh: 


The Lord of the ascendant sign of the annual 
horoscope (Varsha Kundli). 


iv) Trirashipati: 
Lords have been assigned for different ascendants 


64 Annual Heroscopy 


as per table in para 7.3 below for daytime birth or 
nighttime birth in the annual horoscope. 
vy) Diva - Ratripati: 

The Lord of the Sun sign in case the V ersha Pravesh 
takes place during daytime or the Lord of the Moon sign 
for Varsha Pravesh taking place during nighttime.

7.4 Conditions for determining the lord of the 
year. 


The contenders stated above can become the lord 
of the year only when they fulfil the following conditions: 
a. The Planet must aspect the Varsha Lagna (No matter 

whether it is friendly or inimical aspect) 


Annual Horoscopy 65 


b. 


If more than one planet aspect the Varsha Lagna-. 
then the one with more Panchavargeeya bala would 
be chosen 

If there were similarity in aspect and strength of 
more than one planet then the one which has more 
portfolios would be the year lord. 


If more than one planet have equal strength, aspect 
and portfolio then the lord of the year for that year 


would be Lord of Muntha (Munthesh) 
Munthesh should be chosen as Lord of the year 


during the year in which all planets have similarity 
in aspect, strength and portfolio but weak in 
Panchavargeeya bala. 


_In case no planet has any aspect on Lagna then 


the strongest planet would represent the lord of the 
year 

According to some scholars, Rashipati would 
become the lord of the year (The lord of the Sun’ 
sign for daytime birth and Moon sign for night time 
birth) in case of equality among the planets in 
respect of Strength, Aspect and Portfolios. 


Another opinion is also on the ground that is to 
choose Trirashipati in case of equality in lordship. 


I am of the opinion that Lord of the year should be 


one among the planets fulfilling the conditions mentioned 
in (a) to (f) and there would be no difficulty in selection.

the year for the three annual horoscopes:

(a) The planet having more portfolios should be 
chosen as lord of the year. 


(b) In case portfolios are also equal then aspect 
will decide the criteria that too in the following 
order i.e. Friendly open aspect (Sth and 9th), 
Friendly secret aspeet (3rd and 11th), Inimical 
open aspect (4th and 10th) and lastly inimical 
secret aspect (Lagna and seventh) 


7.6 Results of Lord of the year: 


Acharya Nilakanta, seeking the benign blessings 


68 : Annual Horoscopy 


of Lord Ganesha, whom even Lord Shiva and other Gods 
pray before starting their mission, states that the results 
as told in various Jyotish Sastras for the mankind start 
fructifying after a long while. According to him many 
scholars have faltered even though they predict after a 
laborious mathematical calculation. Acharya Nilakanta 
has given this version culling out the details from various 
classical texts. Planets give beneficial results if they are 
not combust and also not in the sixth, twelfth and eighth 
houses in an annual horoscope. 


(i) Sun as year lord 


If Sun is Lord of the year with strength the year 
will prove to be an all round success. If he is of medium 
strength the results are somewhat reduced and when he 
is of low strength the year proves to be very difficult 
plundered with different kinds of dangers. Robust health, 
status, wealth, happiness from spouse and children, 
destruction of enemies is some of the results that a Poorna 
Bali Sun would give during the year. This happiness 
will be augmented if the Sun has /thasa/ yoga with benefic 
Planets. 


(ii) Moon as year lord 


If the birth were of nighttime, if the Lord of Moon’s 
sign has Ithasal with a planet that is the lord of the year 
who forms Kambool yoga with the Moon then the year 
would prove to be very splendid. A Poorna Bali Moon 
provides many comforts such as wealth, wife, children, 
friends, house, etc. besides becoming very rich and 
cultivating friendship with the people in power during 
the year. A Moon of medium strength would create enmity 


Annual Horoscopy 69 


among his kith and kin, health impairment and provide 
change of place. If the Moon forms /sharaf yoga with 
malefic planets then it would result in suffering from 
pulmonary (cough) diseases. A weak Moon as lord of 
the year, bring diseases, fear from enemies, quarrels with 
relatives, shifting to far off places, family stress and 
fear of death. 


It must be noted that Moon is the lord of the year 
during 1954-55 and 1956-57 in the model annual 
horbscope. Let us analyze the results of Moon becoming 
the Lord of the year. 


1954-55: 


(a) Vimsopak bala was 4.95 (low) and the 
Panchavargeeya bala was 19.82 that were too 
low in comparison to other planets during the 
year. 


(b) Harsha Bala was also zero (too low). 


(c) The Lunar Day was Shukla Paksha Dashmi 
but was Nichabhilashi. In all these counts, 
Moon was very weak during the year but being 
a Shukla Paksha Moon we may consider it of 
medium strength and therefore capable of 
giving a few good results as well. The native 
had worst period of his life, such as health 
problems of wife and he had troubles from 
parents and co-borns. 


1956-57: 


(a) Vimsopak bala was 12.98 (auspicious) and 
highest among the planets and the 


70 Annual Horescopy 


Panchavargeeya bala was also highest at 51.91. 


(b) Harsha bala was 5, though considered weak it 
was the second in the order among the planets. 


(c) The Lunar day was Shukla Paksha Duitya and 
Moon has just come out of its exaltation sign. 


(d) Venus, a benefic, is associated with her. The 
year saw the native getting employment. 


(ii) Mars as year lord 


-A strong Mars brings forth name and fame and 
victory over enemies. The native may become the Chief 
of Army, may be directed to command a force in the 
battlefield. The year is likely to make him receive wealth 
from his family and all round happiness from wife and 

children. 


Mars with medium strength would make him suffer 
from blood related diseases, boils, physical injuries and 
wound through weapons though he may get a little 
happiness because of his inbom character. 


A weak Mars would create fear from enemies, 
thieves, fire and scandals. False allegations against the 
native would be the outcome of a weak Mars becoming 
the lord of the year. During this period he will lack his 
intellect, travel aimlessly to foreign land, suffer from 
chronic diseases. He will pay for his demeanour act 
unless Jupiter aspects Mars. 


(iv) Mercury as Year lord 


A person of high intelligence, Success in 
competitions, knowledge of scriptures, display of innate 
talents, prowess in medical science, obtaining fame and 


Annual Horoscopy : : 71 


name from the Government are some of the benefits a 
native would enjoy when Mercury, strong in 
Panchavargeeya bala, becomes the Lord of the year. 
However, Mercury of moderate strength as year lord 
would provide only mediocre results. He may indulge 
in business travels and provide happiness to friends and 
children subject to Mercury forming /thasal yoga with 
benefic planets. Undesirable results will follow if there 
is no Ithasal and other yogas. 


Lack of knowledge, irreligious, getting defamed due 
to loose tongue, bearing lot of stress and strains, loss, 
of wealth, children indulging in providing false evidence 
would be the result if the Mercury, the year lord is weak 
in Panchavargeeya Bala during the year. 


(v) Jupiter as Year lord 


A quite strong and powerful Jupiter endows family 
happiness, makes the native highly charitable and a person 
of high intelligence, and brings wealth, fame, name and 
respect in society. The native would be a recipient of 
an award from the Government and would destroy the 
enemies. Jupiter of moderate strength entitles him to 
be knowledgeable in scriptures. However, if Jupiter forms 
Isharaf yoga with malefic planets a native is likely to 
become poor, lose accumulated wealth and invite troubles 
from womenfolk. 


A weak Jupiter would see the native being 
abandoned by kith and kin, loss of wealth and fame. 
Quarrels, enmity and false allegations would follow a 
weak Jupiter as year lord. 


72 Annual Horoscapy 


(vi) Venus as year lord 


If Venus becomes a year Lord and is quite strong 
provides the native tasty and sweet food, good health 
and happy family. The native would be free from diseases 
and be healthy. He would become a person, of happy 
temperament, cheerful and enjoy the company of women, 
destroying enemies and receiving acclamation from the 
Government. 


Misunderstanding and mental agony followed by 
loss of income and reputation would be the result of 
Venus being of medium strength. Further if Malefic 
Planets aspect Venus with medium strength one will have 
to face accidents and loss of wealth. 


Loss in Business, loss of employment, misunder- 
standing with kith and kin would be the result if Venus 
is weak and becomes lord of the year. 


(vii) Saturn as year lord 


A Poorna Bali Saturn gives good landed property, 
house and agricultural lands. Native gets benefits from 
downtrodden. Native digs wells, tanks, develops 
horticulture, and possesses robust health, fame and name 
in society. He is considered one among the scholars. 


A Madhya Bali Saturn indulges one to be associated 
with low caste women, to use slow moving animals like 
Camels and Buffaloes for work and to face difficulty in - 
procuring food. 

An Alpa Bali Saturn obsiructs all deeds, loss of 
wealth, and fear from enemies, dangers and creates enmity 
with family and relatives. 


Annual Horoscopy 73 


Saturn as year lord in the Model Annual horoscope 
during the year 1955-56: 


Saturn has obtained a vimsopak bala of 12.12 units, 
a Panchavargeeya bala of 48.48 units and a Harsha Bala 
of 15 during the year. Saturn is in own house in the 
birth chart and is exalted in the annual horoscope. The 
year turned out to be a good year to the native. He got 
admission in another University and passed the 
examination with merit and begot a daughter though he 
had to be away from home but he remained with honour 
there. 


Note: The Varshesh is the chief during the year since 
he provides results on the basis of configuration of other 
planets. If he is strong he gives best results. On the other 
hand, a weak year lord would provide just opposite 
results.

were formed then the year would be quite inauspicious.

in fame, financial gain and acquaintances of good 
and special persons. The Moon is of Shukla 
paksha, and even though it is Avarohi, it is 
considered strong since it is in its own nakshatra. 
The native should get recognit..n in society, 
expansion in family, mental peace, lands and 
property, wealth and similar other things. 


The Conclusion 


On examining the situation of Moon in this 
annual horoscope it can be said that the Moon 
without Harsha bala, having alpa vimsopak bala 
associated with the aspect of the Sun should 
give bad results only. The negative impact of 
Moon could mitigate a little in view of the 
friendly aspect of the Sun. However it must be 
noted that the inimical aspect of other planets 
should give only bad results and never good 
results. The Moon being ninth lord obtains the 
friendly aspect of the Sun the tenth lord. The 
Moon may be considered strong even when it 


‘is weak in annual chart since it is the lord of 


Lagna in the birth chart. The Janma Rashi 
(Dhanu) is the second house of annual chart 
and hence it is a sign of financial prosperity to 
the native during the year and it should also 
create tensions in the family, fear of being 
wounded and to incur expenses relating to health. 


It means when the Janmesh is weak in an 
annual chart it would give all sorts of troubles. 


‘The Ninth lord became Varshesh in this chart 


and is posited in the eleventh and has the friendly

(iii) 


aspect of the tenth lord Sun. Hence the native 
should get success in job and facing challenges 
in the job should move forward. 


Sun: It is the second lord (Dhanesh) of birth 
chart and the tenth lord of annual chart is posited 
in the seventh house aspecting lagna. Seventh 
lord Venus is posited in the eighth with Jupiter 
(the second and fifth lord) and Mercury (the 
eighth and eleventh lord). The Sun has the 
friendly aspect of the Moon and neutral aspect 
of other planets. The Sun in the seventh causes, 
troubles to wife, fear in travel and wandering 
in villages besides causing eye diseases, 
headache and health impairment. However the 
influence of benefics on Sun would cause success 


‘in work undertaken. 


The Sun got five units of Harsha Bala and 11.85 


“units of Vimsopak Bala in Panchavargeeya bala 


(Poorna Bali). Jt would therefore make the native 
a popular person, special favour from superiors, 
status in the family, gain from performing 
religious rites, and destruction of foes. 

Mars: Mars is the lord of fifth in the birth chart 
and is posited in the second house (Dhan bhava) 
of the annual chart. Satum throws the secretly 
friendly aspect while Jupiter, Venus and Mercury 
cause openly inimical aspect and the Moon its 
secretly inimical aspect on Mars. It has medium | 
strength in Panchavargeeya bala. It has five units | 
of Harsha Bala. The results of its being of 
medium strength are ill health, blood related 


146

(v) 


. Annual Horoscopy 


diseases, all kinds of tensions, nose bleeding, 
foreign travels and fear from weapons and foes. 
The effect of Mars in the second house causes 
fear of thieves, fire and action by government, 
loss of wealth, eye troubles, and distress to wife 
and death in the family. The native would also 
invite troubles from kith and kin due to loose 
tongue. 


Mercury: He is the lord of third and twelfth 
in the birth chart. He is a lord of eighth and 
eleventh in the annual chart. He possesses five 
units of Harsha Bala and 12.01 units of strength 
(Vimsopak Bala) in Panchavargeeya bala. This 
would result in the native getting special 
incremental education, famous in sports 
activities, success in educational and trade 
relative activities, promotion in employment, 
happiness from children and friends. The openly 
friendly aspect of Saturn, the secretly inimical 
aspect of Moon and the openly inimical aspect 
of Jupiter, Venus and Mars, and the neutral 


_aspect of the Sun besides its position in the 


eighth house causes skin trouble, tensions, and 
more expenses. Since Mercury is in his own 
house and is strong the native gets the benefit 
of progress in business, help from the 
government, destruction of foes and good health. 
Jupiter: Being the lord of sixth and ninth it is 
posited in the second house of the birth chart. 
It is the lord of second and fifth of annual chart 
and is posited in the eighth house. Saturn’s 


Annual Horoscopy 147 


(vi) 


aspect on it is openly friendly. Venus, Mercury 
and Mars throw their openly inimical! aspect; 
Moon her secretly inimical aspect and the Sun 
his neutral aspect on Jupiter. The vimsopak Bala 
of 8.7 units of strength in Panchavargeeya bala 
is considered medium and Harsha Bala of 5 units 
is low. Being in the eighth it provides disease 
free health, expenses, separation from friends, 
foreign travel, troubles to wife, loss of position, 
obstructions, abandonment and tensions from 
quarrels. Being of medium strength in 
Panchavargeeya bala there is likely to be tensions 
from colleagues, loss of patience, literary 
acumen and loss through the influence of 
malefics. 


Venus: It is the lord of fourth and eleventh of 
the birth chart and is in the twelfth house there 
while Venus is the lord of seventh and twelfth 
of the annual chart posited in the eighth house. 
Venus thus has relations with the twelfth house 
in respect of these two charts. The Sun does _ 
not aspect. Saturn’s aspect is openly friendly 
(Ninth) on Venus. Moon forms secretly inimical 
aspect {tenth} and Mercury, Jupiter and Mars 
are applying kendra aspect (openly inimical) on 
Venus. It is of medium strength according to 
Panchavargeeya bala possessing 9.69 units of 
vimsopak bala. Venus has five units of Harsha 
Bala only. Venus in these circumstances should 
give bodily troubles, death in the family, interest 
in incongruous deeds, and secret sorrows. Being 


148 Annual Horoscopy 


in the eighth house Venus is likely to cause less 
gains, ill health, troubles to and from wife and 

children, loss of wealth, financial tensions and 
troubles among couple. 


(vii) Saturn: It is the lord of seventh and eighth house ~ 
of the birth chart and in the seventh house 
thereof. It is the third and fourth lord of annual 
chart and posited in the twelfth house of annual 
chart. Saturn occupying the twelfth house gives 

. demotion, loss of status, financial strains, 
wasteful expenditure, quarrels with relatives, 
worries and tensions. The sun and Moon’s 
neutral aspect, Mars’s secretly friendly aspect, 
Jupiter, Venus and Mercury’s openly friendly 
aspect are on Saturn in the annual chart while 
there is no planetary aspect on Saturn in the 
birth chart. Saturn was in its own house in the 
birth chart and it is in exaltation in the annual 
chart. We can therefore consider Saturn to be 
strong in the annual chart. It gets a vimsopak 
bala of 16.31 units in Panchavargeeya bala that 
is classified as Poorna Bali and gains 10 units 
of Harsha Bala. This positional background of 
Saturn is likely to give the native testing times, 
tensions, troubles to wife, loss of wealth, change 
of residence and stress and strains. 


14.7 Actual Happenings or events 


The Annual year lasted between 10 June 1954 and 
10“ June 1955. During the year the native participated 
in sports activities. He had successes as well as 


Annual Horoscopy : 149 


credentials. He got married. He was rusticated from the 
College. He was not allowed to appear for the examination 
and the entire year was bad. Except a minor ailment in 
the leg during the time of marriage he had no other bodily 
troubles. He won many prizes and rewards in weight 
lifting, boxing and athletics. It can be said he had to 
bear the brunt of karma of others in respect of bad period 
may be it was due to the influence of the company around 
the native.

Dasas in Varsha Phala 


Three kinds of dashas were mentioned in Chapter- 1. 


Let us take out these dashas one by one. 


15.1 Vimshottari Mudda Dasha: 


(i) 


The Janma Nakshatra of the native of the 
example chart is Poorvashada that is 20th 
Nakshatra when counted from Ashwini. The 
completed year in 1954 is 21 (1954 - 1933 = 
21). The following formula is used every year 
for finding out the order of dasha. 


Completed year + Janma Nakshatra Number — 2 
9 2 
21+ 20-2 
9 
= 39 + 9 gives 
Q= 4 and R= 3 


(Note: Q= Quotient and R=Remai:ider) 


The order of dasa has to be reckoned in 
accordance with the remainder counting from 


Sun. Jf the remainder is 1 then the dasa of Sun 


Annual Horoscopy 15t 


(ii) 


(iii) 


(iv) 


would commence first and will move in the order 
of Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, 
Ketu and Venus respectively represented by 
remainders 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9. Here in the 
example the remainder is 3. Hence the dasa of 
Mars should commence first followed in a 
cyclical order by Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, 
Ketu, Venus, Sun and Moon in that year. 


The duration of dasha would be 18 days for 
Sun, 30 days for Moon, 21 days for Mars, 54 
days for Rahu, 48 days for Jupiter, 57 days for 
Saturn, 21 days for Ketu and 60 days for Venus. 
Thus the total number of days in Vimshottari 
Mudda Dasa would be 360 days that represents a 
whole year. 


The third step in reckoning dasa ts to calculate 
the balance of dasa at the beginning. It must 
be noted that dasa in Varsha phala is for a 
duration of one whole year (360 days) at the 
end of which the consecutive annual horoscope 
will commence. Hence while reckoning the 
duration of a particular dasa, Bhogya (yet to 
lapse) portion will be at the beginning and 
Bhukta (elapsed) will be at the end of the year 
while the remaining dasas would be in between 
them providing a total of 360 days in all. 


Vimshottari Mudda dasa for the 22nd annual 
chart: 


The dasa would commence on 10th June 1954 
and end on 10th June 1955. The first dasa would 
be that of Mars as aforesaid.

(B) Method II: Finding out how many days of the 
duration of first dasa at the beginning and how 
many days at the end of Vimshottari Mudda 
Dasa. 


The longitude of Moon in the birth chart is 8° 
23° 32' and the nakshatra at birth is Poorvashada. 
This nakshatra extends between 13°20" and 
26°40' of Dhanu Rashi. Hence deducting 13°20' 
(the commencement of Poorvashada nakshatra 
in Dhanu Rashi) from 23°32' (The longitude of 
Moon at the time of birth) we get the lapsed 
portion (Bhukta) of Moon that give« a balance 
10°12'. The span of any nakshatra is 13°20". 
Hence deducting the traversed portion (10°12') 
of Moon from the span of nakshatra (13°20')

Annual Horoscopy : 153 


we get untraversed portion (Bhogya) that is 
equivalent to 03°08' or 188'. The first dasa is 
that of Mars with a duration of 21 days that 
has to be apportioned into two components 
Bhogya and Bhukta. We can also get this 
untraversed portion (Bhogya) of Moon by 
deducting the longitude of Moon 23°32' from 
26°40' (the last degree upto which the 
Poorvashada Nakshatra extends in Dhanu) which 
would give the same duration of untraversed 
portion viz. 3°08' or 188'. This remainder when 
multiplied by the duration of dasa of the planet 
and divided by 800 would give the duration of 
dasa at the commencement and the balance 
would be taken at the end. In the instant case 
the duration of Mars dasa is 21 days which when 
multiplied by 188 and divided by 800 would 
give 4 days-22 hours-26 minutes-24 seconds that 
will become the Bhogya dasa of Mars at the 
beginning and the remaining 16 days-1 hour- 
33 minutes-36seconds would be reckoned at the 
end of the dasa period as shown below.

15.2 Vimshottari Mudda dasa according to Uttar 
Kalamrita: 


(i) Order of Dasa: Add the completed years to 
the number of Janma Nakshatra. Reduce 2 from 
the sum and divide the balance by 9. The 
remainder determines the ‘order of dasa as 
indicated in Paral(i). . . 

« (ii) The duration of dasa at the beginning and at 
the end for a particular planet from where the 
dasa starts is calculated taking into account the 


Annual Horoseopy ; 5 155 


traversed (Bhukta) and untraversed (Bhogya) 
portion of Moon similar to reckoning of balance 
of dasa in birth chart. The longitude of Moon 
will be that of the annual chart. In the 22nd 
annual chart the Moon’s longitude is 5519°39'14" 
that means in Kanya Rashi 19°39'14". Hence 
the nakshatra of Moon is Hasta third pada. The 
span of Hasta Nakshatra is between 10° and 
23°20'of Kanya Rashi. Hence Moon has 
traversed (Bhukta) a distance of 9°39'14" in 
Hasta nakshatra (19°39'14" — 10° = 9°39'14") 
and hence the untraversed (Bhogya) portion is 
3°40'46" (23°20' — 19°39'14"). As explained 
in Method II above the duration of dasa at the 
beginning and at the end are ascertained. As 
the remainder under (i) is 3 and therefore Mars 
dasa should start first whose duration is 32 days 
under this system. Hence the duration of Mars 
dasa at the beginning of the year would be 8 
days-19 hours-55 minutes-47 seconds and 23 


- days-4 hours-4 minutes-13 seconds at the end. 


(iii) 


The planets have been allotted a fixed duration 
under this system viz. 110 days for Sun, 60 days 
for Moon, 32 days for Mars, 40 days for 
Mercury, 48 days for Jupiter, 56 days for Venus, 


_ 4days for Saturn, 5 days for Mars and 10 days 


for Lagna totaling in all to 365 days. 

Note: Para(i) is as per “Tajik Nilkanthi”. 
However para (ii) and (iii) are contrary. The 
best and widely accepted method is that of Tajik 
Sastra that is being given below. 


156 , Annual Horoscopy 


Method II (Para 1)— for the year 1954 (22nd 


year) 
Completed year + Janma Nakshatra Number — 2 
9 
_ 21+20-2 
9 
= 39 + 9 gives 
Q= 4 and R= 3 


(Note: Q= Quotient and R=Remainder) 


Hence the first dasa would be that of Mars with a 
duration of 21 days starting from 10-6-1954. 


The dasa sequence would be Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, 
Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun and Moon and would 
commence from 10-6-1954 and end on 10-6-1955 as 
shown hereunder in a tabular form.

Method II: for the year 1955 (23rd year) 


Janma Nakshatra is Poorvashada, that is 20th from 
Ashwini. Nakshatra and the completed year is 22 (1955- 
1933) in respect of the Annual chart for the year 1955-56. 

Hence the first dasa should be that of Rahu applying 
the above formula. 


Janma Nakshatra Number + Completed Years — 2 
9 


20+22-2° 
7 gee 
= 40 + 9 gives 
Q= 4 and R= 4 
Hence the remainder 4 indicates that Rahu dasa 
should start first in the year 1955 and the rest will follow 


in the cyclical order. The duration of Rahu dasa is one 
month and 24 days under Vimshottari Mudda Dasa. 


Vimshottari Mudda dasha for the year 1955-56 is given 
hereunder in a tabular form.

Note: The decimals indicated above represents the 
duration of antar dasa in number of days. Refer to Column 
No.7 and Row Number 4. You will be able to locate 
the Antar dasa duration of Mars in Saturn dasa that is 
indicated by 3.325 days. The decimal portion of 0.325 
in days should be converted to hours and minutes. 
Multiplying 0.325 by 24 we get the sum 7.8 (0.325 x 
24) that represents hours. The decimal portion of hour 
can be converted to Minutes when multiplied by 60. We 


164 Annual Horoscopy 


get 48 (0.8 x 60) minutes. Hence the duration of antar 
dasa of Mars in Saturn dasa is 3 days-7 hours-48 minutes. 
This can be verified from the table of antar dasa given 
above.

15.4 Yogini Mudda Dasha: 


There are eight yoginis. Each Yogini has a lord. 
' They are Mangala, Pingala, Dhanya, Bhramari, Bhadrika, 
Ulka, Sidhya and Sankata ruled respectively by Moon, 
Sun, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Venus and Rahu/ 
.Ketu. The duration of dasa are Mangala for 1 year, Pingala 
for two years, Dhanya for three years, Bhramari for four 
years, Bhadrika for five years, Ulka for six years, Sidhya 
for seven years and Sankata for eight years making a 
total of 36 years. The Yogini Mudda dasha can only be 


166 Annual Horoscopy 


for a period of one year or 360 days. Hence one year of 
Yogini dasa can correspondingly have only 10 days of 
Yogini Mudda dasa. e.g. 36 years + 360days = 10 days. 
This is tabulated hereunder: 


Order of Yogini Mudda dasa: 


The following formula is used for finding out the 
-Yogini Mudda dasa order. 


Completed year + Janma Nakshatra Number + 3 
8 


Let us calculate this for the 22nd annual chart 
for the year 1954-55; 


The completed years are 1954-33 = 21 years; The 
Janma Nakshatra is Poorvashada that is 20th number in 
the Nakshatra series. Hence according to the formula 
we should get 21+20+3+8 = 44+8 = Q: 5 and R: 4. The 
remainder 4 gives Bhramari as the first dasa. (Refer to 
the Yogini dasa table mentioned above). 


Annual Horoscopy 167 


Calculating Bhukta and Bhogya portion of the dasa 
at commencement: 


Here again we consider the longitude of Moon at 
birth which was 8° 23' 32". The Janma Nakshatra was 
Poorvashada in Dhanu Rashi. We have seen the Moon 
is yet to traverse (Bhogya) 188' of Poorvashada{15.1 
(iii)(B)}nakshatra at birth. Bhramari dasa has 40 days 
duration. The span of a Nakshatra is 13° 20' or 800°. 
Hence 40 days of Bhramari dasa is to be apportioned 
into two components Bhogya (yet to traverse) and the 
Bhukta (already traversed) by the rule of proportion. — 


The Bhogya portion would be 18840 + 800 and the 
Bhukta portion would be the balance deducted from 40 days. 


40 x 188 = 7520 + 800 = 9.4 days of Bhogya dasa 
of Bhramari and 30.6 days of Bhukta dasa at the end to 
be added (9.4 + 30.6 = 40 days of Bhramari).

General Results of Yogini Mudda dasa: 


Yogini Mudda dasha gives results generally in 
' accordance with its nomenclature. However at times the 
results are modified taking into account the strength and 
situations of the lords of the dasa vis-a-vis the PAC of 
other planets. 


Mangala (Moon) dasha lasts for 10 days only. This 
gives desired results besides gain in business, family 
enjoyment and happiness and success in every field of 
activity. In the model annual chart during this dasha 
though the native had his marriage and got enough 
rewards in the field of sports it caused obstructions in 
his education. 


Pingala (Sun) gets 20 days duration in a year in 
which the native gets gain in business, pendency of work, 
Status in society, prosperity and like noticeable activities. 


Dhanya (Jupiter) will be for a month in a year. The 
native would acquaint with new and popular personalities, 
and obtain respects in society, happiness from children 
and employment benefits and similar auspicious results. 
The irony of it is that the native of the model annual 
chart experienced a high scale of tensions during the 
Dhanya dasha that took place between April-May 1955. 


Bhramari (Mars) lasts for a month and 10 days in 

a year, While any native is likely to enjoy seeking fresh 

employment, business or travel he would doubtless have 

worries and tensions in the business, obstructions, and 

‘wasteful expenditure, frustrations and face litigations. 
The native of the example chart had this dasha for a 

shortwhile during 1954 when it was cool and calm while 


Annual Horoscopy 169 


in 1955 when this dasha had reared its head he had to 
leave the house. 


Bhadrika (Mercury) has 50 days duration in a year. 
Victory in litigation and success in disputes, but worry 
due to activities, tensions in earnings and expenses and 
ultimate victory would be the results during this dasha. 


Ulka (Saturn) lasts for 60 days during which the 
native becomes tension prone, and brings bad results 
out of quarrels and false allegations. There may be gains 
in business and employment after strenuous labour. 


Sidhya (Venus) has a fairly long duration of 70 
days of benefic effect. The native would enjoy all kinds 
of happiness, fame, prosperity, respect and income from 
business. 


Sankata (Rahu/Ketu) dasa is given the maximum 
duration of 80 days among the Yogini dasas. It would 
prove to be a difficult period in which the native suffers 
from loss in business, transfer to unwanted place and 
defeat in litigations. However, the native got married 
on the one hand and had consequent family dissentions 
during this dasa between December 1954 and March 1955. 


15.5 Patyayini dasha: 


Patyayini dasha is not calculated like that of 
Vimshottari Mudda or Yogini Mudda dasa taking into 
account the Janma Nakshatra and completed years. 


The longitudes (excluding the sign) of all the seven 
planets (from Sun to Saturn) and the Lagna are only 
considered. They are first arranged in an ascending order 
of degree and minutes. Let us calculate Krissamsas for 


170 ; Annual Horoscopy 


the 23rd annual chart falling between 1 1-5-1955 and 10th 
June 1956. 


Krissamsas: Step 1. 


This arrangement is called Krissamsas. 


Table of Krissamsa: 


Venus 
Mercury 
Jupiter 
Mars 
Saturn

Lagna 


Sun 


Patyamsas: Step 2 


The first Patyamsas would be that of first Krissamsa. 
In this case it is Venus 3°39'. The second Patyamsas 
would be the difference between the second and the first. 
That is to say Mercury’s Patyamsas would be the 
difference obtained between the Krissamsa of Venus and 
Mercury (3°59'-3°39' = 0°20'). The third Patyamsas would 
be that of Jupiter which is obtained by taking the 
difference between the Krissamsa of Jupiter and Mercury 
(6°17'-3°59' = 2°18'). We continue in the sine way until 
_ we finish the eighth one that would be the difference of 
eighth and seventh Krissamsa. Let us tabulate the Patyamsas 
with the help of Krissamsas arrived at step 1. |

Note: The total of Patyamsas would be equal to 
the last Krissamsa that of Sun 25° 53’. 


Duration of Patyayini dasa: 


The total duration of 365 days is apportioned to 
each planet and lagna in accordance with Patyamsas of 
each planet or lagna to that of the total of Patyamsas.- 
The following formula is used to calculate the duration 
of Patyayini dasa for each planet and Lagna. ~ 


Patyamsas of the Planet/Lagna x 365 days 
Total of Patyamsas 


Let us calculate the duration of dasa for certain 
planets to understand the step. 


Venus has a Patyamsas of 3° 39' (219') and total of 
Patyamsas is equal to 1553" (25° — 53' = 1553'). The 
total duration of Patyayini dasa is 365 days. Hence using 
the formula we would get 219° x 365 + 1553' = 51.47 
days. Similarly for Jupiter that has a Patyamsas of 2° 
18° (138') the duration would come to a total of 32.43 
days (138' x 365 + 1553' = 32.43).

Yogas in Varsha Phal and their 
influence 


Yoga means the configuration of planets or in other 
words becoming altogether one. The unique formation 
of two or more planets causes the Yoga. 


16.1 Tajik Yogas: 


The Tajika yogas are entirely different from Parasari 
Yogas. There are only sixteen yogas through which 
wonderful predictions are made. The Prasna Sastra_ or 
Horary astrology extensively makes use of these Yogas 
for giving correct prediction. These Yogas are useful 
tools for predicting and timing events in Varsha Phal. 
Three significant points are to be borne in mind in order 
to make use of these yogas fully. 

The significant points are: 

a) Lagnesh (The Lord of Lagna in Varsha Kundli) 

b) Karyesh (The lord of the bhava signifying the event) 

c) Deepthamsha (Planetary orbs): It is essential that the 
difference in the longitude between the Lagnesh and 
Karyesh fall within the average of their Deepthamsha 
range. (Refer para 1.7 for a detailed discussion on 


174 


Annual Horoscopy 


Deepthamsha). 
16.2 The Sixteen Yogas: 


Let us discuss the Tajika Yogas one by one: 


(i) 


(ii) 


(iii) 


Ikkaval Yoga: When all the planets are in Kendra 
(1,4,7,10) bhavas or in Panaphara (2,5,8,11) bhavas 
in an annual chart this yoga is formed. It indicates 
prosperity all round the year and there is prospect 
of Raja Yoga during the year. This yoga is not found 
in any of the three model annual chart. 


Induvara Yoga: If the planets in the annual chart 
are situated in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th bhavas 


then this yogais formed. A year full of distress is 


the result of this formation. Luckily this yoga is 


not present in the three model annual chart. 


Ithasal._Yoga—Muthasil Yoga): There are three 


kinds in this yoga and are aspect based. The three 


kinds are (a) Vartaman,.(b) Poorna and (c) Bhavishyat. 


(a) Vartaman Ithasal Yoga: Generally Ithasal Yoga 


means only Vartaman Ithasal Yoga. Otherwise 

it is necessary to mention Poorna and Bhavishyat 

Ithasal yoga. The formation of this yoga depends 
on the following conditions between two planets. 

1. Both Lagnesh and Karyesh Should aspect each 
other no matter whether the aspect is inimical 

or friendly. . 

2. The fast moving planets should be behind the 
slow moving planet. : 

3. The longitudinal distance between the two 

should be within the mean of their 


Annual Horascopy 175 


Deepthamsha. (Refer to para 1.7 for 
Deepthamsha range of the planets) 


(b) Poorna Ithasal Yoga: It needs the following 
situation among the planets concerned. ; 


(¢) 


(d) 


l. 


The mutual aspect between the planets peiiet 
friendly or inimical) 


The fast moving planet should be behind the 
slow moving planet but the longitudinal 
difference between them should not be more 
than one degree. It therefore indicates the fruits 
of this Yoga are about to fructify. (Generally 
fructification takes place within two to three 
months of the year). 


Note: According to some scholars this yoga 
exists even when the fast moving planet crosses 
the slow moving planet till the difference in 
their longitude is less than one degree). 


Bhavishyat Ithasal Yoga: On condition that the 
fast moving planet is behind the slow moving 
planet and the difference in their longitude is less 
than the average of their Deepthamsha this yoga 
is formed and the inference is that the Ithasal 
Yoga is to take place in future. 


Rashyant, Rasyadi Muthasil Yoga: This name 
indicates that the Yoga is about to happen. The 
conditions for the formation of this yoga are: 


1, Fast moving planet should be at the end of 


the Rashi (about 29° and above) 


2. Slow moving planet should be at the beginning 


176 


Annual Horoscopy 


of a consecutive Rashi from the rashi where 
fast moving planet remains and the distance 
between their longitudes falls within the mean 
of their Deepthamsha. On reaching the adjacent 
sign the fast moving planet would form Ithasal 
Yoga. This Yoga fructifies during the last 
quarter (two to three months) of the year. In 
case of retrograde planets the results of this 
yoga would fructify provided the fast moving 
planet reaching the third rashi from that of 
the slow moving planet forms Ithasal Yoga. 
This is called Rashyant Muthasil Yoga. 


Note : There is no mention found in the Sastras 
in the formation of this yoga by retrograde 
planets and hence the considered opinions of. 
the scholars are reproduced below. . 


. Ithasal yoga intensifies if the retrograde slow 


moving planet is ahead of fast moving planet. 
It appears that both the planets are desirous 
of meeting each other. 


. It is to be understood that this yoga does not 


exist if the retrograde fast moving planet is 
behind the slow moving planet since the latter 


- is not interested in the formation of this yoga. 


. Even when the fast moving planet is retrograde 


and ahead of slow moving planet (showing a 
desire to meet) it actually indicates separation 
and there will be no result for this yoga. 


. If both of them are retrograde this yoga cannot 


form. 


Annual Horoscopy 177 


(iv) 


7. If any other retrograde planet falls in between 
an Ithasal yoga formation of two planets then 
there is obstruction. but however it may fructify 
later. 


Ishraf yoga or Musharif Yoga: It will give just 
the opposite result of Ithasal Yoga. While Ithasal 
yoga indicates success Ishraf yoga indicates 
failure. The fast moving planet is ahead of slow 
moving planet and the difference in their longitude 
is not more than one degree in the formation of 
this yoga. This means that the fast moving planet 
has traversed over the slow moving planet. It has 
been said earlier that a faster moving planet behind 


- the slow moving planet can catch up with the 


latter easily and when the difference in their 
longitude is one degree and fall within the mean 
of the planetary orbs (Deepthamsha) strengthen 
and cause Poorna Ithasal Yoga. But’in this 
formation it destroys Ithasal yoga. Therefore one 
can say either there will be failure or the existing 
situation would not last long. 


Ilustration: 


Venus (3°39") and retrograde Mercury (3°58') are 
posited in Taurus and Gemini respectively in the 
annual chart cast for 11-6-1955. These two rashis 
are respectively the fourth and fifth bhavas. There 
is exchange of houses between these two planets. 
Hence 


(i) The fast moving planet is ahead of slow 
moving planet- Poorna Ithasal. 


178 


Note: 
A) 


B) 


Annual Horascopy 


(ii) Mercury is retrograde in the next Rashi. 
Mercury being the faster of the two likes to 
meet Venus the slower one however denotes 
separation. 


(iii)Ishraf Yoga is also formed meaning that the 
existing Situation is not to last long. 


Event: The native had to leave his city in July 
1955 and live in another place. He started his 
educational career again. This is the effect of 4th 
and 5th bhavas and fourth and eighth bhavas. You 
find similar formation between Saturn in Libra 
(220 26') and Moon in Capricom (230 24’). 


It has been discussed so far about the combination 
(Yogas) formed between Lagnesh and Karyesh. 
But our experience is that it does not always 
happen. It has been seen that the yogas are also 
formed between the lords of other bhavas with 
Karyesh and or Lagnesh and results occur 
accordingly. It is hoped that the prediction is made 
here also in accordance with the synthesis laid 
down in Jyotish Sastra. 


Timing of Event: Twelve times that of the 
difference between the longitudes of the Lagnesh 
and Karyesh will be the number of days from 
the date of Varsha Pravesh for an event to fructify. 
No doubt the situation of the planets in the annual 
chart described hereunder indicates the results of 
the year. Moon is the lord of sixth (signifying ill 
health and dispute) posited in the twelfth house. 


Annual Horoscopy 179 


(v) 


It is aspected inimically by the Jupiter the posited 


_in the seventh. There exists the seventh (secretly 


inimical) aspect of Jupiter (the second and eleventh 
lord) on Moon. Likewise Venus the lord of fourth 
and ninth together with the Sun (lord of the 
seventh) also causes its friendly aspect (open) on 
Moon. The Retrograde Saturn the Lagnesh and 
twelfth lord is causing inimical aspect on the 
Moon. The planets which are in Kendra to each 
other cause their mutual inimical aspect. 


The situation of the planets aforesaid ensured the 
native had to leave the house over certain disputes 
with the parents with the ailing wife. It is pertinent 
to note that in this chart the Lagnesh and Karyesh 
have never been able to form beneficial Ithasal 
yoga and thus the results aforesaid. No bad results 
would accrue in Ishraf Yoga if the formation were 
between two benefic planets or among malefics 
whose longitudinal difference is beyond 12 
degrees. 


Nakta yoga: This is an auspicious Yoga. This 
yoga is the result of the contact of a third planet 
in the formation of Ithasal between two other 
planets. If Ithasal yoga between Lagnesh and 
Karyesh is not formed due to certain conditions 
like mutual aspect or similar other situations, then 
at this juncture any other fast moving planet than 
Lagnesh and Karyesh aspect them and passes the 
radiance from one to the other. This may be akin 
to the relay race where one of the participants 
running gives the signal to the other team mate 


180 


Annual Horoscopy 


and the other participants in tum covers his portion 
and passes on the signal to next team mate who 
completes the rest of the task. This yoga therefore 
indicates that the work will be accomplished due 
to the help of a third party. The third planet passes 
on the radiance of the faster of the two to the 
slowei one and thus both the planets get involved 
with the third planet. 


Note: 


1) In the annual chart of 1954 Ithasal yoga is 
formed between Lagnesh Mars (13°14'36") and 
Panchamesh Jupiter (10°32'52") and they are 
in Sama Saptama. The faster moving planet 
Mars is retrograde and ahead. Hence it shows 
separation. — 


_ 2) Saturn (9°58') and Jupiter (10032'52") give 


each other friendly aspect. The faster of the 
two Jupiter is ahead but within one degree 
and hence forms Poorna Ithasal Yoga. (Refer 
16.2(iii)(b)(ii). But retrograde Saturn (slow 
moving planet) does not seem interested in 
Isthasal. 

3) The Moon (19°39'14") and Mercury (19°49'16") 
are in four- ten axis and thus aspect secretly 
inimical. This situation indicates Vartaman 
Poorna Ithasal Yoga formation. 

4) Moon (19°39'14") is in between Lagnesh Mars 
(13°14'36") and Mercury (19°49'16") and thus 
forms Nakta Yoga. 


5) Moon (19°39'14") also lays between Lagnesh 


Annual Horoscopy 181 


(vi) 


Mars (13°14'36") and Venus (28°15'27") the 
seventh and twelfth lord and the situation 
results in the formation of Nakta Yoga. The 
Deepthamsha of Moon is 12° and the 
difference between Mars and Moon is 7° and 
that between Venus and itself is 9°. However 
the Deepthamsha of Mars is 8° and that of 
Venus is 7° and the difference between their 
longitudes is 15°0'51" and hence no Ithasal 
yoga formation but for Moon’s intervention). 


A peep at the events happened in the 22nd. 

year (10-6-54 to 10-6-55) of native’s life would 

reveal the effects of the yogas mentioned so far. 

i) Noticeable recognitions and awards in He 
sports competitions. 

ii) Break in studies: The native was rusticated 
from the University and not allowed to 
appear for the examinations. 

iii) Marriage took place in 1955. {It was due 
to the effect of Mercury the 11th lord (elder 
Brother’s benevolence) having Poorna 
Ithasal with Lagnesh Mars and Venus). 

iv) There was family dispute and tension with . 
parents and brothers. 

v) Financial strains and ill health to wife. 


Yamaya Yoga: The formation of this is almost 
similar to Nakta Yogaexcept that the third planet 
to help would be a slow moving planet and not 
the fast moving planet. 


i. There is no mutual aspect between Lagnesh 


182 


(vii) 


(vill) 


Annual Horoscopy 


and Karyesh. 

li. The intervening slow moving planet aspects 
both the Lagnesh and Karyesh and falls within 
the Deepthamsha range. 

Results: The native gets success with the help 

of a third party but after strenuous efforts. In the 

annual chart cast for 10-6-1954, Lagnesh Mars 
and Karyesh Jupiter are aspected by Saturn and 

falls within the Deepthamsha range. (Saturn 9 + 

Jupiter 9 = 18 + 2 = 9 and Satum 9 + Mars 8 = 

17+2 = 8.5). 

Manaoo Yoga: This yoga obstructs the results 

of Ithasal yoga. It is therefore necessary for 

Lagnesh and Karyesh to form Ithasal yoga when 

a malefic (Mars and/ or Saturn) is in association 

with or cause inimical aspect with that of the faster 

of the two the Lagnesh and the Karyesh and within 
their Deepthamsha range. 


Results: The native would face threats from foes, 
failures, and increase in debts, quarrels and bear 
financial loss. 


Kambool Yoga (Maqbool- ambitious): The role 
played by Moon is very important in this yoga. 
The conditions are: 

i. There exists Ithasal yoga between Lagnesh and 
Karyesh. 

ii, Either the Lagnesh or Karyesh or both of them 
form Ithasal yoga with the Moon. (If all the 
three i.e. the Lagnesh, Karyesh and the Moon 
are in exaltation or own sign and strong then 


Annual Horoscopy 183 


they form an excellent Kambool Yoga). 


Results: There will be fine-tuning in the effects 


of the Ithasal yoga formed between Lagnesh and 


Karyesh since a stronger and fast moving planet 


Moon accepts such formation and increases such 
effects intensely. The effects of the bhava depend 
upon the strength and situation of the planets 
concerned. Therefore this Yoga has been divided 
into four varieties as 

(i) Uttama (excellent), 

(ii) Madhyama (medium), 


(iif) Sama (ordinary) and 
(iv) Adhama (low). 


a) 


b) 


c) 


d) 


When all the three, Lagnesh, Karyesh and 
the Moon are in exaltation or own sign the 
effect would be excellent (Uttama). 


If these three were in their own Dreshkon, 
Hudda, or Navamsa and not in own sign in 
the annual chart then the result would be 
medium (Madhyama). It must be noted that 
there is no Hudda for Moon and Sun, hence 
consider only Dreshkon or Navamsa. 


If in friend’s house or in a neutral house then 


the effect would be Sama (ordinary). 


If the situation of the three planets is 
debilitation sign or inimical sign then the 
effect is low (Adhama). In this way we can 
create different classification for the 
impending results. 


184 Annual Horoscopy 


In the second annual chart Lagnesh Saturn 
(22°26'30") forms Ithasal yoga with the tenth lord Mars 
(17°2'27"). The fast moving planet is behind the slow 
moving planet. The Deepthamsha of Mars, Mercury and 
Saturn are respectively 8°, 7° and 9°. The difference 
in the longitude of Saturn and Mars (22°26'30" — 17°2'27" 
= 5°24'03") is well within the mean of their Deepthamsha 
range (Saturn 9° + Mars 8° = 17°+2 = 8.5°). Hence there 
is [thasal yoga between Mars and Saturn. There .is no 
Ithasal between Saturn and Mercury since the difference 
in their longitude is 18°27'38" (22°26'30" — 3°58'52") 
and the mean of their Deepthamsha is 8° (Saturn9° + 
Mercury7° = 16° + 2 = 8°). There is no aspect of Moon 
on Mars. Saturn however has Moon’s tenth aspect. While 
Mars is in an inimical sign Saturn is in Neutral’s sign. 
Moon is also in an inimical sign. Mars is in its own 
Hudda and Saturn is in neutral’s Hudda that of Venus. 
Mars is in its own Dreshkon, in Jupiter’s (neutral) 
Navamsa while Saturn is in Jupiter’s (inimical) dreshkon 
and in Mars’s (friend) Navamsa.

(ix) Gairi Kambool Yoga: This yoga is the 
culmination of the following factors. 
a. Ithasal yoga formed between Lagnesh and 
Karyesh. 


186 


(x) 


(xi) 


Annual Horoscopy 


b. Moon not being either in exaltation or own 
rashi is at the extreme degrees of a sign. 

c. On Moon entering the next sign forms Ithasal 
yoga with either Lagnesh and Karyesh or any 
other strong planet. 

Result: The native would achieve the desired result 

with the help of a superior official. 


Khallasara Yoga: This yoga nullifies the effect 
of Ithasal yoga. “Kallas” means nullify or weaken. 


' This yoga is formed when 


a. There is Ithasal yoga between Lagnesh and 
Karyesh 

b. An unqualified (Neither exalted nor in own 
Sign and not even aspected by any planet) 
Moon not having association or Ithasal yoga 
with Lagnesh and Karyesh. 


Resuit: This is an inauspicious yoga and destroys 


the effect of Kambool yoga. 


Note: The longitude of Lagnesh and Karyesh is 
not within the Deepthamsha range of the Moon. 


Radda Yoga: This means the cancellation of 

Ithasal yoga formation. Cancellation takes place 

if the following conditions exist in the planetary 

situations: 

a. There is Ithasal yoga between Lagnesh and 
Karyesh 

b. Either Lagnesh or Karyesh is (1) Retrograde, 
(2) combust, (3) debilitated, (4) placed in the 
6th or 8th or 12th bhava or (5) in an inimical 
sign or (6) associated with or aspected by a 


Annual Horoscopy 187 


malefic. 


Result: It means the cancellation or ineffectiveness 
of Ithasal yoga (Ithasal yoga cannot ensure 
auspicious results unless the two planets are strong, 
aspected by benefics or have Ithasal formation with 
a strong Moon). This yoga also gives the same 
effect of Khallasara yoga, which is fruitless. 


Note: 


i) 


Radda yoga is formed if the fast moving 
planet, among the planets forming Ithasal 


“yoga, is retrograde. If the slow moving planet ~ 


is retrograde then the fruit of Ithasal yoga is 
intensified and hence should not be presumed 
to be a Radda yoga formation since the faster 
moving planet is behind the slow moving 


- planet in Ithasal yoga. Therefore, Radda yoga 


i 


iii) 


is formed only when the faster of the two is 


retrograde. 

The other factors stated above take precedence 

in the formation of Radda yoga than 

retrogression of planets. 

The importance lies in the fact regarding the 

following situation of the two planets. 

a. If Ithasal yoga is formed when the fast 
moving planet is in Kendra and the slow 
moving planet is in Apoklim (3rd, 6th, 
9th, 12th) bhava then the initial results 
are good and later inauspicious effect 
arises. . 

b. If Ithasal yoga is formed when the fast 


188 Annual Horoscopy 


moving planet is in Apoklim bhava and 
slow moving planet in Kendra then there 
would be initial obstructions and success 
in the end of the work undertaken. 


ae Dupphalikuttha Yoga: The situations of the 
planets vary unlike the Ithasal yoga already 
described. Here (i) the Ithasal yoga is formed 
between Lagnesh and Karyesh no doubt except 
that (77) the slow moving planet is stronger (being 
in exaltation, own house, own dreshkon, Navamsa 
or Hudda or strong in accordance with 
Panchavargeeya bala) and (iii) the fast moving 
planet is weak (other than the situation stated in 
11 (3b) above). The effect is achieving the desired 
_ result. 


Note: 


(i) This yoga does not fructify if the fast moving 
planet is retrograde or combust according to 
some scholars. 

(ii) This is Ithasal yoga only given separately to 
identify the situation that the slow moving 
planet is stronger and that the fast moving 
planet is weaker. 


It has been specifically described earlier that 
if the fast moving planet is retrograde or of 
lesser degree then it cannot cause Ithasal yoga 
and on the other hand if the slow moving planet 
is retrograde and of advanced degrees it will 
intensify the formation of the Ithasal yoga and 
the consequent result. 


Annual Horoscopy ; 189 


(xiii) Duttodadivira Yoga: Three planets are required 


(xiv) 


(xv) 


to form this yoga. They are the ZLagnesh and 
Karyesh and one more planet that causes Ithasal 
with either of them. When the Lagnesh and the 
Karyesh are both weak, combust, debilitated, 
situated in an inimical house or retrograde losing 
the glow, and one among them forms Ithasal yoga 
with another planet, that is situated in its exaltation 
or own house or own Hudda or own dreshkon or 
own Navamsa, then the work undertaken is easily 
got done or through the help of some one. 


Tambir Yoga: The conditions required for 
formation of this yoga are: 


a. No Ithasal yoga between Lagnesh and Karyesh 


b. Karyesh is at the fag end of a rashi and is 


about to transit to the adjacent sign 


c. On reaching the adjacent sign Karyesh forms 
Ithasal with the planet that is in its own sign 
‘and also with the Lagnesh as well. 


Result: The work undertaken would become 
successful eventhough belated. 


Note: 


(i) If the planet in the adjacent sign is weak then 
there is likely to be failure. 


(ii) This yoga is also called “Subhtambir yoga”. 
Kuttha Yoga: (This means “strong” in Greek 
language.) 


The undermentioned situations of the planets are 


considered strong in the order in which they are 


190 


(xvi) 


Annual Horoscopy 


written. 

a. Generally planets in Kendra are strong but 
among them the one in Lagna is very strong. 

b. Planets in other Kendras viz. 4th, 7th and 10th 
houses follow. 

c. Planets in Panaphar bhavas (2nd, Sth, 8th and 
11th houses). 

d. In absence of above the planet that aspects 
the Lagna. 

e. In absence of above planets in Apoklim bhavas 
(3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses). 


f. Planets in exaltation, own house, own 
dreshkon, own Navamsa and own Hudda. 


Kuttha yoga is therefore formed by Lagnesh and 
Karyesh that are either in Kendra or Panaphar 
and aspected by benefics devoid of malefic 


- influence. 


Result; It indicates auspicious time, success and 
occurrence of auspicious events during the year. 


Duruph Yoga: (Duruph means “weak”): In this 


_ yoga both the Lagnesh and Karyesh are weak, 


situated in 6th or 8th or 12th bhava, combust or 
retrograde. 


Result: In such a situation there is bound to be 
failure in undertaking and tensions galore. 


Note: Ordinarily it should be understood success 
could be expected if the Lagnesh and Karyesh 
are in beneficial houses and have the influence 
of benefics. 


Cuapter 17 


Significant points to ponder 


17.1 Strength of planets on the basis of situations: 


if, 


tii. 


iv. 


The Ist, 4th, 7th and 10th bhavas are Kendras or _ 
Kantakas. These are auspicious houses. Planets 
posited in these bhavas are strong especially those 
in Lagna. Moon becomes stronger in Ist, 10th, 
7th, 4th, lita, 5th, 9th, 3rd and 2nd bhavas 
respectively. Mars also considered stronger in the 


‘aforementioned bhavas and the third bhava. The 


6th, 8th and 12th bhavas are inauspicious houses. 


Planets are fully strong in Lagna, 50% while in 
other Kendras, 25% if either in Panaphar (2nd, 
5th, 8th and 11th) or Apoklim (3rd, 6th, 9th, and 
12th) bhavas. . 

A planet at the beginning of a sign becomes strong. 
At 15° of a sign it becomes Poorna Bali and at 
the end of the sign it gets weak or no strength. 
A planet in own house is strong while in a friend’s 
house it is of medium strength and forbidden if 
in an enemy’s house. 


If a planet gets strength in three divisional charts 


192 : Annual Horascopy 


(Vargas) then it is considered of medium strength. 


vi. Sun during the midday, Venus during midnight, 
Saturn in the evening, Moon during sunset time, 
Mercury in the early Morning, Mars at the end 
of nighttime and Jupiter in Brahma Muhurtha 
become stronger. 

vii. Male planets during the day in a male sign and 
the female planets in a female sign during the 
night are stronger. 

. viii.A planet that is strong during the birth time as 
well as during Varsha Pravesh tends to give 
auspicious results. 


17.2 Planets that are considered weak or 
inauspicious: 
i. Planets in 6th, 8th or 12th bhavas. 


ii. Planets that are Combust and those engulfed by 
the rays of the Sun. 


iii. Planets that are in the seventh from its sign or 
from Mars. 


iv. Planets that are debilitated 
y. Planets in the seventh from the Sun 


vi.. Planets devoid of Ithasal yoga and forming malefic 
Isharaf. 


vii. Planets that are associated with malefics, defeated 
in war and in inimical house. 


viii.Planets aspected by malefics or enemies and in 
6:8 positions from Lagna. 


ix. Planets in Papa-Kartari yoga. 


Annual Horoscopy 193 


av Xs 


Planets that were weak both in the birth chart as 
well as Varsha Kundli. ~ 


17.3 Results of inauspicious planets: 


i, 


vi. 


vii, 


Sun gives skin and eye trouble and loss of aptitude 
besides difficulties to the parents. 

Moon gives poverty, eye diseases and family 
disputes. 


i. Mars provides loss of strength and courage. 


Fear out of Mercury. 

Jupiter would ensure loss of interest in religious 
activities and difficult livelihood. 

Venus destroys prosperity and happiness. Troubles 
from women. 

Saturn creates fear from servants and possibility 
of getting wounded. 


17.4 Travel related ideas: 


ii, 


Travel is definite provided movable signs forming 
a Kendra with benefic planets. Travel would be 
delayed if malefics were in Kendra. No travel if 
such planets are retrograde. Travel takes place 
when they become direct. 


There would be no travel if benefics were in the 
fourth and tenth houses. 


If the Moon and Lagnesh are in the ninth then 
the travel is without doubt. 


. If there is association of Lord of the year and 


the Lord of Varsha Lagna then the place for travel 
is decided after deliberations. 


194 


Vi. 


Vii. 


Annual Horoscopy 


Travel has to take place if the seventh lord is in 
the ninth house. 


Travel would take place if Moon were in the 
seventh from Muntha. 

If Lagnesh is in the ninth or the ninth lord in the 
ninth then too travel is definite. 

Note: Pilgrimage is considered from Ninth bhava. 
Hence it is necessary to consider the seventh and 
ninth bhavas for matters connected with travel. 


17.5 Special significance of aspects: 


i. 


Jw, 


iil. 


iv. 


The portion from Lagna to the sixth bhava of a 
Kundli is called its right side or Poorvardha (first 
half or invisible half). 


The portion from the seventh to twelfth bhava 
of a Kundli is called its left side or (parardha) 
(second half or visible half). 


The planets posited on the left side cast left aspect 
or visible aspect. Hence the aspect of a planet 
posited in the fourth on a planet in the tenth bhava 
is considered weak while the aspect of a planet 
in. the tenth on those in the fourth are considered 
strong since the latter is casting its visible aspect. 


There are other scholars to say that the planetary 
aspects from the 3rd, 4th and 5th bhava are visible 
aspect (Vama drishti) and that from the ninth, 
tenth and eleventh bhava are invisible aspect 
(Dakshina drishti). 


Since the Zodiac is moving westward planets 
appear eastward and hence one half of the zodiac 


Annual Horoscopy 195 


17.6 


til. 


17.7 


i. 


iii, 


falls on the right side and is always visible. 
Planets, that are posited in first half of the zodiac, 
have visible aspect (Vama drishti) and at the end 
cast Dakshina drishti. 


Consideration of Varsha Pravesh according 
to Panchang: 


Varsha Pravesh in all Thithis (Lunar days) except 
Rikta Thithi tends to be good (auspicious). 


Inauspicious effect would take place if Varsha 
Pravesh arises during dwadasi or Rikta Thithis. 


Varsha Pravesh occurring on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, Thursdays or Fridays are good and 
auspicious while those rising on Tuesdays, 
Saturdays and Sundays indicate fear, loss and 
inauspiciousness. 


Nakshatras and Varsha Pravesh: 


The Varsha Pravesh occurring on a day when the 
Nakshatra was Ashwini, Mrigsira, Pushya, Hasta, 
Punarvasu, Swati or Revati it indicates prosperity 
and excellence (Uttama). 


If the Nakshatra on the day of Varsha Pravesh 
happens to be Krittika, Rohini, Ardra, Jyeshta, 
Mula, Sravana, Anuradha, Poorva Phalguni, 
Poorvashada,. Poorva badra pada, Uttara, 
Phalguni, Uttarashada, or Uttara badra pada then 
the year becomes mediocre (Madhyama). 


It is quite considered inauspicious or forbidden 


year if the Varsha Pravesh takes place on a day 
when the Nakshatra was Bharani, Aslesha, Magha,_: 


196 


Annual Horoscopy 


Chitra, Visakha, Dhanishta or Satabhisha. 


17.8 Lagna and Varsha Kundli: 


i. 


Hil. 


When 
a) the lagna is associated with benefics or 


b) aspected by Varshesh or other benefics then 
- the native would get married or beget children 
‘or happiness from children and would be free 
from ill health or other dangers during the 
year. 


A year in which the Lagna rashi is that of malefics 
or associated with or aspected by malefics proves 
to be distress prone with illness, sorrows, losses, 
poverty and like (chart of 10-6-1955). 


A strong Lagnesh provides all kinds of comforts, 
good health and glory (see the chart pf 11-06- 
1955) while one of medium strength a little 
happiness and a weak Lagnesh ensures tensions 
and difficulties. 


. If the Lagnesh happens to be in 6th or 8th or 


vi. 


vi 


12th then it gives reduced happiness. 


All round prosperity is assured if the Lagnesh is 
in Trikona or Kendra or under the influence of 
benefics (see the chart of 11-6-1955). 


If Lagnesh is associated with Malefics or aspected 


by them then the native is entangled in disputes, 
quarrels and ill health. 


. If the dispositor of Lagnesh is posited in a benefic 


bhava then that situation indicates accomplishment 
of good work. 


Annual Horoscopy 197 


17.9 Dwijanma Year: 


i. 


iit. 


When the Janma Lagna and the Varsha Lagna 
are one and the same sign then the year is called 
“Dwijanma” year. The year would be distressful 
and even may cause death. 

According to astrologers from the Hill Region, 
this yoga can occur only in the year in which 
the Ishtakal (time lapsed between the time of birth 


and sunrise) in the birth chart and Varsha Pravesh 


chart are same. 


There are scholars to quote “Janma Lagne yada’ 
Varsha Pravesho bhavati tada phalam subham 
gneyam” that is to say that when the Janma Lagna 
and Varsha Pravesh Lagna are the same it is 
considered auspicious since this yoga would repeat 
several times in one’s life. This hypothesis has 
to be tested. 


17.10 Pada in Varsha Kundli: 


i. 


iii. 


The pada of a planet is the rashi in which it is 
posited in the Janma Kundli. If this Pada (or Rashi) 
of the planet is strong in Varsha Kundli then there 


' would be happiness otherwise it would create 


distress. 


If a planet posited in a particular bhava in the 
birth chart gives good or bad results and remains 
in the same bhava in Varsha Kundli then the result 
given by that planet would be more or less same. 


A planet, which is quite strong in the birth chart 
and becomes weak in Varsha Kundli, then it gives 


198 


Annual Horoscopy 


-bad results at the end of the year. If the strength 


were equal then same results would ensue. On 
the other hand a planet that was weak in birth 
chart and has become strong in Varsha Kundli 
then it would give bad results in the first half of 
the year.

Sahams and their use in Varsha Phal 


18.1 One of the tools used for prediction in Varsha 
Kundli is Saham. It can be called a “sensitive point” 
that is used for finding out the timing of certain life 
-events. Some scholars opine that if Sahams are calculated 
both in the birth chart and annual chart then a comparison 
of the mutual relations between .the two sahams would 
throw more light on the prediction. There are different 
opinions about the number and name of Sahams. There 
are 50 sahams according to Acharya Nilkantha, while 
Acharya Venkatesh mentions about 48 but Acharya 
Keshav elucidates only 23 of such sahams. 


The formula for calculating the Sahams are given hereunder:

18.2 Results of Sahams: 


a. Auspicious results are felt when the Sahams and 
lord of Sahams are placed in benefic houses, or 
aspected by benefics or posited in benefic 
Navamsas. 


b. If a Saham forms Ithasal Yoga with the eighth 
lord it does not give the desired results. However 
if the lord of the Saham is the same both in birth 
chart and annual chart the effect of Saham is 
definite. 

c. The results of the saham should be ascertained 
after taking into consideration the status, life, 
education, business and the longevity of the native. 


Annual Horoscopy : : 203 


d. The prime criterion should be to assess the strength 
_ or weakness of the Saham before deciding the 
end results. A Saham is considered strong if the 
lord of the Saham is posited in the same Rashi 
or aspects the Saham or associated with or 
aspected by benefics. Otherwise a Saham is to 

be taken as weak.

Year-wise comments on Punya Saham: 
1954-55: 
i. The favourable friendly(open) fifth aspect of Mars 
and Rahu falls on Punya Saham. 
ii. The favourable but secretly friendly 11th aspect 
of Jupiter, Venus and Mercury falls on Saham. 


ii, 


~ 


The openly inimical 7th aspect of Saturn and the 
secretly inimical 10th aspect of Ketu are cast on 
Saham. 
_ iv. The Moon and the Sun do not cast any aspect on 
the Saham. Hence their aspect is considered 
neutral. 


Comments: Mars, the Lagnesh and Venus the seventh 
Lord are favourably aspecting the Punya Saham. The

seventh lord of Janam Kundli (birth chart) Saturn’s 
aspect on Punya Saham. The aspectual connection 
of the Moon, the lagna lord ofg birth chart with the 
seventh lord of Venus and lagna lord Mars of annual 
chart. This aspectual connection between the Moon 
and Saturn, Lagnesh and sapptamesh (of birth chart) 
respectively and the Lagnesh (Mars) and Saptmesh 

(Venus) of annual chart resulted in the solemnization 

of the marriage of the native on 16th January 1955. 

1955-56: : 

i. Punya Saham is in Gemini having a longitude of 
26° 46'. It is associated with Mars, the lord of 
third and tenth and Mercury, the lord of fifth and 
eighth and that of Ketu of the annual chart.

iv. There is no inimical aspect on Punya Saham. 


Comments: the native experienced only favourable 
results during the year. . 


B. Vidya Saham: 

1954-55: 

Formula: Sun — Moon + Lagna (daytime birth) 
= 55° 53' — 169° 39° + 224° 54' 
= 246° 14' +224° 54' 
= 471° 08' 
= 111° 08" 
= 3° 21° 08" 


Annual Horoscopy 207 


Comments: Vidya Saham is posited in Cancer sign 
with a longitude of 21° 08'. The Sun, the tenth lord, 
and the Moon, the ninth lord, cast respectively the 
third and eleventh aspect respectively (Both secretly 
friendly) on the Saham. Saturn is the third and fourth 
lord and aspects inimically (the tenth aspect}. All 
other planets have neutral aspect. This Saham is in 
the Janma lagna Rashi. The Varsha Lagna is in the 
fifth house from Vidya Saham. The Seventh Lord 
Saturn of the Birth Chart aspects the Vidya Saham. 
The native suffered in studies during March-April 
1955, due to marriage. , 


1955-56: . 
Formula: Moon — Sun + Lagna (Nighttime birth) 
= 293° 24' — 55° 53' + 324° 17' 
= 561° 48' 
= 201° 48' 
= 6° 21° 48' + 30° 
= 75 21° 48' 
Comments: Vidya Saham falls in the sign of Scorpio 
with a longitude of 21° 48'. 


. The Lord of Saham Mars is in the fifth bhava with 
the lord of the fifth house and thus the Lord of the 
Saham, Mars (carrying the favourable aspect of Satum 
from the fifth house thereof) and Jupiter’s fifth aspect 
on the Saham is favourable. The Vidya Saham is 

having the friendly aspect of Jupiter and the Moon 
and inimical aspect of Yoga Karaka Venus. The aspect 
of Saturn and Mars though usually gives negative 


208 | Annual Horoscopy 


inputs in this case it gave the native both the break 
in education as well secured admission in another 
University during the year as Vidya Saham is beyane 
more friendly aspect than inimical. 
1956-57: 
Formula: Sun — Moon + Lagna (Daytime birth) 

= 55° 53' ~ 72° 04' + 73° 17' 

= 415° 53° — 72° 04' + 73° 17' 

=343° 49' + 73° 17' 

=417° 06' 

= 57° 06' 

= 1% 27° 06' 
Comments: The Vidya Saham is in Vrishabha Rashi 
with a longitude of 27° 06". 


In this case the Lord of the Saham Venus is with 
the Moon the lord of the second in Lagna. There is 
exchange of houses between Lagnesh and the Lord 
of the Saham. Jupiter, the lord of seventh and tenth, 
aspects Venus (Sahamesh) and the Moon (Dhanesh) 
favourably. Vidya Saham has otherwise inimical and 
neutral aspect of other planets. The net result is that 
the native had to abandon his studies. He got 
employed during December 1956. 


C. Karma Saham: 
(For the year 1956-57) 
Formula: Mars — Mercury + Lagna (Daytime birth) 
=310° 26' — 37° 15' + 73° 17' 
= 273° 11' +. 73° 17' 


Annual Horoscopy 209 


= 346° 28' 
= 11s 16° 28' 
Note: The Lagna falls between the Subtrahend 


‘(Mercury) and the Minuend (Mars) and hence 30 
degrees has not been added. 


The Lord of Karma Saham Jupiter that is in the third 
bhava is having seventh (inimical) aspect of Mars 
the lord of sixth and eleventh and the tenth (inimical) 
aspect of Saturn the lord of eighth and ninth besides 
the fourth (inimical) aspect of both the Sun, the third 
lord, and Mercury the Lagnesh and fourth lord. 
- However the Saham is having friendly aspect of 
Saturn, the Sun, Mercury and Ketu and the inimical 
aspect of the moon and Venus. The native got into 
employment during December 1956 after hectic efforts 
and utmost difficulty because of the friendly relations 
between Jupiter, the lord of the seventh and tenth, 
and Venus (the fifth Lord) and the Moon (the second 
lord). The period before this was of untold miseries. 


D. Karya Siddhi Saham: 
(For the year 1954-55) 
Formula: Saturn—Sun+Sun Sign Lord(Daytime birth) 
= 189° 58' - 55° 53' + 88° 15' 
= 134° 05' + 88° 15' 
= 222° 20' 
= 7s 12° 20' 


The Karya Siddhi Saham falls in Varsha Lagna during 
this year. The Sahamesh Mars is retrograde associated 
with Rahu in the second bhava. The Sahamesh is 


Annual Horascopy 


having fourth (inimical) aspect of Moon and the 
seventh (inimical) aspect of Jupiter, Venus and 
Mercury. Saturn casts its friendly aspect on Mars 
while the Sun and Ketu have neutral aspect. The 
Saham on the other hand is aspected favourably by 
the Moon, the ninth lord (third aspect) and Ketu (fifth 
aspect) and the seventh (inimical) aspect of the Sun 
while all other planets have neutral aspect. The net 
result of this association and aspects on the Saiam 
and its lord was the native was rusticated from the 
University during March 1955. The fifth lord Jupiter 
‘is afflicted in the eighth house and having more 
inimical aspect and the Karya Siddhi Saham also 
having the same situation causes failure in 
accomplishment of desires. 


. Vivaha Saham: 
(For the year 1954-55) 


Formula: Venus — Saturn+Lagna (for both day and 
night time birth) 


= 88° 15! —-189° 58" +: 224°-54’ 
= 258° 17' + 224° 54' 
= 489° Q9' 
= 123° 09' 
= 4° 03° 09' 
Note: Since Lagna falls in between the Subtrahend 


and Minuend one sign or 30 degrees has not been 
added. 


Vivaha Saham falls in Simha Rashi that is the tenth 
sign of the annual chart. Sun the lord of the Saham 


Annual Horoscopy 211 


is in the seventh bhava and indicates the appropriate 
time for Marriage. Sun aspects (though inimical) its 
sign wherein the Vivaha Saham is posited. Mars, the 
Lagnesh and Venus the seventh lord aspect Vivaha 
saham friendly. The aspect of Moon the lord of the 
ninth on the Sahamesh Sun is friendly. The Saham 

is also having friendly aspect of Jupiter, Venus, 
Mercury, Mars and Saturn. However their aspect on 
the Sun the Sahamesh is neutral. The marriage was 
performed in January 1955. ; 


18.4 Timing events through Saham: 


Formula: Find the difference between the longitude of 
Saham and that of Sahamesh. Multiply the difference 
by the duration of the Rashi in which Saham lord is 
posited and divide the product by the average duration 
of a Rashi (Rashiman*) that is 300 Vighatis. Let us take 
the example of Vivaha Saham (4 3 09) and determine 
the time of marriage by using the formula. 
Longitude of Saham = 4* 3° 09' or 123° 09! or 123° 
Long. of Saham Lord(Sun) = 1* 25° 53' or 55° 53' or 
56° 
Duration of Rashi of Sahamesh(Vrishabha) = 247 Vighatis 
_ Average duration of a Rashi = 300 Vighatis 
Difference between the longitude of Saham and Sahamesh 
= 56 — 123 = 416 (36+56) — 123 = 293 
Multiplying the difference (293) by the duration of Saham 
Rashi (247) 

ie. 293 x 247 = 72371 


212 Annual Horoscopy 


Divide the product (72371) by the average duration of 
a Rashi (300 Vighatis) 


= 723712300 = 241.24 days 


The year started on 10th June 1954 and the marriage © 
solemnized on 16th January 1955 that is after 221 days. 


* Rashiman: See annexure. The Charkhand 
(oblique ascension) is 52 Pals for the latitude of Delhi 
28° 39". The duration of Vrishabha Rashi at the equator 
is 299 Vighatis. Hence the duration of Vrishabha Rashi 
at Delhi is (299-52) 247 Vighatis. 


Note: 1 ghati = 60 Vighatis (Pals) 


If we calculate the Vivaha Saham for the birth chart 
then the situation would be like this. 


Formula for Vivaha Saham is Venus — Saturn + Lagna 
= 69 03 — 293 17 + 105 29 = 135 46 + 105 29 = 241 15 


Deduct Longitude of Saham from the longitude of the 
Lord of Saham Jupiter 


Longitude of Jupiter = 141° 44' or 142° 
' Longitude of Saham = 241° 15’ or 241° 
Difference = 260° 29' or 261° 


Multiply the difference by the duration of Simha 
Rashi at Delhi (351 Vighatis) and divide by 300. 


= 351 x 261+ 300 = 91611+ 300 = 305.37 days.

This is formed with the help of planetary position 
in the birth chart and the Varsha Lagna. The planets 
are progressed one sign every year from that of their

19.6 Mark the number of Varsha Lagna (for the 23rd 
year) Rashi (Scorpio-8) at the place (A) in the Tripataki 
Chakra. The rest of the number of the rashis should be 
marked in the anticlockwise direction. See diagram. 


19.7 Placement of Moon: Divide the current year 
(completed year + 1) by 9. The remainder determines 
the number of rashis Moon has to be moved from its 
birth chart position. The current year for the annual chart 
on 10-6-1954 is 22. If 22 is divided by 9 we get a 
remainder 4. Moon was in Dhanu rashi at the time of 
birth and hence moving four signs from Dhanu Moon 
has to be placed in Mina Rashi. If the remainder is Zero 
then Moon has to be moved 9 signs away from its birth 
position. 


19.8 Placement of Sun, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
Venus and Saturn: 


Divide the completed year by 4. Place the planets 
counting the number of signs from their birth position 
according to the remainder obtained. The completed year 
is 22 and when divided by 4 it leaves a remainder 2. 
Move these planets two signs away from the birth rashi 
number and place the planets accordingly. 


Therefore Sun will be placed from Vrishabha in 
the natal chart to Mithuna in the Tripataki chakra moving 
two signs away. Like wise Mars should be moved from 
Simha to Kanya, Jupiter from Simha to Kanya, Mercury 
and Venus from Mithuna to Karka. 


Note: If a planet is retrograde then its placement 
differs which is being discussed separately. Saturn is 


216 Annual Horoscopy 


Retrograde in the birth chart. 


19.9 Placement of Retrograde planets, Rahu and 
Ketu: 


Divide the completed year by 4. The remainder so 
obtained determines the number of rashis to be moved 
from their birth position. Since in retrogression planets 
move backwards the counting should also be done 
likewise. Rahu and Ketu move always in retrogression 
and in this birth chart Saturn is retrograde. 


Hence dividing the completed year 22 by 4 we get 
a remainder 2. Rahu was in Kumbh at birth time and 
hence moving backwards it would be marked in Makar, 
Ketu likewise from Simha to Karka and Saturn from 
Makar to Dhanu Rashi. 


Note: If the remainder is zero then move four signs . 
for placing the planets from their birth position since 
we divide by 4. 


19.10 Planetary Vedha in Tripataki chakra: 


It is necessary to consider the Planetary Vedha from 
Lagna and Moon though certain scholars consider the 
Vedha only from the Moon. Vedha caused by malefic 
planets give all kinds of tensions and difficulties while 
the benefic planets render prosperity. If there is mixed 
influence of vedha by benefics and malefics then_their 
effect is one of mixed nature both good and bad. Vedha 
caused by one malefic gives tensions, while two malefics 
ensure bodily afflictions and if three or more malefics 
cause vedha they indicate possibility of death. 


Consider the three lines emanating from any position 


Annual Horoscopy 217 


of planets or bhavas then the planets at the other end 
cause Vedha. In the above Tripataki Chakra, we see Moon 
has vedha from Mercury and Venus. Muntha has vedha 
from Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Sun has Vedha from 
Mercury, Venus, Rahu and Ketu. 


19.11 The native celebrated his marriage during the year. 
He won accolades in sports, earned fame and name. It 
was the year when he was rusticated from the University. 
He had family disturbances, earned the wrath of his 
parents, left home in distress and suffered from wife’s 
health problems. He had mental disturbances due to ill 
health of his wife. 


19.12 Results of different Planetary Vedha with 
the Moon: 


i. Sun: causes high fever, bilious troubles, Mental 
tensions and disturbances. 


ii, Mars: ensures quarrels, blood disorders, ill 
temper, fear from enemies, bodily pains and 
disease and accidents. 


iii, Mercury: gives high degree of intelligence, 
company of scholars, gain from education and 
wealth, difference of opinion among kith and kin 
and fear of foes. 


iv, Jupiter: tends to give the company of religious 
and Vedic scholars, travels, mental peace, and 
gain of children and wealth. 

-y. Venus: attainment of education and Obtention of 


wealth, achieving desires, amorous pleasures, 
victory Over enemies, increase of wealth, windy

elements, company of low society, engaged in 
low activity and windy troubles are likely to be 
caused. 


vii. Rahu: causes dangerous disease, loss of fame, 
name and wealth, fear and unwanted results.

Self Evaluation 


Self- evaluation nowadays has been found to be 
necessary for the aspirants to enable them to clearly 
understand the rudiments of a particular Sastra. A 
thorough practice is necessary for understanding and 
retaining a principle studied in a particular Sastra. An 
attempt has been made to provide certain questions and 
the vivid readers are requested to find the answers on 
their own from the pages of the book. 


Note: Discussions on Rahu and Ketu are not 
employed in Yogas. 


20.1 Ithasal Yoga (Refer to Chapter 16) 


Classified into four categories viz. (i) Wartaman, 
(ii) Poorna, (ii?) Bhavishyat and (iv) Rashyadi Muthasil 
‘Yoga or Rashyant (Yoga being formed with a planet which 
is either at the beginning or at the end of a sign) and 


(A) Involvement of two planets i.e. Lagnesh and 
Karyesh aspecting each other friendly or inimically 
(but not neutral) with the difference between their 
longitudes falling within the mean of their orbs 
of influence (Deepthamsha).

(B) It tends to be good if Karyesh happens to be a 
fast moving planet and it traverses behind the 
slow moving planet. 


Note: The descending order of fast moving planet 


is respectively Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter 
and Saturn (the slowest of all).

20.4 Yogas found in the horoscope: 


(i) Poorna Ithasal Yoga: Poorna Ithasal Yoga between 
Lagnesh Venus in the tenth house and Jupiter ® in 
the fourth house since the longitudinal difference 
between them is 7° 46' (Jupiter 26° 48' - Venus 19° 
02') and the mean of their orbs of influence is 8° 
(Jupiter 9° + Venus 7° = 16°=2 = 8°) and they aspect 
each other though inimical in nature. 

(ii) Poorna Ithasal Yoga is formed between Saturn 26° 
11' in the sixth house and Venus 19° 2' in the tenth 
house. Longitudinal difference of 7° 9' is well within 
the average of the sum of their Deepthamsha (Venus 
7° and Saturn 9° and hence average is 8°) and their 
aspect is openly friendly. 

(ili) 

a. Lagnesh Venus 19°02' in the tenth and Mars 15°44' 
in the twelfth can form Poorna Ithasal yoga since 
the difference between their longitude 3° 18' can 
come within the ambit of the average of their 


222 ‘Annual Horoscopy 


Deepthamsha range 7.5° and their aspect is also 
friendly (3/11) but for the fact the slow moving 
planet Mars is ahead. 


b. Lagnesh Venus the fast moving planet is ahead 
of Mars, the slow moving planet by crossing its 
degrees, can be called Isharaf but for the difference 
in their longitude being more than 1°, hence no 
yoga. This yoga causes destruction of the event. 


The native had the Vimshottari dasa of Saturn and 
antar dasha of Saturn between July 1997 and July 1998 
(started on 24-9-1966) in which he had the pratyantar dashas 
of Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun and Moon (upto 18-9-98) 


Saturn being the lord of sixth and seventh is posited 
in association with the Sun and Ketu in the eleventh 
house and is being aspected by Yoga Karaka Mars. The 
native had secured admission in M. Tech. Course in July 
1996 during the dasha-antardasa-pratyantar dasas 
respectively of Jupiter-Rahu-Moon. He also got 
scholarship during this period. He got respectable position 
with good Marks in M. Sc. during 1995 when he had 
the pratyantar dasa of Mercury in the antar dasha of 
Rahu and Mahadasa of Jupiter. 

(iv)Lagnesh Venus and Jupiter are both aspected by Mars 
and Saturn. It is also observed that 
a) Saturn 26°11' and Venus 19°02' and the difference 
in their longitude being 7°9' is well within their 
Deepthamsha range of 8° (Saturn 9° + Venus 7° 
= 16+ 2 = 8) 


‘b) Jupiter 26°48' and Saturn 26°11" and their 
longitudinal difference is 0°37' and the average . 


Annual Horoscopy a 223 


of their Deepthamsha range is 9° (Saturn 9° + 
Jupiter 9° =18°+ 2=9°) 

‘c) Venus 19° 02' and Mars 15° 44' has 3° 18' as 
difference in their longitude and the average of 
their Deepthamsha range is 8° as indicated (in 
Para 1) above. 


d) However the difference in the longitudes of Mars 
(15° 44") and Jupiter (26° 48") does not fall within 
_ the mean of their orbs of influence (Deepthamsha 
that is 8.5 (Mars 8 + Jupiter 9 = 17+ 2 =8.5). 
Mars being the fast moving planet can cause 
Bhavishyat Ithasal Yoga. Saturn and Mars are 
aspecting the fast moving planet Venus. Hence 
Manaoo Yoga is formed. This yoga may cause 
failures, fear of foes, loss of wealth and increase 
in liabilities. 
Examining the 25th annual horoscope dated 
9th July 1997: 


I. Auspicious and inauspicious situation of planets: 


i. Jupiter is weak being retrograde and debilitated. 
Hence may not be able to give fully auspicious 
results. 


i. Jupiter is the sixth lord and Saturn is in the sixth 
bhava, Venus is the eighth lord while Mars is in 
the twelfth and Mercury the twelfth lord indicate 
the conferment of inauspicious results. 


iii. Benefics Venus and Mercury associated together 
_and aspected by the benefic Jupiter may tend to 
provide gainful and prosperous results. 


224 Anaual Horoscapy 


iv, The situation of Moon being vargottama, Venus 
in the benefic Navamsa of Jupiter, Mercury’s 
exaltation in its Navamsa, Jupiter situated in 
Mercury’s Navamsa indicates auspiciousness 
during the year. 


v. Saturn is also in its own Mooltrikon Navamsa. 
Mars is also in a benefic Navamsa of Venus. Even 
these positions indicate prosperity during the year. 


IT, Year Lord is Sun. 


The Harsha Bala of Sun is medium. It is however 
auspicious since the Panchavargeeya bala is good. It is 
posited in the ninth house in a friend’s rashi but aspected 
by Mars, Ketu, Rahu, Saturn and the Moon. Hence it 
would become a planet of medium strength. As a result 
of this situation the native would experience health 
problems, change of house, ordinary financial status, 
happiness from children, disputes with elders and 
colleagues and transfer. 


If it were strong then the result would be love and 
appreciation from superiors, progress in financial status, 
popularity and destruction of enemies and Obtention of 
wealth. 


The year lord Sun has relations with the following 
planets: 

a. Mars: Its association creates fear of fire and 
thieves but gain of pearls, Gold and wealth, fame 
and name and courage added with inexplicable 
mental tension and worries. 


b. Saturn: It would cause separation from kith and 
kin, troubles from enemies and loss of wealth. 


"Annual Horascopy : . 225 


Cc, 


Moon: It would be a comfortable year without 
strain enjoying foreign travels, gain of wealth, 
association of religious persons, destruction of 
enemies, good food and fine clothes. 


Rahu and Ketu: Loss from persons of dark 
complexion, fear of serpents, loss from the westem 
direction, loss of cattle and many other obstacles 
during the year would be the result. 


20.5 Results of planets posited in different bhavas: 


iii. 


vi. 


Sun in the Ninth house: (Refer Chapter 9 Paral) 
The native would be rich, possess vehicles, attains 
fame and name, evinces interested in charitable 
deeds and all similar comforts are gained. 
However there is likely to be certain worries due 
to the association of malefics. 


Moon in the eleventh house: (Refer Chapter 9 


’ Para 2) capable of giving auspicious results. 


Mars in the twelfth house: (Refer Chapter 9 
Para3) financial strains, increase in expenditure, 
unhappiness, destruction of enemies, eye diseases 
and disputes with relatives.

iii. Jupiter in Kendra aspected by benefics (Mercury 
and Venus) unafflicted by malefics (here Jupiter 
is aspected by Mars and Saturn) destroys all evils 


and misfortunes. 


Aanual Horoscopy 227 


iv, 


If malefics are in third, sixth (Saturn in sixth) . 
and twelfth (Mars in the twelfth) and benefics in 
Kendra (Jupiter, Venus and Mercury in Kendra) 
they destroy evils and misfortunes and render all 
kinds of happiness. 

Misfortune is destroyed in case any one of the 


benefics (Jupiter, Mercury or Venus) is in Kendra

‘ nor combust. Though Jupiter is debilitated both 


Venus and Mercury are unafflicted in this
