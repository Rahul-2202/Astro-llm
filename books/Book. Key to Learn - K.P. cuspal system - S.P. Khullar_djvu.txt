Appreciation and Comments 



I want first of all to thank Mr Khullar and the managers of the 
list, for having set up the workshop. I have tried a few astrological 
methods before, but I had lost interest in them because they never 
gave me a strong impulse to continue learning them . With KCIL it 
has been a different story, since the beginning of the workshop I 
got very much excited by it and I have always tried to put time 
learning it. Practice makes perfect, so I will spend the next weeks 
and months to master all the principles. 

- Judex 

The workshop has been just marvelous and wonderful. I really 
admire the patience and hard work of you both. 

-Murli 

The systematic, to the point logical approach and the precision 
of KCILT is really amazing. Mr. Khullar deserves all the credit for 
developing this theory, and has done a fantastic service to the 
Astrology Community. The lessons in themselves have been very 
lucid and clear and almost all the lessons are self contained, in that 
the need to refer to the books was not felt except on very few 
occasions when specifically asked to do so. The hard work and the 
effort that must have gone in preparing these lessons and the way 
they have been presented by Mr. Khullar and Mr. Ron Gaunt 
deserves a lot of kudos. I never encountered a more logical system. 
Compared to other systems this approach personalizes the 
horoscope in a very accurate way. Once the chart is rectified, all 
events fit together to form a "whole" where time disappears. 
Everything is "written" and happens as promised. 

- Margarita

It has been an extraordinary experience for us. (I am sure 
other members of the group also share my feelings). The way the 
course was structured and presented shows that a lot of thought 
and care went into it. Thank you both, once again. 

- Sandeep 

My thanks to both of you for demystifying CIL through KCIL 
Workshop. A Great Job. Well Done .Workshop lessons have now 
made the theory/rules absolutely simple and straight forward, so, 
any one with interest can learn. The system is highly fine-tuned to 
give very close prediction to minutes. Any one who wants to 
improve his prediction ratings should not miss this opportunity. 

- V. N. Rao 

For the last 13 years of my astrological study I learnt many 
methods of analysis but none could provide me confidence by which 
I could say that Astrology is as scientific as any other science. 
KCIL workshop has built my confidence and enlightened me about 
True Astrology. It has cleared my concepts. I owe my gratitude to 
Ron & Mr. Khullar. Both of them have done for Astrology which 
according to my knowledge none other has done. 

- SK. Malhotra 

My thanks to both to Mr. Khuller and Ron for an extraordinary 
amount of work, and excellent instruction. 

- Chrys 

KCIL gives clear and specific rules for checking various 
promises and timing of such events. Thus I can call it as a "Perfect 
Analytical Tool" which adopts unambiguous method, devoid of 
any vagueness. I have no word to express his brilliance, and the 
effectiveness of the system

Appreciation and Comments vii 



I have been lucky enough to go through all the lessons which 
are now being transcribed in the form of a concise compendium 
after rigorous synthesis. The clarity of thought and authority on 
subject makes this treatise a treasure for every enthusiast of CIL. 

- Chander Verma 

I belong to a family of vedic scholars and traditional 
astrologers and the cuspal interlinking theory has thrown many 
unknown points in astrology to light. It is in fact the most scientific 
way of predicting. Though, initially, the system appears to be 
complex in nature, once the same is understood, it is very interesting 
and amazing to give predictions. KCIL workshop has increased 
my confidence level and enlightened me about True Astrology. 

- A.L. Venkataraman 

The systematic, to the point logical approach and the precision 
of KCILT is really amazing. Mr. Khullar deserves all the credit for

- Vipin Mehta 

First and foremost I must express my deepest appreciation 
and thanks for the tremendous amount of work that you have put 
into structuring and preparing the KCIL lessons. The material has 
been presented in a way that makes it much easier to learn, 
comprehend and apply.

Being a Professional Astrologer and teacher, after having 
learned and practiced many branches, techniques, and Systems of 



viii Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



Astrology over the last four decades; I am at a loss for words to 
express how highly indebted and appreciative I am, for having been 
gifted the opportunity of being a student of Mr. Khullar's KCIT 
System of Astrology. I remain totally in awe at the power of KCIL. 

KCIL is distinctively different in application from any 
astrological system in the works today. 

I continue to marvel at the genius of Mr. S.P. Khullar's 
brilliance and example; I can honestly say that I liken his approach 
in life to that of an Astrological Einstein as he continues in his 
work, undeterred; determined to shine a new, credible, and brilliant 
light on the ancient discipline of Astrology. 

When Mr. Khullar's techniques are concentrated upon, 
dutifully applied, and put into practice on charts, his exceptional 
scientific approach - coupled with the knowledge of correct 
understanding and application of his teachings - will certainly prove 
fruitful in withstanding the test of time. The serious and dedicated 
student of KCIL will come away from this study richly rewarded. 

The KCIL Workshop material, now extended to the public in 
book form, is an amazing gift offered to the astrological community. 
This type of knowledge is simply extraordinary, and I feel highly 
honored to have been a part of such a beautiful, rich, and rewarding 
astrological experience. A gift indeed!

Acknowledgement 



This Book "Key to Learn Sub Sub and Cuspal Interlinks 
Theory" had its genesis in the KCIL Workshop carried out in MSN 
Groups on the Web. The initiator was Mr. Ron Gaunt (Australia), 
and the book has been written under his inspiration, and his active 
involvement at all levels. 

I have no words to express my gratitude to Mr. Gaunt. It would 
not have been possible to write this book without his valuable 
suggestions, editing and formation of lessons content. It has been a 
wonderful experience to discuss various salient features of KCIL 
with him. I would also like to express my appreciation to his wife, 
who graciously accepted his prolonged absence, because she knew 
that he was helping others in a way that was very important for 
them. 

I am equally grateful to Mrs. Sandy L Crowther and members 
of the KCIL Workshop for asking questions and providing me 
opportunities to give clarifications, which have been incorporated 
in the book. 

I express my thanks to Mr. R S Chani one of my senior students 
who have mastered the subject of Sub Sub and Cuspal Interlinks 
Theory. He has always helped me in improving and augmenting 
the contents of all my books. He has always assisted me in my 
research. I wish him success in life. In fact I owe my gratitude to 
all students of Khullar Astrology Institute. 

I can not forget to confess that Mr. Arnol SL. Narasimhan a 
senior student of Khullar Astrology Institute has always assisted 
me in my research. He has been doing an excellent job of providing 
clarifications to all those who have doubts about the various 



Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

concepts of KCIL. I am sure that he and my other senior students 
will keep the torch alight which I have lit. 

I will fail in my duty if I don't express my gratitude to my 
sons Manish and Mohit who always help me in so many ways. 

Mr. Mukesh Gupta has designed his ground breaking software 
'True Astrology' to incorporate all the necessary features to make 
working with CIL charts as easy as possible. He has also made 
provision to cast Western Wheel charts, and provides features found 
in no other astrology software. He also provided a patch to allow 
me to cast the charts, Planetary Tables and Cuspal Positions which 
enable the Printer to print them without recasting them. I express 
my thanks to him. 

Sagar Publications has continued to show the skill and 
professionalism they have attained during the years. They have 
brought this my Fifth book 'Key to Learn Sub Sub and Cuspal 
Interlinks Theory' out in an amazingly short time without sacrificing 
quality. I express my sincere thanks to them.

Preface 



I have had the good fortune to be able to work with, and learn 
from Mr Khullar. His work is outstanding and has taken astrology 
to an entirely new and much higher level. The results he achieves 
using his method are truly exceptional, and inspires his students to 
emulate his remarkable feats. 

His research, resulting in concentrating on and proving the 
effectiveness of his Cuspal Interlink method, is unique and very 
persuasive. This system is not a figment of the imagination, as is 
much of astrology, but a well reasoned method, which has 
incorporated the best of Hindu, Nadi, and KP astrology in an entirely 
different and compelling way. Mr Khullar's books are a must for 
any serious astrologer, and have been very well received by those 
astrologers who seek real as opposed to superficial knowledge of 
the subject. 

I am honoured to have been asked to write a preface to this 
wonderful book. I have no doubt that it is destined to be a classic 
in its own right. In fact I would go so far as to say that in my 
opinion, it is by far the best book ever written on the exposition of 
practical astrology, as applied to predictive astrology, and assessing 
events. 

This is high praise, and you may wonder who it is who makes 
such statements, and what experience I have to make them. 

My introduction to astrology was over 37 years ago, when I 
undertook a correspondence course in Tropical astrology. These 
early days were hard because we had no computers or databases to 
test our systems. But I took an epicurean delight in the smorgasbord 
of goodies offered - Secondary, Tertiary, Minor, Solar Arc 
Progressions, and multiple methods of Directions, including 



xii Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Converse as well as Direct There were also Solar and Lunar Returns, 
and other more exotic systems, such as various cycles and Harmonic 
charts. 

Finally the day came when it dawned on me that despite all 
these systems, touted by some to be almost fool proof, that I was 
seeing no one (including myself) who was successfully making 
predictions. 

This moved me away from Tropical astrology as it is generally 
practiced, because I thought - and still do - that Sign Lords are not 
the bedrock of good predictive astrology. I then went on, and for 
some years used Cosmo biology as my preferred system. This 
worked better but brought up a host of new problems with multiple 
points having to be considered due to mid-point analysis. Looking 
around I came across the Western Sidereal School who used the 
Sidereal Zodiac. This had greater appeal because the Lordships 
seemed to work better. Then it was just a short step to move over 
into the world of Hindu astrology. 

I must admit I was quite excited when I found this because 
the claims I was seeing suggested that here at last was the possibility 
of finding a system that really worked. It didn't take me long to 
realise that in its own way Hindu astrology was as corrupted as 
Tropical. Hundreds of slokas and multiple ayanamsas, Divisional 
Charts etc gave a plethora of combinations, in which it is possible 
to see anything you want- after the event - exactly the same as 
Tropical. 

As time went by I came to realise how seductive astrology is 
to just about everyone who takes the time to be enticed by it. I 
certainly have been enticed into spending a great deal of my life in 
studying it. Today I would estimate that I have spent at least 20,000 
hours in astrological research. This is true research not just dabbling 
in astrology, because I am not, and has never been a professional 
astrologer, so have not had to spend time with clients. I have had 
the good fortune to have the means, and the time for many years to 



Preface xiii 



be able to have astrology as my prime occupation. So I think you 
can see that I have served a long and comprehensive apprenticeship 
in the subject. 

It is the newcomers and the converts who are the most 
bedazzled by astrology's infinite possibilities. Many swear it is 
true and infallible .Why would they genuinely believe this when 
other more knowledgeable astrologers do not? I would put it down 
to lack of experience in the subject, and not realising that it is 
possible to justify anything and everything in ANY system because 
of the millions of possible combinations. They need to go quite 
deep into the subject before they can see a systems limitation. 
Some astrologers appear never to come to this realisation. 

So if it is possible to see anything in any system, how do we 
find a system that really does work? Obviously the proof of the 
pudding is in the eating, so I needed to find someone, or a system 
that produced consistently above average correct results in 
prediction. But the problem in looking at predictions is that they 
are few and far between, and it could take years (if not forever) to 
find someone or a system producing good results. 

I therefore decided to simulate the predictive method. 

I started possibly the first of the Blind Chart tests on the Web. 
Blind Chart tests are a method of taking a genuine birth chart, and 
asking participants which of a number of events was the actual 
event that took place on a certain date. I did this consistently, 
fortnightly, on a number of lists for quite a few years, and saw no 
one who was achieving better than average results in the tests. 

Then came the day when I saw some newcomers to our list 
getting much better than average results. These were the students 
of Mr Khullar using a system called Cuspal Interlinks. This intrigued 
me and I decided to check out the system. Let me say at this point 
I was rather blas6 even skeptical, but the Blind Test results ignited 
my interest sufficient for me to get fully involved in the system. I 
am glad I did, because it has opened my eyes to what can be 



xiv Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



achieved with this method which is in my opinion the most scientific 
of all the astrological systems I have seen. 

Mr Khullar's books give a full and complete explanation of 
the system so I won't duplicate this here; but I would like to explain 
a couple of points which I think newcomers to the system will 
appreciate. 

Cuspal Interlinks (CIL) is what I call a 'Closed System" . If 
you look at nearly all astrologers they work with what I would call 
an 'Open System'. They use multiple methods to achieve a result 
i.e. they might regularly use say the Secondary Progression system. 
Then trying to get a match for any event (after they know the result) 
they might use in conjunction Solar Arc, or Solar Returns, or Lunar 
Returns, or harmonics, etc, etc, etc, to prove and vindicate the event. 
It is not unusual for some astrologers to use totally different or 
many methods for successive cases. The same goes for Hindu 
astrology and it is not uncommon to see practitioners invoking many 
slokas, a number of Divisional Charts, and using simultaneously a 
number of different ayanamsas on a particular case. Of course 
using astrology this way is very deceptive and does not lend itself 
to actual prediction. 

The 'Closed System' of CIL is very different. The system is 
complete in itself. There are rules of relationships between the 
various Lordships, and rules about the significations of each of the 
houses. The system is not plagued by 'add ons' such as planetary 
retrogression, combustion, exaltation, debilitation, planets being 
young or in old age, or even planetary aspects in the usual way. 
Using the lordships and significations coupled to the correct way 
of working with the dasa system and transits, it has been proven 
that it is possible to achieve success in Blind Chart tests and 
prediction. Unlike other systems it is quite common for two or 
more CIL practitioners to come up with exactly the same answer 
to a problem (contrast this with any other system), and even exactly 
the same rectification of an unknown birth time. Incidentally, in 



Preface xv 



my opinion this book demonstrates and gives full details of the 
best rectification method available. 

Mr Khullar is doing sterling work educating a new generation 
of astrologers in the classes at his Institute. When I saw the value 
in CIL I thought it should be offered to a wider audience, so I 
proposed and set up a Web workshop site. This drew many 
dedicated astrologers from our parent web site Astrology Research, 
who have now undertaken the course and achieved good 
understanding of the system in a very short time. This book, Dear 
reader which you now hold in your hands is based on that course. 
I am certain you will find it interesting, informative, and more to 
the point, very useful and practical in your work in astrology.

Introduction 



Human personality is infinitely intricate, and delineating the 
various aspects of a native's life from a horoscope is a complex 
task. What is required is that we choose the right Astrological 
System that helps us to generate the different horoscopes of 
individuals born with very little time difference, and provide us 
with the means of clearly analysing what is promised for various 
aspects of the lives, of individuals born with a time difference of 
say only a few seconds 

In my Book, "Kalamasa and Cuspal Interlinks Theory" I have 
explained the various concepts that help an Astrologer to cast an 
accurate horoscope, and delineate it minutely without sacrificing 
accuracy. Those who have been following Sub Sub and Cuspal 
Interlinks Theory (both for Natal and Horary charts) have found it 
very enterprising and scientific. It has, according to many, gone a 
long way to remove the tag of pseudo science or superstition from 
Astrology. 

However, some foreign (as well as Indian readers) felt that in 
their opinion, the application of this system appears to be somewhat 
complex and needed to be explained in slightly different way in 
order to appeal to a wider audience. It was therefore, suggested by 
Mr. Ron S Gaunt Manager of Astrology Research Group that we 
conduct a Workshop on KCIL, which I agreed. 

Eighteen members were enrolled and Lessons were posted 
on the Web site. Each lesson had a Practice Exercise which members 
were expected to attempt, and provide their answers direct to Ron. 
He checked the answers and provided the necessary feedback. The 
experience was very motivating. 



Introduction 



With the success of the workshop and the fact that it speeded 
the learning process considerably, it was decided to present the 
material in the form of a book for the benefit of all readers. 

How to Use this Book: 

Step 1: Read the Lesson repeatedly till you become confidant 
of mastering its contents. 

Step 2: Attempt to answer the Practice Exercise of each lesson 
without looking at the Answers. 

Step 3: After you have written your answers compare them with 
the answers given in the Book. 

Step 4: If your answers don't match the answers in the Book 
please re-read the Lesson and find out for yourself, which 
concept has not yet been mastered. 

Casting the Horoscope: 

Cast the horoscope using Placidus System, taking the Cusp 
as the beginning of the House. 

Use Geocentric Lattitude and Khullar Ayanamsa. Use True 
Nodes. Apply Notation. 

This Ayanamsa is calculated by the following formula: 

Ayanamsa = (50.2388475/3600) * ((YR-292) + (261/365) + 
(((MN-l)*30+DY)/365) YR stands for Year, MN stands for Months. 
DY stands for Day 

The following Software meets all the requirements to cast a 
correct chart.

Astracadabra Software (for Pocket PCs and Pocket Phones), 
developed by Mr. Neville Lang (Australia). Available from 
www .esotech .com .au/ 

Key to Learn Sub Sub and Cuspal Interlinks Theory is written 
with the sole objective of enabling the readers to master the 
fundamental concepts of Cuspal Interlinks Theory as achieved by 
the participants in the Lessons presented in the Workshop conducted 
on MSN Groups KCIL. 

Each Lesson is written in simple, lucid and easy to learn style 
and has a Practice Exercise which provides the reader with an 
opportunity to test his comprehension. Answers of each Exercise 
are placed in the end of the book. 

This book however, is not a substitute for my book Kalamsa 
and Cuspal Interlinks Theory. If the reader masters the contents of 
this book, he will be able to use the concepts illustrated in my 
books on Natal and Horary Astrology much quicker and easier. 

Sub Sub and Cuspal Interlinks Theory is in tune with the 
Navamsa and Nadiamsa concept of Nadi Astrology. The reader 
will find that it offers sound techniques of predictive astrology. 

How to analyse the horoscope, to determine what is promised 
for the native for all walks of human life, has been explained in 
simple and scientific way. Whilst timing events and use of transits 
are often thought of as complex and incomprehensible, it is dealt 
with here in a very clear and practical way with many actual case 
studies. 

Suggestions from readers are welcome.

Lesson 1 
Positional Status of a Planet 



Introduction: Before we start talking about the subject of 
Positional Status of a Planet, let us understand how the Zodiac is 
divided in the Stellar Astrology Systems. In Stellar System the 
Zodiac is divided into 27 equal parts each of 13°. 20'. Each part is 
called Nakshatra or Star. Each Nakshatra is allotted the rulership 
of a Planet. Each Nakshatra is then divided into 9 unequal parts. 
Each part is called the Sub. Just like Nakshatra each Sub is also 
allotted the ruler ship of a Planet. Lastly, each Sub is further divided 
into 9 parts and each such part is called Sub Sub and is allotted the 
ruler ship of a Planet. 




The outer wheel shows the division of the Zodiac into 27 parts, 



Thus, each Transiting Planet (hereafter shown as Tr. Planet) 
according to its longitude will be in a particular Sign, Star, Sub and 
Sub-Sub. These positions are respectively termed as 'Sign lord', 
'Star lord, 'Sub lord' and 'Sub-Sub lord of the planet. For example, 
Sun of 07°40'48" in Pisces implies that it is in Jupiter sign, Sat 
star, Ketu sub and Rahu sub-sub. This will be shown by the software 
in the Planetary Table which is illustrated below. 

Note: Tr has been used with reference to the Physical Planet. 
The Physical Planet is a wanderer. But the zodiacal position of the 
Planet at the time of an event fixes its lord ship as Sign or Star or 
Sub or Sub-Sub. Tr Planet then becomes the Natal Planet and its 
zodiacal position specifies its Sign, Star, Sub and Sub-Sub which 
stands fixed for the natal chart.

Positional Status of a Planet 

Positional Status of a Planet 

A Tr. Planet is said to have positional status if: 

1. There is no Planet in its Star zone area. 

2. The Tr. Planet is in its own Star. That is the Planet is 
placed in the zodiacal area of the Nakshatra (Star) which 
is ruled by the Tr. Planet itself. 

3. There is mutual exchange of Nakshatra (Star) lords. 

How to Read the Planetary Table 

Planetary table as shown in the first column above indicates 
the zodiacal position of Tr. Planets at the time of birth of the native. 
The Tr. Planets various Lordships are placed in rows. The zodiacal 
position of the Planets is defined by four columns. First column 
indicates the Sign in which the Planet is placed. The second column 
indicates the Star. Third column indicates its Sub lord and the last 
column indicates its Sub-Sub lord. Take the case of Tr. Jupiter in 
the above Table. Jupiter is in Aries 22°04 , 59".The reading of the 
Table indicates that Jupiter is in the Sign ruled by Mars, the Star 
ruled by Venus, Sub and SS ruled by Saturn. 

Practical Approach to determine the Positional Status of 
a Planet: 

The practical and easy way to find out whether a Tr. Planet 
has positional status or not is as follows: 

Scan the second column in the Planetary Position Table (shown 
as StL) from top to Tr Ketu and check if that Tr. Planet appears in 
any row or not. If the Planet does not appear in any row other than 
the row which is for the Planet itself, then the Planet is said to 
have positional status. Similarly scan the StL column to find out if 
there is mutual exchange of Nakshatras (Star Lords) between the 
concerned Tr. Planet and any other Tr .Planet in the table.

Let us determine the positional status of Mars in this chart. If 
we scan the column titled StL, we find Mars does not appear in the 
entire column, which satisfies condition no.l, and hence Mars has 
positional status. Similarly Positional Status of Moon can be 
justified. Let us now consider the case of Sun. If we scan the StL 
column, we find that Sun appears in the row of Moon, Mars and 
Rahu. Therefore, we can conclude that the Planet Sun has no PS in 
this chart. 

Case B: In the table given below let us check whether Mars 
has PS or not.

We notice that Planet Mars appears in a Row but this Row 
belongs to Mars itself i.e. Mars is in its own Star. We declare that 
Mars has PS (Condition No. 2). 

Case C: In the table below let us check whether Planets Sun 
and Moon have PS or not.

Scanning the second column we find that Sun is in Moon Star 
and Moon is in Sun Star. We declare that both Sun and Moon have 
PS (Condition No. 3) ; ie when transiting planets have an exchange 
of Star Lords they both have Positional Strength (PS.) 

Note: There is one more condition that enables a Planet to 
acquire positional status. That is when the Planet is in the Star 
of Rahu or Ketu and Rahu or Ketu represent that Planet. This 
will be clarified at the end of lesson 5.

Lesson 2 

Application of Positional Status of a 

Planet 



Let us now discuss what results a Tr. Planet will offer to the 
native in whose horoscope this Planet has positional status. The Tr. 
Planet will offer the results of the following houses: 

A. The house occupied by the Tr Planet in the Bhava 
(houses) chart 

B. The houses where the Tr. Planet appears as Sign or Star 
or Sub or Sub Sub in the cuspal positions of those houses. 

How to read Cuspal Position Table: 

Cuspal position table has 12 rows corresponding to 12 houses 
and four columns. The Sign rising on each cusp indicates the Sign 
lord ship of the house. It is indicated by the first column. The second 
column indicates the Star lord of the cusp; third column indicates 
the Sub lord of the cusp and the fourth column indicates the SSL of 
the cusp. The Sign lord, Star lord, Sub lord and SSL of the cusp are 
called the co-rulers of the cusp . For example in chart of Fig 1 shown 
below Ascdt rises in Scorpio 02° .35'. 02". The Ascdt is said to be 
co-ruled by Mars, Jupiter, Rahu and Ketu. 

Some times we say the Planets co-ruling the Ascdt are Mars, 
Jupiter, Rahu and Ketu. The above two statements are identical in 
significance. 

Let us explain through an example chart Fig 1

72 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



In this chart we notice that the Planet Mars has positional 
status because there is no Planet in Mars Star. Mars occupies second 
Bhava. It appears as Sign lord of cusps 1 and 6.1t is Sub lord of 5th 
cusp and Star lord of 8th cusp. 

Thus due to the fact that Mars has positional status it will 
offer the results of the houses 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8. 

Let us take the case of Tr. Planet Moon. In the chart shown 
above we notice that Planet Moon has positional status. It occupies 
second house in Bhava chart. It appears as SSL of 3rd and 7th 
cusp, and Sign lord of 9th cusp. It also appears as Star lord of 1 1th 
cusp. This means Planet Moon having PS will offer the results of 
houses 2, 3, 7, 9 and 11. 

Notel: Remember that this only indicates that the Planet 
Mars or Moon during their Dasa period (Dasa or Bhukti or 
An tar a or Sookshmaor Prana) will offer the results of the above 
houses. It does not state whether the results will be positive or 
negative. About this aspect we will discuss in future under the 
topic Role of Sub lord of the Planet. 

Note2: The Tr. Planet who has PS will also give the results 
of the houses as per its Stellar Status. This will be discussed in 
a separate Lesson. 

Note3: Number shown in the Bhava chart indicates the lord 
ship of the house. For example in Fig 2 number 9 shows that the 
lordship of 11th house is allotted to Jupiter. This is because the 
degree that rises on the 11th cusp is Sag 27°48 , 40". Please read 
page 28 of the Book Kalamsa and Cuspal Interlinks (Revised 
Edition). It is explained there how the Planets are placed in the 
Bhava chart and also how the lordship of Houses are allotted 

Practice Exercise: Lesson2 

Here is the chart of a native. Please find which of the Planets

Lesson Three 
Stellar Status of a Planet 



In our earlier lessons, we have learnt that a Tr Planet is always 
placed in a Sign, Star, Sub and Sub-Sub according to its longitude. 
The Planet does not confer anything on its own (unless it has 
positional status), but it gives the significations of its Star lord. It 
is called Stellar Status*. This statement means that the Tr. Planet 
will always offer the results of the following houses: 

1. The house occupied by its Star lord in the Bhava chart. 

2. The houses where its Star lord appears in the cuspal 
positions as Sign lord or Star lord or Sub lord or Sub- 
Sub lord. 

^Stellar Status is the position of Star lord in various houses of 
which the planet under consideration will offer results. 

It may be noted that the Tr. Planet will always offer the 
result as per its stellar and positional status (if any). 

Let us try to explain it through example chart (Figl - Refer to 
lesson 2). If we consider the Tr .Planet Sun in the chart we find that 
Sun has no positional status, because there are Planets who are in 
Sun Star. Sun is in Saturn Star and Saturn occupies 6th house in the 
Bhava chart. It also appears in cuspal positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10. 
Summarizing the whole thing, we may say that Planet Sun will 
offer the results of houses 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 as per its stellar 
status. 

Now let us consider the case of the Planet Mars which has 
positional status (Explained in lesson-1). Therefore, it will offer 



Stellar Status of a Planet 17 



the results of houses 1 , 2, 5, 6 and 8. Mars is in the star of Sun who 
is placed in 4th house in Bhava chart and appears in cuspal positions 
3, 7 and 10. Thus, Mars as per its stellar status offers the results of 
houses 3, 4, 7 and 10. It can be deduced that Mars will offer the 
results of the houses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 in summation. 

Practice Exercise: Lesson Three. 

Refer to the chart in Fig-2 of Lesson 2. Please indicate the 
houses of which the Planets Jupiter, Mercury and Moon will offer 
results to the native. 



Lesson Four 
Behaviour of Rahu and Ketu 



The Earth orbits around Sun from West to East, and likewise 
Moon orbits around the Earth in the counter clockwise direction 
i.e. West to East. Since, Moon's axis is inclined to the Ecliptic at 5 
deg 8 minutes; it cuts the Ecliptic at two points which are 
diametrically opposite to each other. The ascending node i.e. north 
node is called Rahu or Dragon's Head and descending node i.e. 
south node is called Ketu or Dragon's Tail. This is illustrated below 
in Fig 3 :

5'0& H / r Moon's orbrt

/- ^ North Node

VI South Node 



Fig3: Illustration of Moon's Nodes 



Behaviour of Rahu and Ketu 19 



In classical Hindu astrology, Rahu and Ketu are considered 
as Planets and the interpretation of their influence is that Ketu is 
the Karmic luggage that we carry in this life, while Rahu represents 
the target set for this life i.e. it represents the direction in which our 
life is heading, the lessons we need to learn in our life. Rahu 
represents Soul's mission to accomplish in this life. Some 
Astrologers go to the extent of saying: "The North Node is the 
single most important point in the chart ..., it describes what your 
soul wants to learn and experience in this life. It is a Soul 
Messenger." 

Much has been written about the behaviour of Rahu and 
Ketu in the revised edition of Kalamsa and Cuspal Interlinks 
Theory. Let us present the same material in an easy to learn format. 

Behaviour of Rahu and Ketu 

Rahu and Ketu are considered as Planets. They will offer 
the result as per their PS and Stellar Status. Let us see what 
result Rahu and Ketu will offer in the chart of Fig 4.

Beha viour of Rahu and Ketu 23 



Tr. Planet Rahu in this chart has positional status because 
there is no Planet in its Star. It can be verified from the second 
column of the Planetary Table. Thus Rahu will offer the result both 
as per its positional status and as per its stellar status. 

Positional Status Result: Rahu occupies 11th house and in 
cuspal positions 3,7,9 and 10 .Thus, Rahu will offer the result of 
houses 3, 7, 9, 10 and 11. 

Stellar Status Result: Rahu is in Saturn Star. Saturn occupies 
8th house and appears in cuspal positions 4, 5, 6, 11 and 12. Thus, 
Rahu will offer the results of houses 4, 5, 6, 8, 11 and 12 as per its 
stellar status. 

In summation, Rahu in this chart will offer the result of houses 
3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10, 11 and 12. 

What we discussed above are the results of Rahu as Rahu i.e. 
when we consider Rahu as a Planet like any other Planet. 

In the given chart, Ketu also has the positional status because 
Ketu is in Moon Star and Moon is in Ketu Star (mutually exchanging 
star lords - as explained in previous lesson). 

Positional Status Result: Ketu occupies the 5th house and 
appears in 4, 5, 8, 10 and 12 cuspal positions. Thus, Ketu will offer 
the results of 4, 5, 8, 10 and 12 houses. 

Stellar Status Result: Ketu is in Moon Star and Moon 
occupies 12th house. Furthermore, it appears in cuspal positions 8, 

11 and 12. Therefore, Ketu will offer the results of 8, 11 and 12 
houses. 

In summation, Ketu will offer the results of 4, 5, 8, 10, 11 and 

12 houses. These are the houses which signify the Positional and 
Stellar status of Ketu as Ketu. 



24 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Planets That Rahu and Ketu Represent: 

We have stated above that Rahu and Ketu are the points of 
intersection. These points are represented by the Zodiacal positions 
of Rahu and Ketu. We also know that each zodiacal point is ruled 
by a Sign and a Star lord. It is believed that Rahu and Ketu 
absorb the energy of the Planets that co-rule their zodiacal 
positions. 

In Fig 4, Tr. Rahu is in Can 10°.08'.33" . This position is ruled 
by the Planet Moon as Sign Lord and the Planet Saturn as the Star 
lord. According to inter-cuspal theory, Tr. Rahu and Ketu represent 
the planets which are their Sign and Star lords. In the chart under 
reckoning, Moon and Saturn are the sign and star of Rahu 
respectively; therefore, Rahu is said to represent Moon and Saturn. 
In other words, Tr. Rahu will also provide the results of Moon 
and Saturn as per their positional and stellar status. In brief, 
we can say that Rahu will offer the results of Rahu as Rahu, Rahu 
as Moon, and Rahu as Saturn as per their positional and stellar 
status. Ketu can be analyzed on the basis of same principle e.g. in 
the given chart Ketu will be studied as Ketu, Saturn (Sign lord of 
Ketu) and Moon (Star lord of Ketu). 

Note: However it should be remembered that the result of 
Rahu as Rahu, Rahu as Moon, and Rahu as Saturn has to be 
considered independently. This is because the result of a house 
that the Planet offers has to be qualified by the Sub lord of the 
Planet. This will be explained in future lesson. It is, however, to 
be remembered that Rahu or Ketu will act as three Planets. 

Fig 4.1 shows the diagramatic representation for determining 
the significations of Rahu in a chart. The same procedure can be 
addopted for determining the significations for Ketu.

Lesson 5 

Rahu or Ketu as Star Lord 
of a Planet 



We have seen in lesson 1 that Rahu and Ketu have also been 
allotted the rulership of Nakshatras (Stars) .Thus any Tr. Planet as 
per its longitude may be in the Star of Rahu or Ketu. Let us discuss 
what result a Tr. Planet will offer when it is in Rahu or Ketu Star. 

Refer Fig 5 in Lesson 4. We notice that Tr. Saturn is in Ketu 
Star. In this Chart Ketu represents Sun because Ketu is in Leo sign 
and also in Sun Star. The principle is that any Planet in the Star 
of Rahu or Ketu will be treated as if the Planet is also in the 
Star of the Planets which Rahu or Ketu represents. 

Thus the Planet will be considered in this case as if in the first 
it is in Ketu Star and in the second it will be assumed to be in the 
Star of Sun. Thus at the stellar level Saturn will offer the following 
results: 

Saturn in Ketu Star: We have seen in lesson 4 above that it 
will give the result of houses 2, 9 and 12. 



Rahu or Ketu as Star Lord of a Planet 31 



Saturn in Sun Star: Sun is placed in second house and appears 
in cuspal positions 8 and 12. Thus Saturn will offer the result of 
houses 2, 8 and 12. 

To sum up we will say that Saturn in this chart will offer the 
results of houses 2, 8, 9 and 12. 

Let us take another example. Refer Fig 1. In this chart we find 
that Mercury is in Rahu Star. Rahu is in Virgo Sign ruled by Mercury 
and Rahu is in Sun Star. Mercury in this chart will offer the following 
results: 

Mercury in Rahu Star: Rahu is placed in 10th house and 
appears in cuspal positions 1, 4, 11 and 12. Thus Mercury will offer 
the results of houses 1,4, 10, 11 and 12. 

Mercury in Sun Star: Sun occupies 4th house and appears 
in cuspal positions 3, 7 and 10 .Thus Mercury will offer the results 
of houses 3, 4, 7 and 10. 

Mercury in Mercury Star: This is as good as Mercury has 
the positional status in this chart. Mercury is placed in 3rd house 
and appears in cuspal positions 2, 3, 8, 9 and 11, Thus Mercury will 
offer the results of houses 2, 3, 8, 9 and 11. 

Summarising the above results we say Mercury in this chart 
will offer the results of houses 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. 

Let us now discuss the case where we find Rahu in Ketu 
Star. Refer Fig 6. Here we find that Rahu is in Ketu Star.

Rahu or Ketu as Star Lord of a Planet 35 



Tr. Ketu in this chart is in Mercury Sign and Mars Star. Thus 
Ketu represents Mercury and Mars. 

Tr. Rahu in Ketu Star: Ketu is placed in 8th house and 
appears in cuspal positions 2, 6, 9 and 10.Rahu will thus offer the 
results of houses 2, 6, 8, 9 and 10. 

Tr. Rahu in Mercury Star: Mercury occupies house 3 and 
appears in cuspal positions 4, 8, 10 and 11. Thus Rahu will offer 
result of houses 3, 4, 8, 10 andll. 

Tr. Rahu in Mars Star: Mars is placed in 6th house and 
appears in cuspal positions 1, 6 and 8. Rahu will thus offer result of 
houses 1, 6 and 8, 

Summarising we may say that Rahu will offer the result of 
houses 1,2,3,4,6,8,9, 10 and 11. 

Ah! Have we not forgotten something? In lesson 4 we said 
that Rahu and Ketu also offer the result which the Planets they 
represent have to offer. We, therefore, have to include the result 
which the Planets Rahu and Ketu have to offer. In this chart 
Table 6, Rahu is in Jupiter Sign and Ketu Star. 

Results offered by Jupiter: We notice Jupiter has PS. It is 
placed in 3rd house and appears in cuspal positions 2, 5, 6 and 
11 Jupiter is in Mars Star who is placed in 6th house and appears in 
cuspal positions 1, 6 and 8 Jupiter will thus offer the results of 
houses 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 11. 

Results offered by Ketu: Ketu is in Mars Star who occupies 
6th house and appears in cuspal positions 1, 6 and S.Thus Ketu as 
per its stellar status offer the result of houses 1, 6 and 8. But Ketu 
has also to offer the result of the Planets Mercury and Mars which 
it represents. 

Ketu as Mercury: Mercury has PS in this chart. It occupies 
house 3 and appears in cuspal positions 4, 8, 10 andll . Mercury is 
in Moon Star. Moon is placed in second house and appears in cuspal 
positions 2, 7, 9 and 11. 



36 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Thus Ketu as Mercury will offer the result of houses 2, 3, 
4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. 

Ketu as Mars: Mars has no PS. It is in Venus Star who 
occupies 3rd house. Venus appears in cuspal positions 1,3,5,7,8 
and 12.Thus Ketu as Mars will offer the result of houses 1, 3, 5, 
7, 8 and 12. 

Thus in this chart Rahu will offer the result of all houses. 

Need to Remember: 

Principle of Nakshatra/Stellar theory is based on the following 
fundamental concepts: 

1. Each specific area of the Zodiac represents a specific 
energy content represented by the static (in the natural 
zodiac) and dynamic significations (in the concerned 
natal chart). Since in stellar systems, Rahu and Ketu are 
treated as planets, so they are also allotted specific areas 
in the Zodiac. As far as Zodiac areas are concerned, Rahu 
and Ketu only represent themselves , for static 
significations. Like Signs each Nakshatra is allotted 
specific significations. You may refer my Book Basic 
and Traditional concepts Pages 77 to 101. 

2. Planet offers results of the areas of the Zodiac as per 
their Star lords' position. House cusps are only divisions 
of space at the background of the Zodiac. 

3. Suppose a Planet is in the Star of Moon, it will only hit 
at the cuspal positions where Moon appears. Now if in 
the chart Moon is represented by Rahu or Ketu, the 
planet is not said to be hitting the cuspal positions 
where Rahu or Ketu appears. 

Suppose a Planet is in Tauras Sign and Moon Star. 
The Planet's nature is modified by the influence of 



Rahu or Ketu as Star Lord of a Planet 37 



Venus and the sub influence of Moon. Suppose Moon 
in the chart is represented by Rahu or Ketu, the Planet 
cannot be said to be under the influence of Rahu or 
Ketu. The influence on the Planet is as per its Zodiacal 
position. The cuspal positions where Moon appears 
are the mundane positions which indicate the areas 
where the influence of the planet will be observed. 

4. Rahu and Ketu are intersection points and are said to 
absorb the energy contents (static as well as dynamic) of 
the planets that represent those intersection points by 
Sign and Star. Thus any planet in Rahu/Ketu Star is taken 
to be in the Star of the planets that Rahu/ Ketu represent. 

Suppose a Planet is in Ketu Star. Let Ketu represent 
Moon. The Planet is then under the influence of the 
sign lord and the sub influence of Ketu. However the 
Planet will be said to be linked to the mundane 
positions where Ketu appears as well as where the 
planets that Ketu represents appear. 

Practical Approach: 

From a practical application point of view, the easy way 
to consider the foregoing is to look at it as follows: 

a) In the table titled 'Planetary Positions' whenever 
Rahu and/or Ketu are shown, here you also substitute 
the Tr. planets that Rahu/Ketu represents. The reason 
for this is that the Nodal Points take on the attributes of 
the planets that rule the nodal points. 

b) In the table titled 'Cuspal Positions' whenever Rahu and/ 
or Ketu are shown, here you do NOT substitute the Tr. 
planets that Rahu/Ketu represents, because these are 
NOT planets positions, they are only the zones (zodiacal 
positions) represented by Rahu or Ketu as Lords. 



38 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

Note: However there is a specific application for which we 
will replace Rahu/Ketu in cuspal positions by the Planets they 
represent. This will be clarified in later lessons. 

Please master this lesson. 

Supplement to Lesson 1: Positional Status of a Planet 

We have discussed three conditions which declare that a Planet 
has Positional Status. There is another very important condition 
which enables the Planet to acquire PS. This happens when we 
find a Planet in the Star of Rahu or Ketu and the Planet itself 
represents Rahu or Ketu. Refer Fig 1 of Lesson 2. Here we find 
Mercury to be in the Star of Rahu. Now Rahu in this chart is placed 
in Mercury Sign. Thus we say Rahu represents Mercury. We have 
said above that a Planet in the Star of Rahu or Ketu is as well as in 
the Star of the Planets that Rahu or Ketu represent. Thus Mercury 
which is in Rahu Star will be considered as well in the Star of 
Mercury whom Rahu represents. 

You may refer to the Planetary Position on Page 94 of the 
Book. There you notice that Mercury is in Ketu Star. But Ketu 
being in Virgo Sign ruled by Mercury represents Mercury. Thus 
Mercury will be considered in Mercury Star. 

In both the above cases Mercury has PS . 

Practice Exercise: Lesson 5. 

Refer Fig 6.1 and indicate what result Planet Rahu will 
offer to the Native during its Dasa Periods.

Lesson 6 
Sub Lord of a Planet and its Role 



We have discussed in Lesson- 1 that each Planet as per its 
longitude is always in a Star and a Sub. We have also seen in lessons 
2 and 3 that a Planet offers the results of houses signified by it as 
per its Positional and Stellar status. Now there may be more than 
one Planet in a chart which has the same Star lord. Take the case of 
Fig-1 (Lesson 2). Here we notice that the Planets Moon, Mars and 
Rahu are all in the Star of Sun. Will all these Planets offer the same 
results for all the houses signified by these Planets? The answer is 
the result offered by the Planets is qualified by the Sub Lord of the 
respective Planet. If Moon, Mars and Rahu are in different Subs 
the nature of the result offered by them may differ. In other words 
we say that the Sub lord of the Planet qualifies the nature of the 
result offered by the Planet. 

The role of the SUB Lord can be summed up under 2 rules 

1. STAR PROPOSES AND SUB DISPOSES. 

A Tr planet's STAR Lord may appear in a cuspal position. 
This signifies commitment to the experiences and events 
offered by that house. The TV planet's SUB Lord will either 
confirm or deny these experiences/events. 

The SUB Lord will indicate confirmation or denial by its 
position in relation to the house being assessed ie the Sub 
Lord in the 7th house from the house under consideration 
would deny the STAR Lords commitment to that house. 



Sub Lord of a Planet and its Role 43 



Favourable houses are taken as 1, 3, 5, 9 and 11 from a 
cusp under consideration. Houses 2, 6, and 10 are taken 
as neutral houses, and houses 4, 7, 8 and 12 are taken as 
adverse houses. 

2. STAR INDICATES INVOLVEMENT AND SUB 
COMMITMENT. 

Here again a Tr planet's STAR Lord may appear in a 
cuspal position, while its Sub Lord may appear in a cusp 
that is relevant to the experience/event This will enable 
the experience/event to happen irrespective of whether the 
position from the relevant cusp is considered to be 
favourable or unfavourable. 

Suggested Reading: Pages 14, 15, 123 and 124 of my Book 
Kalamsa and Cuspal Interlinks Theory (Revised Edition). 

Let us explain the role of the Sub Lord through an example 
chart of Fig-1 (lesson 2). Here the Planet Moon is in Sun Star 
and has PS also. Moon will therefore offer the results of houses 
2, 3,4, 7, 9, 10 and 11 due to its PS and Stellar Status. Now, 
Moon is in the Sub of Moon which appears in cuspal positions 
2 (PS and is placed in second Bhava) , 3, 7, 9 and 1 1 . Thus the 
result of houses 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10 and 11 will be qualified by 
houses 2, 3, 7, 9 and 11. The criterion for sub lord's 
qualification is illustrated below: 

First Criterion: 

This is based on the concept of Rule 1 that Star proposes and 
Sub disposes. If the position of Sub lord is 4 or 7 or 8 or 12 with 
respect to the position of the houses of which the Planet has to 
offer the results as per its PS or Stellar Status then the Planet is 
believed to offer unfavourable result. 



44 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



In the above case, Moon is to offer the results of second house 
i.e. say money matters. The native's financial status will improve 
during the Dasa periods of Moon if the Sub Lord of Moon does not 
appear in cuspal positions 4 or 7 or 8 or 12 from second house. We 
have stated above that Moon is in Moon Sub that appears in 2, 3, 7, 
9 and 11 from Ascdt. These positions of Sub Lord with respect to 
Second house are 1, 2, 6, 8 and 10. This means that on an average 
the Planet Moon in this horoscope will offer favourable result but 
the Sub lord's position in 8th cusp from 2 also indicates that native 
may also face some financial crisis. 

Second Criterion: 

This is based on the concept of Rule 2 that Star indicates 
involvement and Sub indicates commitment. Let us explain it 
through an example. In Fig-1 (lesson 2) , we notice that Mars has 
PS and is placed in Second House. Thus, Mars is said to involve 
Second House i.e. it will offer the results of Second House e.g. 
money matters or addition in the family etc. Now, Mars is in the 
Sub of Mars which is the Sub lord of the 5th cusp (refer cuspal 
position table of Fig-1) and 5th cusp is 4th from the Second cusp. 
Thus, Mars should offer unfavourable result for Second house 
(Considering only this position of the Sub Lord Mars). Undoubtedly, 
Mars will not give positive result related to money matters, but 
Mars will offer desired result as far as addition in the family is 
concerned. 

This is because 5th house is the relevant house for the first 
child birth. Remember that if the Sub Lord is in a cuspal 
position which is one of the relevant cusps that takes part in 
enacting an event then the first criterion (i.e. a planet offers 
negative result of the house where its Star lord is placed if its 



Sub Lord of a Planet and its Role 45 



Sub lord is placed in 4th or 7th or 8th or 12th cuspal position 
from the Star lord position) is ignored. Any Planet which 
involves the 5th cusp and commits to 11th cusp can offer the 
native faourable results for the birth of the first child or even 
for romantic relations though the 11th position is 7th from 
5.This is because for the birth of child 11th house is one of the 
relevant cusp. 

Favourable or Unfavourable Result: 

The concept of favourable or unfavourable result is subjective. 
There may be two Planets in a chart whose Star lords appear in 7th 
house or in 7th cuspal position. Both these Planets will offer the 
native the result of the 7th house, say marriage or divorce. Now 
the Planet whose Sub lord appears in 5 or 1 1 will be considered 
favourable for marriage. However the Planet whose Sub lord 
appears in 6th cusp will be considered favourable for divorce. In 
other words for marriage we need to select the Planet whose Sub 
lord appears in 5 or 1 1 and for divorce we need to select the Planet 
whose Sub lord appears in 6.The Planet which is favourable for 
marriage is unfavourable for divorce and the Planet which is 
favourable for divorce is unfavourable for marriage. This has to be 
interpreted as: Involvement represents the partner and commitment 
implies separation from the partner or union with the partner. 

Specific Role of Sub: 

This Role of the Sub lord has more applications when we 
discuss the promise of a cusp. We will therefore discuss this aspect 
in detail in a future lesson. For detailed study of discussed subject, 
please read Page numbers 123 and 124 of my book.

Sub Lord of a Planet and its Role 49 

After reckoning Fig 7, answer the following questions: 

Question 1 

On 23.09.2004 the native was running Bhukti of Sun, Antara 
of Saturn and Sookshama of Moon. Please indicate whether these 
Planets can offer the native child birth or not. 

Note: Houses offering first child birth are 2, 5, and 11 

Question 2 

Will the Planet Mars during its period offer favourable result 
to the native regarding his financial status? 

Note: Houses offering improved financial position are 2, 6, 
and 11. 



Lesson 7 

Rahu or Ketu as Sub Lord 
of a Planet & Role of Sub-Sub Lord 

of a Planet 



In lesson 4 we said that Rahu and Ketu offer the results of 
three Planets as follows: 

1. Rahu or Ketu as Rahu or Ketu. 

2. Rahu or Ketu as Sign lord of Rahu or Ketu. 

3. Rahu or Ketu as Star lord of Rahu or Ketu. 

In Lesson 5 we explained that if a Planet is in the Star of Rahu 
or Ketu it will be considered as follows: 

1. Planet in the Star of Rahu or ketu. 

2. Planet in the Star of Sign lord of Rahu or Ketu. 

3. Planet in the Star of Star lord of Rahu or Ketu. 

We also said that this should be seen from Planetary Positions 
Table. For example let us say that a Planet A is in the Star of Rahu. 
Let Rahu represent B as Sign lord and C as Star lord. Then first 
read the Planetary Table as A in the Star of Rahu. Then in place of 
Rahu under the column STL against A replace it by B . And then we 
may replace Rahu by C. 

Another way of saying the same is, "any planet in the Star of 
Rahu or Ketu will also be considered as if that planet (which Rahu 
or Ketu represents) is substituted for Rahu or Ketu in the Planetary 
Positions Table." 



Rahu orKetu as Sub Lord of a Planet 51 



Similarly any Planet in the Sub of Rahu or Ketu will be 
considered as if that Planet is also in the Sub of those Planets 
which Rahu or Ketu represents. 

Let us refer to Figl in Lesson 2.Here we notice that Tr Planet 
Sun is in Saturn Star and Ketu Sub. The results which the Planet 
Sun has to offer to the native during its Dasa periods will be qualified 
or specified by the Sub lord Ketu. 

Sun in this chart has no PS . It will offer the results as per its 
Stellar Status that is of houses 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10. 

Ketu who is the Sub lord of Sun in this chart represents Jupiter 
and Saturn. Qualification of results for the houses signified by Sun 
will be studied as follows: 

L Sun in the Star of Saturn and Sub of Ketu. Ketu appears 
in cuspal positions 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Ketu is placed 
in 4 with PS. 

2. Sun in the Star of Saturn and Sub of Jupiter. Now Jupiter 
appears in cuspal positions 1, 2, 5, 7, 11 and 12Jupiter 
is placed in 6 with PS (Jupiter is in Venus Star and Venus 
is in Jupiter Star.). 

3. Sun in the Star of Saturn and Sub of Saturn. Here we 
notice Saturn appears in cuspal positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 
10. Saturn is placed in 6 but has no PS. 

Summarising the above we may say that the results of houses 
signified by Sun will be qualified or specified by the cuspal positions 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.This means that the Planet Sun 
is capable to offer both the favourable as well as unfavourable result 
of the houses signified by it. Yes you will be asking the question: 
But what result do we choose? 

The answer to this question requires knowledge of the 
principles of Vimsottari Dasa and also the transit potential of the 
Planet Sun. We will discuss in detail on this subject in future lesson. 



52 



Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Role of Sub-Sub Lord of a Planet: 

The Sub-Sub lord of a Planet indicates the end qualification 
of the result of a house signified by a Planet as per its PS or Stellar 
Status. It should however be remembered that the native has to 
first experience the result of the house signified as per the 
qualification of the Sub lord of the Planet. Let us explain this 
through an example.

Rahu or Ketu as Sub Lord of a Planet 55 



Figure 8 is the chart of a man whose father died on 
1 9.09. 1979.0n that date the native was running the Dasa of Saturn 
and Bhukti of Venus. 

Note: This chart is not a rectified chart It is only used to 
explain the role of the Sub-Sub lord of a Planet. 

1: OPERATION OF SATURN AS DASA LORD 

In the native's chart the 9th house represents the father ie the 
first house or Ascendant of the father. The 8th from any ascendant 
always represents death, injuries and accidents. So the natives 4th 
house being 8th from the 9th signifies the house of death of the 
father. 

A. Dasa lord Saturn is in Ketu Star and Ketu is in Saturn 
Star. We say Saturn has PS. Saturn thus becomes the 
significator of 4th cusp being the lord of 4th house. Saturn 
is in Ketu Star who is the Sub-Sub lord of 9th cusp. So 
Saturn becomes the significator of 9th house also. Both 
relevant cusps for the death of father are signified. 

B. Dasa Lord Saturn is in Ketu Star which also represents 
Jupiter, but we can ignore this because the condition has 
already been fulfilled by Ketu representing Saturn. 

C. Saturn is in the Sub of Rahu (which has PS and is Star 
lord of 9) and also represents Moon. Moon is the Star 
lord of 4th cusp. (Both Rahu and Moon would confirm 
commitment). 

We say that the Planet Saturn has the potential to cause 
the death of father of the native because it involves 
relevant cusps 1 and 8 with respect to 9th cusp and also 
commits to 4th cusp (8th from 9th) which is the house of 
death for father. 

D. Saturn is in the Sub of Rahu that also represents Mercury, 
but we can ignore this because the potential for death of 



56 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



the father has already been established by Rahu 
representing the Moon. 

E. Saturn is in the Sub-Sub of Moon that appears in cuspal 
positions 4 (i.e. 8th from 9) , 10 (i.e.2 from 9).Thus the 
Sub-Sub lord of Saturn appears in cuspal positions which 
are death inflicting houses. We say the Sub-Sub lord of 
Saturn supports the end result of death of father. 

F. If Moon as Sub Sub Lord had not appeared in death 
inflicting houses from the 9th cusp then the Dasa lord 
could not have killed father. It could have only offered 
the father of the native, events such as accidents, injuries 
or some kind of surgery. 

2: OPERATION OF VENUS AS BHUKTI LORD 

Houses considered for death are 1 (representing the body of 
the native) , 2, 7 and 12 which are Maraka (harm inflicting) houses, 
and the Badhaksthana (house of obstruction, commonly considered 
as death inflicting) is 11 for charts with the ascendant in Cardinal 
signs, 9 for fixed signs, and 7 for mutable signs. 

A. In this chart Venus is in Venus Star and Jupiter Sub. Venus 
appears in 3, 4, 9 and 10 and is placed in 10. All these 
houses are death inflicting houses for the father. 
(Remember to count from the 9th house ie 10th is the 
second to the 9th). 

B. Venus is in Jupiter Sub which appears in 3rd cusp i.e. 
Maraka and Badhaka (7th from 9th and 9th is ruled by 
mutable sign Gemini) house for father. So Jupiter 
confirms the Star indications. 

C. OPERATION OF SUB SUB LORDS 

Venus is in the Sub-Sub of Venus. We have already seen 
that Venus appears in the death inflicting houses for 



Rahu or Ketu as Sub Lord of a Planet 57 



father. Thus the Sub-Sub lord of the Bhukti lord confirms 
the end result. You will see from 1 (E) above that the 
Sub Sub Lord of the Dasa Lord likewise gave the same 
confirmation. 

3. Suppose a Planet involves the Ascdt or the first cusp and 
commits to the 6th cusp through its Sub lord. We say that this 
Planet is capable to cause sickness to the native. 

Now if the Sub-Sub lord of this Planet appears in 8th or 12th 
cusp then the native may not recover from sickness during 
the period of this Planet. However if the Sub-Sub lord of the 
Planet appears in 1 (health), or 5 (12th to 6) , or 11 then the 
native may recover from the sickness during the period of 
this Planet. 

Another way to explain the Role of Sub-Sub Lord: Some 
times we find that a Planet in its period gives marriage as well as 
divorce. This happens because: 

1. Planet involves 7th cusp and commits to 5 or 11 and 
also to 6. 

2. Sub-Sub lord of the Planet appears in 6 and 12. 

Let us explain the role of Sub-Sub of a Planet in yet another 
way. 

The Planet involves 7 and commits to 5 or 11, But the Sub- 
Sub lord of the Planet appears in 6 and does not appear in any of 
the relevant cusps 5 or 7 or 11 .This may indicate that the proposed 
marriage may not take place. 

4: Rahu or Ketu as Sub-Sub lord of a Planet: Please treat it in 
the same way as we have discussed for Rahu or Ketu as Sub 
lord of a Planet. In simple words any Planet in the Sub-Sub of 
Rahu or Ketu in the 'Planetary Positions' Table will be taken 
as if it is in the Sub-Sub of Planets that Rahu or Ketu represents. 



58 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

Practice Exercise: Lesson 7 

Look at figure 7 of Lesson 6. The native of this chart will be 
running Dasa periods of Dasa -Bhukti- Antara {at some time in 
future} as shown below: 

A. Rahu-Jupiter-Sat 

B . Rahu-Jupiter-Ketu 

C. Rahu -Jupiter-Moon 

Please indicate during which Antara period the native can 
expect enhancement in financial status and during which 
Antara period there will be no enhancement in financial status. 



Lesson 8 
Study of a Cusp 



1. Formation of Cuspal Chart: For every event (remember birth 
of a person is also an event) a particular degree rises in the 
Eastern Horizon at the time and place of happening of the 
event. We call this as the Ascendant or Lagna or First Cusp. 

A: The chart is then cast using Placidus System of House 
Formation and Khullar Ayanamsa. You may refer Page 
33 of my Book. The degree rising on each cusp is 
calculated and this is shown in Cuspal Positions in the 
chart. How to read Cuspal Positions have already been 
explained in Lesson 2. 

B: Each cuspal position is defined by a particular Sign, Star, 
Sub and Sub-Sub. The lords of Sign, Star, Sub and Sub- 
Sub are called the co-rulers of the cusp. 

2. Purpose of Study of a Cusp: We analyse a horoscope to 
determine the following: 

A: What is the native's destiny? That is, what is promised 
to the native for all aspects of human life? 

B: Timing the specific events. 

3. In CIL Theory, the study of the horoscope is basically the 
study of the Planets that co-rule the cuspal positions. 
However we should remember that the potential and 
promise of each cusp is dependent upon the significations 
of the Sub-Sub lord of the cusp which differentiates persons 
born with a little time difference. The study of the cusp of 



60 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



a house is basically the study of what the destiny of the 
individual has promised to the native regarding the 
significations of that house. 

It should be borne in mind that a promise is not a guarantee 
that an event will happen. Sometimes promises are kept, 
sometimes not. We will see below how to check whether such 
a promise is fulfilled. 

A native experiences in his/her life only that which is promised 
in the horoscope. If the Sub-Sub lord of the 5th cusp in a 
nativity does not promise the birth of a child, the person will 
never get a child. A person gets his/her first child during the 
joint period of the Planets that signify 2, 5 and 1L This person 
may run the joint period of the Planets that signify these houses 
but he/she will not get the child if it is not promised. Native 
during this period will get the other results of houses 2, 5 and 
11. 

The concepts Potential of a cusp and Promise of a cusp have 
been explained in my Book on pages 118 to 120. Here we 
will discuss how we can study the horoscope for determining 
the promise of specific events. 

Procedure to Study the Promise of Specific events. 

We follow the following procedure to determine the promise 
of specific events that may or may not happen in the life of a 
person. 

A: Step 1: Study of the Ascendant. 

(1) A native is born at a particular moment on a 
particular date and at a particular place. Planetary 
and Cuspal positions at that moment corresponds 
to his/her Karmic code. The Ascendant at that 
moment reflects the very being of the individual. 
The person's nature, his capacity to enjoy the 
pleasures and struggles of life; his/her style of 
functioning; what is destined for him in this 



Study of a Cusp 61 



incarnation as per the wisdom acquired from earlier 
lives is depicted by the Ascendant 

(2) In other words, study of the Ascendant, in fact is 
the study of the whole horoscope in general. Nay it 
is the epitome of the whole horoscope. In simple 
words we may say that the native enjoys the 
significations of those houses with which the Sub- 
Sub lord of the Ascendant has established link. This 
can be a direct link or an indirect link. 

Direct Linkage means linkage with the Primary Cusp of the 
matter under consideration through Star lord or by way of 
Positional status. If the matter under consideration is the 
capability of the native to produce a child i.e. addition in the 
family the 2nd cusp becomes the Primary cusp. (Note this 
does NOT mean that the Primary Cusp for determining the 
procreative power or the capability of the native to produce 
the child is the 2nd. It is in fact the 5th.Second house plays 
the role of Primary cusp at the time of birth of the child). 

Indirect Linkage means that the Star lord appears in 11th 
cusp, the house of fulfillment of desire. The Sub lord linkage 
specifies the area through which desire will be fulfilled. In 
the matter of child birth if the Star lord appears in 11th cusp 
and Sub lord appears in 2nd cusp it should be read as the 
fulfillment of desire by way of having a child. If the Sub lord 
appears in 7th cusp it would mean fulfillment of desire of 
marriage. Indirect linkage is also said to be established if the 
Sub Sub lord of the 1st cusp has positional status and it appears 
in 11th cuspal position or Bhava and its Sub lord appears in 
2nd cuspal position (for child birth). 

Direct or Indirect linkage has nothing to do with the strength 
of linkage. Strength of linkage is checked by the position of 
Sub lord in favourable or unfavourable cusps with respect to 
the desired cusp. 



62 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

B: Step 2: Fix the Primary and Supporting Cusps that 
will take part in enacting the event. Refer Appendix B 
for this purpose. 

C: Step 3: For a particular event's promise we need to look 
for the linkages of the Sub-Sub lord of the Primary cusp 
with the desired cusps. 

5. Let us explain this through examples. 

D. Example 1: Promise of Child Birth. Refer Fig 7 of 

Lesson 6. Let us analyse the chart to determine whether 
the native is promised birth of a child. 

Fifth house in a chart signifies Progeny. Second house is 
the house that signifies self acquisition. It may be self 
acquired wealth or addition in the family. 11th house is 
fulfillment of desire. 

Step 1: If the native has to enjoy the birth of a child the 
SSL of Ascendant should be linked directly or indirectly 
with 2nd cusp. Sub-Sub lord of Ascdt is Venus who is in 
Moon Star. Moon is placed in the second house and is 
also the Sub lord of the second house. Moon is also the 
Star lord of 11th cusp (fulfillment of desires). 

Step 2: Since the addition in family has to be by way of 
child birth we need to study the 5th cusp. For promise of 
addition in family (by way of child birth) 5th cusp SSL 
should be linked with 2 directly or indirectly. 



Study of a Cusp 63 



Step 3: Sub-Sub lord of 5th cusp is Sun who is in Sun 
Star. Sun is placed in second Bhava. Sun is in the Sub of 
Venus who is the SSL of second Bhava. 

We can say native is promised the birth of a child. 

Position of Sub lord of SSL of 5th cusp in cuspal positions 
which are 4, 7, 8 and 12 from Fifth cusp indicates delay and other 
problems. 

This is stated as a general principle. Remember Sub lord 
does not qualify other positions of Sub lord. Sub lord only 
qualifies Star lord position. 

In this example chart SSL of 5th cusp is Sun who is in Sun 
Star. Thus it signifies 5th house significations (Progeny). Sun is in 
the Sub of Venus that appears in 2 (addition in family). Now if 
Venus also appears in positions which are 4, 7, 8 and 12 from 5 
then this indicates adverse effects on the 5th house significations. 
Here in this chart Venus appears in 4 and 8 positions from 5. This 
accounts for delays etc. 

Note: In Astrology we say an event may happen if it is 
promised; but an event will never happen if it is not promised. 
Here we have declared that the native is promised birth of a 
child. We can not say that the native will definitely have a child. 
Reason for this is 5th cusp has many other significations also; 
for example Speculation. Linkage of the 5th cusp SSL with 
second cusp will also promise gain to the native through 
speculation. 

Example 2: Promise for Higher Education. Refer Fig 8.1

Study of a Cusp 67 



(1) Conditions for Higher education are: (Refer page 198 
of my Book) 

a. Fourth Sub-Sub lord should maintain a connection 
with 9th house. 

b. Ninth house Sub-Sub lord should be linked with 
favourable houses with respect to itself and also 
with respect to the Ascendant. Favourable houses 
for achieving excellence in higher education are 5, 
7 and 11. 

c. Linkages of the Sub-Sub lord of the 9th house with 
4, 8 or 12 are not considered good. 

d. Linkage of the Ascendant Sub-Sub lord with 9th 
house through its Star lord or through 11th house 
promises success in higher education. 

Step 1: If the native is to enjoy or experience Higher education 
the SSL of Ascdt should be linked with 9th cusp either directly 
or indirectly i.e. through 11th cusp. 

Here the SSL of Ascdt is Venus who is in Venus Star and 
Saturn Sub. Both Venus and Saturn appear in 9th cusp. 

Thus we say that the native is capable to enjoy the 
significations of the 9th cusp. One of the significations of 9th 
cusp is Higher Education. 

Step 2: 9th cusp represents Higher Education. But for that 
the native needs to have the basic education and there has to 
be a link between the basic education that is 4th house and 
the 9th house. 

Here SSL of 4th cusp is Saturn who is in Saturn Star. Saturn is 
Sub as well as SSL of the 9th cusp. Thus 4th cusp maintains a 
link with the 9th cusp. Saturn is in the Sub of Sun who appears 
in 4, 8, 11 and 12. Cusps 4, 8 and 12 are unfavourable houses 
for 9. 11th cusp is favourable for 9. 



68 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



We, therefore, say that the native may have higher education 
and there may be a break between the basic and higher 
education. 

Step 3: 9th cusp is the Primary cusp for higher education. 
Sub-Sub lord of 9th cusp is Saturn who is in Saturn Star. 
Saturn appears in cuspal positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10. 
Saturn is in the Sub of Sun which we have stated above appears 
in4,8, 11 and 12. 

Thus 9th cusp also indicates that the native may go for higher 
education but it is beset with problems. 

Linkages of SSL of 9th cusp through its Sub lord with 4, 8 
and 12 that is 8, 12 and 4 from 9 is adverse for the significations 
of the 9th house (in the present example we are talking of 
Higher education) .Linkage through Sub Lord with 11th cusp 
that is 3rd from 9 is very positive as 3rd house from any house 
is the house of multiplication of significations of the house 
from where it is 3rd. Thus we conclude that Higher education 
is possible but with attached problems. 

We will study some more examples in next lesson where 
we will discuss how to analyse the promise of a cusp wh<Sh 
Rahu or Ketu is the SSL of the cusp.

Please answer the following questions: 

Question 1: Does the chart promise birth of a child to the 
native? 

Bhavas 2, 5, 11 

Question2: Does the chart promise gain through property to 
the native? 

Bhavas 4, 2, 11, 12 

Question3: Does the chart promise that the native is prone to 

sickness? 

Bhavas 1,6,8, 1£ 

Question4: Does the chart promise native earning by way of 

service? 

Bhavas 6, 2, 10 



Lesson 9 

Rahu or Ketu 
As Sub-Sub Lord of a Cusp 



We have discussed in Lesson 8 that the promise of various 
aspects of a house is determined by the significations of the Sub- 
Sub lord of the cusp. 

I. It is possible that for a cusp Rahu or Ketu appears as Sub- 
Sub Lord. In such a case the promise of that cusp is studied 
by following the procedure stated below: 

A: Step 1: Treat Rahu or Ketu like other Planets and 
determine promise as stated in Lesson 8. 

B: Step 2: Replace Rahu or Ketu by the Sign lord of Rahu 
or Ketu. That is, treat the Planet who is the Sign Lord of 
Rahu or Ketu as the Sub-Sub lord of the cusp and 
determine the promise. 

C: Step 3: Replace Rahu or Ketu by the Star lord of Rahu 
or Ketu. That is, treat the Planet who is the Star lord of 
Rahu or Ketu as the Sub-Sub lord of the cusp and 
determine the promise. 

D: Step 4: Summation of Steps 1, 2 and 3 will declare the 
promise of the cusp. 

Thus we may say that when Rahu or Ketu appears as Sub- 
Sub lord of a cusp then that cusp can be treated as if it has 
three SSLs: 



74 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

(1) RahuorKetu 

(2) Sign Lord of Rahu or Ketu 

(3) Star lord of Rahu or Ketu. 

This concept is used only for determining the promise of a 
cusp. 

If a Tflanet is in the Star of a Planet that Rahu or Ketu 
represents it will not be considered as being in the Star of 
the SSL of the cusp whose SSL is Rahu or Ketu. 

Suppose Rahu is the SSL of 4th cusp in a chart. In that 
chart Rahu may represent Mercury as Sign lord and Sun as 
Star lord. IfaTr Planet, in that chart, is in Mercury or Sun 
Star then that Planet will not be considered as in the Star of 
SSL of the 4th cusp. 

2. It is possible that the promise of a particular condition as 
shown by Rahu or Ketu as SSL of a cusp, and as shown by 
the Planets that Rahu or Ketu represent, is of opposite 
nature. In such cases we should remember that this 
indicates weak promise. However, the promise shown by 
Rahu or Ketu takes precedence. 

Let us explain this concept through an example. 

A: Example: Promise of committing Suicide. (Self 
assassination or taking one's own life) Refer Fig 1 of 
Lesson 2. 

(1) The SSL of Ascendant should meet one of the 
following Necessary Conditions; 

a: SSL of Ascendant should involve the 8th cusp 
(house of death) through PS, or its Star lord, 
and commit to Maraka houses (2 and 7) and 
Badhaka house, through its Sub lord. 



Rahu orKetuAs Sub-Sub Lord of a Cusp 75 



b: The Star lord of SSL of Ascendant (or if SSL 
has PS) appears in 1 and 8, and its Sub lord 
appears in Maraka and Badhaka houses. 

c: The Star lord of SSL of Ascendant (or if SSL 
has PS) appears in 1 and Sub lord appears in 
2, and 7, or 8 and Badhaka house. 

(2) Similarly the SSL of the 8th cusp should satisfy 
one of the following conditions: 

a: SSL of 8th cusp should involve the Ascendant 
through PS or its Star Lord and commit to 
Maraka and Badhaka houses. 

b: The Star lord of SSL of 8th cusp (or if SSL 
has PS) appears in 1 and 8 and Sub appears in 
Maraka and Badhaka houses. 

c: The Star lord of SSL of 8th cusp (or if SSL 
has PS) appears in 8, and its Sub appears in 1, 
2, or 7 and Badhaka house. 

B: Essential Condition: 

The Sub-Sub lord of the SSL of Ascendant should appear 
in 8 or Maraka and Badhaka houses. 

3. Study of SSL of Ascendant of Fig 1 Lesson 2: 

The SSL of Ascendant is Ketu who represents Jupiter as Sign 
lord and Saturn as Star lord. Thus we say that the SSL of 
Ascendant is Ketu, Jupiter and Saturn. 

A: Ketu as SSL of Ascendant: 

(1) In this chart Ketu has PS. We can say that Ketu is 
as good as in its own Star. 

(2) Now Ketu is SSL of 1 and Sub Lord of 8. 



76 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



(3) Ketu is in the Sub of Venus that appears in 2, 7 and 
9 (Badhaka). Thus Ketu meets the necessary 
condition for committing suicide. 

(4) Ketu is in the SSL of Mars who appears in 8 as Star 
lord and is placed in 2 with PS. Thus Ketu meets 
the essential condition also. 

B: Jupiter as SSL of Ascendant: 

(1) Jupiter has PS because it is in Venus Star and Venus 
is in Jupiter Star. 

(2) Jupiter is in the Sub of Saturn. Jupiter appears in 1 
but does not appear in 8 

(3) Saturn the Sub lord of Jupiter does not appear in 2, 
7 and 8. Saturn only appears in 9 (Badhaka house). 
Thus we see that Jupiter as per its PS does not 
satisfy the necessary condition. 

(4) Jupiter is in Venus Star. Venus does not appear in 1 
or 8. Thus Jupiter does not satisfy the necessary 
condition even as per its Stellar Status. 

C: Saturn as SSL of Ascendant: 

(1) Saturn has no PS in this chart. Saturn is in Venus 
Star who does not appear in 1 or 8. Thus Saturn does 
not meet the necessary condition. 

Conclusion for Ascendant: SSL as Jupiter or Saturn shows 
poor promise for committing suicide. However, Ascendant 
SSL as Ketu shows strong promise, hence will take 
precedence. 

Study of SSL of 8th Cusp: 

A: The SSL of 8th cusp is Mercury who is in Rahu Star 
and Jupiter Sub. 



Rahu orKetuAs Sub-Sub Lord of a Cusp 77 



(1) Mercury has PS because Mercury is in Rahu Star; 
Rahu represents Mercury and Sun (as Sign lord 
and Star Lord respectively). 

(2) Rahu is the Sub lord of Ascendant. Thus we say 
that 8th cusp involves 1 and 8. (Rahu in 1 and 
Mercury in 8). 

(3) Jupiter the Sub lord of Mercury appears in 2 and 7, 
but not in the Badhaka house 9. 

(4) Rahu as Sun. Sun does not signify either 1 or 8. 

(5) Thus we see that Mercury the SSL of 8th cusp 
does not meet the necessary condition 

Conclusion for 8th Cusp: SSL of 8th cusp does not promise 
that the native will commit suicide. 

Final conclusion: In the ultimate analysis we may say that 
the Ascendant does promise that the native may commit 
suicide, but as the 8th cusp does not promise the event of 
suicide* it is not promised in this chart. 

Practice Exercise: Lesson 9- Refer Fig 9 and answer the 
questions given below. Please give astrological reasons for your 
answers. 

Question 1: 

a. Do you think that the chart promises committing suicide? 

b. Do you think that the native is likely to commit suicide? If 

so Why? 

Question 2: 

a. Does the chart promise love marriage? (You can refer 
Pages 220 and 226 of the Book. 

b. Do you think that the native will have a love marriage? If 

so Why?

Lesson 10 
Vimsottari Dasa and its Application 



The horoscope of each individual is unique. It has a specific 
degree that rises on the Ascendant and corresponding specific 
degrees rise on other cusps. Planets are positioned in specific 
zodiacal positions. The Planetary positions and cuspal positions in 
the chart correspond to the native's Karraic code. 

We have already stated that a horoscope is analysed to 
determine the following: 

What is the native's destiny? ie. what is promised to the native 
for all aspects of human life. 

Timing Specific Events in the Native's life. 

If an event is promised as indicated by the study of the dynamic 
significations of the SSL of the Ascendant and SSL of the Primary 
cusp, it will happen only at a specific Date and Time. This Date 
and Time is controlled by Dasa period lords. 

In Sub-Sub and CIL we use Vimsottari Dasa System which is 
based on the progression of Moon in Stars, Sub, Sub-Sub, Sub- 
Sub-Sub and Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub from its position at birth. 

The Star lord of Moon at the time of birth or at any time in life 
is called the Dasa lord, Sub lord of Moon is called Bhukti lord, 
Sub-Sub lord is called Antara Lord, Sub-Sub-Sub lord is called 
Sookshama lord, and Sub-Sub-Sub-Sub lord is called Prana lord. 



82 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

1 Timing Events: 

A: A promised event happens in the joint period of 
fruitful significators* of houses that take part in 
enacting an event provided Transit agrees. 

This statement specifically states that an event happens 
when the following three things agree; 

(1) Event should be promised 

(2) It happens only in the joint period of Planets that 
signify Primary and supporting cusps 

(3) Transit agrees 

In this Lesson we will discuss role of the various levels of 
Dasa period lords. 

Note: Please read chapter 14 pages 297 onwards, of my 
book, for calculation of Dasa periods. 

* For definition of fruitful significators' see KCIT (Rev) page 
100 

2. Philosophy behind Application of Vimsottari Dasa: 

A: Major Events: Role of Dasa Lord 

Each Planet in a horoscope signifies certain houses as 
per its PS and Stellar Status. If a Planet has no PS it 
provides the results of the houses it signifies as per its 
Stellar Status. The result of the houses signified by the 
Planet is qualified and specified by the Sub lord of the 
Planet. 

Dasa lord as per its significations fixes the houses for 
the significant events to happen during its period. Unless 
Dasa lord is linked with the Primary cusp for an aspect 
of life, that event may not happen during its period. 
Remember Dasa lord can be linked to Primary cusp 



Vimsottari Dasa and its Application 83 

directly or indirectly. Let me explain this through 
examples: 

(1) Purchase of Property: Dasa lord may not signify 
house 4 either by PS or by Stellar Status. But if 
Dasa Lord involves 9th house (12th to 10 - others 
property) and commits to 4 by its Sub lord, then 
Dasa lord will permit the event to happen in 
appropriate Bhukti, Antara etc. 

(2) Marriage: For marriage, Dasa lord may be a 
significator of 7th cusp because it signifies 7th 
house by its PS or by its Stellar Status and commits 
to 5 or 1 1 by its Sub lord, or to cusps which are not 
negating the significations of 7th cusp. 

Or Dasa lord may involve 5th or 11th cusp by its 
Star lord or PS and commits to 7th cusp by its Sub 
lord. Such Dasa lord will permit the event of 
marriage to take place in appropriate Bhukti, Antara 
etc. 

(3) Higher Education: If the chart promises native to 
undergo higher education then Dasa lord should 
permit this event. It can do so if it is significator of 
9. 

Or if Dasa lord involves 4th or 11th house and 
commits to 9 by its Sub lord. 

(4) Death of Native or his/her Relation: Death takes 
place only in a particular Dasa whose lord is linked 
simultaneously to Ascendant and 8th house for the 
native and the relevant 8th house for the relative. 
Simultaneous linkage is possible in following ways: 

a: Dasa lord by its PS is appearing in 1 and 8. 
Sub lord of Dasa lord appears in Maraka or 



84 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



badhaka house. Sub-Sub lord of Dasa lord has 
to be in 8 or Maraka or Badhaka house. 

b: Dasa lord involves Ascendant by its Star lord 
or PS and commits to 8th cusp by its Sub lord. 
Sub-Sub lord of Dasa lord has to be in 8 or 
Maraka or Badhaka house. 

c: Dasa lord involves 8th cusp by its Star lord or 
PS and commits to Ascendant by its Sub lord. 
Sub-Sub lord of Dasa lord has to be in 8 or 
Maraka or Badhaka house. 

d: Dasa lord involves Ascendant and 8th cusp 
and commits to Maraka and Badhaka house. 
Sub-Sub lord of Dasa lord has to be in 8 or 
Maraka or Badhaka house. Note Maraka and 
Badhaka houses are discussed on pages 46 
&47ofKCILRev 

e: If the Dasa lord is one of the ruling planets in 
Ascendant or 8th cusp and is significator of 
Maraka and Badhaka houses then this Dasa 
lord can also cause the death of the relevant 
relative. Sub lord and SSL of Dasa Lord have 
to be in 8 or Maraka or Badhaka. (Reference 
Page 50 of the Book). 

Dasa lord can allow happening of significant events in its 
own Bhukti and even its own Antara if it is significator of 
Primary and supporting cusps that take part in enacting the 
event. Sub-Sub lord of the Dasa lord should appear in relevant 
cusps. 

I do not agree with those who say that Dasa lord does not 
provide significant events in its own Bhukti. 

B: Major Event: Role of Bhukti Lord 



Vimsottari Dasa and its Application 85 



(1) Bhukti lord can provide only which the Dasa lord 
permits. In other words Bhukti lord may cause the 
event to happen only if Dasa lord is not linked to 
those houses which negate the happening of that 
event. 

a: For example, Marriage can not take place in a 
Dasa whose lord is linked only to 4, 6 and 12 
or involves 7 and commits to 6 without being 
committed to 5 or 1 1 . 

(2) Bhukti lord should be significator of Primary cusp 
directly or indirectly. 

a: For example marriage takes place only in that 
Bhukti which is linked to 7th cusp directly or 
indirectly. 

b: Death takes place only in a Bhukti which 
signifies 8 or Maraka and Badhaka house. 

(3) Bhukti lord can allow an event to happen in its own 
Antara if Bhukti lord signifies Primary and 
supporting cusps. 

C: Major Event: Role of Antara Lord 

(1) Antara lord can allow only those events which Dasa 
and Bhukti lords permit. 

(2) Antara lord has to be a significator of the Primary 
and or supporting cusps. 

D: Major Event: Role of Sookshama and Prana Lords 

Sookshama and Prana lords should be linked with 
Primary and at least one supporting cusp for the event, 
which may happen in a particular Dasa, Bhukti and 
Antara. 



86 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



E: Timing Minor Events: 

(1) All principles stated above for Major Events apply. 
However emphasis is laid on Antara, Sookshma and 
Prana lords. 

(2) For example a person makes a short visit abroad. It 
can happen in Dasa and Bhukti whose lords may 
be only significator of 3 or 9 or 12. 

a: Antara lord may be significator of 9 (long 
journey) or 12 (new environment or foreign 
land). 

b: Sookshama and Prana lord has to be strongly 
linked with 3, 9 and 12. 

The best way to learn the application of Dasa period lords is 
to study some charts for past events. We will discuss Timing 
future events in a separate lesson. 

3. Example 1: Refer Fig 9 of Lesson 9 

We have seen in Lesson 9 Practice Exercise that this chart 
promises that the native may commit suicide. The native in 
fact committed suicide on 15 October 1994 at about 08.00 
hrs . The native on that day was running Dasa period of Jupiter- 
Mercury- Jupiter-Saturn- Mercury. Let us see whether Dasa 
period lords justify happening of the event. 

A: Dasa Lord Jupiter: 

(1) In this chart Tr. Jupiter is in Jupiter Star and Sun 
Sub. 

(2) Jupiter appears in cuspal positions 2, 7 and 8 and is 
placed in second Bhava. All these are death 
inflicting positions. 

(3) Sun Sub lord of Jupiter appears as the Star lord of 
Ascendant (only relevant cusps shown). Thus 



Vimsottari Dasa and its Application 87 



Jupiter meets the necessary condition to cause 
death of the native. 

(4) Tr. Jupiter is in the Sub-Sub of Mercury who 
appears in 2, 7 and 8 . Thus Dasa lord Jupiter also 
satisfies the essential condition. 

B: Bhukti Lord Mercury: 

(1) Here we find that Tr. Mercury is in Saturn Star and 
Rahu Sub. 

(2) Saturn appears in 2, 7 and 8 (only relevant positions 
shown). 

(3) Sub lord Rahu represents Mercury as Sign lord and 
Moon as Star lord. Notice both Mercury and Moon 
appears in the Ascendant. Mercury also appears in 
2, 7 and 8. Mercury is in the Sub Sub of Rahu. Thus 
we find that the Bhukti lord Mercury has the 
potential to cause death of the native. 

C: Antara Lord Jupiter: 

We have discussed above that Jupiter has the potential 
to cause death. 

D: Sookshama Lord Saturn: Tr. Saturn in this chart is in 
Ketu Star and Saturn Sub. Ketu represents Jupiter as Sign 
lord and Saturn as Star lord. 

(1) TfcSaturn in Ketu Star: 

Ketu is placed in 7 (Maraka and Badhaka ). Only 
relevant cuspal or Bhava positions shown. 

(2) Tr. Saturn in Jupiter Star: 

Jupiter appears in 2, 7 and 8. 

(3) Tr. Saturn in Saturn Star: 

Saturn appears in 2, 7 and 8. 



88 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



(4) Saturn is in Saturn Sub and thus is linked to relevant 
cusps 2, 7 and 8. 

(5) Saturn is in the Sub-Sub of Mercury which appears 
in 1, 2, 7 and 8. 

Thus we find that Sookshama lord can cause death 
of the Native. 

E: Prana Lord Mercury: 

We have discussed above that Mercury has the potential 
to cause death. Mercury is Sign as well as Sub lord of 
Ascendant (self) and clearly indicates that the native 
himself took his own life. 

4 Example 2: Refer Fig 8.2 

The native got first male child on 26.12.1999 at 23.45 hrs. He 
was running at that time Dasa period of Mars-Jup-Mars-Jup- 
Mars. In lesson 8 we have seen that this chart promises birth 
of child. 

Let us see whether Planets Mars and Jupiter which are Dasa 
period lords justify birth of first child or not. Birth of first 
child takes place in the joint period of Planets that are fruitful 
significators of 2, 5 and 11. 

A: Tr. Planet Mars: 

(1) Mars is in Venus Star and Jupiter Sub. Venus 
appears in 2 and Jupiter appears in 5 and 1L 

Thus Planet Mars is capable to cause birth of first 
child. 

a: Mars is in Mars Sub-Sub who appears in 
relevant cuspal positions 2 and 11. 

b: Mars as SSL confirms birth of child. 



Vimsottari Dasa and its Application 89 



(2) Tr. Jupiter: 

a: In this chart Tr. Jupiter is in Ketu Star and 
Tr.Ketu is in Jupiter Star. Thus we may say 
that Tr. Jupiter is in Jupiter Star who appears 
in 5 and 1 1 . 

b: Tr. Jupiter is in Mars Sub who appears in 2 
and 11. 

c: Jupiter is in the Sub-Sub of Ketu. Now Ketu 
as Moon and Jupiter appears in relevant cusps . 

Thus we say that native got first child in Dasa period 
of Planets that signify 2, 5 andll. 

Note!: I have chosen only those examples where event has 
happened in Dasa period of Planets where Rahu or Ketu has 
not appeared as any Dasa period lord. In next lesson we will 
explain application of Rahu or Ketu as Dasa period lords. 

Note2: Some times we notice that a Planet involves the 
Primary cusp for an event and simultaneously commits to 
favourable and unfavourable cusps. We will discuss the 
significations of such Planets and their role in enacting 
favourable and unfavourable events in future lessons. 

Practice Exercise: Lesson 10. 

Refer Fig 10 .The following two significant events happened 
in the life of this native. 

1. Native lost his mother on 10 June 1994 when he was 
running Dasa period Ven-Jup-Ven-Sat-Moon. Please 
justify that the event has happened in the joint period of 
Planets that signify the event. Please take 4th cusp as 
Ascendant for mother.

Native purchased land in Dec 1988 to build house. He 
was running Dasa period Ven-Mars-Jup- Venus. Please 
justify happening of the event. For purchase of land we 
need those Planets to take part who signify 4, 1 1 and 12.

Lesson 11 
Transit and its Application 



1. In Lesson 10 we stated that a promised event happens in the 
joint period of fruitful significators of houses that take part in 
enacting an event, provided Transit agrees. This statement 
specifically states that an event happens when the following 
three things agree; 

A: Event should be promised and 

B: It happens only in the joint period of Planets that signify 
Primary and supporting cusps and 

C: Transit agrees 

In Lesson 8 we discussed how to determine promise of specific 
events. In Lesson 10 we discussed role of Dasa period lords. 
In this Lesson we will discuss Theory of Transit as is applied 
in CIL. 

2. Concept of Transit 

Each Planet occupies a particular position in the natal chart. 
We said that these positions of Planets correspond to the 
native's Karmic Code. We used suffix Tr to represent natal 
Planets. Tr Planets acquire capability to provide specific results 
to the native as per their PS and Stellar Status. 

However the capability of Tr Planets for causing specific event 
to happen is conditioned by the position of Planets at the 
expected event time and date. For Event position of Planets 
we will use the suffix ETr. 



94 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



It may be stated categorically that ETr Planets can at best 
either support the happening of the event during specific 
period of fruitful significators of that event or it may 
disallow the Tr Planets to cause that event. ETr Planets 
can not of their own cause an event. 

ETr positions of Planets are called Transits. 

3. Theory of Transit as applied in CIL 

Theory of Transit is based on the concepts of Theory of Transit 
as applied by Nadi Astrologers. It stands established through 
the study of Nadi literature that there is positive co-relationship 
between Tr Planets and ETr Planets at the time of happening 
of specific Major or Minor events. 

The co-relationship that ETr Planets establish with Tr Planets 
at the time of an event is studied on the basis of the following 
rules. 

A: ETr Planet excites the cuspal positions where its transit 
Sign lord appears as Sign, Star, Sub and Sub-Sub lords 
in natal chart. Transit Sign lord in the natal chart may or 
may not have PS . 

B; ETr Planet excites the lord of the Sign in the natal chart 

in which it transits . This Sign lord in the natal chart should 
be significator of relevant cusps for the event in the natal 
chart (either by PS or by Stellar Status). 

C: If ETr Planet transits in a Sign that satisfies the above 
two conditions then ETr Planet in that Sign should 
transit in a Star, lord of which: 

(1) appears in relevant cusps for the event in the natal 
chart (Star lord may or may not have PS in the natal 
chart ) or 

(2) Star lord should be significator of relevant cusps in 
the natal chart (either by PS or by Stellar Status) 



Transit and its Application 95 



D: If ETr Planet transits in a Sign and Star that satisfies 
above conditions then ETr Planet should transit in a Sub 
lord of which: 

(1) appears in relevant cusp for the event in the natal 
chart or 

(2) Sub lord should be significator of relevant cusps in 
the natal chart (either by PS or by Stellar Status). 

E: If ETr Planet transits in a Sign, Star and Sub, lords of 
which satisfies above conditions then ETr Planet should 
transit in Sub Sub the lord of which: 

(1) appears in relevant cusp for that event in the natal 
chart or 

(2) SSL should be significator of relevant cusps in the 
natal chart (either by PS or by Stellar Status). 

In the light of the above we can say that the Planet which 
has to cause the event to happen should in transit be also 
linked with the relevant cusps. 

It should be noted that if the Sign lord of the Planet in 
transit does not favour the event then even if its Star lord 
favours the event, the event does not happen. 

The above rules need be applied to Dasa period lords. It may 
be emphasised that no event happens in the life of a native 
unless ETr Sun and ETr Moon occupies the desired positions 
in transit. 

By desired positions we mean that for an event to happen 
Sun and Moon must transit in a Sign, Star, Sub and Sub-Sub 
lords of which satisfies above conditions. 

For specific events ETr Sun and ETr Moon transits in the 
Stars the lords of which in the natal chart are linked with 
the Primary cusp directly or indirectly. 



96 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



For some events we define what should be ETr MOON'S 
STAR LORD for that event. 

For example Moon's Star lord on the day of Death is fixed by 
the SSL of the 8th cusp in the Natal Chart. 

A: Moon's Star lord on the day of death can be: 

(1) the same Planet which is the SSL of the 8th cusp. 

(2) the same Planet which is the Star lord of the SSL 

of the 8th cusp. 

(3) any Planet whose Star lord is the same Planet who 
is the Star lord of the SSL of the 8th cusp. 

For example let Saturn be the SSL of the 8th cusp in a natal 
chart. Let Saturn be in the Star of Jupiter. On the day of death 
Moon's Star lord can be: 

(1) Saturn, (2) Jupiter, and (3). Any Planet (in the natal chart) 
who is in the Star of Jupiter. 

Note: In some cases Moon Star on the day of death may be 
other than that stated above. But that Star lord has to be a 
Planet that links with 1 and 8 cusps or Maraka and Badhaka 
houses. 



Transit and its Application 97 



5. Transit of Jupiter: 

Jupiter represents the year of happening of significant events. 
ETr Jupiter must transit on the day of happening of a significant 
event (malefic or benefice) in Sign, Star, Sub and Sub-Sub 
the lords of which satisfies above conditions stated under the 
title Theory of Transit. 

6. Transit of Saturn: 

For events like death of the native or his/her relations Saturn 
must transit in a Sign, Star, Sub and Sub-Sub the lords of 
which satisfies above conditions stated under the title Theory 
of Transit. 

7. Let us explain the application of the Theory of Transit 
through an example. Refer Fig 9 of Lesson 9. 

In Lesson 9 we came to the conclusion that the Chart promises 
that the native may commit suicide. 

The native in fact committed suicide on 15 October 1994 at 
about 08.00 hrs. The native on that day was running Dasa 
period of Jupiter-Mercury- Jupiter-Saturn-Mercury. In Lesson 
10 we discussed that the Dasa period lords had the potential 
to allow the event to happen. 

Let us study the event chart to see whether transit allows the 
event to happen or not. Fig 11,1 is the event chart.

Transit and its Application 101 

8. Transit Of Dasa Lord and Antara lord Jupiter 

A: ETr Jupiter transits in Libra Sign ruled by Venus. 

(1) Venus appears as SSL of 7th cusp in the natal chart 
Fig 9, both Maraka and Badhaka house. 

(2) Venus in the natal chart is in Ketu Star. Ketu is 
placed in 7th Bhava. 

Ketu represents Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter is placed in 2 
and appears in 2, 7 and 8. 

Similarly Saturn appears in 2, 7 and 8. 

We may say that ETr Jupiter transits in a sign the 
lord of which satisfies the necessary conditions. 

B: ETr Jupiter transits in Jupiter Star. 

(1) Jupiter in the natal chart is placed in 2-Maraka 
house. 

(2) Jupiter appears in 2, 7 and 8. 

ETr Jupiter thus satisfies necessary conditions. 
C: ETr Jupiter transits in Mercury Sub. 

(1) Mercury appears in 1, 2, 7 and 8.A11 these cusps 
are relevant for the event of suicide. More over 

(2) Mercury in the natal chart is in Saturn Star who 
appears in 2, 7 and 8. Mercury is in the Sub of Rahu 
who represents Mercury and Moon. Both these 
Planets appear in 1 . 

Thus ETr Jupiter's transit in Mercury Sub satisfies 
all the necessary conditions. 

D: ETr Jupiter transits in Ketu Sub-Sub. Ketu in the 
natal chart represents Jupiter and Saturn. 

(1) Ketu in the natal chart has PS because Ketu is in 
Sat Star and Sat is in Ketu Star. 



702 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



(2) Ketu is placed in 7-Both Maraka and Badhaka 
house. 

(3) Ketu as Jupiter and Saturn appears in 2, 7 and 8. 

Thus ETr Jupiter's transit in Sub-Sub of Ketu 
satisfies the essential condition. 

9. Transit of Bhukti Lord and Prana Lord Mercury 

A: ETr Mercury transits in Sign Libra ruled by Venus. 

We have already discussed in 8 A: (1) that Venus satisfies 
all the necessary conditions. 

B: ETr Mercury transits in Rahu Star. 

(1) Rahu is placed in 1 in the natal chart. 

(2) Rahu represents Mercury in the natal chart. 

(3) Mercury appears in 1, 2, 7 and 8A11 these are 
relevant cusps for the event of suicide. 

Thus ETr Mercury's transit in Rahu Star satisfies all 
necessary conditions. 

C: ETr Mercury transits in Jupiter Sub. 

We have already discussed above in 8 A: (2) that Jupiter 
is placed in 2 and appears in 2, 7 and 8. 

Thus ETr Mercury's transit in Jupiter's Sub satisfies 
necessary conditions. 

D: ETr Mercury Transits in Rahu Sub-Sub. 

We have already discussed in 9 B that ETr Mercury's 
transit in Rahu zone satisfies necessary conditions. 

10. Transit of Sookshama Lord Saturn 

A: ETr Saturn transits in Sign Aquarius ruled by Saturn. 

(1) Sat appears in 2, 7 and 8 in the natal chart. All these 
cusps are relevant cusps for the event. More over 



Transit and its Application 1 03 

(2) Saturn in the natal chart is in Ketu Star. Ketu is 
placed in 7-Maraka and Badhaka house. 

(3) Ketu represents Jupiter and Saturn. Thus Sat in Ketu 
Star is as good as in Jupiter as well as in 
Saturn Star. Both Jupiter and Saturn appear in 2, 7 
and 8. 

We thus conclude that ETr Saturn's transit in 
Aquarius Sign satisfies necessary conditions. 

B: ETr Saturn transits in Rahu Star Sat Sub and Jupiter Sub- 
Sub. 

We have discussed above that Planets Rahu, Sat and 
Jupiter in the Natal chart Satisfies necessary 
conditions to allow the event to happen. 

11. Transit of Sun 

A: ETr Sun transits in Virgo ruled by Mercury. 

(1) Mercury appears in 1,2,7 and 8, all relevant cusps 
for the event. More over 

(2) Mercury in the natal chart is in Sat Star who appears 
in 2, 7 and 8. And Mercury is in the Sub of Rahu 
that represents Mercury and Moon Both these 
Planets appear in 1 , 

Thus we say ETr Sun's transit in Virgo satisfies 
necessary conditions. 

B: ETr Sun transits in Mars Star. 

(1) Mars in the natal chart is in Mercury Star who 
appears in 1, 2, 7 and 8. 

(2) Mars is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 2, 7 
and 8. 

Thus we find that ETr Sun's transit in Mars Star 
satisfies necessary conditions. 



104 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

C: ETr Sun Transits in Sat Sub and Sat Sub-Sub. 

Sat appears in 2, 7 and 8. 

Thus we conclude that the transit of ETr Sun allows 
the event to happen. 

12. Transit of Moon 

Moon transits in Sign Aquarius ruled by Sat in Rahu Star and 
Jupiter Sub and Rahu Sub-Sub. We have discussed above that 
Planets Sat, Rahu, and Jupiter satisfies necessary conditions. 

Conclusion: ETr Dasa period Lords and ETr Sun and ETr 
Moon allow the event to happen. 

Practice Exercise: Lesson 11 

Refer Fig 8.2 of Lesson 8. 

A: The native of this chart got first male child on 26,12.1999 
at 23.45 hrs. He was running at that time Dasa period of 
Mars-Jup-Mars-Jup-Mars. In lesson 8 we have seen that 
this chart promises birth of child. In Lesson 10 we saw 
that Planets Mars and Jupiter which are Dasa period lords 
justify birth of first child. 

B: Fig 11.2 is the event (ETr) chart of birth of first male 
child. Please justify that the transit of Dasa period lords, 
Sun and Moon allows the event to happen.

Lesson 12 
Rahu and Ketu as Dasa Period Lords 



We have studied that Rahu and Ketu act as three Planets. In 
other words we may say that Rahu and Ketu in their dasa periods 
(Dasa or Bhukti or Antara or Sookshma or Prana) offer the results 
as follows: 

Rahu and Ketu as per their PS and Stellar Status. 

Results which Sign lord of Rahu and Ketu has to offer as per 
its PS and Stellar Status. 

Results which Star lord of Rahu and Ketu has to offer as per 
its PS and Stellar Status. 

These results operate simultaneously. Therefore, it is quite 
possible that result for a particular house as offered by Rahu 
and Ketu and their Sign and Star lords may be contradictory 
in nature. 

For example we may find that in a particular chart Rahu as 
Rahu may involve 7th cusp and commit to 6. Sign lord of Rahu 
may involve 7th cusp and commit to 5 and 11. Star lord of Rahu 
may involve 7th cusp and commit to 6 and 11. 

Here we find that Rahu as Rahu does not allow the event of 
marriage. Sign lord of Rahu allows the event of marriage. Star lord 
of Rahu allows the event of marriage as well as promises separation. 

Similar situations may arise in the case of Ketu 

So the question before us is how to decide what results the 
native will enjoy in the period of Rahu and Ketu, especially when 



Rahu and Ketu as Dasa Period Lords 109 



there is contradiction between the results offered by Rahu as Rahu, 
and the results offered by Sign or Star lord of Rahu. The same 
applies for Ketu. 

We have also seen in earlier lessons that Rahu and Ketu 
frequently offer the result of almost all the houses. It is a complex 
problem. Let us try to make it as simple as possible. 

We will take the example of Rahu. We will use the same 
technique for Ketu. 

First check Rahu as Rahu. Then check if the planets 
represented by Rahu contradict Rahu. 

If not proceed as normal. If the planets represented by Rahu 
do contradict, then proceed as follows. 

Note in the following case studies we dissect the dasa periods 
for instructive purposes. In practice we would consider all dasa 
lords in continuing sequence. 

1: Procedure to decide Results that will be offered by Rahu. 

Refer Fig 1 of Lesson 2. Here Rahu is in Virgo Sign ruled by 
Mercury. Rahu is in the Star of Sun. Thus Rahu represents 
Mercury and Sun. 

A Case 1: Dasa Period Rahu-Rahu i.e. Rahu Dasa Rahu 
Bhukti. 

(1) During Rahu Dasa Rahu Bhukti native will enjoy 
the results as per its Antara lord. 

(2) During Rahu Dasa Rahu Bhukti and Antara of Rahu 
the native will enjoy the results which Rahu has to 
offer as Rahu for those houses where there is 
contradiction between Rahu and the Planets Rahu 
represents. 

(3) However during the Sookshma of Mercury the 
native will enjoy the result as offered by Mercury. 



1 10 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

We may say that the native is practically running 
the period of Mer-Mer-Mer-Mer. 

(4) Similarly during the Sookshma of Sun the native 
will enjoy the results which Sun has to offer. We 
may read the Dasa period as Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun. 

Let us see if during Rahu Dasa Rahu Bhukti and Rahu 
Antara native could marry. Rahu is in Sun Star and Venus 
Sub. Sun appears in relevant cusp 7 as Star lord of 7th 
cusp. Sub lord Venus appears in 2 (8th to 7) , and 7. Thus 
we say that possibility of marriage during Rahu Antara 
is remote. 

Can Rahu-Rahu-Mercury give marriage? Now we have 
to read Dasa period as Mer-Mer-Mer. Mercury in this 
chart is in Rahu Star and Jupiter Sub. Rahu appears in 
11 and Jupiter appears in 5 and 7. Mercury is in the SS of 
Rahu that appears in 11. Thus we may say that native 
could marry during this period if marriage is promised 
in the chart. 

During Rahu Dasa Rahu Bhukti and Antara of Planets 
other than Rahu, Sun and Mercury the native will get 
results of those houses which Antara lord signify. 

B Case 2: Rahu as Bhukti Lord in the Dasa of Planets 
that Rahu Represents 

(1) During Sun Dasa Rahu Bhukti native will get the 
results as if he/she is running Sun Dasa Sun Bhukti. 
Remember that Bhukti lord can only provide what 
Dasa lord permits. 

(2) During Mercury Dasa Rahu Bhukti native will get 
the results as if he/she is running Mer Dasa Mercury 
Bhukti. 

C Case 3: Rahu as Bhukti Lord in the Dasa of other 
Planets 



Rahu and Ketu as Dasa Period Lords 111 



(1) Let us take the case of Mars Dasa Rahu Bhukti. 
Mars in this chart has PS. Mars is in Sun Star and 
Mars Sub. During this period native had a break in 
education. 

(2) Break in education takes place during the period of 
Planets that signify 3 and 8. 

(3) Mars is Star lord of 8th cusp and since it has PS it 
will signify 8. Mars is in Sun star who is the Star 
lord of 3rd cusp. Thus Mars signifies 3rd house. 
Mars is in Mars Sub. Thus we see that Mars involves 
3 and commits to 8. 

(4) Rahu as Rahu in this chart signifies 3 but not 8. But 
Rahu as Mercury signifies 3 and 8 because Mercury 
has PS and appears in 3 and 8 . 

(5) Thus we find that Bhukti lord Rahu offers the result 
as per the dictates of Dasa Lord. 

(6) During this period the native also suffered from 
health problems. Mars signifies 6 and 8. However 
Rahu as Rahu does not signify 6 or 8. But Rahu as 
Mercury signifies 1 and 8 and Rahu as Sun signifies 
6. 

We may therefore say that Rahu as Bhukti lord offers 
those results which are in consonance with the Dasa lord. 
Similarly Rahu as Antara Lord provides those results 
which Dasa and Bhukti lord allow. 

D Case 4: Rahu Dasa and Bhukti of Planets other than 
those Planets that Rahu Represents 

(1) Where there is contradiction between the results of 
Rahu as Rahu, OR Rahu as the Planets Rahu 
represents, the Bhukti lord will offer the result 
which is in consonance with the results of Rahu as 
Rahu, OR Rahu as the Planets Rahu represents. 



1 12 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



(2) For example let us say that in a chart Rahu offers 
the following results for house 7. 

a. Rahu as Rahu which does not allow marriage. 

b. Rahu as Sign Lord of Rahu which allows 
Marriage. 

c. Rahu as Star Lord of Rahu which does not 
allow marriage. 

d. In this case if the Bhukti lord allows marriage 
then the marriage will take place. Here we will 
read the Dasa period as Dasa of Sign Lord of 
Rahu. 

Example: Let us try to explain the above concepts through 
an example. Refer Fig 1 of Lesson 2. 

The native lost his mother when he was running Saturn Dasa, 
Ketu Bhukti and Venus Antara. We need to find reasons why 
Ketu Bhukti Ketu Antara did not cause the event of death of 
mother to take place. 

A Operation of Bhukti Lord Ketu: 

Ketu in this chart represents Jupiter and Saturn. 
(1) Ketu as Ketu: 

a. Ketu has PS. It is placed in 4 (Ascendant for 
mother). Thus Ketu signifies Ascendant of 
mother. 

b. Ketu is in the Sub of Venus who does not 
appear in 2, 7 and 8 from 4. It only appears in 
Badhaka house for 4. 

c. Thus Ketu as per PS does not have the 
capability to cause death of mother. 

d. Ketu is in Saturn Star who appears only in 1, 
2 and 7 from 4. Ketu is in the Sub of Venus 



Rahu and Ketu as Dasa Period Lords 113 



who appears in Badhaka house from 4. Thus 
Ketu as Ketu as per Stellar Status also is not a 
strong Planet to cause death of mother. 

We have stated above that Ketu as Bhukti lord in 
its own Antara will offer results which Ketu has to 
offer as Ketu as Ketu. Thus during Ketu Antara the 
event of death of mother did not take place, ie 8th 
house of mother is not involved. Bhukti Lord in its 
own Antara can cause an event only if it is linked 
with all the relevant cusps. 

Note: In this lesson we have stated that we could read Saturn 
Dasa Ketu Bhukti as if it is Saturn Dasa Saturn Bhukti because 
Ketu represents Saturn but only for the results of those houses where 
there is contradiction. Here there is no contradiction as far as the 
8th house from 4 is concerned. Ketu does not signify 8th house. So 
the question of contradiction does not arise. Ketu in Ketu Antara 
will therefore act as Ketu as Ketu. 

(2) Ketu as Saturn: 

a. Saturn is in Venus Star who is placed in 4 
(Ascendant for mother) and Rahu Sub who 
appears in 1 1 (8th from 4) . 

b. Saturn is in the SS of Mercury who appears in 
11 (8th from 4) , and 3 (12 from 4). 

c. Thus we find that Ketu as Saturn Satisfies the 
necessary as well as essential condition to 
cause the event of death. 

(3) Ketu as Jupiter: 

a. Jupiter has PS because it is in Venus Star and 
Venus is in Jupiter Star. 

b. Jupiter appears in 1 1 (8th from 4) Jupiter is in 
the Sub of Saturn that appears in 1,2 and 7 
from 4. 



1 14 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



c. Thus Jupiter involves 8th house from 4 and 
commits to 1 as well as Maraka houses. 

d. Jupiter is in the SS of Saturn that appears in 2 
and 7 from 4. 

e. We say that Ketu as Jupiter also has the 
capability to cause death of mother. 

3: Why Venus Antara caused death of mother? 

A Venus has PS. It is placed in 4 and thus signifies 
Ascendant of mother. 

(1) Venus is in the Sub of Moon that appears in 11 (8th 
from 4) and 3 (12th from 4) .Thus Venus involves 
ascendant of mother and commits to 8th from 
mother's Ascendant. 

(2) Venus is in the SS of Venus that appears in 12 
(Badhaka house for 4). 

(3) Venus thus satisfies the necessary and essential 
conditions to cause the event of death of mother. 
Venus here acts in consonance with the Bhukti Lord 
Ketu as Saturn or as Jupiter. 

Practice Exercise: Lesson 12

Lesson 13 
CIL and Birth Time Rectification 



Philosophy behind Theory of Rectification 

Human birth is said to take place at a particular moment when 
soul takes possession of the body. According to doctrine of 
reincarnation and law of karma this moment occurs when the 
incarnated soul gets the spiritual impulse towards fresh 
experience and unfoldment. In Astrology we say that this 
moment is defined by a particular position of Sun (soul or 
Purusha) and Moon (mind or Prakriti). Purusha and Prakriti 
are concepts of Samkhya Philosophy. 

• At that moment a particular zodiacal position rises in 
the eastern horizon at that place. We call this the 
Ascendant. 

• Corresponding to this Ascendant position using the 
Placidus house system and Khullar Ayanamsa we 
calculate other cuspal positions. 

• The Ascendant and other cuspal positions need to 
correspond with the Karmic code of the incarnating soul. 

• Similarly Planetary positions in the zodiac and in Bhavas 
need to correspond to the Karmic code of the incarnating 
soul 

Each incarnated soul has its own secret. It stands revealed 
only by the minute divisions of the Zodiac that rise on each of 
the twelve cuspal positions and the minute divisions of the 
Zodiac, which influence each planet. The horoscope cast and 



CIL and Birth Time Rectification 119 

analysed on cuspal interlinks basis will simulate and reveal 
conditions to represent the unique life pattern of the individual. 

2. Necessary Conditions for a Correct Ascendant 

• The planets co-ruling the Ascendant should have linkages 
with the houses 1 or 7or 10 i.e. 5 or 1 1 or 2 from the 9th 
cusp, the house that represents the father of the native in 
the horoscope. 

• The Sub-Sub lord of the Ascendant should establish 
relationship with Moon's Star lord. 

(This will be explained in a separate paragraph). 

• The Sub-Sub arc, and the Sub-Sub lord of the Ascendant 
should reveal the sex of the native. 

• The planets co-ruling the Moon's position should be 
linked with the houses 1 or 7 or 10. 

The position of Moon is its transit position at the time of 
birth of the native. Therefore the Moon's Sign lord, Star 
lord, Sub lord, Sub-Sub lord and Sub Sub Sub lord should 
either appear in cusps lor 7 or 10, or be significator of 
these houses in the native's chart. 

The moment at which the event happens, is controlled 
by the Prana lord running at that time. So at the moment 
of birth, the Prana lord should be Significator of 10, 1,7 
houses; (at least two of these houses). Or the Prana lord 
itself should appear in these cusps irrespective of the 
fact that it has the positional status or not. 

3. Philosophy behind fixing the Ascendant: 

• An event happens at a moment when the Ascendant i.e. 
the degree-minute-seconds rising on the Eastern horizon 
at the place of happening is co-ruled by the planets that 
are significators of the cusps that are taking part in the 
event. 



120 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



• The birth of a native means addition to the family of 
father (2nd house) by way of child (5th house) and 
fulfillment of ambition (11th house). 

• Since in the native's chart 9th house represents the 
Ascendant of the father, houses 10, 1,7 will take part in 
enacting the event. 

• Thus all the planets co-ruling the Ascendant should be 
linked to 10 or 1 or 7 through their Star lords or should 
have positional status to become significator of 
Ascendant etc. Since the Sub-Sub lord of the Ascendant 
closely represents the moment of birth, it should be 
significator of invariably all the three houses, but 
certainly be linked with the 10th (i.e. 2nd from 9th) house 
directly i.e Star lord of SSL of Ascendant in 10 or the 
Star lord in 1 or 7 and its Sub lord in 10. 

• If the SSL of the Ascendant has the positional status and 
it appears as Sign or Star or Sub or Sub-Sub lord of the 
10th cusp then also the condition is satisfied. 

4. Conditions for other Cuspal Positions 

A Genetical Connections; By genetical connections we 
mean that the SSLs of relevant cusps that represent the 
native's father, mother, younger and elder co-born, and 
children should establish relationship with the Moon's 
Star lord of respective relation. 

B Promise for various Aspects of Life; We know that each 
house represents specific significations. SSL of each cusp 
should match with the promise of various aspects of 
native's life. 

To conclude we may say that we need to ensure that 
SSLs of all cusps should satisfy above conditions. 



CIL and Birth Time Rectification 121 



C Justification for Past Events: 

(1) Each event happens in the joint period of Planets 
that are fruitful significators of the event. The 
Sookshama and Prana lords should be strongly 
linked with Primary and Supporting cusps. We may 
need to adjust time of birth to match the Dasa period 
lords operating at the time and Date of happening 
of the event. 

(2) The transit position of Planets that take part in 
enacting the event and also the transit of Sun and 
Moon should support the event. This may 
necessitate adjustment of some cuspal positions. 

How SSL of Ascendant Establishes Relationship with 
Moon's Star Lord 

A The S-S lord of the Ascendant itself may be the Moon's 
Star lord. The S-S lord may or may not have positional 
status. 

B The Star lord, the Sub lord or the S-S lord of the S-S lord 
of the Ascendant can be the Star lord of Moon. That is 
the SSL of the Ascendant may be a Planet whose Star 
lord or Sub lord or SS lord is the same planet as the star 
lord of Moon. If Moon comes as the SSLof the Ascendant 
it always establishes relationship. 

C The Star lord of Moon can be in the Star or Sub or S-S 
which may be the S-S lord of the Ascendant. Let us 
explain this with an example: Let X be the Star Lord of 
Moon and Y be the SSL of Ascendant. If X is in the Star 
of Y or Sub of Y or in SS of Y we say that the relationship 
is established. 

D Similarly we need to fix the SSLs of 3rd cusp (immediate 
younger co born, 4th cusp (mother) , 5th cusp (first child) 



722 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

, 7th cusp (first marriage partner) , 9th cusp (father) , 
and 11th cusp (immediate elder co born) to ensure that 
they establish relationship with Moon's Star lord of 
respective relation. 

6 How to fix the Ascendant Sub-Sub for Male and Female 
Horoscope: 

• There is no single fool proof method that can be used. 

• After an in-depth study I have come to the conclusion 
that: 

• The SSL of the SSL of the Ascendant represents the sex 
of the child as per its placement in the male or female 
sign and 

• The SS arc of the Ascendant indicates the sex of the 
child as per its placement in the relevant half. 

However, the application of these concepts demands 
attention to the various possibilities that may occur in 
a chart. 

For example: 

All the Planets in the chart may be in Male or in Female signs. 
OR 

All the Planets are in the Sub-Sub, the lords of which may be 
in male or in female signs only. 

In the above cases the placement of the Sub-Sub arc of the 
Ascendant in the relevant half has to be given preference to 
decide the sex of the child. Placed below is summation of the 
above concepts for Male and Female Horoscope. 

Male Horoscope 

• If the Ascendant rises in Male Sign the SS arc* should be set 
in the first half of the SS arc. 



CIL and Birth Time Rectification 123 



• If the Ascendant rises in the Female sign the SS arc should be 
set in the second half of the SS arc. 

• If in a horoscope all the Planets are in the SS the lords of 
which are in Male signs then the above rules of setting the arc 
may be ignored. In other words arc can be set in first or second 
half. 

• If the SS lord of the chosen SS is in female sign then it is 
essential that the SS arc should be in the first half for Ascendant 
rising in male sign and in second half for Ascendant rising in 
female sign. Suppose SSL of Ascendant's SSL is Jupiter who 
is in female Sign. If Ascendant rises in female Sign then it is 
essential that the SS arc of SSL of Ascendant should be fixed 
in second half. If the Ascendant rises in male Sign then it is 
essential that the SS arc of SSL of Ascendant should be fixed 
in first half. 

Female Horoscope 

• If the Ascendant rises in Female Sign the SS arc* should be 
set in the first half of Sub Sub arc of SSL. 

• If the Ascendant rises in the Male sign the SS arc should be 
set in the second half of Sub Sub arc of SSL. 

• If in a horoscope all the Planets are in the SS the lords of 
which are in female signs then the above rules of setting the 
arc may be ignored. In other words arc can be set in first or 
second half. 

• If the SS lord of the chosen SS is in male sign then it is essential 
that the SS arc should be in the first half for Ascendant rising 
in female sign and in second half for Ascendant rising in male 
sign. Suppose SSL of Ascendant's SSL is Jupiter who is in 
male Sign. If Ascendant rises in female Sign then it is essential 
that the SS arc of SSL of Ascendant should be fixed in first 
half. If the Ascendant rises in male Sign then it is essential 



124 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



that the SS arc of SSL of Ascendant should be fixed in second 
half. 

Note: It is rarely that we take into consideration the principle 
that the SSL of the SSL of the Ascendant represents the sex of 
the child as per its placement in the male or female sign. 
However it comes into play when all Planets in a chart are 
placed in the SS the lords of which are either in the male or 
female signs. 

*Sub-Sub arc is the space allotted to each Sub-Sub in each 
Sub. Refer Appendix C. True Astrology and TP Jyotish 
Softwares have the provision to show the percentage at which 
the SS arc of any cusp is fixed. Zero to 50 percent refers to 
first half and 50 to 100 percent refers to second half. 

From the above it can be concluded that rectification of a 
chart means fixing the correct Ascendant and other cuspal 
positions to satisfy various requirements stated in above 
paragraphs. Corresponding time of birth will set the 
beginning and ending dates of various Dasa periods. 

Practical Approach to Rectification: We will first consider 
rectification of those charts where the client provides the time, 
Date and place of birth. No authenticated data for genetical 
connections or past events is provided. An astrologer should 
consider himself lucky if he is able to get a correct horoscope 
with the given time, Date and place of birth. It is indeed a rare 
occasion. 

Step 1: Cast the horoscope as per given data. 



CIL and Birth Time Rectification 125 



Step 2: Check whether the Planets co ruling the Ascendant 
satisfy the necessary conditions as stated above. 

Step 3: If the conditions are not met we need to adjust the 
horoscope and fix the Sign, Star, Sub and Sub-Sub. For noted 
time of birth we generally expect that the rectified time should 
be within plus-minus 10 minutes. 

Step 4: Choose the Sub and Sub-Sub lords which establishes 
relationship with Moon's Star lord. 

Step 5: Set the SS arc for male and female horoscope as per 
above suggested method. 

Remember that fixing the Ascendant with chosen Planets 
and setting the SS arc in the relevant half can at best 
only gives us an approximately correct horoscope. 
Reasons for that are: 

If you change the percentage of SS arc within the relevant 
half you will notice that SSLs of other cuspal positions 
change. 

You may need to change the Sub or the SSL to ensure 
proper SSLs of other cuspal positions. 

Example 1: Let us try to explain this through an example. 
Following are the birth details of a female. 

Female; DOB: 28 Sep 1934; 1.15pm; BST -1.00; Paris, 
France; 48N 50'40" 002E17'25" 

Step 1: Fig 13.1 is the chart cast as per given data.

Step 2: Mars, Mercury, Moon and Jupiter co-rule the 
Ascendant. These Planets need to signify 1 or 7 or 10. 

Mars is in Mercury Star and Mercury is in Mars Star. 
Thus both Mars and Mercury have PS. 

Mercury is placed in 10 and appears in 1. Only relevant 
cusps are shown. 

Mars appears in 1 (and qualifies by PS). Thus we see 
that Mars and Mercury satisfy necessary condition. 

Moon in this chart has PS . It appears in relevant cusps 1 , 
7 and 10. 

Jupiter has PS and is placed in 10 and appears in L Jupiter 
is in Mars Star and Venus Sub. Mars appears in 1 and 
Venus appears in 7 and 10. Thus Jupiter signifies relevant 
cusps. 

Step 3: Let us check the condition for female horoscope. 

SSL of Ascendant is Jupiter whose SSL is Saturn. 

Saturn is placed in the chart in Capricorn i.e. a female 
sign. 

SS arc of Ascendant is 36.66 percent being in the first 
half (i.e. the position of SSL Jupiter is at 36.66 percent 
of the SSL's arc). We therefore say that it meets all the 
conditions for female horoscope . 

Step 4: Let us now see whether the SSL of Ascendant 
establishes relationship with Moon's Star lord or not. 

Jupiter is in Mars Star, Venus Sub and Sat SS. Thus 
Jupiter is not related to Moon's Star. 

Moon is in Moon Star, Mercury sub and Rahu SS. Rahu 
does not represent Jupiter. Thus Moon is not related to 
Jupiter. Conclusion: Jupiter cannot be the right planet 
to appear as SSL of the Ascendant 



130 



Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Step 5: To choose the right Planet that can be fixed as the 
SSL of Ascendant we need to scrutinize the Planetary Table 
to find out which Planets are related to Moon's Star lord. 

Only Sun, Moon, Rahu, Saturn and Ketu are related to 
Moon. Here Moon's Star lord is Moon. 

Since Rahu SS precedes Jupiter SS (See Vimsottari Dasa 
order on Page 297 of KCIL revised edition) the first 
choice is that we fix Rahu as SS of the Ascendant. We 
also need to set the time so that SS arc is in first half for 
female horoscope. If we set the time of birth as 13.14.07 
hrs we get Rahu as SS of Ascendant and SS arc of Rahu 
is 25 percent. 

The cuspal positions for this time of birth are shown in 
Fig 13.2.

This is the first possibility of an approximately correct 
Horoscope for the given data. Other possibilities are 
keeping the SS of Ascendant as Moon, Ketu, Sat or Sun. 

Step 6: We now have to check whether Rahu satisfies the 
other condition that it should signify 1, 7 and 10. 

In this chart Rahu represents Moon as its Star lord. We 
have seen above that Moon signifies 1, 7 and 10. 

Thus we say that Rahu satisfies all conditions. 

Step7: We now check whether Moon's position at birth 
satisfies necessary conditions. At the time of birth Moon 
transits in Venus Sign, Moon Star, Mercury Sub and Rahu 
SS. These Planets should either appear in 1 or 7 or 10 or be 
significators of these cusps in the chart. 

We find Venus appears in 7, Moon appears in 1, 7 and 
10. Mercury appears in 1,7 and 10 and Rahu appears in 
1. 

Rahu in the chart represents Moon who appears in 1 , 7 
and 10. 

Thus Moon's position at the time of birth satisfies 
necessary conditions. 

Note: If we compare the cuspal positions of Fig 13.1 and 
Fig 13.2 we notice that the SSLs of certain cusps have changed. 
For an accurate horoscope the SSLs of various cuspal positions 
need to satisfy genetical connections, and also promise of various 
cusps. We can vary the time of birth from 13.13.55 to 13.14.20 
hrs so that the SS arc of Rahu remains between to 50 percent. 

The exact time of birth thus can be fixed only if we know 
details about genetical connections or some past events. 



132 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

Example 2: How to fix correct chart when data is provided. 

In example 1 we have seen that we can at best only construct an 
approximately correct chart if no data for genetical connections or 
past events is provided. Now if the following data is provided for 
the above example let us see how we can fix the correct horoscope. 

A. Data for Genetical Connections 

Birth of Father: 8 May 1896 
Birth of Mother: 1 Feb 1912 
Birth of Younger Sister: 5 May 1938 

B. Data for Significant Events 

10 Jun 2004 Conviction and fine 

5 Nov 1975 Death of Father 
1 Aug 1978 Death of Mother 
21 Dec 1952 First Marriage 

6 Dec 1957 Divorced 

C. Procedure to Fix the Horoscope for Genetical 
Connections 

Step 1: Find the Moon's Star lords of Father, Mother 
and younger sister. 

Those who have True Astrology software they may 
use the facility of Transit. Those who have other 
Software may do this with the help of Ephemeris. 
Look for the Moon position for the date of birth of 
Father, Mother and younger sister. 

Moon Star of Father: Rahu or Jupiter 

Moon Star of Mother: Jupiter or Saturn 

Moon Star of younger sister: Jupiter or Saturn 



CIL and Birth Time Rectification 133 



Step 2: Check the SSLs of 3rd for younger sister, 4th for 
mother and 9th for father. These SSLs have to establish 
relationship with Moons Star lords of respective relations . 

Keeping the SS arc of Ascendant at 25 percent we 
find that SSL of 3rd cusp is Saturn, 4th cusp SSL is 
Jupiter and 9th cusp SSL is Rahu. It appears that 
the chart establishes genetical connections. 

The Moon Star of younger sister born on 05.05.193 8 
could be either Jupiter or Saturn. Now SSL of 3rd 
cusp is Saturn. Also in the chart Jupiter is in the SS 
of Sat. Thus we say SSL of 3rd cusp establishes 
relationship with Moon's Star of younger sister. 

Moon Star of Mother is Jupiter (born on 
01.02.1912). 4th SSL is Jupiter. Thus we say that 
the SSL of 4th cusp establishes relationship with 
the Moon's Star of Mother 

Father's Moon Star could be Jupiter or Saturn (born 
on 08.05.1896). 9th SSL is Rahu.lt is as good as 
saying that SSL of 9th cusp is Saturn. Since Jupiter 
is in the SS of Saturn we can say that 9th SSL 
establishes relationship with father's Moon Star. 

Step 3: It is indicated that the younger co born is female. 
This requires that the SS arc of the 3rd cusp should be 
set in the second half as male sign rises on the 3rd cusp. 
We notice that with time of birth 13.14.07 hrs the SS arc 
of 3rd cusp is about 76 percent. 

From above it appears that the above time of birth 
should give us a correct horoscope 



134 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

D. Setting Chart for Promise of Various Aspects of Life 

Promise of Marriage: 

Ascendant SSL is Rahu who has PS and appears in 11. 
Rahu is in Moon Star who appears in 7. Thus we can say 
that Ascendant promises marriage. 

SSL of 7th cusp is Mercury who has PS because Mercury 
is in Mars Star and Mars is in Mercury Star. Thus Mercury 
signifies 7. 

Mercury is in Mars Star that appears in 5. Mercury is in 
the Sub of Venus that appears in relevant cusps 7 and 11. 

We therefore conclude that the native is promised 
marriage. 

Promise of Divorce: 

SSL of Ascendant is Rahu who is in Moon Star. Moon 
appears in 7 . 

Rahu is in the Sub of Jupiter that does not appear in any 
relevant cusp for marriage or divorce. 

Rahu represents Moon. Moon is in Moon Star (7) and 
Mercury Sub. Mercury appears in 7 (marriage) and also 
in 6 and 12 (separation). 

SSL of 7th cusp is Mercury who has PS. Mercury is in 
the Sub of Venus who appears in 7 anil (marriage) and 
also in 6 (separation). 

Mercury is in Mars Star who appears in 5 (relevant for 
marriage) and 12 (relevant for separation). Separation is 
supported by Venus the Sub of Mercury which appears 
in 6. 

E. Promise for Loss of Reputation: 

Ascendant indicates Status and 12th cusp indicates loss 
of Status or reputation and imprisonment. 8th cusp 



CIL and Birth Time Rectification 



135 



indicates punishment. 

SSL of 8th cusp is Jupiter with the time of birth as 
13.14.07. Jupiter has PS and thus signifies 8. Jupiter is 
in Mars Star who appears in 1 (reputation). Jupiter is in 
the Sub of Venus that does not appear in 12 (loss of 
reputation). 

This means that Jupiter can not be right SSL of the 8th 
cusp. If we change the time to 13.14.10 we get Saturn as 
the SSL of the 8th cusp. 

Saturn is in Mars Star who appears in 1. Saturn is in the 
Sub of Saturn who appears in 8 and 12. Thus we see that 
Sat SSL of the 8th cusp promises loss of reputation. 

Fig 13.3 indicates the cuspal positions for time of birth 
13.14.10.

We may say that this time of birth should be the correct 
time of birth. Wait and have patience. 

F. Procedure to fix horoscope to Match Dasa Potential 
for Specific Events 

Marriage: On 21.12.1952 the native was running the 
Dasa period of Rahu-Mercury-Mercury-Venus-Rahu. 
With time of birth as 13.14.10 Rahu Prana lasts till about 
19.30 hrs. This Prana lord does not have the capability 
to enact marriage. 

Rahu as Rahu: Rahu is in Moon Star who appears in 
Primary cusp 7. Rahu is in Sub of Jupiter who does not 
appear in 5 or 11. Rahu as Rahu does not allow marriage 
to take place. 

Rahu as Moon: Moon is in Moon Star and Mercury 
Sub. Mercury appears in 6 and 12 and also in 7. Rahu as 
Moon also does not allow marriage. 

Rahu as Saturn: Saturn is in Mars Star and Saturn Sub. 
Mars appears in 5 but Saturn does not appear in 7. Rahu 
as Saturn also does not allow marriage. 

Marriage should have taken place in Jupiter Prana 
because Jupiter is in Mars Star and Venus Sub. Mars 
appears in 5 and Venus appears in 7 and 1 1 . 

We, therefore, need to adjust time of birth so as to ensure 
that Jupiter Prana begins around 12 hrs on 21.12.1952. 
We get this condition if we fix the time as 13.14.17. 

The Sub -Sub Lords of all cusps at this time remain the 
same as in Fig 13.3. 

Death of Father: Native's father died on 05,11,1975 
when she was running the Dasa period of Jup-Mars-Jup- 
Ven-Ven. 



CIL and Birth Time Rectification 137 



Death of Mother: Native's mother died on 01.08.1978 
when she was running Dasa period of Jup-Rahu-Moon- 
Moon-Mars/Rahu, 

In Lesson 10 we discussed how to verify the event of 
death. Considering Fig 1 3. 3 for Cuspal Positions and 
Fig 13.1 for Bhava Chart, please verify and satisfy 
yourself that the death of parents are justified by Dasa 
Period Lords.

Lesson 14 
Timing Future Events 

1 . In earlier Lessons we have discussed how to 

• Check the promise of a particular aspect 

• Decide the houses that will take part in enacting an event 
using the Primary and Supporting Cusps Tables. 

• Verify the correctness of chart by genetical connections 
and Dasa potential for various past events. 

Let us now discuss how to make predictions from an ac- 
curate horoscope for various events that are likely to hap- 
pen in future in the life of a native. 

2. Philosophy of Timing Events: 

It is said, "A promised event happens in the joint period of 
Planets that are fruitful significators of those cusps that 
take part in enacting an event provided transit agrees". 

However, the clause "in the joint period of Planets that are 
fruitful significators of those cusps that take part in enacting 
an event", is not the whole story. We also need to take into 
account, the significance of Vimsottari Dasa principles, and 
assessment of time when a particular promised event can 
happen in the life of a native. 

3. Salient Features of Vimsottari Dasa System: 

• In Vimsottari Dasa system there is always a specific Dasa 
period that runs at a specific date and time in the life of 
a native. This Dasa period is defined as Dasa Lord - 



140 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Bhukti Lord - Antara Lord -Sookshama Lord - Prana 
Lord. 

Vimsottari Dasa is sequential in nature. This sequential 
nature has a hidden meaning that each succeeding period 
can only enact an event if it's preceding Dasa period 
Lord permits that event. The word "permit" here is used 
as an opposite of the word "deny". Let us try to explain 
it through an example. 

Suppose in a horoscope Dasa Lord involves the 7th house 
(either by PS or through Star Lord) , and commits to 6th 
cusp through Sub lord without simultaneously 
committing to 5 or 11. Then this Dasa lord denies 
marriage to the native during its period. Any Bhukti Lord 
who may be a strong fruitful significator of 7th cusp, 
will not be able to cause the event of marriage. However 
if Dasa Lord does not deny the event of marriage, but is 
linked with 3 or 5 or 9 or 11, it can allow the Bhukti lord 
to enact marriage if it is a fruitful significator of 7th cusp. 

There is another fundamental concept of Vimsottari Dasa 
System which bears a close relationship with timing of 
events. Dasa period calculation is based on the 
progression of Moon from one Nakshatra (Star) to 
another succeeding Nakshatra (Star). 

Moon's Star Lord at the time of birth is the Dasa Lord at 
the time of birth. Moon's Sub lord is the Bhukti Lord, 
and Moon's SS Lord is the Antara Lord etc. 

We know that the space allotted to each Star is 13°20'. 
But the progression speed of Moon in each Star is 
controlled by the Star Lord. Each Star Lord is allotted 
different number of years in Vimsottari Dasa System. 

Suppose a person is born in the beginning of Rahu Dasa. 
After 18 years he will run Jupiter Dasa. Suppose in the

chart of the native Jupiter does not permit marriage. It 
would mean that native can't marry till 34 years. This 
should correspond to the promise of delayed marriage 
in the horoscope. Thus the sequential order of Dasa lord 
bears a close relationship with the destiny of the native. 

The sequential nature of Vimsottari Dasa System also 
bears a close relationship with the nature of event and 
its frequency. For example marriage, child birth, purchase 
of property etc will happen only in specific Bhukti that 
is linked to the Primary cusp directly or indirectly. It 
goes without saying that Dasa lord should permit the 
event. 

A promised event happens as per assessment of time span 
from the significations of the SSL of the Primary cusp 
for that event. The above statement does not specify this. 
For example death of native happens only in a particular 
Dasa the lord of which satisfies necessary and essential 
conditions. Now there can be more than one Planet in 
the chart that may satisfy the necessary and essential 
conditions for causing death of the native. Which one 
the Astrologer has to pick depends upon the assessment 
of life span of the native calculated from the significations 
of SSLs of 1, 3 and 8. Same is the case for other 
significant events. 

It may, however, be remembered that calculation of life 
span of relatives from the natives chart may lead to wrong 
assessment. SSLs of 1, 3 and 8 from the concerned 
relative's Ascendant may not be the real SSLs of 1, 3 
and 8 in the relative's own horoscope. In simple words 
predicting death of relatives is not possible simply on 
the basis of above statement. We need to use some other 
techniques to answer such questions about relatives.

4. Timing Future Events: 

Timing events looks simple, but it is not. It comes with 
experience. It depends upon the Astrologer's power of 
comprehension and analytical capability. Some believe, it 
depends upon the intuitive power of the Astrologer. 

Once a student of Astrology went to an experienced 
Astrologer to learn the intricacies of timing events. He said 
to the Astrologer, "Sir, this is the chart of a beautiful lady 
who got married in the joint period of Saturn- Jupiter- 
Rahu. Why did she not get married in the period of Saturn- 
Rahu- Jupiter?" Sudden came the reply from that 
experienced Astrologer, "Did she go to the Astrologer at 
that time?" The student was equally sharp. He said, "Sir, 
I was told that the marriages are arranged in Heaven." 

A genuine student of Astrology has the right to know the 
reasons for such problems. 

5. Scientific and Rational Approach for Timing Events: The 

following steps need to be followed in timing an event: 

Step 1. Decide the houses that are needed to enact an event. 
You may use the Primary and Supporting Cusps Tables. 

Step 2. Check the promise of the event from the Sub-Sub lord 
of the Ascendant and Sub Sub Lord of the Primary Cusp. 

Step 3. If the event is promised, assess the time period in 
which the event may happen. Early or delayed happening of 
the event is judged from the SSL of the Primary cusp. If the 
SSL of the Primary cusp is linked with favourable as well as 
unfavourable houses, the event is promised to happen late. 
For example if the SSL of the 7th cusp signifies 5 or 7 or 11, 
and also 2 or 4 or 6 or 10, then the marriage is promised late. 
In another way if the SSL of 7th cusp involves 7 through PS 
or Star and commits to 5 or 1 1, and also commits to 2 or 4 or 
6 or 10 it promises delayed marriage. 



Timing Future Events 143 



Step 4. Having assessed the approximate time period, we have 
to select the Dasa periods according to the nature of the event, 
and Dasa potential of the period lords that are favourable for 
the particular event. For this you may use the following general 
guide lines; 

• Events, which do not happen so often, have to be 
predicted as per Dasa lord Signification. For example, 
death of an individual will happen only in a specific Dasa. 

For most of the people even purchase of a house may 
also be an event, which may not repeat itself in the life 
of the native. So Dasa potential has to be favourable for 
such events. 

• For matters that may repeat but not too often, Bhukti 
plays the most Significant role. For example, marriage 
will take place only in a specific Bhukti that is strongly 
connected with 7th cusp. The Dasa lord may be neutral 
or favourable for the event but should not disallow the 
event. 

• For matters of common or repetitive nature, we have to 
concentrate on Antara, Sookshma and Prana lords. 
However, the Bhukti should not specifically deny these 
events 

Note 1: It should be kept in mind that there is no negation 
at the Star level. Suppose in a chart a Planet say Sun 
signifies houses 2 and 7 either by PS or by Stellar Status. 
It means that the Planet is capable to provide results of 2 
as well as 7. Since 2 is 8 to 7 it should not be thought of not 
allowing marriage. However if the Sub Lord of Sun 
appears in 2 then we may say that the Planet Sun is 
favourable for 2nd house significations but can't allow 
marriage to take place during its Dasa period. And yet if 
the Sub Lord of Sun also appears in 5 or 11 along with its 



144 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



appearance in 2 then Sun can allow marriage but with 
some problem say delay or marital discord. 

Note 2: It may be remembered that each selected period 
Lord's SSL should appear at least in one of the relevant 
cusps to ensure the enactment of the event in the end. SSL 
of the selected period Lord may be appearing in other 
cuspal positions which may be unfavourable. This is real 
life situation because the selected Planet can cause many 
other events for which those cuspal positions of SSL may 
be favourable. 

Step 5. Having fixed the Dasa, Bhukti and Antara periods, 
we should fix the Sookshma and Prana. This is done by taking 
into consideration the transit of Dasa, Bhukti, Antara lords, 
Sun and Moon. 

Transit of period lords should be examined as discussed in 
Lesson 11. 

It may be remembered that Selection of Sookshama and Prana 
Lords largely depends upon the following: 

• Sun should transit in a Sign and Star that allows the event 
to happen. We know that Sun transits in a Sign 
approximately for 30 days and in a Star approximately 
for 13 days. Fixing the transit of Sun in relevant Sign 
and Star allows us to say that the event will happen during 
these 13 days. 

• Select the Sookshama Lord that strongly indicates the 
happening of the event that will operate during these 13 
days. 

• Select the Prana Lord in the selected Sookshama Lord 
that strongly indicates the happening of the event. 



Timing Future Events 145 



• During the selected Sookshama Lord and Prana Lord, 
Sun will be transiting in a particular Sub. This Sub Lord 
should support the happening of the event. If not move 
to another position of Sun and or Prana Lord. 

• After fixing the Sub Lord of Sun and Prana Lord, look 
for the right position of Moon in a particular Sign, Star, 
Sub and Sub Sub. 

• Corresponding to this position of Moon and §un and 
Dasa period, a particular Ascendant will be risingrat the 
place of happening of the Event. 

• Adjust the position of Ascendant of Event Chart so that 
Planets that co rule the Ascendant of the Event Chart are 
those Planets which in the Natal chart signify relevant 
cusps that take part in enacting the event. 

Ruling Planets and Selection of Dasa Period Lords 

It is believed that the ruling planets at the moment of judgment 
are the ruling planets at the fructification of the event in past 
or future. Astrologers make use of this dictum to select the 
Dasa period for predicting future events. 

The Ruling Planets at the time of judgment are defined as 
follows; 

• RP (Ascendant); Planets that co rule the Ascendant 
at the time and place of judgment. 

• RP (Moon): Planets that co rule the position of Moon 
at the time and place of judgment. 

Planets that co rule RP (Ascendant) are used for the 
selection of Dasa Period Lords and Planets that co rule 
RP (MOON) are use&tofixthe Ascendant of Event Chart. 



146 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Use of ruling Planets theory for the selection of Dasa 
Period lords and fixing Ascendant of Event Chart does 
not allow an astrologer to sacrifice any step that has been 
stated in Para 5 above. It is to be used as a confirmatory 
test. 

Dasa period lords selected as per Para 5 above should be 
compared with the RP (Ascendant) Planets. If they match, 
it confirms that the event will most probably happen as 
predicted. If any Planet that appears in the selected Dasa 
Period does not appear in the RP (Ascendant) then it 
should qualify to be a RP. 

A Planet is said to qualify to be ruling Planet, if in the 
Natal Chart it is in the Star or Sub or Sub Sub of any 
Planet who is a RP. For example let us say that for a 
particular event the Astrologer has selected Mars as 
Antara Lord, but Mars does not appear as one of the 
Planets that co rule RP (Ascendant) at the time of 
judgment. Then if Mars in the Natal Chart is in the Star, 
or Sub, or Sub Sub, of any Planet that appears in RP 
(Ascendant) then it qualifies to be a RP. 

If the selected Dasa period, say Mars, in the above 
example does not qualifies to be a ruling planet then the 
event may not happen during Antara of Mars. The 
astrologer may then try to select another Antara lord.

Example of Prediction. 

I will explain the application of the above principles through 
an example. We may remember that the correctness of 
prediction depends on the level attained by the astrologer in 
the application of the concepts of SS and CIL Theory. Some 
of my senior students have been able to make some wonderful 
predictions. I am placing one such case which clearly 
establishes the validity of above principles. 

• A lady was pregnant and expected to deliver her first 
child by 20 Sept 2004. This date was given to the lady 
by her Doctor. The lady approached Mr. R.S.Chani one 
of my senior students. She wanted to know the date of 
actual delivery on the basis of her natal chart analysis. 
Mr. Chani told the Lady that you will deliver the child 
only on 23.09.2004 at 10.30 hrs. The Lady delivered the 
child as predicted on 23.09.2004 at 10.30.38 hrs. 

Let us see how this Astrologer could give such an 
accurate prediction based on SS and CIL theory. Birth 
Data of the Lady is given below: 

D.O.B: 5 Oct 1978 Rectified T.O.B: 13.49.04 hrs. P.O.B: 
Delhi, India (Long 77E15; Lat 28N30'48"). 

Fig 14.1 is the rectified chart of the Lady.

Promise of Child Birth: 

• SSL of the 5th cusp is Rahu who has no PS. Rahu is in Sun 
Star who does not appear in 2 or 5 or 11. However Rahu 
represents Mercury and Sun. Mercury has PS and is the SSL 
of the 11th cusp. Thus Mercury signifies 11. 

• Mercury is in the Sub of Venus that appears in 5 (relevant 
cusps) but also in 4. Mercury is in the Star of Moon that appears 
in 2 and 5 . 

The appearance of Mercury's Sub lord in 4 gave a hint to the 
Astrologer that there could have been some delay or 
miscarriage or abortion. The Lady confirmed that she had a 
miscarriage. 

• Rahu as Sun also promises birth of child because Sun is in 
Moon Star (2 and 5) and in the Sub of Mercury who appears 
in 11. 

Fixing Date of Delivery: 

• Mr. Chani noted that on 20 Sept 2004 the native will be running 
the Dasa period of Saturn-Jupiter-Saturn-Mercury-Mercury. 
The Prana lord Mercury will last up to 20.51 hrs of 22 Sept 
2004. 

• The Sookshama Lord Mercury as stated above signifies 2, 5 
and 11, but since Mercury is in the SS of Jupiter who does not 
appear in 2 or 5 or 1 1 , Mercury Sookshama in its own Prana 
can not cause the delivery of the child. 

• The selection of Prana Lord in this case has to be fixed by 
taking in to consideration the transit of Sun and Moon, and 
also to ensure that the Prana Lord should be significator of 2, 
5 and 11. 

• Next Prana is of Ketu who is in Jupiter Star. Jupiter appears 
in 3 and 12. So the Lady moves to the hospital. 



1 52 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



• Ketu as Jupiter signifies 2 and 11 as Jupiter's Star Lord Saturn 
appears in 2 and 11. Jupiter is in the Sub of Moon that appears 
in 2 & 5. And Jupiter is in Sub Sub of Sat who appears in 2 & 
11. 

• Thus Ketu as Jupiter will cause the birth of the child. 

Fixing Time of Delivery: 

• Time of delivery has to be fixed taking into consideration the 
transit of Sun and Moon. 

• The Astrologer noted that the transit of Sun in Mercury Sign 
Sun Star Mercury Sub and Jupiter SS during the period of 
Prana Lord Ketu favours the event, but the transit of Moon in 
Venus Star is not acceptable. 

• Venus in the native's chart does not signify 2 or 5 or 11. Venus 
is in Jupiter Star. Jupiter does not appear in 2 or 5 or 11. 

Moon on 23 Sept 2004 enters in Sun Star at about 09.47 hrs at 
the expected place of delivery (Noida, UP, India). 

• Next the Astrologer checked that when Moon enters Sun Star 
at that time the Ascendant at the place of delivery should rise 
in a Sign the Lord of which should signify 2 or 5 or 11 in the 
native's chart. 

• The Astrologer found that till 10.19 hrs the Ascendant will be 
Libra ruled by Venus who does not signify 2 or 5 or 11. 

• The lady, therefore can deliver only after 10.19 hrs when 
Scorpio Ascendant rises at the place of delivery. 

• In Scorpio Ascendant, and in Star of Jupiter, only three Sub 
lords Moon, Mars and Rahu occur. 

• Moon Sub gets eliminated because it is not a fruitful 
significator of 2, 5 and 11. Mars looks to signify 2, 5 and 11, 
but its Sub lord Venus appears in both favourable and 
unfavourable positions with respect to 5th house. 



Timing Future Events 



153 



The Astrologer fixed Rahu as the Sub Lord of the Ascendant 
at which time the delivery will take place i.e. between 10. 27 
hrs and at 10.35 hrs. 

Another reason for choosing Rahu as Sub lord rather than 
Mars was based on the fact that Astrologer was sure that the 
lady will deliver through a surgical operation. If we see Fig 
14.1 we notice that SSL of 8th cusp is Rahu that represents 
Mercury. Here in this chart Mercury involves 5 and 2 and 
commits to 5 and 11. Mars does not appear in 8 (source- 
surgery). 

Selection of SSL of Ascendant in the Sub of Rahu is done to 
ensure that the SSL of Ascendant should maintain relationship 
with Moon's Star lord in the Event Chart. 

Fig 14.2 shows the planetary positions 
at 10.27 hrs on 23 Sept 2004.

Figl4.2 



154 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



It can be seen from Fig 14.2 that Rahu as Rahu does not 
establish relationship with Moon's Star lord Sun. Next SSLs Jupiter 
and also Mercury, establish relationship with Sun. Since Jupiter 
has appeared as Star Lord of Ascendant the Astrologer chose 
Mercury as the SS of Ascendant and declared that the lady would 
deliver between 10.30 and 1031*22 hrs. The delivery was recorded 
as happening at 10.30.30 hrs. 

The formation of the Ascendant of the child is based on the 
following conditions: 

• The Planets co ruling the Ascendant should signify 2 or 5 or 
11 in the mother's as well as the father's chart. (Remember 5 
is for the first child. The second would be 7, the third 9 and so 
on). 

• The Ascendant of the child is formed as per the Karmic code 
of the child. 

• The Planets co ruling the Ascendant of the child should be 
significator of 1 or 7 or 10 in the child's chart. 

• Fig 14.3 is the chart of child. It can be seen that Rahu Sub 
Lord and Mercury SSL are linked with 1, 7 and 10 in the 
chart.

1 62 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



Accuracy of Ascendant 

The Planets Jupiter and Venus co rule the Ascendant. Jupiter 
has PS and as such signifies Ascendant. Similarly Venus has PS 
because it is in its own Star. Venus is in the Sub of Rahu. Rahu is 
the Star lord of 7th cusp. Rahu represents Saturn as Sign Lord. 
Saturn appears in 10 as Sub Lord. Thus Venus is linked with 1, 7 
and 10. 

Venus is the SSL of Ascendant and Venus is the Moon's Star 
Lord. 

The SS arc of SSL Venus is in the first half. Since Male Sign 
rises on the Ascendant this satisfies the condition for the sex of the 
native. 

Thus we find that Ascendant satisfies the necessary conditions. 

Genetical Connection 

The native got first male child when Moon was transiting in 
Ketu Star. The SSL of the 5th cusp is Mercury who is in Ketu Star. 

Sex of the First Child 

5th cusp rises in male sign Aries. The SS arc of SSL of 5th 
cusp is in first half. This confirms the sex of the first child. 

Death of Mother 

The native lost his mother on 19/20 Aug 1988 when he was 
running the Dasa period of Mars-Rahu-Ketu-Jup-Ven. 

Operation of Dasa Lord Mars 

Dasa Lord Mars has PS . It appears in 5 (Maraka for mother) 
and 10 (Maraka and Badhaka for Mother). Mars is in Jupiter Sub 



Case Studies 163 



that appears in 4 (Ascendant of mother) and 1 1 (8th from 4) . 

Dasa Lord Mars is in Saturn Star and Jupiter Sub. Saturn 
appears in 4 and Jupiter appears in 4 and 1 1 .Thus Mars involves 
Mother's Ascendant and commits to 8th cusp. 

Mars is in the Sub-Sub of Venus who appears in 5 (Maraka) 
and 11 (8th from mother's Ascendant). 

Thus we find that Dasa Lord Mars satisfies the necessary and 
essential conditions to cause death of mother. 

Operation of Bhukti Lord Rahu 

We know that any Planet in Rahu Star is as good as in the Star 
of the Planet which Rahu represents. Thus Rahu is as good as in 
Saturn Star who appears in 4 (Ascdt for mother), and 10 which is 
both Maraka and Badhaka for Mother. Rahu is in the Sub of Venus 
who appears in 11 (8th from 4). Thus Rahu satisfies the necessary 
condition. 

Rahu is in the SS of Saturn who appears in 3 (12th to 4) and 
10 (Maraka and Badhaka for mother). 

Rahu in this chart represents Saturn as Sign Lord. Saturn is in 
Sun Star and Venus Sub. 

Sun appears in 4 (Ascendant of mother) and Venus appears in 
5 (Maraka for mother) and 11 (8th from mother's Ascendant). Thus 
Rahu as Saturn satisfies the necessary condition. 

Saturn is in the SS of Rahu. We may say that Saturn is in the 
SS of Saturn who appears in 10 (both Maraka and Badhaka for 
mother). 

The Bhukti lord Rahu as Saturn satisfies the necessary and 
essential conditions for causing the death of mother. 

Thus we find that Rahu as Rahu and Rahu as Saturn satisfies 
the necessary and essential conditions for causing death of mother. 



764 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Operation of Antara Lord Ketu 

Ketu in this chart represents Sun as Sign Lord and Venus as 
Star Lord. 

Venus is in Venus Star and Rahu Sub. Since Rahu represents 
Saturn we can say that Venus is in Venus Star and Saturn Sub. 
Venus appears in 5 (Maraka for mother) and 11 (8th from mother's 
Ascendant) .Saturn appears in 4 (Ascendant for mother), 10 Maraka 
and Badhaka for mother. Thus Ketu as Venus satisfies the necessary 
condition. 

Venus is in the SS of Jupiter who appears in 1 1 (8th fom 
mother's Ascendant). Thus Ketu as Venus satisfies the essential 
condition also for causing death to mother. 

Operation of Sookshama Lord Jupiter 

Jupiter is in Mercury Star and Venus Sub. Mercury appears in 
1,2, and 7 from 4. Jupiter's Sub Lord Venus appears in 2 and 8 
from 4.Thus Jupiter satisfies the necessary condition. 
Jupiter is in the SS of Sun who appears in 7 (both Maraka 
and Badhaka for mother) from 4. Thus Jupiter satisfies the 
essential condition also. 

Operation of Prana Lord Venus 

We have already discussed above. 

We, therefore conclude that Dasa potential at the time of death 
of mother justifies the correctness of horoscope. 

Marriage of the Native 

Native married on 20 June 1980 when he was running the 
period of Moon-Rahu-Mars- Venus-Mars. 



Case Studies 165 



Operation of Dasa Lord Moon 

Moon has PS and it is the SSL of 7th cusp. Thus Moon signifies 
7Moon is in the Sub and Sub-Sub of Venus who appears in relevant 
cusps 5 and 1 L No doubt Venus appears in 6 and 1 2 also . This does 
not prevent marriage but shows possible marital discord. 

Operation of Bhukti Lord Rahu 

Rahu is in Rahu Star who appears as Star lord of 7. Rahu is in 
Venus Sub who appears in relevant cusps 5 and 11. Since Venus 
also appears in 6 and 12 Bhukti lord also shows possible marital 
discord. 

Operation of Antara and Sookshama Lord Mars 

Mars has PS . It is placed in 7 and appears in relevant cusp 5 . 
Mars is in the Sub of Jupiter that appears in relevant cusp 1 1 . 

Operation of Sookshama Lord Venus 

Venus is in Venus Star and Rahu Sub. Venus appears in relevant 
cusps 5 and 11 and Rahu appears in Primary cusp 7. 

Thus we find that Dasa potential at the time of marriage 
justifies the accuracy of the chart. 

Birth of Male Child 

The native got his first child on 19 Aug 1982 when he was 
running the period of Moon-Sat- Ven-Mer-Jup. 

Let us first check whether the chart promises that the native 
has the procreative power or not. 

SSL of the 5th cusp is Mercury. Mercury is in Ketu Star. In 
this chart, Ketu represents Sun and Venus. So Mercury will be 



166 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

considered in Sun Star. Sun is the SSL of 2nd cusp. Mercury is in 
Mercury Sub who appears both in 2 and 5. Thus we say that the 
native has the power to produce the child. 

A person gets the first child during the joint period of the 
Planets that are linked with 2, 5 and 11. 

Dasa lord Moon has PS and is the Star lord of 2nd cusp. Thus 
Moon signifies 2nd house. Moon is in the Star of Venus and Sub of 
Venus who appears in 5 and 11, Thus Dasa lord is linked with 2, 5 
and 11. 

Bhukti lord Saturn is in Sun Star who appears in 2. Saturn is 
in the Sub of Venus who appears in 5 and 11. 

Antara Lord Venus is in Venus Star who appears in 5 and 
11. Venus is in Rahu Sub. Rahu represents Sat who appears in 2. 

Venus is in the SS of Jupiter who appears in 11. 

Sookshama Lord Mercury is in Ketu Star and Mercury Sub. 
Ketu appears in 5 and Mercury appears both in 2 and 5 . 

Prana Lord Jupiter is in Mercury Star. Mercury appears in 2 
and 5 Jupiter is in the Sub of Venus who appears in 5 and 11. 

Thus we find that Dasa potential at the time of birth of first 
child justifies the accuracy of the chart. 

Death of Father and Native on 30 Jan 2004 

Fig CS1 is the chart of the native who on 30.01.2004 lost his 
father around 15.45 hrs. The native himself died on the same date 
around 18.50 hrs. Fig CS2 is the Death Time chart for Father and 
Fig CS3 is the Death Time chart for the native. Father and the 
native died at different locations but in the same city. Death of 
father took place in Rajinder Nagar, Delhi (Long 77E11 1 , Lat 
28N39') . Death of Native took place in ShalimarBagh, Delhi (Long 
77E9',Lat28N43').

Case Studies 173 



On 30.01.2004 the native was running the Dasa period of 
Rahu-Mercury-Rahu-Sat- Venus covering the period of two death 
events. 

Death of Father: 

Dasa Lord Rahu is in Rahu Star. Since Rahu represents Saturn 
we may say that Rahu is as good as in Saturn Star. Now Saturn 
appears in 1 and 8 from 9th (Ascendant for Father) .Rahu is in the 
Sub of Venus who appears in 9th cusp. Thus Rahu as Rahu satisfies 
the necessary condition for causing death of father. 

Rahu is in the SS of Saturn who appears in 8th house from 
9th. Thus Rahu satisfies the essential condition also. 

Dasa lord Rahu also represents Saturn being placed in Saturn's 
Sign. Thus Rahu will also offer the results which Saturn has to 
offer to the native. 

Now Saturn is in the Star of Sun who is the SSL of 4th cusp 
(i.e. 8th from 9th cusp).Saturn is in the Sub of Venus who is the 
Star lord of 9th cusp. Thus Saturn involves the 8th cusp from 9 and 
commits to Ascdt. 

This is the necessary condition for the Dasa lord to cause for 
the death of the person. 

Saturn is in the SS of Rahu that represents Saturn. Thus the 
SSL of Dasa Lord gets linked to 8, 2, 7 houses from 9. 

Similarly we can verify that the Bhukti, Antara, Sookshama 
and Prana Lords all have the potential to cause the death of Father. 

Death of Native: 

Dasa Lord Rahu is in Rahu Star. Since Rahu represents Saturn 
we may say that Rahu is as good as in Saturn Star. Now Saturn 
appears in 8 from Ascendant. Rahu is in the Sub of Venus who 



1 74 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



appears in 1st cusp. Thus Rahu as Rahu satisfies the necessary 
condition for causing death of native. 

Rahu is in the SS of Saturn who appears in 8th house. Thus 
Rahu satisfies the essential condition also. 

Dasa lord Rahu as Saturn clearly links with 1 and 8. Saturn is 
in the Star of Sun who is placed in the 8th Bhava. Saturn is in the 
Sub of Venus who is the Star, Sub and Sub-Sub lord of the Ascdt. 

SSL of Saturn is placed in 2, 7 and 8,Thus the Dasa lord 
satisfies the necessary and essential conditions to cause for the 
death of the Native. 

Bhukti, Antara, Sookshama and Prana lords also justify death 
of the Native. 

Death day and Moon'p Star Lord: 

On the Day of death Moon was transiting in Sun Star. Now in 
the natal chart 4th cusp ije. 8th from 9th cusp has Sun as the SS. 
The Sub-Sub lord of the 8th cusp from Ascendant is Saturn who is 
in Sun Star. Thus the necessary conditions for Moon's Star lord on 
the day of death for the native and his father are satisfied. 

Transit of Jupiter 

A ETr Jupiter transit in Leo ruled by Sun. Sun is the SSL of 4th 
cusp i.e.8th from 9. £> un i s placed in 8. Thus Jupiter's transit 
in Leo justifies the condition for transit. 

B. ETr Jupiter transits in Venus Star. Venus is placed in 8. Venus 
in the Natal chart is in Venus Star and Rahu Sub . Venus appears 
in 9 and Rahu as Saturn appears in 2, 7 and 8 from 9. 

C. ETr Jupiter transits in the Sub of Saturn who appears in 2, 7 
and 8 from 9. Sat appears in 2 and 8 from Ascendant. More 



Case Studies 175 



over in the Natal chart Saturn is in Sun Star (who is placed in 
8) and in the Sub of Venus who appears in Ascendant. Thus 
ETr Jupiter's transit in Saturn Sub justifies the necessary 
conditions. 

D. ETr Jupiter transits in the SS of Jupiter who in the Natal chart 
is in Mercury Star and Venus Sub. Thus Jupiter in the Natal 
chart is linked with 1 and 8 both from Ascendant as well as 
from 9. 

We may therefore conclude that transit of Jupiter justifies the 
event of Twin Deaths. 

Similarly it can be verified that the Transit of Dasa Lords 
and Sun and Moon justify the event of Twin Deaths. 

Note: Please read Appendix A for analysis and formation 
of death time charts.

Case Studies 179 

Accuracy of the Ascendant 

For a correct horoscope, the Ascendant Sub-Sub lord should 
satisfy the following three conditions: 

1. It should establish relation with the Moon's Star lord. Here 
Rahu is the Sub-Sub lord of the Ascendant. Rahu represents 
Mars being in Aries. Mars is in the Sub of Saturn who is the 
Moon Star of the Native. 

2. The Sub-Sub lord of the Ascendant should reveal the sex of 
the native. Rahu is in the Sub-Sub of Ketu who is placed in 
male sign Libra. Moreover the longitude of the Sub-Sub arc 
of Rahu in Venus Sub is in the first half. Since Male sign rises 
on the Ascendant, this also confirms that this is the chart of a 
male. 

3. The Sub-Sub lord of the Ascendant should be linked with 
cusps 1,7, 10 (i.e. 2, 5 and 11 from 9th cusp that represents 
father). 

Here Rahu is in Ketu Star and since Ketu is in Rahu Star, 
Rahu will be taken as in its own Star. Rahu is the Star lord of 
7th cusp, and Sub-Sub lord of the Ascendant. Since Ketu 
represents Venus being in Libra, Rahu is as good as in Venus 
Star. Venus is the sign lord of the 10th cusp. 

Promise of Short Life. 

It can be checked that the Sub-Sub lords of 1, 3 and 8th cusp 
are linked with Maraka/Badhaka houses. 

Promise for Unnatural death. 

For unnatural death, the Sub-Sub lord of Ascendant and 8th 
cusp should be linked to 8 and 12. Rahu the Sub-Sub lord of 
Ascendant is in Ketu star which appears as the star lord of the 8th 
cusp. Since Ketu represents Venus, Rahu is as good as in Venus 
Star. Venus is the Sub-Sub lord of the 12th cusp. 



780 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



The Sub-Sub lord of the 8th cusp is Mercury who has the 
positional status and as such gets significations of 8 and 12. More 
over Mercury is in Jupiter Star (the Sub lord of the 12th cusp) and 
its own Sub. 

Mercury is also the Sub lord of the 7th cusp which is both 
Maraka and Badhaka. 

Accident on 10.10.1931. 

For any specific event, the Sookshma and Prana lords have to 
be significator of the Primary cusp and supporting cusps that take 
part in enacting the event. 

On 10.10.1931, the native was running the period of Mer- 
Venus-Jup-Mar-Mercury. Accident happens on a particular day and 
time when Prana lord is linked with 1, 4, 8 and 12 houses. Here 
Sookshma lord Mars is linked with 4, 8 and 12 (4 Sign lord, 8 Sub 
lord and 12 Sign lord. Mars has the positional status). 

Prana lord Mercury also has the positional status. Mercury is 
in Jupiter Star. Thus Prana lord is linked with 1, 4, 8 and 12. 

The green signal for any event to happen is given by the Transit 
of Sun and Moon. These planets should transit in Sign, Star, Sub 
and Sub-Sub the lords of which should either 

(a) Appear themselves in the Primary and supporting cusps 

or 



Case Studies 181 



(b) Should be significator of Primary and supporting cusps 
in the natal chart. 

Since the time of accident is not known let us study the transit 
of Sun and Moon in Stars at time 13.05 hrs which looked to be 
time of accident. 

On 10.10.1931 , at 13.05 hrs Sun Transits in Mars Star who is 
the Sub lord of the 8th house (accident). 

Moon was transiting in Moon Star. In the natal chart Moon 
transits in Saturn Star and Mercury Sub. Now Saturn is not only 
posited in the 4th house but is also the Sub-Sub lord of the 4th 
cusp. Mercury is the Star lord of the 12th cusp and SS of the 8th 
cusp. 

Death on 11.10.1931. 

Death could not take place on 10.10.1931 because Moon was 
transiting in Moon Star and Moon does not appear in the 8th cusp 
and as such does not become the source for death of the native. 
When Moon enters in Mars Star, death takes place. Mars is the Sub 
lord of the 8th cusp. It has PS and is also the Star lord of 2. 

Fig CS5 is event chart for death. Time is taken as 13.05.50 
hrs. Death took place at Nottingham (Long 01W10, Lat 52N58')- 
The native was at that time running the Dasa period of Mer-Ven- 
Jup-Mars-Ven. Prana lord Venus satisfies the necessary and essential 
conditions to cause death of the native.

2. Accuracy of Chart: 

• Mercury, Moon, Jupiter and Rahu co rules the Ascendant. 
All these Planets are linked with 1 or 7 or 10. 

• Since this is the horoscope of a male it would generally 
be considered that the SS arc of the Ascendant which 
rises in female Sign should be set in the second half. 
However in this chart SSL of Ascendant is in the Star, 
Sub, and SS the lords of which are all placed in male 
signs: In such cases we can ignore the concept of setting 
the arc in first or second half. Thus the SS arc in this 
horoscope is in the first half. 

• SS lord of the Ascendant is Rahu who is in Mars Star 
which is the Moon's Star lord. 

• Thus the fixed Ascendant satisfies the necessary 
conditions. 

3. Promise of Short Life: 

The span of life is determined from the significations of the 
Sub-Sub lords of the 1, 3 and 8 houses. For very short or 
immediate death, the following conditions should exist in the 
chart. 

L The Sub-Sub lords of 1, 3 and 8 houses should be fruitful 
significators of Maraka, Badhaka and or 8th house 

2. If a child is born in a Dasa, Bhukti, Antara, the lords of 
which are the joint co-rulers of the Ascendant or the 8th 
cusp and are simultaneously linked through their Star 
lords to Maraka and Badhakasthna and or 8th house, 
their joint period is very critical for the life of the native. 
The Sub lords of the Dasa periods should support their 
Star lord significations and SS lords should appear in 
Maraka or Badhaka or 8th cusp. 



790 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

In this chart SSL of 1 and 3 is Rahu who is in Mars 
Star and Sun Sub .Both Mars and Sun appears in 8. 

Rahu has PS and appears in 1 and 2. 

Thus Rahu as Rahu promises very short life. 

Rahu in this chart represents Saturn as Sign Lord 
and Mars as Star lord. 

Saturn has PS and appears in 2 and 7 (both Maraka 
and Badhaka). Saturn is in the Sub of Venus that 
appears in 2. Saturn is in the SS of Rahu who 
appears in 2, 7 and 8 (including Sat and Mars). 

• Mars is in Mars Star who appears in 8. Mars is in 
the Sub of Moon who appears in l.Thus Mars is 
linked with 1 and 8 Jt indicates life is very short. 

Conclusion: The SSL of 1 and 3 promises very short life. 

• SSL of 8th cusp is Sun who has PS and as such signifies 
8th and 12th house. 

• Sun is in Sub of Sun and SS of Venus who appears in 2 
and 12. 

• 8th SS also does not promise much life to the native. 
However since SS of the 8th cusp is not linked with 7th 
cusp it does allow the native to live for some period. 

Significations of Dasa Period Lords at Birth: 

• The native was born in the Dasa period of Mars -Jup- 
Jup-Jup-Ven. 



Case Studies 191 



• We thus find that Mars appears in 8 and Jupiter appears 
in Ascendant. But the Prana lord Venus does not appear 
either in Ascendant or in 8th cusp. 

• The native thus could not die immediately after birth 
though Mars and Jupiter has the potential to cause death. 

• The next question we need to answer is why Bhukti lord 
Jupiter did not cause death of the native. 

• Jupiter has PS and as such signify 1, 7. Jupiter is in Ketu 
Star that appears in 8, Thus we find that Jupiter signify 
all relevant houses that can inflict death on the native 
except the second house. 

• A Planet can cause an event to happen in its own 
subsequent period only if it signifies or is linked with 
all the houses that take part in enacting the event. 

• Thus Jupiter in its own Antara could not cause death of 
the native because it is not linked with second house. 

The Dasa and Bhukti lord promises short life but not 
immediate death. 

Death of Native: 

The native died on 25 Mach 2008 at about 20.17 hrs when he 
was running the period Mars-Jup-Sat-Rahu-Mercury. Fig CS7 
is the death time chart.

Operation of Dasa Period Lords: 

• Dasa Lord Mars has PS and appears in 8. Mars is in the Sub 
of Moon that appears in 1 . Mars is in SS of Rahu that represents 
Mars and Saturn. Rahu, Mars and Saturn appear in 2, 7 and 8. 

• Thus the Dasa Lord satisfies the necessary and essential 
conditions to cause death of the native. 

• Bhukti lord Jupiter has PS and appears in 1 and 7 (both Maraka 
and Badhaka) and 12. Jupiter is in Ketu Star that appears in 
8.Jupiter is in the Sub of Jupiter that appears in 1,7 and 12, 
Jupiter is in the SS of Rahu. We have discussed above that it 
appears in 2, 7 and 8. 

• Thus Jupiter Bhukti lord has the capability to cause death of 
the native. 

• Antara Lord is Saturn and Sookshama Lord is Rahu who 
represents Saturn.We may Say that Antara and Sookshama 
Lord is Saturn who has PS and appears in 2 and 7 (both Maraka 
and Badhaka) .Saturn is in the Sub of Venus and SS of Rahu 
who appear in relevant cusps Maraka and Badhaka houses. 
Rahu as Mars is linked with 1 and 8 as discussed above. 

• Thus Antara and Sookshama Lord has the capability to cause 
death of the native. 

• Death took place in the Prana of Mercury who has PS and 
appears in 1,7 and 8.Mercury is in the Star of Venus who 
appears in 2. Thus Mercury signifies 2, 7 and 8. 

• Mercury is in the Sub of Mercury and SS of Venus. Both these 
Planets appear in relevant cusps. 

Conclusion: Dasa period at the time of death completely 
justifies the Event. 

We can see from the Fig CS7 that transit of Dasa period 
Lords, Sun and Moon supports the event. 



196 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



On the day of death Moon transits in Jupiter Star. In the 
Natal chart SSL of 8th cusp is Sun. Jupiter in the Natal chart is 
in Ketu Star .Since Ketu Represents Sun in the Natal chart we 
may say that in the natal chart Jupiter is in Sun Star. Thus the 
Star lord of Moon agrees with the SSL of the 8th cusp. 

Example 4: Method of Analyzing Multiple Option Blind 
Charts 

Step 1: Fix the chart for correct Ascdt and other cuspal 
positions from the given time line. 

Step 2: Decide the Primary and supporting cusps that should 
operate for each of the given option. 

Step 3: Note the Dasa period running on the day of happening 
of the event. 

Step 4: Draw the Transit chart for the day of happening of the 
event. The Transit chart should be cast for the place where 
the event has happened. It is possible only if the data given in 
Blind chart has provided this information. 

Step 5: Start the process of elimination of those events which 
don't correspond with the Dasa and Transit potential. 
Sometimes certain events can be eliminated if the chart does 
not promise those events." 

Let us apply the above concepts for the Analysis of a Blind 
Chart.

Case Studies 201 



Step 2: For options 1 (surgery on eye) and 3 (attempt to commit 
suicide) the Primary cusp is 8 and supporting cusps arel, 2 
and 7. For option 2 the Primary cusp is 3 (information) and 
also 6 (service) and supporting cusps are 9 and 1 1 . For option 
4 the Primary cusp is 3 and supporting cusps are 9 and 12,But 
do remember that Journey abroad means leaving the current 
place of residence and as such the Primary cusp 3 could be 
interpreted as the negation of the 4th cusp. 

Step 3: The native was running the Dasa period of Rahu-Sat- 
Mars-Sat-Moon/Mars. In this chart Rahu represents Saturn. 
Practically we can say that the native was running the Dasa 
period of Sat-Sat-Mars-Sat-Moon/Mars. 

Mars the Antara lord will only be allowed to offer the result 
of those houses which the Dasa and Bhukti lord Saturn permits 
as per its significations. The Sookshama lord Sat will then 
allow only those events which synchronizes with the Antara 
lord Mars. More over the Sookshama and Prana lord always 
provide the result of those events for which they are linked 
with the Primary and supporting cusps provided the Transit 
of Dasa Period lords and Sun and Moon agrees. 

Step 4: Check the transit positions of Planets as on 21 .06.2006. 

Step 5 Process of Elimination: If we look at the Transit chart 
we notice that Sun transits in Mars Star. As per the transit 
philosophy the native will enjoy the results of Dasa period 
lords of those houses which have been excited by Mars as per 
its cuspal positions in the natal chart or those cuspal positions 
for which Mars is the significator in the natal chart. In the 
natal chart Mars neither appears in the 8th cusp nor is it 
significator of the 8th house in the natal chart. Thus options 1 
and 3 get eliminated. 



202 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Option 2 gets eliminated because Mars Involves 6th cusp but 
commits to 5 i.e. negation of service. 

So we are left with option 4. Let us now analyse whether the 
Dasa potential and transit allow this event or not. Saturn is the 
Dasa lord, Bhukti Lord and Sookshama lord. It is in Sun Star who 
is the Sub as well as the Sub-Sub lord of the 4th cusp. Saturn is in 
the Sub of Venus which appears in 3 (negation of 4 i.e leaving the 
current residence) , 12 (new environment say abroad) , and 11 
fulfillment of action. Saturn is the Sub-Sub lord of 9th cusp (long 
Journey).Mars is the lord of the 9th cusp.This means the native 
will leave the house for long journey. 

Mars the Antra lord also involves the 4th cusp being in its 
own star. It is in the Sub of Rahu that represents Saturn and Sun. 
Rahu is the star lord of 3. Thus Mars points out that the native can 
leave the house. Mars also signifies the houses 9 and 11 .Mars is in 
the SS of Venus who is the Sub lord of 12. The end result of leaving 
the house is visit abroad. 

On the day of visit Moon transits in Ketu Star who is the Star 
lord of 9 and SS lord of 12,Inthe natal chart Ketu represents Jupiter 
who is the significator of the event of leaving the house. Jupiter is 
in Sat Star (4th star lord) and Sub of Venus the Sign and SS lord of 

3. 

On 21.06.2006 Moon is the Prana lord up to 16.15 hrs. The 
native should have left the home country only after 16,15 i.e. in the 
Prana of Mars.

Step 2: Primary and supporting cusps for options are listed 
below: 

a. Winning Medal in Sports: 1, 6, 10 and 11. Sports is 
signified by 5th house. Thus 5th SSL should be linked 
with 6, 10 and 11. 

b. Broke her right arm. 1 ,3 ,8 and 12. Third cusp SSL should 
be linked through its Star lord with 8 to indicate that the 
native can have injury on right arm. 

c. Abduction: Abduction means the criminal act of 
capturing and carrying away by force. This almost 
amounts to virtual imprisonment. The abducted person 
leaves his/her residence (3rd house or involving 4th and 
committing to 3rd), Mental agony (8th) and placing the 
native in a new environment (12th). 

So, the houses that take part in abduction are 3, 8 and 
12. If at the time of abduction the native runs the 
Sookshama and Prana lord who are linked with these 
houses then we can say that the person has been abducted. 

Prana Lord May involve 3 and commit to 8 and 12 or it 
may involve 4 and commit to 3, 8, and 12 or it may 
involve 12 and commit to 3 and 12. 

d. Death of Father 1, 8, 2, 7 and Badhaka houses with 
respect to 9th house. 

Step 3: On 3 Dec 1977 the native was running the Dasa period 
of Ven-Sun-Sat-Mer-Mer. 

Step 4: Sookshama and Prana Lord does not support the events 
of abduction, winning medal and injury due to supports 
activity. 

Step 5: Dasa period lords satisfies the necessary and essential 
conditions to cause death of father. Transit supports the event.

Table 1: 

Planets Moon, Jupiter, and Venus have Positional Status. These 
Planets do not appear in any row in second column. In other words 
there is no Planet who is in the Star of these Planets. 

Table 2: 

Planet Moon has the positional status because Moon is in Ketu 
Star and Ketu is in Moon StarPlanet Mars has positional status 
because the Planet is in its own Star. Remember that even if any 
other Planet is also in Mars Star even then the Planet enjoys 
positional status. 

Planet Jupiter has no positional status. If you scan the second 
column you will notice that Jupiter appears in the row of the Planet 
Venus. In other words the Planet Venus is in the Star of Jupiter. 
Thus the Planet Jupiter loses its positional status. 

Planet Ketu has positional status because Ketu is in Moon 
Star and Moon is in Ketu Star. No doubt there are other Planets 
who are in Ketu Star yet the Planet will not lose its positional status. 
This has been stated above. 

Table 3: 

Planets Rahu and Ketu have positional status because there is 
exchange of Stars. Planet Sun has positional status because Sun 
does not appear in any row in second column. In other words there 
is no Planet in the Star of Sun. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 209 



Planet Saturn has no positional status because Saturn appears 
in the second column against the Mars row. In other words Mars is 
in the Star of Saturn and thus the Planet loses its positional status. 

Answer Practice Exercise: Lesson 2 

In this chart only Planets Mercury and Moon have no 
positional status. All other Planets have positional status. 

Planet Sun occupies the 8th house and appears in cuspal 
positions 7 and 11 .Thus the Planet will offer the results of houses 
7,8 and 11. 

Planet Mars is placed in the 6th house and appears in cuspal 
positions 2, 9 and 12 Mars will offer the results of houses 2, 6, 9 
and 12. 

Planet Venus occupies the 10th house and appears in cuspal 
positions 2, 3, 5, and 8.Venus will thus offer the results of houses 
2, 3, 5, 8 and 10. 

Planet Jupiter is placed in 11th house and appears in cuspal 
positions 1,3,5,7,9, 10, and 1 l.Thus Planet Jupiter will offer the 
results of houses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11. 

Planet Saturn occupies the 6th house and appears in cuspal 
positions 1, 2, 9, Hand 12. Planet Saturn will therefore offer the 
results of houses 1, 2, 6, 9, 11 and 12. 

About Rahu and Ketu we will discuss afterwards. 

Answers Practice Exercise: Lesson 3 

Tr. Planet Jupiter: As we discussed in Lesson 2, the Planet 
Jupiter has PS and will offer the results of houses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 
and 11 as per its positional status. Let us now determine the stellar 
status of Jupiter. Jupiter is in Sun Star which is placed in 8th Bhava 
and appears in cuspal positions 7 and 11. Thus, as per its stellar 
status Jupiter will offer the results of houses 7, 8 and 11. Merging 



210 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



the PS and Stellar status, we may say that Jupiter will offer the 
results of houses 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. 

Planet Mercury has no PS in this chart and therefore can not 
offer the result of those houses where it appears in cuspal 
positions. It is also not able to offer the result of the house it 
occupies. It will offer the result as per its stellar status only. Mercury 
is in Jupiter Star which is placed in llthhouse and appears in cuspal 
positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11. Mercury will thus offer the result 
of houses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11. 

Planet Moon also has no PS in this chart. It will therefore 
offer result as per its stellar status alone. Moon is in Sun Star which 
occupies 8th house. fS un appears in cuspal positions 7 and 11. Moon 
will thus offer the results of houses 7, 8 and 11. 

Answers Practice Exercise: Lesson 4 

If we scan the second column of the Planetary Table in Fig 5 
we notice that Rahu does not appear in any of the rows. We therefore 
conclude that Rahu has PS in this chart. 

Rahu as Rahu will therefore offer results both as per its PS 
and stellar status. 

PS Result: Tr. Rahu is placed in 6th house and appears in 
cuspal positions 2, 3, 4 and 8. Therefore, Rahu will offer the results 
of 2, 3,4, 6 and 8 houses. 

Stellar Status Result: Tr. Rahu is in the Star of Jupiter which 
is placed in 2nd house. Jupiter also appears in cuspal positions 4, 

6, 7, 10 and 12. Therefore, Rahu will offer the result of the 2, 4, 6, 

7, 10 and 12 houses. 

In summation, Tr. Rahu will offer the result of the 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 

8, 10 and 12 houses. 

Planets Rahu Represents: In this chart Tr. Rahu is in Saturn 
Sign and Jupiter Star. Thus Tr.Rahu will also offer the result which 



Answers of Practice Exercises 211 



Tr .Planets Saturn and Jupiter have to offer as per their PS and Stellar 
Status. 

Rahu as Tr. Jupiter: Tr. Jupiter has no PS. It is in Saturn 
Star. Saturn is placed in 11th house. It appears in cuspal positions 
5,6,9, 10, 11 and 12. Tr.Rahu as Tr. Jupiter will offer the result of 
houses 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12. 

Rahu as Tr. Saturn: Tr. Saturn has no PS in this chart. Tr. 
Saturn is in Ketu Star who is placed in 12th house. Ketu appears in 
cuspal positions 2 and 9. Thus Rahu as Saturn will offer the result 
of houses 2, 9 and 12. 

Note: We have yet not discussed the behaviour of a Planet 
when it is in Rahu or Ketu Star. We will do it in next lesson. Till 
then this may be taken as the possible answer. 

Answers Practice Exercise: Lesson 5 

Please refer to Figure 6:1. Here we have the complication of 
having Rahu in its own Star. So we must realise that BOTH Tr 
Rahu and Star Lord Rahu (STL) represents the Sign Lord (RL), as 
well as itself. 

As Tr Rahu represents Mercury we have to perform two 
assessments one as Tr Rahu itself and another as the planet it 
represents i.e. Tr Mercury. 

1. TRANSIT RAHU AS ITSELF. 

(a) Tr Rahu has positional Status (PS) as it is in its own Star 
which appears in 1, 5, 7 and 11 cusps and is placed in 1 1 . 

(b) Like Tr Rahu, STL Rahu also represents Mercury so Tr 
Rahu can be considered as being in Mercury Star. 

(c) Tr .Mercury has PS because it is in the Star of Ketu which 
represents Jupiter, and Jupiter is in the Star of Mercury 
- so there is an exchange of star lords. Mercury is situated 
in the 5th house and gives the results of 1 , 3, 5, 9 and 12, 



212 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



2. TRANSIT RAHU AS MERCURY 

(a) Tr. Mercury is in Ketu Star which represents Jupiter as 
sign lord and Venus as Star Lord. 

(b) Tr Mercury in Ketu Star: Ketu is placed in 5 and gives 
the results of 6 and 12 cusps. 

(c) Tr Mercury in Jupiter Star. Jupiter is placed in 8 and 
gives the results of 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 12 cusps. 

(d) Tr Mercury in Venus Star. Venus is placed in 7 and 
appears in all cuspal positions except 8 and 12. 

FINAL RESULT 

From the foregoing it will be noted that Rahu in this chart is 
capable of providing results for all twelve houses. 

Answers Practice Exercise: Lesson 6 

Questionl: The birth of first child takes place in the joint 
period of Planets who are significators of 2, 5 and 11. There are 
certain conditions that need be satisfied for Planets to appear in a 
proper sequence. This will be discussed in future lesson. 

The objective of this lesson is to allow you to make a decision 
whether a Planet can take part in enacting an event or not. 

A Planet is considered capable to take part if it signifies at 
least one of the houses that take part in enacting the event. 

Signification of a Planet for a house means that its Star lord 
appears in that house. If a Planet has PS it may be taken in its own 
Star. Thus first condition for a Planet to take part in an event is that 
it should signify at least one of the houses. 

For the Planet to be a fruitful significator of a particular event 
the Sub lord should appear in favourable position from the house 
signified by the Planet. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 213 



Let me explain through example of event of marriage. Here 
we take 7th house as the Primary house and houses 5 and 11 are 
supporting houses. If a Planet has to take part in enacting marriage 
it should signify 5 or 7 or 1 L If a Planet only commits to 7 through 
Sub Lord but does not signify 5 or 7 or 11 (either by PS or 
through its Star Lord) it can not take part in enacting the event. 
In the chart of Fig 7 Bhukti lord Sun is in Sun Star. It is placed in 
second Bhava and also appears in 5 as SSL lord of 5th cusp. Sun is 
thus capable of providing results of relevant houses for the event 
of child birth. 

Sun is in the Sub of Venus who is the SSL of 2nd cusp. Venus 
also appears in 1, 3, 7, 8, 9 and 12. Thus we notice that the Sub 
lord of Sun (Venus) supports as well as negates the significations 
of 2 and 5. i.e. supports by being in 2, and 3 (11th to 5) , and 
negates by 1 being 12th to 2, and 8th (7th to 2nd and 4th to 5th). 
There are other connections here, but these examples demonstrate 
how to assess the effect of the Sub Lord. 

This means Tr. Sun is capable of giving favourable as well as 
unfavourable results of houses 2 and 5. 

Antara Lord Saturn has PS. It is the Star lord of 5th cusp. 
Therefore we say Saturn is capable of providing a result for the 
relevant 5th house. 

Sat is in the Sub of Sun who has PS and is placed in second 
Bhava which is another relevant cusp for child birth. Saturn is thus 
fully competent to cause the birth of the first child. 

Sookshama lord Moon has PS and is Sub Lord of the 2nd 
cusp and Star lord of 1 1 . Moon therefore has the capability of 
providing second and 11 house results. 

Moon is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 2, 5 and 1 1 .These 
houses (2, 5 and 11) are relevant cusps for the event of first child 
birth. 

Moon is thus fully competent to cause the birth of first child. 



214 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Conclusion: The native could get first child during the period 
of Sun-Sat and Moon. 

Question2: Financial Status of a person improves during the 
period of a Planet that signifies 2, 6 and 1 1 . 

In this chart Mars has no PS . It is in Venus Star who appears 
as SSL of second cusp. We say Mars can provide results of the 
second house. 

Mars is in Mars Sub who appears in 1 , 6 and 8. Commitment 
of Mars to cusps 1 and 8 is not good for second house because 1 is 
12th to 2, and 8 is 7th to 2. Houses 1 and 8 are not relevant houses. 

However Mars is also committed to 6th cusp which is very 
favourable for the enhancement of financial status. 

Conclusion: Mars will give mixed results for financial 
matters. This is because Mars through its Sub lord is committed to 
6 (favourable position with respect to 2) and 1 and 8 (unfavourable 
positions with respect to 2). Overall there is unlikely to be any 
significant improvement.'

Increase is attained during the period of a Planet 

A: that signifies second house (either by PS or by Stellar 
Status) and the Sub lord of the Planet appears in cuspal 
positions favourable to second house and also to the 
Ascendant. 

B: that signifies 6 or 11 (either by PS or by Stellar Status) 
and Sub lord appears in second cusp. If the Sub lord of 
the Planet occupies second house then it should have 
PS, 



Answers of Practice Exercises 215 

In the light of above let us try to analyse the Antara lords in 
A, B and C in practice exercise. 

2. Check Signification of Antara Lord Saturn. 

A: Saturn with PS: 

(1) is resident in 8th Bhava. 

(2) appears in cuspal positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9,and 12 

(3) Saturn as per its PS does not signify 2, but it does 
signify 6. 

(4) Therefore Saturn in its period does have the 
potential to increase financial status of the native 
subject to confirmation from its Sub and Sub Sub 
Lords. 

B: Saturn as per its Stellar Status. 

(1) Saturn is in MARS Star 

(2) who is resident in the 6th Bhava 

(3) and appears in 1,6, and 8. 

(4) Here again Saturn signifies the relevant 6th Bhava 
and qualifies to have the potential to increase the 
financial status of the native subject to confirmation 
by Sub lord. 

C: Check Qualification by Sub Lord. 

(1) Saturn is in the Sub of Sun who is resident in the 
2nd Bhava and has PS 

(2) And appears in 3, 5, 7, and 10th cusps. 

(3) 3,7 and 10 are all favourable positions to the 6th 
Bhava 

(4) This means that Saturn has the capability to bring 
changes in Significations of the 6th Cusp i.e. loss 



216 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



to others or getting a loan (Note: here, Sun 
favourably qualifies the Signification of Saturn 
shown above. 

(6) The commitment of Sub Lord Sun to the 2nd offers 
Saturn the capability of enhancing financial status 
subject to confirmation by its Sub- Sub Lord. 

D: Check Confirmation or Rejection by Sub-Sub Lord 

(SSL). 

(1) Saturn is in the Sub- Sub of VENUS: 

(a) who is resident in the 3rd Bhava 

(b) and appears in 1,2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 12 

(2) The 2nd is the Prime Bhava for financial increase. 
So SSL Venus does offer confirmation of increase 
in financial status, but there are also potential 
problems due to Venus' position in other cusps. 

CONCLUSION: 

The Antara Lord Saturn is conducive to the native 
receiving some financial increase during its Period; but it is 
likely there will also be problems because its Sub Sub lord Venus 

is in 1 (12 to 2) , 8 (7 to 2) , and 9 (8 to 2). 

3. Check Signification of Antara Lord Ketu. 

Ketu has no PS. We have to consider its results as per its 
Stellar Status 

Ketu represents Mercury as Sign Lord and Mars as Star Lord. 

A: Ketu as Ketu: Ketu is in Mars Star who is placed in 6. 
Mars appears in 1,6 and 8. 

(1) Ketu is in the Sub of Sun. Sun has PS and is placed 
in 2 and appears in 3, 5, 7 and 10 Cusps. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 217 



(2) With confirmation from Sun related to the 2nd we 
see that Ketu has the potential to create 
improvement in the native's financial status. 

Note: Here Ketu as Ketu signifies houses 1, 6 and 8. Its 
Sub lord Sun appears in 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. In this exercise we are 
to focus on the aspect of financial status of the native. A Planet 
can contribute to increase in financial status of the native if it 
signifies 6 (loss to other) and commits to the Primary cusp 2 
money matters). 

Now the same Planet may also be committing to other cusps 
than 2. Those positions of Sub lord are to be used to interpret other 
results of 6th house. 

For example in this case Ketu as Ketu involves 6th house and 
commits to 10th cusp through its Sub lord Sun. This would mean 
that Ketu is also capable to provide Job to the native. 

Sub lord only qualifies Star lord position. Sub lord does 
not qualify its other positions. 

B: Ketu as Mercury 

(1) Mercury has PS because it does not appear as Star 
Lord for another Planet. 

(2) is resident of the 3rd Bhava and 

(3) appears in 4, 8, 10 and 11. 

(4) 11 is a relevant house, but Mercury is in the SUB 
OF SATURN which does not appear in 2 

Therefore Mercury as per its PS cannot enhance 
Financial Status. Let us see what Mercury has to offer 
as per its Stellar Status. 

(5) a: Mercury is in Moon Star. 

b: Moon is placed in 2 and appears in 2, 7, 9 and 

11. 



218 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



c: Mercury is in the Sub of Saturn who is placed 
in 8 and has PS and appears in 1 , 2, 3, 4 ? 5, 6, 
7, 9 and 12. 

d: Positions 3, 4, 6 and 7 are favourable with 
respect to 2 and others are unfavourable 
positions with respect to 2. 

Thus Mercury as per its Stellar Status has the 
capability to enhance the native's financial status 
but also has the capability to cause depletion of 
financial status. 

Ketu as Mars 

(1) Mars has no PS. Therefore does not signify any 
house by PS . 

(2) Mars is in VENUS STAR, who is resident of 3 

(3) and appears in 1,2, 3, 7, 8. 9. and 12 

So Ketu via Mars does Signify 2, relevant house 
for Financial Status 

(4) Mars is in the Sub of MARS 

a: who is resident in the 6th Bhava 

b: and appears in 1,6, and 8. 

c: Sub lord's positions in 1 and 8 are not good 
for 2nd house Significations being 12th and 
8th to 2. 

d: Appearance of Sub lord in 6 favours second 
house significations. 

However, we may say that Mars is not capable 
of bringing any significant improvement in the 
financial status of the native 



Answers of Practice Exercises 219 



CONCLUSION 

Ketu Antara can at best show moderate improvement in 
the financial status of the native. 

4 Check Signification of Antara Lord Moon. 

A: Moon with PS 

(1) Moon has PS because Moon is in Venus Star and 
Venus is in Moon Star. 

(2) is resident in 2nd Bhava 

(3) and appears in 2, 7, 9, and 11 
B: Moon as per its Stellar Status 

(1) is in Venus Star 

(2) who is resident in the 3nd Bhava 

(3) and appears in 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 12 
C: Moon is in the Sub of Jupiter 

(1) Jupiter is placed in 3 with PS and 

(2) appears in 2, 5, 6 and 1 1 . 

Sub lord's appearance in 2, 3, 6 and 11 supports the 
significations of 2 but appearance in 5 is adverse for 2. 

D: Moon as financial indicator. 

Moon signifies 2 both as per PS and as per Stellar Status. 
Sub lord of Moon supports quite strongly the 
significations of 2 but also indicates adverse results for 

2. 

How ever the end result has to be confirmed by the Sub- 
Sub lord of Moon. 

Moon is in the SS of Venus that appears both in 
favourable as well as unfavourable houses with respect 
to 2. 



220 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



CONCLUSION 

The Antara Lord Moon in its Period is likely to offer scope 
for increase in financial prospects but may also cause some financial 
losses. 

None of the Antara Lords offer very good opportunities 
for smooth increase in financial gain. This is real life situation. 
We will be able to appreciate it when we discuss in Lesson 10 
the operation of Vimsottari Dasa System. 

Answers Practice Exercise: Lesson 8 

1. Question 1: Promise of Child Birth. 
A: Study of Ascendant. 

(1) SSL of Ascendant is Sun who is in Venus Star. 

(2) Venus appears in 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12. 

(3) Sun is in the Sub of Jupiter who has PS. 

(4) Jupiter is placed in 8 and appears in cusps 4, 5, 7, 
9, 10, 11 and 12*. 

(5) Thus we notice that Ascendant SSL involves 
second house and commits to 5 and 11. This 
promises that native can get a child. 

*We will use this study for answering other questions 
also. 

B: Study of 5th Cusp. 

(1) SSL of 5th cusp is Jupiter who has PS. 

(2) Jupiter is in the Sub of Mars who appears in relevant 
cuspal positions 2 and 1 1 , 

(3) More over Jupiter is in Ketu Star. Ketu represents 
Moon as Sign lord. Thus Jupiter is as good as in 
Moon Star. Moon appears in 2 and 5. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 221 



(4) Thus 5th cusp promises birth of child to the 
native. 

2. Question 2: Gain through Property. 

A: We notice that SSL of Ascendant involves second house 
(money) and 

B: commits to 4th cusp (property), 11 (desire fulfillment), 
and 12 (investment). 

Study of 4th cusp: One gains through the significations of 
4th house (property is one of the significations of 4th house) 
when the SSL of 4th cusp is linked with second house directly 
(through Star lord) or indirectly (Star in 11 and Sub in 2). 

(1) In this chart SSL of 4th cusp is Mercury who has 
PS. Mercury appears in 3, 4 and 5. 

(2) Mercury is in Ketu Star who appears in 1,4 and 9. 
Since Ketu represents Moon as Sign lord and Jupiter 
as Star lord, Mercury will be considered to be in 
the Star of Moon as well as Jupiter. 

(3) Mercury is in Moon Star, and Sat Sub. Moon 
appears in 2, and Saturn appears in 1,8, 11 and 12. 
Saturn is placed in 2, but has no PS. Mercury thus 
involves second cusp and commits to 11. This 
means gain through property. 

(4) Mercury involving second cusp and committing to 
8 and 12 means expenditure, investment or loss in 
property. Thus we may say that the native can 
gain in property and also invest in property. 

(5) The end result is indicated by the SSL of 
Mercury. Mercury is in the SS of Sun who 
appears in 3, 6 and 10. All these cuspal positions 
are favourable for second house. Thus the native 
will in the end gain in property. 



222 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 

Mercury in Jupiter Star, and Saturn Sub: Jupiter 
appears in 1 1 but Saturn does not appear in 2 . Thus 
we say Mercury is not linked to second house and 
as such is not relevant for defining the promise of 
gain in property. 

3. Question 3. Proneness to Sickness. 

A: Refer Pages 45, 135 and 136 of my book and read under 
the title status of health. 

(1) In this chart Ascendant SSL is linked with 6 and 12 
through its Star lord. 

(2) We say that the native is prone to sickness. 

4. Question 4. Promise of Earning by way of Service. 

A: You may read Pages 182 and 247 of my book. 

(1) In this chart SSL of the 6th cusp is Venus who is in 
Saturn Star. Saturn is placed in 2 (house of earning). 

(2) We therefore say that native is promised earning 
by way of service. 

Answers Practice Exercise Lesson 9 

1: Question 1: Study of SSL of Ascendant: 

A: SSL of Ascendant is Moon who has PS and is in Moon 
Star and Mercury Sub. 

(1) Moon signifies 1 as it has PS and 

(2) Mercury appears in 1, 2, 7 (Maraka and Badhaka) 
and 8. 

(3) Thus SSL of Ascendant satisfies the necessary 
condition via Mercury Sub. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 223 

This indicates that the native may commit suicide. 
(4) Moon is in the Sub Sub of Ketu. 

a. Ketu has PS because Ketu is in Sat Star and 
Sat is in Ketu Star. 

b. Ketu is placed in 7 which is both Maraka and 
Badhaka. 

c. Ketu represents Jupiter and Saturn. Both 
Jupiter and Sat appear in 2, 7 and 8. 

Thus SSL of Ascendant meets the essential 
condition. 

Conclusion of promise of SSL of Ascendant: The 
native will commit suicide because SSL of Ascendant 
meets both the necessary as well as essential condition. 

B: Study of SSL of 8th Cusp: 

(1) SSL of 8th cusp is Jupiter who has PS as it is in Jupiter 
Star. Jupiter is in Sun Sub. 

(2) Jupiter appears in 2, 7 and 8. Sun appears in 1. 

(3) Thus SSL of 8th cusp satisfies the necessary condition 
via Sun Sub. 

This indicates that the native may commit suicide. 

(4) Jupiter is in the Sub- Sub of Mercury who appears in 1, 

2, 7 and 8. 

Thus 8th SSL meets the essential condition also via Mercury 
as Sub- Sub 

Conclusion: Both SSL of Ascendant and SSL of 8th cusp 
meet the necessary as well as the essential condition and 
as such the native will commit suicide. 



224 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf interlinks Theory 

2. Question 2: 

A: Study of SSL of Ascendant. 

(1) SSL of Ascendant is Moon who has PS as it is in 
Moon Star and Mercury Sub. 

(2) Moon appears in 5 and 1 1 and Mercury appears in 
7. 

(3) Moon is in the Sub Sub of Ketu that represents 
Saturn as Star lord (Ketu is resident of 7). 

a: Saturn has PS and appears in 5, 7 and 11 
(relevant cusps only indicated) and is in its 
own Sub. 

b: SSL of Ascendant meets the necessary as well 
as the essential conditions for love marriage. 

Conclusion: The SSL of the Ascendant promises love 
marriage for the native. 

B: Study of SSL of 7th Cusp: 

(1) SSL of 7th cusp is Venus who has PS. Venus is 
placed in 11th Bhava and is the SSL of 7th cusp. 
Venus thus becomes significator of 7 and 11 as per 
its PS. 

(2) Venus is in Ketu Star who represents Saturn. Saturn 
is in 5, 7, and 11, and is in its own Sub. 

(3) Venus is in the Sub Sub of Saturn who appears in 
5,7 and 11. 

Conclusion: The SSL of the 7th cusp also promises love 
marriage 

C: Study of SSL of 5th Cusp: 

(1) SSL of 5th Cusp is Mercury who is in Saturn Star 
and Rahu Sub. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 225 



(2) Saturn appears in 5, 7 and 1 1 . 

(3) Rahu represents Mercury who appears in 5 & 7 and 
Moon who appear in 5, and 11. 

(4) Mercury is in the Sub Sub of Rahu which as we see 
confirms the relevant houses. 

Conclusion: The SSL of the 5th cusp also promises 
love marriage. 

In summation we can see that all the relevant cusps 
promise love marriage and native will have love 
marriage.

c: and commits to Maraka /Badhaka houses. 

d: SSL of Dasa lord should be in 2 or 7 or 
Badhaka or 8 from 4. 

e: If the Dasa lord is one of the ruling planets in 
Ascendant or 8th cusp and is significator of 
Maraka and Badhaka houses then this Dasa 
lord can also cause the death of the relevant 
relative. Sub lord and SSL of Dasa Lord have

c: and commits to Maraka /Badhaka houses 

Note: SSLs of Dasa period lords should appear in 
Death inflicting houses Maraka or Badhaka or 8). 
SSLs may also be appearing in other cuspal 
positions. We will talk about the role of SSL when 
it appears in both desired as well as undesired 
houses in a separate Lesson. 

On 10.06.1994 native was running the Dasa period 
of Venus- Jupiter- Venus-Saturn-Moon. The Prana 
lord Moon lasts only up to 19.00.58 hrs. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 227 



B: Operation of Dasa Lord Venus 

(1) In this chart Venus has PS. Venus is placed in 5 and 
is SSL of 10. 

(2) 5th house is second to 4, and 10 is 7th to 4. Since 
4th cusp rises in dual sign Virgo, 10th house which 
is 7th from 4 is both Maraka as well as Badhaka. 

(3) Thus we find that as per its PS Venus signifies 2 
and 7 from 4. (Only relevant cusps shown) 

(4) Venus is in Jupiter Star who appears in 4, 5 and 
10. 

(5) Venus is in the Sub of Venus who is placed in 5 
and appears in 10. 

(6) Venus is in the SS of Sun who has PS and is placed 
in 5. (Maraka house for 4). 

Thus Dasa lord Venus involves Ascendant for Mother 
ie. 4 and commits to Maraka and Badhaka houses 
and has the potential to cause death of Mother. 

C: Operation of Bhukti Lord Jupiter 

(1) Jupiter has no PS. Thus it will offer results only 
as per its Stellar Status. 

(2) Jupiter is in Ketu Star. Ketu represents Mars as 
Star lord and Venus as Sign lord. 

a: Ketu appears in 3 and 11. Mars appears in 4 
and 11 

b: Thus Jupiter involves 1, 8 and 12 houses with 
respect to 4. 

(3) Jupiter is in Sub of Moon who appears as SSL of 
5th cusp that is Maraka house for 4. 



228 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



(4) Jupiter is in the Sub-Sub of Venus that also appears 
in 5. 

We, therefore conclude that Jupiter can cause death 
of Mother of the native 

D: Operation of Antara Lord Venus 

We have already discussed the role of Venus in 3 above. 
E: Operation of Sookshama Lord Saturn 

(1) Saturn has no PS. It will therefore, provide results 
as per its Stellar Status alone. Saturn is in Jupiter 
Star. Jupiter appears in 4, 5 and 10 (only relevant 
cusps shown).Thus Saturn signifies 1, 2 and 7 from 

4. 

(2) Saturn is in the Sub of Venus who is placed in 5 
and has PS . Venus appears in 5 and 10. 

(3) Saturn is in the SS of Mercury who appears in 4 
and 11, that is in 1 and 8 with respect to 4. 

Thus we find that Saturn satisfies all the conditions, 
and has the capability to cause death of Mother of 
the native. 

F: Operation of Prana Lord Moon 

(1) Moon has no PS. It will, therefore, provide only its 
Stellar Status results. 

(2) Moon is in the Star of Saturn who is placed in 5. 
Saturn appears in 11. 5 is 2 from 4 and 11 is 8 from 

4. 

(3) Moon is in the Sub of Rahu that represents Mars as 
Sign lord and Mercury as Star lord. 

a: Rahu appears in 5 and 10. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 229 



b: Mercury appears in 4 and 11 i.e. 1 and 8 from 

4. 

c: Mars appears in 4 and 11 i.e.l and 8 from 4. 

Thus we find that Prana Lord Moon is linked 
with 1, 2, 7 and 8 from 4. 

(10) Moon is in the Sub-Sub of Moon who is placed in 
10 but has no PS. Moon does not appear in 2 or 7 
or 8 from 4. This means that Moon Prana Lord fails 
to satisfy the essential condition. 

Thus we come to the conclusion that the death of the 
Mother of the native should have taken place in the 
Prana of Mars. 

G: Operation of Prana Lord Mars 

(1) Mars has no PS. 

(2) Mars is in Moon Star who is placed in 10 (Both 
Maraka and Badhaka for 4). 

(3) Mars is in the Sub of Saturn who appears in 11 i.e. 
8th from 4. 

(4) Mars is in the SS of Sun who appears in 5 i.e. 
Maraka house for 4. 

Mars satisfies all conditions and should have caused 
death of Mother of the Native. Therefore in 
summation we can say that all the Dasa levels 
promised death of mother after 19:00:58 hrs on the 
10th June 1994 

Question 2: Answer 

A: Purchase of Land Dec 1988 

(1) Native purchases property in the joint period of 
Planets that signify 4 (property) , 1 1 (fulfillment of 
desire) and 12 (expenditure). 



230 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



(2) Native takes possession of property in the joint 
period of Planets that signify 4, 9 (12th to 10 which 
represents others property) and 1 1 , 

(3) In Dec 1988 the native was running the Dasa period 
of Venus-Mars-Jupiter. Antara lord Jupiter runs 
through the whole month of Dec 1988. 

B: Operation of Dasa Lord Venus 

(1) Venus has PS and is in 12th cusp that signifies 
expenditure. 

(2) Venus is in Jupiter Star who is placed in 2 (money). 
Jupiter appears in 4. Venus thus signifies 2 and 4 
(only relevant cusps shown). 

(3) Venus is in the Sub of Venus who appears in 12. 

(4) Venus is in the Sub Sub of Sun who appears in 4 
(property), and 9 (loss of property to others). 

Thus we see that Venus involves 2 (Money) and commits 
to 12 Expenditure. Venus involves 4 (Property) and 
commits to 12 (Expenditure). 

We therefore conclude that Dasa lord has the potential 
to cause the native to invest in property. 

C: Operation of Bhukti Lord Mars 

(1) Mars has no PS. 

(2) Mars is in Moon Star who appears in 2 and 12. 

(3) Mars is in the Sub of Saturn that appears in 11. 

a: Thus we find that Mars who is the Sub-Sub 
lord of 4th cusp (Source Property) involves 
the second house (money) and 12th house 
(expenditure). This is interpreted as follows: 



Answers of Practice Exercises 2 $1 

For the 4th house matters (here property) the native 
will spend his money. 

(4) Mars is in the Sub Sub of Sun who appears in 
relevant cusps 4 and 9 as explained above. 

We therefore conclude that Mars Bhukti has the 
capability to allow the native to invest in property. 

D: Operation of Antara lord Jupiter 

(1) Jupiter has no PS. 

(2) Jupiter is in Ketu Star that represents Venus as Sign 
lord, and Mars as Star lord. Jupiter will therefore 
be considered in Ketu Star, Venus Star and Mars 
Star. 

(3) Ketu is the Star lord of 11. Venus is Sub lord of 12, 
and Mars appears in 4. 

a: Jupiter thus signifies 4, 11 and 12. 

(4) Jupiter is in the Sub of Moon that appears in 8 (gain 
of money to other). 

Moon also appears in 6 (loss to other and 
multiplication of property of the native - being 3rd 
from 4th) 

(5) Jupiter is in the Sub Sub of Venus that appears in 
12 the house of expenditure. Jupiter also appears 
in 5 which is the house of gain to the opponent. 

Thus we see that Jupiter Antara has the capability to 
enact the event of purchase of property. 

Since the date of purchase is not known we do not know 
in which Sookshama and Prana lord the event has 
happened. However Sookshama and Prana Lord are 
invariably linked with Primary and Supporting cusps. 



232 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



In summation we can say that all the Dasa levels 
offered the opportunity and capability to purchase 
property in December 1988 

Answers Practice Exercise: Lesson 11 

1 . The native got first male child on 26.12.1999 at 23.45 hrs. He 
was running at that time Dasa period of Mars-Jup-Mars-Jup- 
Mars. In lesson 8 we have seen that this chart promises birth 
of child. In Lesson 10 we discussed that the Dasa period lords 
at the time of birth of child justifies the event. We are now to 
examine the Transit of Dasa Period lords, Sun and Moon to 
see that it supports the event or not. 

2. Transit of Dasa Lord, Antara Lord and Sookshama Lord 
Mars 

A. ETr Mars transits in Capricorn Sign ruled by Saturn 

i. Saturn in the Natal chart has no PS but appears in 
relevant cusp 11 as Sign lord. 

ii. Saturn in the Natal chart is in Mars Star. Mars 
appears in 2 and 11 and is placed in 5. 

iii. Saturn is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 5 and 

11. 

iv. Thus we find that Saturn is linked with 2, 5 and 1L 

v. Saturn is in the SS of Saturn that appears in 11. 

Thus we find that ETr Mars's transit in Capricorn 
Sign satisfies necessary conditions. 

B. ETr Mars transits in Mars Star 

i. Mars is placed in 5 and appears in relevant cusps 2 
and 11 

ii. Mars in the Natal chart is in Venus Star and Jupiter 
Sub. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 233 

iii. Venus appears in 2 and Jupiter appears in 5 and 11, 

iv. Thus we find that Mars is linked with 2, 5 and 11, 

v. Mars is in the SS of Mars which appears in relevant 
cusps 2 and 5. 

We can therefore say that Mars transit in Mars Star 
justifies necessary conditions. 

C. ETr Mars transits in Saturn Sub 

i. Saturn appears in relevant cusp 11 

ii. Saturn in the Natal chart is in Mars Star who is 
placed in 5 

iii. Mars appears in 2 and 1 1 . 

iv. Saturn in the Natal chart is in Jupiter Sub that 
appears in relevant cusps 5 and 11 

v. Saturn is in the SS of Saturn that appears in 11. 

Thus ETr Mars's transit in Sat Sub justifies necessary 
conditions. 

D. ETr Mars transit in SS of Rahu 

i. Rahu appears in relevant cusps 2 and 5 

ii. Rahu in the Natal chart is in Sun Star who is placed 
in 5 

iii. Rahu is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 5 and 
11 

iv. Rahu is in the SS of Sat who appears in 11 

We find that ETr Mars transit in Rahu SS satisfies 
necessary conditions. 

3. Transit of Bhukti Lord and Sookshama Lord Jupiter 

A. ETr Jupiter transits in Aries ruled by Mars 



234 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 

i. We have seen above that Mars signifies 2, 5 and 11 

B. ETr Jupiter transits in Ketu Star 

ii. In the Natal chart Ketu represents Moon as Sign 
Lord. 

iii. Moon appears in relevant cusps 2 and 5. 

iv. We have seen above in Paragraph 2 that Moon is 
linked in the Natal chart with relevant cusps 2, 5 
and 11. 

Thus transit of ETr in Ketu Star justifies necessary 
conditions. 

C. ETr Jupiter transits in Venus Sub and Sun SS 

i. We have seen above that both Venus and Sun signify 
relevant cusps 2, 5 and 1L 

Thus we find transit of Jupiter in Sign, Star, Sub and 
SS justifies the event. 

4. Transit of Sun: ETr Sun transits in Sagittarius ruled by Jupiter. 
ETr Sun transits in Ketu Star, Sat Sub and Moon SS. 

We have seen above that Jupiter, Ketu, Sat and Moon are 
related to relevant cusps 2, Sand 11. 

5. Transit of Moon: ETr Moon transits in Leo ruled by Sun. 
ETr Moon transits in Ketu Star, Rahu Sub, and Jupiter SS. 

Rahu in the Natal chart represents Sat and Sun. Thus we 
find that Etr Moon transits in the Sign, Star, Sub, and SS 
the lord of which are all related to relevant cusp. 

We need to notice that the SSL of 5th cusp in the Natal 
chart is Jupiter who is in Ketu Star. Thus transit of Moon in 
Ketu Star fixes the Moon Star of the child as per SSL of the 5th 
cusp. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 235 

Answers: Lesson 12 

1. Question 1: Marriage 

A: Operation of Dasa Lord Mars 

(1) In this chart Mars has no PS . It is in Venus Star and 
Mars Sub 

(2) Venus appears in 7 (Primary cusp). 

(3) Sub Lord Mars appears in 7 and 11 (both relevant 
cusps for marriage) and also in 6 (12th to 7). 

(4) Thus we say that Mars has the potential to allow 
the event of marriage to take place but also hints at 
possible marital discord. 

(5) Mars is in the SS of Mercury that appears in relevant 
cusps 5 and 1 1 . 

Conclusion: Despite possible problems, Mars Dasa 
can allow Marriage. 

B: Operation of Bhukti Lord Ketu 

(1) Ketu has no PS. It represents Mercury as its Sign 
Lord and Mars as its Star Lord. 

(2) Ketu as Ketu: 

a: Ketu is in Mars Star and Sun Sub. 

b: Mars appears in 7 and 11 and Mars is placed 
in 5. Thus Ketu signifies 5, 7 and 1L 

c: Ketu's Sub lord appears in 2 (8th from 7) and 
11 (relevant cusp). 

d: Ketu is in the SS of Sun that appears in: 2, 10 
and 11. 



236 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

Conclusion: It looks difficult for Ketu as Ketu 
to allow marriage to take place. 

(3) Ketu as Mercury: 

a: Mercury has PS . It appears in relevant cusps 
5andll. 

b: Mercury is in the Sub of Saturn who appears 
in 5 and is placed in 7 with PS 

c: Mercury is in the SS of Ketu who represents 
Mercury and Mars 

d: Both Mercury and Mars appear in relevant 
cusps. 

Conclusion: Ketu as Mercury has the potential 
to cause marriage 

(4) Ketu as Mars: 

We have discussed in Para 1 that Mars has the 
potential to cause marriage and also promises 
marital discord. 

C: Selection of Antara: 

(1) Ketu Bhukti Ketu Antara: 

a: As stated above Ketu involves the Primary 
cusp through its Star lord Mars but commits 
to 2nd cusp through its Sub and Sub-Sub lord 
Sun. 8th cusp to any cusp always offers 
negative results. 

b: Ketu Antara in Ketu Bhukti will offer results 
only of Ketu as Ketu. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 237 

Conclusion: Ketu Antara is not suitable for 
marriage event. 

(2) Ketu Bhukti Venus Antara: 

a: Venus has PS because Venus is in Moon Star 
and Moon is in Venus Star. 

b: Venus appears in Primary cusp 7 and thus 
signifies 7. 

c: Venus is in the Sub of Mars that appears in 6, 
7 and 11. 

d: Venus is in the SS of Rahu that appears in 6 
and 12. Rahu no doubt appears in 7 also but 
since Venus is not promising marriage we 
need not take Rahu's appearance in 7 into 
consideration. 

Conclusion: Venus Antara in the end will not 
allow marriage to take place. Venus here is in 
accord with the results of Ketu as Ketu. 

(3) Ketu Bhukti Sun Antara: 

a: Sun is in Sun Star and Venus Sub. 

b: Sun appears in relevant cusp 11 and Venus 
appears in the Primary cusp 7.but also in 
2. This would allow the marriage to take place 
but there will be some marital discord also. 

c; Thus we find that Sun involves the supporting 
cusp and commits to the Primary cusp. 

d: Sun is in the SS of Venus that appears in the 
Primary cusp. 



238 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



FINAL CONCLUSION: Marriage should have 
taken place in Sun Antara. Here Sun is offering 
results which Bhukti lord Ketu as Mercury 
allows. 

• The native actually married in Sun Antara. 

Question 2: Sale of Property 

We should keep in mind that sale of property is as good as 
purchase of native's property by the other represented by 7th 
house. The native thus can sell the property during the 
Sookshama and Prana the Lords of which signify or as we 
say establish links as follows: 

a: Involves 4th cusp and commits to 3 and 2 or 11. 3 
is 12th to 4 and indicate loss of 4th house 
significations. 2 is gain of money, and 11 is 
fulfillment of desire. 

b: Involves 3 and commits to 10 or/and 5. 3 is 12thto 
4, 10 is 4th from 7 (property of other), 5 is 11 from 
7 (fulfillment of other's desire). 

A: Operartion of Sookshama Lord Ketu 

(1) Ketu as Ketu 

a: Ketu is in Mars Star. Mars does not appear in 
3 or 4. 

Conclusion: Ketu as Ketu is not capable to cause 
results relating sale of property. 

(2) Ketu as Mercury: 

a: Mercury is in Moon Star and Saturn Sub. 
b: Moon appears in 3 and Saturn appears in 



Answers of Practice Exercises 239 

relevant cusps 3 and 5. 

c: Mercury is in the SS of Ketu that represents 
Mars. Mars appears in 10 (property of other) 
and 11 (gain to the native). 

Conclusion: Ketu as Mercury allows the event 
of sale of property. 

(3) Ketu as Mars: 

a: Mars is in Venus Star that appears as the SS 
lord of the relevant cusp3. Mars is in Mars 
Sub that appears in relevant cusp 10 and 1 1 . 

b: Mars is in the SS of Mercury that appears in 
relevant cusps 5, 2 and 11. 

Conclusion: Ketu as Mars has the capability to 
allow the sale of the property. 

B: Selection of Prana Lord 

(1) Ketu Sookshama Ketu Prana: 

a: Ketu in Ketu Sookshama Ketu Prana will offer 
the results of Ketu as Ketu 

Conclusion: The native can't sell property 
during this Sookshama. 

(2) Ketu Sookshama Venus Prana: 

a: Venus has PS and appears in relevant cusps 2 
(Money) , 3 (loss of property) , and 10 
(.transfer of property to other). 

b: Venus is in Mars Sub who appears in relevant 



240 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 

cusps 10 and 1 1 . 

c: Venus is in the SS of Rahu who represents 
Jupiter, Ketu, Mercury and Mars. Both 
Mercury and Mars appear in relevant cusps. 

Conclusion: Sookshama lord Venus allows the 
native to sell the property. Here Venus is acting 
in consonance with Ketu as Mars. 

Note: There can be more than one Antara Lord signifying 
relevant cusps for causing an event to happen. We need to select 
the Antara lord following the sequential order in which the 
selected Antaras appear, ensuring that the Transit of Dasa, 
Bhukti and selected Antara and also of Sun supports the event. 
Same procedure is to be followed for the selection of 
Sookshama and Prana Lords. These Lords have to sig- 
nify relevant cusps. For Sooksama and Prana lords tran- 
sit of Sun and Moon plays very significant role.

244 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

2. Accuracy of Ascendant: 

• Jupiter, Ketu, Rahu and Jupiter are the Planets that co 
rule the Ascendant. It can be seen that all these Planets 
signify 1 or 7 or 10. 

Let us take the case of SSL Jupiter who has no PS . Jupiter 
is in Mercury Star and Saturn Sub. Mercury appears in 7 
and Saturn appears in 10 and is placed in 1 with PS. 
Thus we see that Jupiter is linked with 1, 7 and 10. 

• Moon Star of the Native is Sun who is in the Star of 
Jupiter (SSL of Ascendant). 

• Ascendant rises in male sign. For Male horoscope the 
SS arc of the Ascendant has to be in first half. Here the 

SS arc is 28.72%. 

We therefore conclude that the Ascendant satisfies the 
necessary conditions. 

3. Genetical Connections: 

• Mother's Moon Star is Moon. Here we find that the SSL 
of 4th cusp is Moon. 

• Father's Moon Star is Rahu. In the chart Rahu is in the 
Sub of Mars who is the SSL of 9th cusp. 

• Wife's Moon Star is Mercury. The SSL of 7th cusp is 
Jupiter who is in Mercury Star. 

• Younger sister's Moon Star is Jupiter. SSL of 3rd cusp is 
Sun who is in Jupiter Star. 

We find that the chart establishes all genetical connections. 

4. Verification of Events:

• He left for oversea trip on 10 July 1860 when he 
was running the period of Rah-Rah- Jupiter-Moon-

Jupiter. 

• Antra and Prana Lord Jupiter is in Mercury Star 
which appears in relevant cusps 9 and 12. Jupiter is 
in the Sub of Saturn which appears in the relevant 
Cusp 3. 

Jupiter is in the SS of Jupiter which appears in 3. 

• SookshmaLord Moon is in Sun Star and Venus Sub 
andSS. 

Sun appears in relevant cusps 3 and 9. Venus appears 
in relevant cusps 3, 9 and 12. 

• Thus the Dasa potential justifies the event 

Let us verify whether the transit of Jupiter, Sun and 
Moon justifies the event. 

Transit of Jupiter: 

ETr Jupiter on 10 July 1860 at 09.00 hrs transits in 
Moon Sign, Sat Star, Sun Sub and Moon SS. 

We have seen above that Moon in the chart signifies 
relevant cusps 3, 9 and 12. 

• Saturn appears in 3, Sun appears in 3 and 9 

• Thus we find that ETr Jupiter allows the event to 
take place. 

Transit of Sun: 

• ETr Sun transits in Mercury Sign, Jupiter Star, Ketu 
Sub and Sat SS. 

Mercury appears in 9 and 12 in the natal chart. 

• Star Lord Jupiter in the Natal chart signifies relevant 
cusps3, 9 and 12. 

• Ketu in the natal chart represents Moon who in the 
natal chart signifies 3, 9 and 12. 



246 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

• Saturn appears in 3rd cusp in the natal chart. 

• Thus we find that ETr Sun allows the event to take 
place. 

Transit of Moon: 

• ETr Moon transits in Jupiter Sign and Mercury Star. 
Both these Planets are related to the desired cusps 
3, 9 and 12 as discussed above. 

Conclusion: Dasa Potential as well as Transit justifies 
the Event of visit abroad. 

B. Death of Father: 

• The native lost his father on 14 Dec 1861 (approx 
09.30 hrs) when he was running the Dasa period of 
Rahu-Rahu- Venus-Mercury-Mercury. 

Dasa and Bhukti lord Rahu is in Moon Star and 
Mars Sub. 

Moon appears in 4 (8th from 9) and Mars appears 
in 4 and 9 (Ascendant for Father). 

Thus we find that Dasa and Bhukti lord satisfies 
the necessary condition. 

Rahu is in the SS of Venus who appears in both 
Maraka and Badhaka houses with respect to 9. 

• We, therefore, say that Rahu also satisfies the 
essential condition. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 247 



Antara lord Venus has PS and as stated above it 
appears in both Maraka and Badhaka houses from 
9. 

Venus is in Mars Star, Mars appears in 1 and 8 from 
9. 

Venus is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 3 
(both Maraka and Badhaka for 9). 

Venus is in the SS of Mars that appears in 1 and 8 
from 9. 

Thus we say that Venus satisfies the necessary as 
well as essential condition to cause death of Father. 

Sookshama and Prana lord Mercury is in Saturn 
Star who appears in 2, 7 and 8 from 9. 

Mercury is in the Sub of Venus who appears in 2 
and 7 from 9. 

Mercury is in the SS of Mercury who appears in 12 
from 9. 

Thus Mercury satisfies the necessary and essential 
condition to cause death of Father. 

Let us verify the transit of Dasa Period Lords, and 
Jupiter, Saturn, Sun and Moon on the day of Death. 
Fig 13.5 shows the event chart (14 Dec 1861 at 
09.30.04 hrs.).

Answers of Practice Exercises 251 



Transit of Dasa and Bhukti Lord Rahu: 

• ETr Rahu transits in Sign of Jupiter who appears in 
3 (both Maraka and Badhaka for 9). 

Jupiter in the Natal chart is in Mercury Star who 
appears in 9 (Ascendant for Father) and in the Sub 
of Saturn who appears in 2, 7 and 8 from 9. 

• ETr Rahu transits in the Star of Ketu which in the 
Natal chart represents Moon and Saturn. Moon 
appears in 8 from 9 and Saturn appears in 2, 7 and 
8 from 9. 

• ETr Rahu transits in Sub of Mercury who appears 
in 12 from 9. Mercury in the Natal chart is in Saturn 
Star and Venus Sub. Saturn appears in 2, 7 and 8 
from 9 and Venus appears in 2 and 7 from 9. 

• ETr Rahu transits in SS of Mars who appears in 1 
and 8 from 9. 

In Natal chart Mars is in Venus Star and Saturn Sub. 
As stated above, both Venus and Saturn appear in 
relevant cusps. 

• Thus we find that ETr Rahu fully supports the event 
of death of Father. 

Transit of Antara Lord Venus: 

ETr Venus on the day of death transits in the Sign of 
Saturn, Star of Moon, Sub and Sub-Sub of Mercury. As 
stated above Saturn, Moon and Mercury either appear 
in relevant cusps or are significators of relevant cusps. 

Transit of Sookshama and Prana Lord Mercury: 

ETr Mercury transits in the Sign of Mars, Star of Saturn, 
Sub and Sub-Sub of Jupiter. As stated above all these 
Planets either appear in relevant cusps or are significators 
of relevant cusps in the Natal chart. 



252 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



Transit of Jupiter: 

For significant events ETr Jupiter needs to transit in the 
Sign, Star, Sub and SS the lords of which should appear 
in relevant cuspal positions in the Natal chart or be 
significators of relevant cusps in the Natal chart. 

On the day of death of native's father ETr Jupiter transits 
in Mercury Sign, Sun Star, Saturn Sub and Moon SS. 
We have discussed above that Planets Mercury, Saturn 
and Moon either appear in relevant cusps in the Natal 
chart or are significators of relevant cusps that can inflict 
death of father. 

Sun in the Natal chart is in Jupiter Star that appears in 3 
(both Maraka and Badhaka for 9).Sun is in the Sub of 
Mercury that appears in 1 and 12 from 9. 

Thus we find that ETr Jupiter supports the Event. 

Transit of Saturn: 

Death usually takes place when ETr Saturn transits in 
the Sign, Star, Sub, and SS the lords of which appear in 
2, 7, Badhaka and 8th house from the Ascendant or are 
significators of these houses in the Natal chart. 

On the day of death of native's father ETr Saturn was 
transiting in Mercury Sign, Sun Star, Rahu Sub and Ketu 
SS . We have discussed above that all these Planets either 
appear in death inflicting houses of Father or are 
significators of these houses in the Natal chart. 

Transit of Sun: 

• ETr Sun transits in Jupiter Sign, Ketu Star, Ketu 
Sub and Jupiter SS. We have discussed above that 
both Jupiter and Ketu are related to the relevant 
cusps. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 253 

• ETr Sun transits in Ketu Star who in the Natal chart 
represents Moon the SS of 4th cusp (8th from 9). 

• Thus we find that ETr Sun allows the event of death 
of Father. 

Transit of Moon: 

• ETr Moon transits in Mars Sign, Sun Star, Moon 
Sub and Venus SS . All these Planets signify relevant 
cusps or appear in relevant cusps. 

• SSL of 4th cusp (8th from 9) is Moon, who in the 
Natal chart is in Sun Star. ETr Moon also transits 
in Sun Star. 

• We conclude that the transit of Moon justifies the 
event. 

C: Marriage: 

• Marriage is promised to the native because the SSL 
of Ascendant and SSL of 7th cusp is Jupiter who is in 
Mercury Star that appears in 7. 

• The native got married on 10 Mar 1863 when he was 
running the Dasa period of Rahu-Jupiter-Saturn-Rahu- 
Venus. 

• Dasa and Sookshama Lord Rahu is in Moon Star and 
Mars Sub. Moon appears in the Primary cusp 7 and Mars 
appears in 7 as well as in 1 1 . Rahu is in the SS of Venus 
that appears in the relevant cusp 5. 

• Bhukti Lord Jupiter is in Mercury Star who appears in 
relevant cusps 7 and 1L Jupiter is in the Sub of Saturn 
who appears in 1 (Bhava with PS) , 2, 3, 4, 8, and 10. 
Cusp 2 and 10 are not favourable to 7. 



254 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



You may think that Jupiter Bhukti is not very favourable 
to enact the event of marriage since the Sub lord of Jupiter 
does not appear in supporting cusps. But in this case we 
would be missing a very important point. Ketu who 
represents Saturn is placed in 7th Bhava. Ketu is not 
appearing in 7th cuspal position but it is Planet Ketu that 
is placed in 7th Bhava. Placement of Rahu or Ketu in a 
Bhava is as good as the placements of the Planets that Rahu 
or Ketu represents. However the appearance of Rahu or 
Ketu in cuspal positions can not be replaced by the Planets 
that Rahu or Ketu represents. Those positions specify 
zodiacal positions. Since Saturn in this chart has PS and 
Ketu as Saturn is placed in 7 it allows Jupiter Bhukti to 
enact marriage. 

• Thus Jupiter has the capability of enacting marriage. 

• Antara Lord Saturn is in Ketu Star who is placed in 7th 
Bhava. Saturn is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 5, 
7 and 11. Saturn is in the SS of Venus who appears in the 
relevant cusp 5. 

• Prana Lord Venus is in Mars Star who appears in 7 and 
11. Venus is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 5, 7 
and 11. Venus is in the SS of Mars (7 and 11). 

Thus we find that the Dasa period justifies the event of 
marriage. Let us see if transit on the day of marriage 
supports the event or not. Fig 13.6 is the event chart for 
marriage.

258 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspaf Interlinks Theory 



Transit of Dasa Lord and Sookshama Lord Rahu: 

• ETr Rahu on the day of marriage transits in Mars 
Sign, Mercury Star, Mercury Sub and Saturn SS. 

Both Mars and Mercury appear in relevant cusps 7 
and 11 in the natal chart. 

Saturn in the Natal chart is in Ketu Star and Jupiter 
Sub. Ketu is placed in 7 and Jupiter appears in 5, 7 
and 11 in the natal chart. 

• Thus ETr Rahu supports the Event of marriage. 
Transit of Bhukti Lord Jupiter: 

• ETr Jupiter transits in Venus Sign, Mars Star, Venus 
Sub and Saturn SS. 

• We have seen above that marriage took place in the 
Prana of Venus because it signifies relevant cusps. 

• Mars appears in 7 and 11 in the natal chart. 

• Saturn signifies relevant cusps as seen above. 

• Thus ETr Jupiter supports the event of marriage. 
Transit of Antara Lord Saturn: 

• ETr Saturn transits in Mercury Sign, Moon Star, 
Mars Sub and Rahu SS. 

• We have discussed above that Mercury and Mars 
appear in relevant cusps 5 and 1 1 . Moon is the Sub 
lord of the 7th cusp in the natal chart. 

• Rahu in the natal chart is in Moon Star and Mars 
Sub. 

• Thus we find that ETr Saturn supports the event of 
marriage. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 259 



Transit of Prana Lord Venus: 

• ETr Venus transits in Jupiter Sign, Mercury Star, 
Ketu Sub and Moon SS. 

• We have discussed above that all these Planets either 
appear in the revant cuspal positions in the natal 
chart or signify the relevant cuspal positions in the 
natal chart. 

• Thus ETr Venus supports the event of marriage. 
TVanritof Sun: 

• ETr Sun transits in Saturn Sign, Jupiter Star, Venus 
SubandRahuSS. 

• All these Planets either appear in relevant cuspal 
positions or signify relevant cusps in the natal chart. 

• Thus ETr Sun justifies the event of marriage. 
Transit of Moon: 

• ETr Moon transits in Venus Sign, Jupiter Star, Venus 
SubandRahu SS. 

• Thus we see that ETr Moon also justifies the event 
of marriage. 

Conclusion: Both the Dasa period Lords and transit 
agree and justifies the event of marriage. 

D: Operation to remove Appendix: 

Anatomical location of Appendix is represented by 6th 
house. If the native has to undergo surgical operation on 
any part represented by 6th house then the SSL of 6th 
cusp should be linked through its Star lord (or by PS) with 
the 8th cusp and the SSL of the 8th cusp should be linked 
through its Star lord (or by PS) with 6th cusp. 



260 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

• In the natal chart Fig 13.4 Ketu is the SS of the 6th cusp. 

• Ketu is in Saturn Star who is the SSL of 8th cusp. 

Saturn is the SSL of 8th cusp who is in Ketu Star. Ketu 
is the Sub as well as the SS of the 6th cusp. 

• Thus we find that chart promises surgical operation on 
the parts of the body represented by 6th house. 

The event of surgical operation happens during the 
Sookshama and Prana the lords of which signify 1, house 
where surgery is to be performed, and 8. 

• On 24 Jun 1902 the native was running the Sookshama 
of Ketu and Prana of Mercury. 

• Ketu has PS and as such signifies 6 and 1 (Star lord of 
Ascendant Sub & Sub Sub of 6). 

Ketu is in the Star of Saturn who is SSL of 8 (surgery). 
Ketu is in the Sub of Moon who appears in 6 (Appendix). 

Ketu is in the SS of Mercury who appears in 8 (surgery) 
and 12 (Hospitalisation). Mercury also appears in 
relevant cusp 11 for recovery. 

• Prana Lord Mercury is in Saturn Star who is the SSL of 
8th cusp (surgery) .Mercury is in the Sub of Venus who 
appears in 6 (Appendix). 

• Mercury is in the SS of Mercury who appears in 8, 12, 
and 11. 

• SSL of Mercury appearing in 8 and 12 along with 11 
promises delayed recovery. 

Transit of Sun: 

• ETr Sun transits in Mercury Sign and Rahu Star. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 261 



• Mercury appears in 8 and it is the Prana Lord at the 
time of event. 

• Rahu appears in l.Rahu represents Moon and 
Saturn. Moon appears in 6 and 8. Saturn appears in 

8. 

• Thus ETr Sun justifies the event. 
Transit of Moon: 

• ETr Moon transits in Saturn Sign and Moon Star. 

• Saturn is the SSL of 8th cusp (surgery). 

• Moon is the Star lord of 6th cusp and is placed in 
8th Bhava. 

• Thus ETr Moon justifies the event of surgical 
operation.

The native lost his mother on 22 Jan 1901 at 18.30 hrs. He 
was running the Dasa period of Sat-Ven-Ven-Sat-Mars. 

Operation of Dasa and Sookshama Lord Saturn: 

• Saturn is in Ketu Star and Jupiter Sub. 

Ketu appears in 4 (Ascendant for mother) and 
Jupiter appears in 1 1 (8th from 4) . 

• Saturn is in the SS of Venus who appears in 2, 7 
and Badhaka houses from Ascendant of mother. 

• Thus Saturn satisfies the necessary and essential 
condition for causing death of mother. 

Operation of Bhukti and Antara Lord Venus: 

• Venus has PS and appears in 2, 7 and Badhaka 
houses from the Ascendant of mother.

mother's Ascendant 

• Thus Venus justifies the necessary and essential 
condition for causing death of mother. 

Operation of Prana Lord Mars: 

• Mars has PS. It appears in 1 and from mother's 
Ascendant. 

• Mars is in the Sub of Saturn who appears in 7, 12 
and Badhaka house from mother's Ascendant. 

• Mars is in the SS of Rahu who appears in 7 & 8 
from mother's Ascendant. 

• Thus Mars satisfies the necessary and essential 
condition. 

• Conclusion: Dasa period Lords justify the death 
of mother. 

Native Becomes King: 

On the day of death of mother he was running the Dasa 
period Sat-Ven-Ven-Sat-Mars and on that day he 
becomes the King. 

A person occupies status as high as that of the head 
of a country during the period of Planets that are 
linked with 1, 2, 6, 10 and 11 



Answers of Practice Exercises 263 



• Saturn has PS and as such it signifies 1, 2 and 10. 
Saturn is in the Star of Ketu who appears in 1 and 
6. Saturn is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 11 

Thus Dasa and Sookshama lord Saturn is linked 
with 1, 2, 6, lOand 1 1 . Saturn is in the SS of Venus 
who appears in relevant cusps 2, 6 and 10. 

• Bhukti and Antara Lord Venus has PS and as such 
signifies relevant cusps 2, 6 and 10. Venus is in 
Mars Star who appears in 1 and 1 1 . 

Venus is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears in 
relevant cusps 1 and 1 1 . 

Venus is in the SS of Mars who appears in relevant 
cusp 11. Thus we find that Bhukti and Antara Lord 
justify the event. 

• Prana Lord Mars has PS and appears in 11. Mars 
is in Venus Star who appears in relevant cusps v 2, 6 
and 10. 

Mars is in the Sub of Saturn who appears in 1, 2 
and 10. 

Mars is in the SS of Rahu who appears in 11. 

Conclusion: Thus we find Dasa period lords justify the 
Event. 

Fig 13.7 is the event chart for death of mother and Native 
becoming the King. Readers may check that transit of Dasa period 
lords, Sun and Moon supports the Event.

270 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 



Operation of Dasa Period Lords: 

• Dasa Lord Saturn has PS and appears in 1,2 and 
8. Saturn is in Ketu Star that appears in l.Ketu 
represents Moon who appears in 2, 7 (both Maraka 
and Badhaka) and 8. Thus Saturn signifies 1, 2, 7 
and 8. Saturn is in the Sub of Jupiter who appears 
in 1 and 7, Saturn is in SS of Venus who appears in 
2 and 8. 

Thus Saturn is fully competent to cause death of 
the native. 

• Bhukti, Antara and Sookshama Lord Jupiter has 
no PS . Jupiter is in the Star of Mercury who appears 
in 7 and 8Jupiter is in the Sub of Saturn who has 
PS & appears in 1,2 and 8. Jupiter is in the SS of 
Jupiter who appears in relevant cusp 7 (both Maraka 
and Badhaka). 

Thus we find that Jupiter is linked with all the 
relevant death inflicting houses. 

• Prana Lord Venus has PS and appears in 2 and 
8. Venus is in Mars Star who is placed in 1 and 
appears in 7. Thus Venus signifies all the death 
inflicting houses. Venus is in the Sub of Jupiter and 
SS of Mars. Both these Planets appear in relevant 
cusps. 

Conclusion: Dasa period lords clearly justify the event 
of death. 

Readers may see from Fig 13.8 that transit of Dasa period 
lords supports the event. 



Answers of Practice Exercises 271 



Death of the native took place on the day when Moon was 
transiting in Mercury Star who incidentally is also the Prana 
lord at the time of death. In the natal chart SSL of 8th cusp is 
Saturn. In the natal chart Mercury is in Saturn Star. Thus the 
Moon Star lord on the day of death is as per the SSL of the 8th 
cusp. 



Appendix A: 
Concept of Zero Longevity 

The timing of an event is done using the following principles: 

1 . The Planets co-ruling the Ascdt at the moment an event 
happens have to be linked with the relevant cusps that 
take part in enacting an event. 

2. The Sub and Sub-Sub lord of the Ascdt should establish 
relationship with the Moon's Star lord at that moment. 

3. The Planets co-ruling the Moon's position in the event 
chart (Dasa Period Lords) should be linked with the 
Primary and supporting cusps. 

Horoscope and Human Birth: 

It is believed that the birth of human beings take place in 
accordance with the theory of Reincarnation. It states that the human 
beings take birth in accordance with his/her past karmas and future 
dispositions. 

The Astrological Birth time is taken to be that moment when 
the individual soul takes possession of the body which the soul 
itself has got created. At this particular moment a particular degree 
rises on the Ascdt at the place of birth. Each Planet occupies a 
particular Zodiacal position and a particular house position. The 
Planets co-ruling the Ascdt and other cuspal positions together with 
the Planets Zodiacal and house positions bear correspondence with 
the native's past karmas and future dispositions. 

No event takes place without the inter play of Sun and Moon. 
On the basis of these concepts we fix the Ascdt for the native for a 



Appendix A: Concept of Zero Longevity 273 



correct horoscope. Since the birth of a child takes place when the 
father of the child runs the joint period of Planets that are fruitful 
significators of 2, 5 and 1 1 we say that the Ascdt of the child should 
be co-ruled by Planets that are linked to 10, 5 and 7 houses (i.e 2, 
5, and 11 from 9). 

Fixing Zero Longevity Chart: 

Using the above concepts we can fix the chart for the time of 
death of the native or any of his relation that bears genitical 
connection with the native. Since it is the chart of the moment 
when the soul leaves the body it has to be the chart of zero longevity 
i.e zero life. 

Conditions for the formation of the Death Time Ascdt: 

A. The Ascdt at the time of death is formed by the Planets 
that co-rule the 8th cusp or the Ascdt in the natal chart of 
the native and are linked through their Star and Sub or 
by positional status with the 8th cusp. 

B . The Planets placed in the 8th cusp and linked with the 
8th cusp and the Ascdt in the natal chart. 

C. Strong significators of 8th cusp, Maraka houses and 
Badhaka house. 

Significations of Death Chart: 

1 . The Planets co-ruling the Death Time Ascdt (formed as per 
conditions stated above in A, B and C) have to be linked with 
houses 1, 8, 2, 7 and Badhaka. 

2. Dasa Period Lords in the Death Time Chart have also to be 
linked with 1, 8, 2, 7 and Badhaka. 

3. SSL of the 8th cusp in the Death Time Chart has to be linked 
with the Moon's star lord at that time. 



274 Key to Learn Sub Sub & Cuspal Interlinks Theory 

4. Moon's Star lord on the day of Death is fixed by the SSL of 
the 8th cusp in the Natal Chart. 

Moon's Star lord on the day of death can be: 

a. The same Planet which is the SSL of the 8th cusp. 

b. The same Planet which is the Star lord of the SSL of the 
8th cusp. 

c. Any Planet whose Star lord is the same Planet who is 
the Star lord of the SSL of the 8th cusp. 

For example let Saturn be the SSL of the 8th cusp in a natal 
chart. Let Saturn be in the Star of Jupiter. On the day of death 
Moon's Star lord can be: 

A. Saturn B. Jupiter and C. Any Planet in the natal chart 
who is in the Star of Jupiter. 

Note: In some cases Moon Star on the day of death may be 
other than that stated above. But that Star lord has to be a 
Planet that links with 1 and 8 cusps or signify Maraka and 
Badhaka houses and should bear relationship with the Moon's 
Star lord as fixed by the natal chart. 

Let us try to explain this through an example. 

Refer Case Study 1. We have explained how the natal chart 
justifies Twin Deaths .We will here analyse the death time charts 
for father and the native. 

Fig CS1 is the natal chart of the native. Fig CS2 is the death 
time chart of father and Fig CS3 is the death time chart of native. 

Analysis Chart of Fig CS2-Fathers Death Time Chart: 

In the Natal chart (Fig CS1) the 4th cusp i.e. 8th from 9th is 
co-ruled by Planets Ju-Mer-Sat-Sun. The Ascdt in death time chart 
(Fig CS2) is co-ruled by Planets Mer-Rahu-Sun-Sat. Remember in 



Appendix A: Concept of Zero Longevity 275 



Chart (Fig CS1) Rahu represents Sat. These Planets are linked to 
houses 1 , 8 and also to Maraka or Badhaka houses in chart Fig CS 1 
as well as in chart Fig CS2. The Ascdt Sub lord Sun and Sub-Sub 
lord Sat are linked to Moon's Star lord Sun on the day of death in 
chart Fig CS2. The Dasa period lords in chart Fig CS2 are all linked 
to 1 , 8 and also to Maraka and Badhaka houses. 

Analysis Chart Fig CS3-Native's death Time Chart: The 

Ascdt in this chart is co-ruled by Planets Moon-Mer-Sat-Sat. In 
the Natal chart Fig CS 1 these Planets appear in 8th cusp. Remember 
Rahu in the Natal Chart represents Sat. All these Planets in the 
Natal Chart Fig CS 1 are linked with cusps 1 and 8. In Death Time 
chart Fig CS3 also these Planets are linked with 1 and 8. Sub and 
Sub-Sub lord of Ascdt in Chart Fig CS3 establishes relationship 
with Moon Star lord Sun because Sun in this Chart is in the Sub of 
Sat. 

The Planets co-ruling the position of Moon in Chart Fig CS3 
are all linked with relevant cusps that are 1,8 and Maraka Badhaka 
houses. The Sookshama lord at the time of death in chart Fig CS3 
is Sun and the Prana lord is Mercury. Both these Planets are linked 
with 1 and 8. 

Moon's Star lord on the day of death is Sun who is the Star 
lord of the SSL of the 8th cusp in chart Fig CS3 and also the Star 
lord of SSL of the 8th cusp in chart Fig CS1. 



Appendix B: 
Primary and Supporting Cusps 



You may find in the attachment Tables which may help you 
in deciding Primary and Supporting Cusps or houses for specific 
events. These Tables have been slightly modified from the Tables 
which appear in Appendix A of Horary Book to suit technique used 
to analyse Natal Chart. 

Concept of Primary cusp 

We know each house is assigned specific significations. When 
we analyse a horoscope for a specific event we look into the 
significations of houses and conclude that this event refers to a 
specific signification of a specific house. We then say that this is 
the Primary house or cusp for this event. 

Supporting Cusps or Houses 

These are those cusps which take part in enacting the 
event.Selection of these houses depends upon the nature of the 
event. 

Note: You may note that under the column Supporting cusps 
some houses are shown in brackets. These houses play a significant 
role in determining the promise of the event along with the Primary 
cusp. We will discuss its philosophy in future lesson.
