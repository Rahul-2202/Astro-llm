Dedication 

This book is humbly dedicated to the lotus feet of three great men from 
whom I learnt Jyotish: 

1. Sri P. Venkata Subrahmanyachalapathi Rao (my father and my first 
guru), 

2. Dr. B. V. Raman (immortal author who rendered yeoman service to 
Jyotish), and, 

3. Pt. Sanjay Rath (author, my guru and founder of "Sri Jagannath Vedic 
Centre"). 
My only qualification for writing this book, apart from great enthusiasm 

to share my little knowledge with others, is the little knowledge I gained 
from the above three gurus. Whatever flows from my pen (or rather 
computer keyboard) is due to the knowledge and blessings I received 
from Mahavishnu and the above three great men. This book really 
belongs to them and not to me1. 

1 But any mistakes in this book are mine. 



About the author 

P.V.R. Narasimha Rao is an engineer by profession. He did his B.Tech 
in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, 
Madras (1987-1991). He did his masters at Rice University, Houston, US 
(1991-1993). He works as a software engineer near Boston, USA 

He is seriously interested in Jyotish and Sanskrit literature. His academic 
record includes two diplomas equivalent to Bachelor's degree in Sanskrit at 
a young age: Sansh-ita Bhaashaa Kovida diploma from Bharatiya Vidya 
Bhavan at an age of 10 and Sanskrita Bhaashaa Visaarada diploma, with 
distinction, from a board in Baroda at an age of 11. He is an ardent student 
of Jyotish and a designated Jyotish Guru at "Sri Jagannath Vedic Centre". 



Preface 

With the Creator said to be one of its eighteen great preceptors, Jyotish 
or Vedic astrology is thought to be as old as this creation is. There are many 
excellent books on Jyotish written in Sanskrit language by great Maharshis 
and brilliant scholars. Thanks to the yeoman service rendered by Dr. B.V. 
Raman and the efforts of other Indian astrologers to follow him, today we 
have a fair amount of Jyotish literature in English language too. 

Considering the wealth of Vedic astrology literature in Sanskrit and 
English, another book may not really be needed. Even if another book is 
needed, there are many erudite scholars who are better equipped than me 
to write. Nevertheless, I wanted, like a parrot that enthusiastically repeats 
the few words learnt by it, to share with fellow students the little knowledge 
I received from classics and from my gurus. 

In this book, I have covered divisional charts, special ascendants, 
arudhas, argalas, yogas, ashtakavarga, avasthas, a few nakshatra dasas, a 
few rasi dasas, several techniques of transit analysis, Tajaka analysis and a 
few miscellaneous topics. 

I have tried to give prominence to special ascendants, divisional charts 
and arudhas, because contemporary literature doesn't seem to give them 
the kind of importance that Sage Parasara gave. Understanding the primacy 
Parasara gave to all these concepts is a must for a renaissance in Vedic 
astrology. 

Unfortunately, some people think today that Parasara and Jaimini taught 
two totally different approaches to astrology. When we talk about arudha 
padas, argalas, chara karakas, chara dasa and other rasi dasas, people think 
of them as "Jaimini astrology". People even use terms like "Jaimini karakas" 
and "Jaimini dasas". However, all these concepts were covered by Parasara 
also (please read "Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram"). The "Parasari vs 
Jaimini" distinction is based on unfortunate misconceptions that we can do 
away with. 

In this book, I have de-emphasized these wrong distinctions and 
emphasized an integrated approach - a holistic approach - that looks at 
Vedic astrology as a whole. I really think that this is the right approach. 

In the part on dasas, I covered Vimsottari dasa and Ashtottari dasa, as 
they are the most commonly used nakshatra dasas. Kalachakra dasa was 
termed the "most respectable dasa" by Parasara and a discussion on dasas 
cannot be complete without it. In the galaxy of dasas, rasi dasas taught by 
Parasara and Jaimini have their own place and I covered two rasi dasas 



used for timing material success - Lagna Kendradi Rasi dasa and Sudasa. 
I also covered Narayana dasa, which is the most versatile rasi dasa taught 
by maharshis. For the spiritually inclined, I included Drigdasa, which can 
help us in timing events in one's spiritual evolution. Because of the importance 
of the topic of longevity, I covered two ayur dasas - Shoola dasa and Niryaana 
Shoola Dasa. 

In the part on transits, I covered the interpretation of transits based on 
the natal positions of planets in rasi chart and divisional charts. I covered 
some techniques based on ashtakavarga and sodhya pindas. I also covered 
several techniques related to transits in nakshatras. 

In the part on Tajaka, I covered the casting of Tajaka annual, monthly 
and sixty-hour charts, their interpretation, Tajaka yogas and three dasas 
used for timing events in Tajaka charts. Some scholars may validly question 
why Tajaka system is being covered in a book on Vedic astrology. There 
are no references to it in the works of Parasara, Jaimini and other maharshis. 
The oldest reference to these techniques to be found in the works of a 
respected authority on Vedic astrology is in Tajaka Neelakanthi, a work 
by Neelakantha who also wrote a celebrated commentary on "Jaimini 
Sutras". His coverage of Tajaka system lends some authenticity to the 
system. One can only speculate whether Parasara talked about this system 
in parts that are possibly missing today. I simply followed the precedent set 
by illustrious scholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and Dr. B.V. 
Raman. 

When we rely on finer techniques of Vedic astrology - such as divisional 
charts and special lagnas - for finer predictions, it is crucial to have an 
accurate birthtime. The chapter "Impact of Birthtime Error" shows how to 
cope with birthtime inaccuracies. 

While I am upset with the dismissal of astrology by some critics as a 
'superstition', I am equally, if not more, upset with the irrational and 
unscientific attitude of some astrologers. In an effort to promote rational 
thinking in the astrological community, I included a chapter on "Rational 
Thinking". 

A very brief introduction to some special topics such as remedial 
measures, mundane astrology and muhurtas is provided in this book and it is 
hoped that interested readers will pursue these topics further by referring to 
other textbooks. 

Vedic astrology is considered a sacred subject and Maharshi Parasara 
warned us against sharing this knowledge with unworthy people. Ancient 
sages laid down some rules for the ethical behavior of a Vedic astrologer. I 
earnestly hope that all the readers of this book will appreciate those rules. 



To that end, I added a chapter on "Ethical Behavior of a Jyotishi". 
While no particular topic has been covered in great depth, key 

fundamentals are covered in this book. Most fundamental concepts and 
computations are clearly defined with examples and their uses are briefly 
outlined. But I do not want to bill this as a comprehensive introduction for 
beginners. There are parts of this book that can be followed even by beginners, 
but an average beginner may find it overwhelming in many places. For most 
part, this book is for intermediate level students who already have a good 
background, but are in need of integrating and consolidating their knowledge. 
However, there are some points in some places that can be appreciated 
only by advanced scholars. So I will not make any claims on who will find 
this book useful. Rather than targeting readership with a specific level of 
knowledge, I tried to write a more or less self-sufficient book that covers a 
wide spectrum of topics. Beginners should read this book very carefully, 
and more than once, to completely understand various concepts. Though I 
have tried to maintain some level of clarity, I squeezed in a lot of material 
and beginners should patiently read, re-read and practice. 

Due to my background in engineering, I tried to adopt a style somewhat 
similar to the one used in mathematics and physics textbooks. I tried to be 
concise and always to the point. I gave plenty of examples and even some 
exercises. I hope that students will read the material and examples carefully 
and attempt the exercises sincerely. I hope that the astrological community 
will accept this new style of astrology teaching. 

In this book, I did not try to steer clear of the controversies plaguing 
Vedic astrology. As my purpose in writing this book is to chronicle my broad 
understanding of Jyotish in a clear and concise fashion and to give clear 
guidance to fellow students, I stated my views clearly except in issues in 
which I do not have a firm opinion. 

This book probably contains some fine knowledge, due to the blessings 
I received from my gurus, arid some wrong knowledge as well, due to the 
limitations of my intelligence. Giving fine knowledge to unworthy students 
and feeding wrong knowledge to worthy students are both mistakes and I 
am aware that I may be committing both. I beg for the forgiveness of my 
gurus, maharshis and gods. 

A free computer software program written by me called "Jagannatha 
Hora Lite" is available for a free download on SJVC website (http:// 
www.sjvc.net). It can compute the positions of all planets, upagrahas, lagna, 
special lagnas, arudha padas and ashtakavarga for twenty divisional charts. 
It supports several popular ayanamsas. It gives Shadbalas, Vimsottari, 
Ashtottari and Kalachakra dasas and also gives Tajaka annual charts, 



Patyayini dasa, Mudda dasa, Panchavargeeya Bala and Sahams. Those 
who have a computer with a Microsoft operating system (Windows 95 or 
later) can download and use this software. 

As I devoted most of my free time in the last few years to astrology 
reading, research and writing, my wife Padmaja, my daughter Sriharini and 
my son Sriharish made a personal sacrifice and co-operated with my 
astrological activities. I am thankful to them for their co-operation. 

I cannot possibly conclude this preface without expressing my deep 
gratitude for my guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of 
enlightenment, encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to 
him. I express my gratitude to all the elders and well-wishers whose blessings 
gave me the energy to finish this book. I hope that I will be forgiven for any 
mistakes and that I will continue to receive their kind blessings. I will always 
be eager to correct my mistakes. 

May Jupiter's light shine on us,

Part 1: Chart 
Analysis 

Several important principles and techniques of chart analysis are 
explained in this part. This part forms the basis for the rest of the book. 

Based on the positions of all the planets at the time of birth, several 
charts are prepared. They go by the names - "rasi chart" and "divisional 
charts". Based on the analysis of these charts, several conclusions can be 
drawn regarding the results that can be given by different planets to the 
native. This part covers the analysis and judgment of these charts. 

It can help if the reader has basic understanding and prior knowledge of 
Vedic or western astrology, but it is not really required. This part is intended 
to be self-sufficient. However, bear in mind that extra reading can only do 
good! 



1. Basic Concepts 

1.1 What is astrology 
Planets in the skies are constantly in motion with respect to earth . The 

positions of Sun, Moon and some planets close to earth can give important 
clues about the fortunes of individual human beings and groups of human 
beings. That is the basic premise of astrology. How exactly we can make 
guesses about the fortunes of individual human beings and groups of human 
beings based on the positions of those planets in the skies is the question 
that we will attempt to answer in this book. While astrology is the subject 
that deals with this question, there are many theories and philosophies in 
vogue and they are significantly different from each other. 

Sunsign astrology, for example, is based on categorizing people into 
twelve groups based on the solar month of birth. Some people may be 
convinced, based on their experiences, that people born in the same month 
share certain qualities. It is, however, not very logical from a rational 
perspective - there are just too many people in this world, who are totally 
different from each other. So the month of one's birth is totally inadequate 
for guessing one's nature or fortune. Even the date and the hour of birth are 
not enough. We know that there are many twins in this world, who are 
significantly different from each other! 

What we mentioned just now is, by the way, a very important question 
to be answered - it is like an "acid test" for any astrological doctrine. It is a 
known fact that there are many twins in this world, who are significantly 
different from each other and who lead totally different lives. Of course, 
some twins may have some common qualities between them, but the fact 
remains that several twins are significantly different. An astrological doctrine 
should be capable of explaining this fact in order to be considered as a 
meaningful subject. 

Most astrological doctrines of the world fail this acid test. If an 
astrological doctrine assumes, like in the case of many popular astrological 
theories of the world, that two persons born within a couple of hours in 
nearby towns will have the same fortune, then that doctrine is obviously 
lacking in completeness and inadequate for confident use in real-life. It fails 
the acid test of twins. 
1.2 Indian Astrology 

Materialistically speaking, India may not be a rich country today, but 
India has an extremely rich cultural heritage. The depth of some of India's 
ancient knowledge (like astrology) is just amazing and it makes one wonder 
if the history of this great civilization is correctly represented in the pages of 



4 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

modern history. Indian Astrology is the most comprehensive and complete 
system of astrology available today and it is the only one that comes close to 
answering the just mentioned "twins puzzle". It can explain how twins can 
be different. The principles used in India's astrology are so sensitive to 
changes in birthtime that people born within 1-2 minutes can be significantly 
different in some aspects and similar in some others. This approach 
distinguishes between what a person truly is, what a person wants to be, 
what he thinks he is and what the world thinks he is. It has enough parameters, 
tools, techniques and degrees of freedom to model the extremely complicated 
human life. 

This astrological approach is known in the world by many names. Early 
pioneers of modern Indian astrology, like Dr. B.V. Raman, called it "Hindu 
astrology", because this system was first taught by ancient Hindu sages. 
However, some people do not like this expression because "Hindu" is not a 
Sanskrit word. This word was later coined by the western invaders from 
the name of a river flowing on the northwestern border of India (river 
"Sindhu" or "Indus"). They used the word "Hindu" to describe the land and 
the people on the eastern side of this river. 

The religion practiced by a majority of Indians is known as "Hindu" 
religion today, but the fact is that there is no name for this religion in India's 
Sanskrit language, the language in which most of the literature of this religion - 
and astrology - appeared! Most other religions are known by the name of 
their main propagator, but India's ancient religion had no single propagator 
or prophet. This religion consisted of knowledge that revealed itself to spiritual 
masters of many generations. So there was no name for this religion and 
the word "Hindu" coined by western invaders was accepted by the world. 
However, as already stressed, this word finds no place in Sanskrit literature. 
Some people do not like using a non-Sanskrit word to describe India's 
astrology, considering that most of India's classical literature in astrology 
appeared in Sanskrit. 

Later day authors came up with the name - "Vedic astrology". The 
word "Vedic" means "pertaining to Vedas". Vedas are the sacred scriptures 
of, what is known today as, Hinduism and they are supposed to contain 
knowledge of all subjects. Moreover, astrology in particular is supposed to 
be a "Vedaanga" (which means a limb of Vedas). In particular, it is said to 
be the eye of the Vedas. So the name "Vedic astrology" is becoming popular 
these days. This author also suggests using "Vedic astrology" or "Jyotish" 
(meaning "science of light"). Jyotishi is a practitioner of Jyotish, i.e. a Vedic 
astrologer. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 5 

1.3    Basics 

1.3.1 Grahas (planets) 
The words "planet" and "star" are used in a slightly different sense in 

astrology than in astronomy. For example, Sun (a star) and Moon (a satellite 
of earth) are called planets in astrology, along with Mars etc. Basically, a 
graha or a planet is a body that has considerable influence on the living 
beings on earth. Distant stars have negligible influence on us, but Sun, Moon 
and planets in the solar system have a great influence on our activities. So 
the word graha (or planet) is used to describe them. 

Seven planets are considered in Indian astrology. They are - Sun, 
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. In addition, two 
"chaayaa grahas" (shadow planets) are considered in Indian astrology -
Rahu and Ketu. These are also called "the north node" and "the south 
node" respectively (or the head and tail of dragon). Rahu and Ketu are not 
real planets; they are just some mathematical points. 

Apart from these 9 planets, there are 11 moving mathematical points 
known as Upagrahas (sub-planets or satellites). We also have lagna 
(ascendant), which is the point that rises on the eastern horizon as the earth 
rotates around itself. In addition, we have some mathematical points known 
as "special ascendants". 

1.3.2 Rasis (signs) 
The positions of all these planets, upagrahas, lagna and special lagnas in 

the zodiac are measured in degrees, minutes and seconds from the start of 
the zodiac (which is a fixed point in the sky). These positions are measured 
as seen from earth and they are called "geocentric positions". For the 
positions (calculated in degrees, minutes and seconds) of planets, lagna, 
special lagnas and upagrahas, we also use the words longitude and sphuta. 
When watched from earth, the longitude of any planet in the skies can be 
from 0°0'0" (0 degrees 0 minutes 0 seconds) to 359°59'59". It should be 
noted that 0°0'0" corresponds to the beginning of the zodiac. Many western 
astrologers consider Sayana or tropical (moving) zodiac, whereas Nirayana 
or sidereal (fixed) zodiac is considered in Vedic astrology. 

The zodiac (sky) lasts 360° as mentioned above and it is divided into 12 
equal parts. They are called "rasis" (signs). English names, Sanskrit names, 
two-letter symbols and values of the start longitude and the end longitude 
(in degrees, minutes and seconds) of all twelve rasis are given in Table 1. 



6 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Table 1: Definition of Rasis 
 

Rasi name Sanskrit name Symbol Start End 
Aries Mesha Ar 0°0'0" 29°59'59" 
Taurus Vrishabha/Vrisha Ta 30°0'0" 59°59'59" 
Gemini Mithuna Ge 60°0'0" 89°59'59" 
Cancer Karkataka/Karka Cn 90°0'0" 119°59'59" 
Leo Simha Le 120°0'0" 149°59'59" 
Virgo Kanya Vi 150°0'0" 179°59'59" 
Libra Tula Li 180°0'0" 209°59'59" 
Scorpio Vrischika Sc 210°0'0" 239°59-59" 
Sagittarius Dhanus Sg 240°0'0" 269°59'59" 
Capricorn Makara Cp 270°0'0" 299°59'59" 
Aquarius Kumbha Aq 300°0'0" 329°59'59" 
Pisces Meena Pi 330°0'0" 359°59'59" 

Notation: If a planet is at 221°37', then you can find from Table 1 that it is 
between 210°0'0" and 239°59'59". So, that planet is in Scorpio (or 
Vrischika). Its advancement from the start of the rasi occupied by is 11°37'. 
Its position in the zodiac (221 °37') is shown by some people by the notation 
11°37' in Sc or simply 11 Sc37. This means "advanced by 11°37' from the 
start of Sc (Scorpio)". Some people show it as 7s 11° 37'. This means 
"after completing 7 signs, advanced by 11°37' in the 8th sign (which is 
Scorpio)". 
Exercise 1: 
Jupiter is at 94° 19'. Mercury is at 5s 17° 45'. Venus is at 25 Li 31. For each 
of these planets, find (a) the rasi occupied and (b) the advancement from 
the start of the rasi occupied 
Each rasi again has many kinds of divisions and they are called "vargas". 
They will be defined in detail later. 
1.3.3  Bhavas (houses) 

Another important concept is "house" (Sanskrit name: bhava). In each 
chart, houses can be found with respect to several reference points and 
the reference points most commonly employed are lagna and special lagnas. 
Starting from the rasi occupied by the selected reference point and proceeding 
in the regular order across the zodiac, we associate each rasi with a house 
(first, second etc). Always the rasi containing the reference point chosen is 
the lst house. Next rasi is the 2nd house. The rasi after that is the 3rd house. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 7 

We proceed until the 12th house like that. Just remember that when we 
encounter Pisces, we go to Aries after it. If no reference point is specified 
when houses are mentioned, it means that lagna is used as the reference. 
If, for example, horalagna is in Cn, first house with respect to horalagna is 
in Cn. Second house is in Le (see Table 1). Third house is in Vi. Ninth 
house is in Pi. Tenth house is in Ar. Eleventh house is in Ta. Twelfth house 
is in Ge. 
Exercise 2: 
(1) Lagna is in Cn, Sun is in Ar, Moon is in Ta and Mars is in Cp. Find the 

houses occupied by Sun, Moon and Mars. 
(2) Repeat the exercise, taking Moon as the reference point when finding 

houses. 
Different houses stand for different matters. Looking at the rasis and houses 
occupied by various planets, we can say a lot of things about the person. 
How exactly this is done will become clear in the coming chapters. 
1.3.4  Chakras (charts) 

A "chart" (Sanskrit name: chakra) is prepared with the information of 
rasis occupied by all planets. For preparing any chart, we need to first 
determine the rasis occupied by all planets, upagrahas, lagna and special 
lagnas. In the visual representation of a chart, there are 12 boxes (and some 
other visual areas) with each representing a rasi. All planets, upagrahas and 
lagnas are written in the boxes corresponding to the rasis they occupy. 

There are 3 popular ways of drawing charts in India: (1) South Indian 
style chart ruled by Jupiter, (2) North Indian style diamond chart ruled by 
Venus and (3) East Indian style Sun chart ruled by Sun. In this book, all the 
charts will be given in formats (1) and (2). 

Out of the three chart formats, (1) and (3) are rasi-based and (2) is 
bhava-based. In rasi-based chart drawing formats, a rasi is always at a 
fixed position. Ar is always in one particular position and Ta is in another 
position and so on. Planets, lagna etc are placed in the box (or the visual 
area) representing the rasi occupied by it. In bhava-based chart drawing 
formats, a bhava (house) is always at a fixed position. Lagna (denoted by 
"Asc" for ascendant) is always in a particular visual area of the chart and 
the 2nd, 3rd etc houses are in fixed positions. 
Example 1: Let us take Lord Sree Rama's rasi chart. The rasis occupied 
by planets and lagna are given below. 
Ar - Sun; Ta - Mercury; Ge - Ketu; Cn - Ascendant (lagna), Moon & 
Jupiter; Li - Saturn; Sg - Rahu; Cp - Mars; Pi - Venus.

Figure 1: Indian Chart Styles

 
Rasi chart for the above data is drawn in South Indian, North Indian 

and East Indian formats in Figure 1. In the South Indian chart, notice the 
boxes containing Ar, Ta, Ge etc. In this format, these rasis will always be in 
the same positions. The same holds for the East Indian format. The North 
Indian format is different. Note the box containing "Asc" (ascendant -
lagna). The same box will show the house containing lagna in all north 
Indian format charts. It may be Ar in one chart, Ta in another and Ge in yet 
another. The number corresponding to the rasi (1 for Ar, 2 for Ta, 3 for Ge 
and so on) is shown in the box. For example, the box with "Asc" has 4 in it 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 9 

and it shows Cn. So the 1st house is in Cn. Please note the order in which 
houses are visually arranged in this chart. The same pattern will be used in 
all charts. 
NOTE: Some people draw the east Indian format charts with an enclosing 
rectangle. 

1.3.5 Varga chakras (divisional charts) 
We saw that charts can be drawn with the information of which planet 

occupies which rasi. Based on the longitude of a planet, we can find the rasi 
occupied by it and mark its position in rasi chart. 

In addition, we have what are known as "divisional charts" (Sanskrit 
name: varga chakras). These are based on dividing rasis into 2 parts, 3 
parts, 4 parts and so on. We divide each rasi into n parts and map each part 
to a rasi again. Based on the rasis occupied by planets in these divisional 
mappings, we draw divisional charts (or harmonic charts). Each divisional 
chart throws light on a specific area of one's life. In each divisional chart, 
we find houses and analyze the chart as if it were an independent chart. 
The science of Vedic astrology stands on the basis of 4 pillars - (1) grahas 
or planets, (2) rasis or signs, (3) bhavas or houses, and, (4) varga chakras 
or divisional charts. 

1.3.6 Nakshatras (constellations) 
In Vedic astrology, the zodiac is divided into 27 nakshatras. Each 

nakshatra has a length of 360°/27 = 13° 20'. The first nakshatra, for example, 
stretches from the beginning of Aries to 13° 20' in Aries. The second nakshatra 
stretches from there to 26° 40' in Aries. The third nakshatra stretches from 
there to 10° in Taurus. The list of nakshatras with the respective starting 
and ending points is given in Table 2. The table also gives the "Vimsottari 
lords" of all nakshatras. This will be used later. 

Each nakshatra is again divided into 4 quarters. They are called padas 
(legs/feet). The length of a nakshatra pada is 3° 20'.

For the purpose of some special charts like Kota Chakra and 
Sarvatobhadra Chakra, we consider 28 nakshatras. The last quarter of 
Uttarashadha is known as "Abhijit". However, we consider 27 nakshatras 
for all other purposes. 

 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 1 1 

1.3.7 Solar Calendar 
In solar calendar, one year is the time in which Sun moves by 360° and 

one month is the time in which Sun moves by 30°. These are called "solar 
year" and "solar month" respectively. Each solar month has 30 days, where 
one day stands for exactly 1° motion of Sun). This calendar will be used in 
dasas and in Tajaka analysis. 
1.3.8 Tithis and Lunar Calendar 
1.3.8.1 Tithis 

In lunar calendar, one day stands for one tithi. Tithi or lunar day is a 
period in which the difference between the longitudes of Moon and Sun 
changes by exactly 12°. 

Table 3: Names of Tithis

When Sun and Moon are at the same longitude, a new lunar month of 
30 tithis starts. As time progresses, Moon will go ahead of Sun. When 
Moon's longitude is exactly 12° greater than Sun's longitude, the first tithi or 
lunar day finishes and the second tithi starts. When Moon's longitude is 
exactly 24° greater than Sun's longitude, the second tithi finishes and the 



12 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

third tithi starts. When Moon's longitude is exactly 36° greater than Sun's 
longitude, the third tithi finishes and the fourth tithi starts. And so on. You 
can see that Sun-Moon longitude differential will be (12 x n)° after exactly 
n tithis. 

A lunar month consists of 30 tithis. Each month is divided into two 
fortnights (pakshas). During Sukla/Suddha paksha or the brighter fortnight, 
Moon is waxing. During this paksha, Moon is ahead of Sun by an amount 
that is between 0° and 180°. During Krishna/Bahula paksha or the darker 
fortnight, Moon is waning. During this paksha, Moon is ahead of Sun by an 
amount that is between 180° and 360°. 

At the end of a month, Sun-Moon longitude differential will be (12 X 
30)°, i.e., 360°. That means that Moon will finish one cycle around the 
zodiac and catch up with Sun again. So Sun and Moon will be at the same 
longitude again. Then a new month starts. 

We can find the tithi running on a day from the longitudes of Sun and 
Moon using the following procedure. 
(1) Find the difference: (Moon's longitude-Sun's longitude). Add 360° if 

the result is negative. The result will be between 0° and 360° and will 
show how advanced Moon is with respect to Sun. 

(2) Divide this result by 12°. Ignore the remainder and take the quotient. 
(3) Add 1 to the quotient. You get a number from 1 to 30. That will give the 

index of the tithi running. 
(4) Refer to Table 3 and find the name of the tithi. There are 15 tithis and 

the same tithis repeat in the brigher and daiker fortnights. For example, 
it can be seen from the table that the 22th tithi out of the 30 tithis is in 
Krishna paksha and it is Saptami. So the 22nd tithi is "Krishna Saptami". 
We write the classification of fortnight (Sukla or Krishna) first and then 
write tithi name. "Sukla Saptami" stands for "Saptami" in the brighter 
fortnight (sukla paksha), i.e. the 7th tithi. "Krishna Saptami" stands for 
"Saptami" in the darker fortnight (krishna paksha), i.e. the 22nd tithi. 

Example 2: 
Let us say that Moon is at 24°12' in Gemini. This is (2 x 30°) + 24° 12' 

= 84° 12' from the beginning of the zodiac. 
Let us say that Sun is at 17°46' in Scorpio. This is (7 x 30°) + 17° 46' = 

227° 46' from the beginning of the zodiac. 
Moon - Sun = 84° 12' - 227° 46' = -(143° 34'). It is negative because 

Sun is at a higher longitude. We have to add 360° to it to make it positive. It 
becomes 216° 26'. So this is the advancement of Moon with respect to Sun. 
Converting this to a decimal number, we get 216.43°. We have to divide it 
by 12°. We find 216.43 / 12 and the quotient is 18. So 18 tithis are over. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 13 

Adding 1 to it, we get 19 and so the 19th tithi is running. Referring to Table 
3, we see that this is "Chaturthi" tithi of Krishna paksha (darker fortnight). 
So it is "Krishna Chaturthi". 
Exercise 3: Moon is at 14°43' in Leo. Sun is at 28°13' in Capricorn. Find 
the running tithi. 
1.3.8.2 Lunar Months 
We said that a new lunar month starts whenever Sun and Moon are at the 
same longitude. Then Moon will go ahead of Sun and, after about 29-30 
days, he will catch up with Sun again. A new lunar month will start again. 
These lunar months go by special names. The name of a lunar month is 
decided by the rasi in which Sun-Moon conjunction2 takes place. If Sun-
Moon conjoin in Pisces, for example, it starts Chaitra maasa. These names 
come from the constellation that Moon is most likely to occupy on the full 
Moon day. In the month that starts when Sun and Moon conjoin in Pisces, 
Moon is likely to be in Chitra constellation (23°20' in Virgo to 6°40' in Libra) 
on the full Moon day (15th tithi - Pournimasya). So the month is called 
Chaitra.

2 Two planets are said to be in "conjunction" if they are exactly at the same longitude. 

NOTE: However, we sometimes use this term approximately. If two planets are in 
the same sign, but not exactly at the same longitude, we still say that they are in 
conjunction. 



14 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

A solar year has about 365.2425 days, but a lunar year only has about 355 
days. Once in every 3 years, this difference accumulates to one month and 
an extra lunar month comes. This results in Sun-Moon conjunction coming 
twice in the same rasi. For example, Sun-Moon conjunction took place at 
0°23' in Taurus on May 15, 1999 at 5:35:32 pm (IST) and again at 28°29' in 
Taurus on June 14, 1999 at 12:33:27 am (IST). Sun-Moon conjunction in 
Taurus starts Jyeshtha maasa (maasa = month) as per Table 4. So 1999 had 
2 Jyeshtha maasas. One is called "Nija" Jeshtha maasa and the other is 
called "Adhika" Jyeshtha maasa. Nija means real and adhika means extra. 
An adhika maasa (extra month) comes once in every 3 years and that 
synchronizes the lunar years with solar years. This calendar has been in use 
in India for millennia. 
1.3.9       Yogas 
Add the longitudes of Sun and Moon. Remove 360° from the sum if it is 
greater than 360°. Divide the sum by the length of one nakshatra (13°20' or 
800'). Ignore fractions and take the integer part. Add 1 to it and the result is 
the index of the yoga running. Refer to Table 5 and find the yoga 
corresponding to the index.

27 Vaidhriti A class of gods 
Example 3: Suppose Sun is at 23°50' in Cp and Moon is at 17°20' in Li. Then 
Sun's longitude is 23°50' + 9x30° = 293°50' and Moon's longitude is 17°20' 
+ 6x 30° = 197°20'. The sum is 293°50' + 197°20' = 491°10'. By subtracting 
360°, we get 131° 10'. This is equivalent to 131 X 60 + 10 = 7870'. By 
dividing this with 800', we get 9.8375. Ignoring the fraction, we get 9. 
Adding 1 to it, we get 10. From Table 5, we see that the 10th yoga is 
"Gandayoga". 

Exercise 4: Moon is at 14°43' in Leo. Sun is at 28° 13' in Capricorn. Find 
the running Sun-Moon yoga. 

1.3.10 Karanas 
Each tithi is divided into 2 karanas. There are 11 karanas: (1) Bava, (2) 

Balava, (3) Kaulava, (4) Taitula, (5) Garija, (6) Vanija, (7) Vishti, (8) Sakuna, 
(9) Chatushpada, (10) Naga, and, (11) Kimstughna. The first 7 karanas 
repeat 8 times starting from the 2nd half of the first lunar day of a month. 
The last 4 karanas come just once in a month, starting from the 2nd half of 
the 29th lunar day and ending at the 1st half of the first lunar day. 
1.3.11 Hora 

Each day starts at sunrise and ends at next day's sunrise. This period is 
divided into 24 equal parts and they are called horas. A hora is almost equal 
to an hour. These horas are ruled by different planets. The lords of hora 
come in the order of decreasing speed with respect to earth: Saturn, Jupiter, 
Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and Moon. After Moon, we go back to Saturn 
and repeat the 7 planets. 

The first hora of any day (i.e. a period of one hour following sunrise) is 
ruled by the lord of the weekday (Sun for Sunday, Moon for Monday, Mars 



16 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

for Tuesday, Mercury for Wednesday, Jupiter for Thursday, Venus for Friday 
and Saturn for Saturday). After that, we list planets in the order mentioned 
above. 

For example, let us take 9:40 pm on a Wednesday on which sunrise was 
at 6:10 am. The time elapsed since sunrise is 21:40-6:10= 15:30. So the 
16th hour since sunrise was running then. This is ruled by the 16th planet 
from Mercury. After subtracting multiples of 7 from 16, we get 2. So the 
hora (hour) is ruled by the 2nd planet from Mercury. From the list given 
above, we see that the 2nd planet from Mercury is Moon. So Moon's hora 
runs at 9:40 pm. 
1.3.12 Panchaanga 

Panchaanga means "one with 5 limbs". Almanacs published in India 
with planetary positions are traditionally called panchaangas. Along with 
the planetary positions, they give the start and end times of tithi, vaara 
(week day - Sunday, Monday etc), nakshatra, yoga and karana running on 
each day. These five are the limbs of panchaanga. 

When we choose a muhurta (an auspicious time for starting a venture), 
we should choose an auspicious tithi, vaara, nakshatra, yoga and karana. 
1.3.13 Ayanamsa 

Because of the movement in earth's precession, the starting point of 
the tropical zodiac changes slowly (with respect to fixed stars). Tropical 
(sayana) zodiac is analogous to measuring the positions of trees and buildings 
sitting in a slowly moving bus. Sidereal (nirayana) zodiac, on the other hand, 
considers a fixed zodiac. It considers the motion of the tropical zodiac (bus 
in our analogy) and makes an adjustment accordingly. We use the sidereal 
zodiac in Vedic astrology. The difference between the tropical zodiac and 
the sidereal zodiac is of great importance. What modern ephemeris gives us 
is the tropical positions of planets. To convert these positions, we have to 
subtract the difference between the two zodiacs. This difference varies 
with time. As earth's precession changes every year, the difference between 
the tropical zodiac and the sidereal zodiac changes. This difference is called 
"ayanamsa" (sidereal difference). There are many opinions on the correct 
value of ayanamsa, because nobody knows exactly which star is supposed 
to be the starting point of the real zodiac. We will use Chitrapaksha/Lahiri 
ayanamsa in this book, which is accepted by most Vedic astrologers of 
India. 
1.4   Dasa Systems 

Dasa systems are a hallmark of Vedic astrology. Vedic astrology has 
hundreds of dasa system. Each dasa system divides one's life into periods, 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 17 

sub-periods, sub-sub-periods and so on. All the periods are ruled by different 
planets or rasis. Some dasa systems are planet-based and some are rasi-
based. Each dasa system is good at showing events of a specific nature. 
For each dasa system, we have some standard rules, based on which we 
analyze the natal chart and attribute different results to different periods 
and sub-periods. Each dasa system comes with rules for dividing one's life 
into periods and sub-periods and rules for attributing different results to 
different periods, based on the planetary positions in the natal chart. These 
periods are called "dasas" or "mahadasas" (MD). Sub-periods are called 
"antardasas" (AD). Sub-sub-periods are called "pratyantardasas" (PD). 

Some dasas are good at showing matters related to longevity and death. 
They are called "ayur dasas" (dasas of longevity). Some dasas are good at 
showing general results. They are called "phalita dasas" (dasas of general 
results). 

Mind is a very important part of our existence and Moon governs it. 
Some dasas are computed based on the nakshatra occupied by Moon and 
they are called "nakshatra dasas". Some dasas are based on the rasis 
occupied by planets and they are called "rasi dasas". 

We will learn 10 different dasa systems in this book. Readers should 
not look at these 10 dasas as ten different alternatives to look at the same 
life event. They should instead be looked at as ways to look at 10 different 
aspects of the same life event. In fact, some of the dasas taught in this book 
are limited to specific matters. For example, we should look at Drigdasa for 
spiritual progress and we should look at Sudasa for money and wealth. Like 
that, some dasas are limited to specific matters. 
1.5  Conclusion 

The content of this chapter may be too rudimentary for most readers. 
However, for beginners, it may be confusing. 

The content of the first several chapters of this book may seem to be 
disjoint, but things will fall in place as we go on. Readers should patiently go 
through the material in the order presented. One has to work hard on the 
basics. Once the basics are clear, Vedic astrology is a very systematic 
subject. 

Some Western astrologers mix Western astrology with Vedic astrology 
and bring in progressions, extra-Saturnine planets etc into Vedic astrology. 
It is silly to suggest that the Sages who taught such brilliant and superfine 
techniques did not consider some planets because they did not know about 
them. Vedic astrology is a very logical and systematic subject and there is 
no need to corrupt it. There are some techniques of western astrology 



18 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

that are not used by most contemporary Vedic astrologers but were taught 
by seers. We can accept those techniques. An example is progressions. 
They were not taught by Parasara, but they were taught by Manu. So we 
can accept them. But the use of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were not taught 
by any seers of Vedic astrology. We should first strive to clearly understand 
the teachings of maharshis. There is a lot of width and depth in the knowledge 
taught by maharshis. Our focus should be on understanding their teachings 
correctly and not on adding new things to the knowledge that we only 
superficially understand. 

Western astrologers reading this book may have to unlearn some 
things they learnt before, as they read this book.

2. Rasis 

2.1 Introduction 
We learnt that the zodiac of 360° is divided into 12 equal parts of 30°. 

We learnt these are called rasis (signs). We learnt the definition of rasis in 
Table 1. Different rasis have different properties and they stand for different 
things. We will learn them in this small chapter. 
2.2 Characteristics of Rasis 

2.2.1 Limbs of Vishnu 
The whole zodiac is nothing but a manifestation of Lord Vishnu's body. 

Aries is the head. Taurus is the face. Gemini is the arms. Cancer is the 
heart. Leo is the stomach. Virgo is the hip. Libra is the space below navel. 
Scorpio is the private parts. Sagittarius is the thighs. Capricorn is the knees. 
Aquarius is the ankles. Pisces is the feet. 

These are the limbs that rasis in the natural zodiac stand for. Because 
we are all part of the Supreme energy governing this world, the above 
mapping applies to us too. For example, we should pay attention to Leo for 
analyzing stomach problems and to Pisces for analyzing problems related to 
feet and so on. 
2.2.2 Odd and Even 
(1) Ar, Ge, Le, Li, Sg and Aq are called odd rasis or vishama rasis or 

oja rasis. They are also known as male rasis. 
(2) Ta, Cn, Vi, Sc, Cp and Pi are called even rasis or sama rasis or 

yugma rasis. They are also known as female rasis. 
This division is used in some dasas and in the determination of the sex of 
children. 
2.2.3 Odd-footed and Even-footed 
(1) Ar, Ta, Ge, Li, Sc and Sg are called odd-footed rasis or vishamapada 

rasis or ojapada rasis. 
(2) Cn, Le, Vi, Cp, Aq and Pi are called even-footed rasis or samapada 

rasis or or yugmapada rasis. 
This division is used in some dasas. 
2.2.4 Movable, Fixed and Dual 
(1) Ar, Cn, Li and Cp are known as chara rasis or movable rasis. They 

are ruled by Brahma, the Creator. Their nature is to move and to be 
dynamic. 



20 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(2) Ta, Le, Sc and Aq are known as sthira rasis or fixed rasis. They are 
ruled by Shiva, the Destroyer. Their nature is to be stable and constant. 

(3) Ge, Vi, Sg and Pi are known as dwiswabhava rasis or dual rasis. They 
are ruled by Vishnu, the Sustainer.3 They are stable sometimes and 
dynamic sometimes. 

2.2.5 Rasis & Five Elements 
According to Hindu philosophy, this world is made up of five elements -

fire, water, air, earth and ether. Water is a substance with a flexible state. 
Air is a substance with a varying state. Earth is a substance with a constant 
and solid state. Fire is a substance that transforms the state of things. Ether 
is something that is present everywhere. 

For example, suppose one has a good memory and remembers something 
he learnt 10 years back. It involves a skill of earthy nature. Suppose a 
poet's imagination creates a nice poem that appeals to one's aesthetic sense. 
This involves watery skills. Suppose one is in a bad mood and his mind is 
wandering aimlessly. This shows airy state of the mind. These 5 elements 
are behind every material substance, every action, every thought, every 
emotion and every happening in this universe. 
(1) Ar, Le and Sg are called agni rasis or fiery rasis. 
(2) Ta, Vi and Cp are called bhoo rasis or earthy rasis. 
(3) Ge, Li and Aq are called vaayu rasis or airy rasis. 
(4) Cn, Sc and Pi are called jala rasis or watery rasis. 
(5) The 5th element of aakaasa or ether is present in every rasi. 

Let us see how these may be used. For example, the 5th house in one's 
chart shows one's emotional nature. The 5th house in a fiery sign may show 
a normally angry, aggressive or determined person. The 5th house in an 
earthy sign may show a balanced, logical and stable person. The 5th house 
in an airy sign may show someone with unstable and wandering emotions. 
The 5th house in a watery sign may show one with an imaginative and 
creative mind. 
2.2.6 Pitta, Vaata and Kapha 

Ayurveda is India's Vedic medical system that recognizes human body 
and everything else in the universe as having 3 natures that are formed with 
the above 5 elements: 

Pitta or bilious nature is a combination of the elements of fire and 

3 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together form the Trinity of Hindu Gods. Brahma creates 
the world. Vishnu sustains it. Shiva destroys it. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 21 

water. It shows things that result in tranformation in a system. In a human 
body, for example, it may show digestion etc. 

Vaata or windy nature is a combination of the elements of air and 
ether. It shows things that move in and out of a system. In a human body, 
for example, it may show breathing etc. 

Kapha or phlegmatic nature is a combination of the elements of earth 
and water. It shows things that bind a system together. In a human body, for 
example, it may show bones, muscles, fat etc. It shows things that give a 
structure to a system. 

Ar, Le and Sg are of pitta nature. Ta, Vi and Cp are of vaata nature. Cn, 
Sc and Pi are of kapha nature. Ge, Li and Aq are of a mixed nature. 
2.2.7 Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas 

In Hindu philosophy, everything in this universe has one of 3 gunas 
(qualities). They are called trigunas. Sattwa (purity) is a quality that gives 
truthfulness and purity. Rajas or rajo guna (energy) is a quality that makes 
one energetic and passionate. Tamas or tamo guna (darkness) is a quality 
that makes one depraved. 

As an example, let us say a saint is living in a small hermitage. Let us 
say a man living in a local forest comes, makes fun of the saint and abuses 
him for no reason. Let us say a king fights with that man after finding out 
about this. Let us say that the saint tells him to leave the man and yet the 
king punishes him. 

The saint shows sattva guna and he is not bothered by petty things. He 
ignores the abuse. He is a pure person. The man abusing the saint for no 
reason shows tamo guna, as he is in the dark. Abusing a saattwik person for 
no reason is a pathetic thing to do and only a depraved person in darkness 
can do it. The king acts appropriately and shows his energy by defeating the 
man. So far it is sattwa guna (the state of being true). But the king punishes 
the man ignoring the advice of the saint to forgive him. His passionate 
response makes him a person with rajo guna. 
(1) Saattwik signs, i.e. signs with sattwa guna, are - Cn, Le, Sg, Pi. 
(2) Raajasik signs, i.e. signs with rajo guna, are - Ar, Ta, Li, Sc. 
(3) Taamasik signs, i.e. signs with tamo guna, are - Ge, Vi, Cp, Aq. 
2.2.8 Rasis and Directions 
(1) Ar, Le and Sg show east. 
(2) Ta, Vi and Cp show south. 
(3) Ge, Li and Aq show west. 
(4) Cn, Sc and Pi show north.

2.2.9   Rasis and Colors 
Ar shows blood-red color. Ta shows white. Ge shows grass green. Cn 

shows pale red. Le shows white. Virgo is variegated. Libra shows black. 
Scorpio shows reddish brown. Sagittarius shows the color of the husk of 
grass. Capricorn is variegated. Aquarius shows brown color (that of a 
mongoose). Pisces shows cream color or the color of fish. 
2.2.10 Day and Night 
(1) Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Sg and Cp are night time rasis - they are strong during 

the night time. They are nishaa rasis. 
(2) Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Aq and Pi are day time rasis - they are strong during the 

day time. They are divaa rasis. 
Out of the two rasis owned by a planet, one is a day sign and one is a 

night sign. Moon governs all the nishaa rasis and Sun governs all the divaa 
rasis. 
2.2.11 Rising of rasis 

Some rasis rise with their head. They are called "Seershodaya rasis". 
Some rasis rise with their feet4. They are called "Prishthodaya rasis". 
(1) Ge, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Aq are Seershodaya rasis. 
(2) Ar, Ta, Cn, Sg, Cp are Prishthodaya rasis. 
(3) Pi rises with both its head and feet. 

It is said that planets in Seershodaya rasis give their results in the first 
half of their dasas and planets in Prishthodaya rasis give their results in the 
second half of their dasas. 
2.2.12 Varna or Class 

In Hinduism, people are divided into 4 varnas or classes - (1) 
Brahmanas, (2) Kshatriyas, (3) Vaisyas and (4) Sudras. Brahmanas pursue 
knowledge and work as priests or ministers. Kshatriyas are valiant and they 
become kings, army chiefs and soldiers. Vaisyas are the traders and suppliers 
of various services. Sudras execute various menial tasks. 
(1) Brahmanas (scholars) are represented by watery signs - Cn, Sc, Pi. 
(2) Kshatriyas (warriors) are represented by fiery signs - Ar, Le, Sg. 
(3) Vaisyas (traders) are represented by earthy signs - Ta, Vi, Cp. 
(4) Sudras (workers) are represented by airy signs - Ge, Li, Aq. 
4 Many scholars have interpreted "prishthodaya" as "rising with the feet". So we will use 

the same interpretation. However, strictly speaking, one should note that "prishtha" 
means "back".

3. Planets 

3.1 Introduction 
There are 7 grahas (planets) in Vedic astrology: Sun, Moon, Mars, 

Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. There are two more chaayaa grahas 
(shadow planets): Rahu and Ketu. Rahu and Ketu are mathematical points. 
They are also called the north and south nodes or the head and tail of 
dragon. They are based on the points at which the orbit of Moon around 
earth cuts the orbit of earth around Sun. 

Rasis represent situations that develop in one's life and influences that 
enter one's life. Planets in a chart represent human beings that play a role in 
one's life. 

Just as the whole zodiac represents Lord Vishnu and rasis represent 
His limbs, planets represent Vishnu's avataras (incarnations). 
3.2 Characteristics of Planets 
3.2.1 Vishnu's Avataras 

This world contains two essences - jeevaamsa (living essence) and 
paramaatmaamsa (absolute and supreme essence). Planets are the 
manifestations of different aspects of these essences. Vishnu's incarnations 
happened with these essences taken from various planets. 

Meena/Matsya avatara (fish) came from Ketu. Koorma avatara 
(tortoise) came from Saturn. Varaaha/sookara avatara (boar) came from 
Rahu. Narasimha/Nrisimha avatara (half-man, half-lion) came from Mars. 
Vaamana avatara (learned dwarf) came from Jupiter. Parasu Rama/ 
Bhaargava Rama came from Venus. Rama came from Sun. Krishna came 
from Moon. Buddha came from Mercury. 

All these incarnations came into being with a significant percentage of 
paramaatmaamsa (supreme essence) thanjeevaatmaamsa (living essence). 
Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha avataras had only paramaatmaamsa. 

Other living beings are born with a significant percentage of jeevaamsa 
and a little of paramaatmaamsa from the planets. 
3.2.2 Benefics and Malefics 
(1) Jupiter and Venus are natural benefics (saumya grahas or subha 

grahas). Mercury becomes a natural benefic when he is alone or with 
more natural benefics. Waxing Moon of Sukla paksha is a natural benefic. 

(2) Sun, Mars, Rahu and Ketu are natural malefics (kroora grahas or 
paapa grahas). Mercury becomes a natural malefic when he is joined 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 2 5 

by more natural malefics. Waning Moon of Krishna paksha is a natural 
malefic. 
This information is important because the results given by planets are 

based on their inherent nature. 
3.2.3 Main Governance 

Sun governs soul. Moon governs mind. Mars governs strength. Mercury 
governs speech. Jupiter governs knowledge and happiness. Venus governs 
potency. Saturn governs grief. 
3.2.4 Planets and Colors 

Sun shows blood-red color. Moon shows tawny color. Mars shows blood-
red color. Mercury shows grass green color. Jupiter shows tawny color. 
Venus is variegated. Saturn shows black color. 

These colors can be useful, for example, when predicting the color of 
one's car. For now, readers should just memorize these characteristics. 
3.2.5 Planetary Cabinet 

Sun and Moon are kings. Mars is the leader (army chief). Mercury is 
the prince. Jupiter and Venus are the ministers. Saturn is the servant. Rahu 
and Ketu form the army. 
3.2.6 Planetary Deities 

Ruling deities of various planets are as given below: Agni (fire god) for 
Sun, Varuna (rain god) for Moon, Subrahmanya (army chief of gods) for 
Mars, Maha Vishnu (supreme sustaining force) for Mercury, Indra (ruler 
of gods) for Jupiter, Sachi Devi (Indra's wife) for Venus, Brahma (Creator) 
for Saturn. 
3.2.7 Sex of Planets 

Sun, Mars and Jupiter are male. Moon and Venus are female. Saturn 
and Mercury are eunich. 

This information can be used for predicting the sex of children based on 
one's chart. For example, if the house ruling the first child is influenced by 
Jupiter, Mars and Mercury, we may predict a son. If it is influenced by 
Moon and Mercury, we may predict a daughter. 
3.2.8 Planets and Five Elements 
(1) Agni tattva (fiery element) is ruled by Mars. Sun also has the same 

nature. 
(2) Bhoo tattva (earthy element) is ruled by Mercury. 
(3) Vaayu tattva (airy element) is ruled by Saturn. 
(4) Aakaasa tattva (ethery element) is ruled by Jupiter. 



26 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(5) Jala tattva (watery element) is ruled by Venus. Moon also has the same 
nature. 
These rulerships throw light on the basic nature of planets. Being a 

fiery planet, Mars governs leadership, enterprise etc. Being an earthy planet, 
Mercury governs memory, logical abilities etc. Being an airy planet, Saturn 
governs wandering and free spirit. Being a watery planet, Venus governs 
imaginative and creative work. Being an ethery planet, Jupiter governs 
wisdom, intelligence and perceiving knowledge. 
3.2.9  Planets and Varnas 

Jupiter and Venus are Brahmanas (learned). Sun and Mars are 
Kshatriyas (warriors). Moon and Mercury are Vaisyas (traders). Saturn is 
a Sudra (worker). 

Learning and intelligence is the forte of the learned class. Bravery is 
the forte of the warrior class. Getting along with others well is the forte of 
the trader class. Hard work is the forte of the working class. In this manner, 
we should understand varnas to show one's basic nature rather than the 
caste of one's family. 

It should be noted that Moon, who was earlier classified in the planetary 
cabinet as a king, is said here to be of Vaisya varna. Sun is a king who is 
also a warrior. He is a brave king, who asserts himself. But Moon is a king 
who gets along well with everyone. 
3.2.10 Planets and Gunas 

Sun, Moon and Jupiter are saattwik planets. Mercury and Venus are 
raajasik planets. Mars and Saturn are taamasik planets. 
NOTE: There is a misconception today that sattwa guna means patience 
and not hurting others. An aggressive response to an offender is often 
thought to be raajasik. However, sattwa simply means "the state of being 
true". Pleasing others with artificial goodness is not sattwa guna. Punishing 
a person for his mistakes is not necessarily rajo guna. If there is some 
passion and impurity in one's energetic response, then it shows rajo guna. 
But, if a warrior fights a sinning person with no passion or ego, it can still be 
a saattvic act. Lord Sri Rama and Sun are examples for this. Sun is a king 
of the warrior class and yet he is saattwik. Lord Rama, who was born with 
his amsa, is a saattwik person despite killing Ravana and other demons. 

Sattva guna simply means purity and truthfulness in one's thoughts and 
action. Rajo guna shows some passion, energy and impurity in thoughts and 
actions. Tamo guna shows a dark, mean and depraved spirit in thoughts and 
actions. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 27 

3.2.11 Planetary Abodes 
Sun lives in a temple. Moon lives in a watery place. Mercury lives in a 

sports ground. Jupiter lives in a treasure house. Venus lives in the bedroom. 
Saturn lives in a filthy area. 

This description should give one an idea of the nature of planets. 
3.2.12 Seven Dhaatus 

Sapta dhaatus or 7 matters make up human body. The planetary rulerships 
are as follows: Sun rules bones. Moon rules blood. Mars rules marrow. 
Mercury rules skin. Jupiter rules fat. Venus rules semen (materials related 
to the reproductive system). Saturn rules muscles. 

If Sun is afflicted, it can show some problems related to bones. 
Weakness of Moon may give blood related problems. And so on. 
3.2.13 Planets and Time Periods 

Sun rules an ayana5. Moon rules a minute. Mars rules a week. Mercury 
rules a ritu6. Jupiter rules a month. Venus rules a fortnight. Saturn rules a 
year. 

These periods are very useful in prasna or horary astrology. 
3.2.14 Planets & Tastes 

Sun governs the pungent taste (e.g. onion, ginger, pepper). Moon governs 
the saline taste (e.g. sea salt, rock salt). Mars governs the bitter taste (e.g. 
karela/bitter melon, dandelion root, rhubarb root, neem leaves). Mercury 
governs a mixed taste. Jupiter governs sweetness (e.g. sugar, dates). Venus 
governs the sour taste (e.g. lemon, tamarind). Saturn governs the astringent 
taste (e.g. plantain, pomegranate). 

The 2nd house shows one's preference in food. The planets influencing 
it may decide one's favorite taste. In addition, one should avoid the tastes of 
the planets who are likely to bring disease. Suppose one is running a dasa or 
antardasa of a sign containing Moon as per Shoola dasa (a dasa that shows 
suffering). Then some suffering related to Moon is possible. Moon can give 
problems related to blood pressure as he governs blood. So eating too much 
salty food during such a period may result in high blood pressure. Similarly, 
5 There are 2 ayanas in a year. During Sun's transit from Cp to Ge, we have Uttara 

(north) ayana. During Sun's transit from Cn to Sg, we have Dakshina (south) ayana. 
6 Ritu roughly means a "season". There are 6 ritus in a year. They are - vasanta 

(spring), greeshma (summer), varsha (rain), hemanta (dew), seeta (winter), sisira 
(fall). Each ritu consists of 2 months. 



28 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

one should cut down on sweets during a period in which Jupiter related 
troubles are indicated. Or, one may develop too much fat (Jupiter) or get 
other Jupiter related diseases. 
3.2.15 Planetary Strengths 

Mercury and Jupiter are strong in the eastern direction (lagna). Sun and 
Mars are strong in the southern direction (meridian - 10lh house). Moon 
and Venus are strong in the northern direction (nadir - 4th house). Saturn is 
strong in the west (7th house). These are the digbalas (strengths associated 
with direction) of planets. These show the direction taken by one in one's 
life, as we will see later. 

Moon, Mars and Saturn are strong in the night time. Sun, Jupiter and 
Venus are strong in the daytime. Mercury is always strong. 

Natural malefics are strong in Krishna paksha. Natural benefics are 
strong in Sukla paksha. 

Natural malefics are strong in Dakshina ayana7. Natural benefics are 
strong in Uttara ayana. 
3.2.16 Planets & Ritus 

Planetary rulerships over ritus (seasons) are as follows: Venus governs 
vasanta ritu (spring). Mars governs greeshma ritu (summer). Moon governs 
varsha ritu (rainy season). Mercury governs hemanta ritu (season of dew). 
Jupiter governs sheeta ritu (winter). Saturn governs sisira ritu (fall). 
3.2.17 Dhatu, Moola and Jeeva 
(1) Rahu, Mars, Saturn and Moon rule over dhaatus (metals and materials). 
(2) Sun and Venus rule over moolas (roots and vegetables). 
(3) Mercury, Jupiter and Ketu rule over jeevas (living beings). 
3.3    Planetary Dignities 

Each planet has a sign where it is exalted (uchcha), a sign where it is 
debilitated (neecha), a sign that is called its moolatrikona and one or two 
rasis that are owned by it. A planet is said to be strong in its own rasi or 
exaltation rasi or moolatrikona. 

Table 6 shows own rasis, exaltation rasis, the degree of deep exaltation, 
debilitation rasi, the degree of deep debilitation and the moolatrikona of 
each planet. 
7 For the meaning of ayanas, see footnote 5. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 2 9 

Table 6: Dignities of Planets 
 

Planet Own rasis Exaltation rasi Debilitation rasi Mool-
  (deep exaltation (deep debilitation atri - 
  point) point) kona 
Sun Le Ar (10°) Li (10°) Le 
Moon Cn Ta(3°) Sc (3°) Ta 
Mars Ar& Sc Cp (28°) Cn(28°) Ar

Venus Ta&Li Pi (27°) Vi(27°) Li 
Saturn Cp& Aq Li (20°) Ar(20°) Aq 
Rahu Aq Ge Sg Vi 
Ketu Sc Sg Ge Pi 

Some special points regardingthe results given by planets: 
(1) Sun gives the results of being in moolatrikona in the first 20° of Le and 

the results of being in own rasi in the remaining 10°. 
(2) Moon gives the results of being in exaltation rasi in the first 3° of Ta and 

the results of being in moolatrikona in the remaining 27°. 
(3) Mars gives the results of being in moolatrikona in the first 12° of Le and 

the results of being in own rasi in the remaining 18°. 
(4) Mercury gives the results of being in exaltation rasi in the first 15° of Vi, 

the results of being in moolatrikona in the next 5° and the results of 
being in own rasi in the remaining 10°. 

(5) Jupiter gives the results of being in moolatrikona in the first 10° of Sg 
and the results of being in own rasi in the remaining 20°. 

(6) Venus gives the results of being in moolatrikona in the first half of Li 
and the results of being in own rasi in the second half of Li. 

(7) Saturn gives the results of being in moolatrikona in the first 20° of Aq 
and the results of being in own rasi in the remaining 10°. 
An analogy may help one understand the subtle difference between 

own rasi, exaltation rasi and moolatrikona. 
Own rasi of a planet (e.g. Pisces of Jupiter) is like one's home. One is 

most natural and comfortable at home. That is exactly what a planet in 
own rasi is. Moolatrikona of a planet (e.g. Sagittarius of Jupiter) is like 
one's office. One executes one's formal job and performs one's duty at 
office. One is powerful and duty-minded at office. Exaltation sign of a 



 

30 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

planet (e.g. Cancer of Jupiter) is like a favorite party/picnic. One is excited 
to be at one's favorite party/picnic. So an exalted planet is like an excited 
person at his favorite picnic spot. Debilitation sign of a planet (e.g. Capricorn 
of Jupiter) is like one's worst party. A debilitated planet is like an unhappy 
person stuck at a place he hates. 

Jupiter is a saattwik and dharmik Brahmin. Ethery Jupiter, planet of 
perception, intelligence and wisdom, is most comfortable in saattwik Pisces, 
which is the 12th house of the natural zodiac. That is his home. However, he 
also has to uphold dharma. Upholding dharma is his duty. Whether he likes 
it or not, he has to do it. So fiery Sagittarius, 9th house in the natural zodiac, 
is his moolatrikona. Jupiter is like a "raaja purohit" (chief priest of a king) in 
Sagittarius. He has to sometimes take strong decisions to uphold dharma 
(like sentencing someone to death). In Pisces, he is like a peaceful Brahmin 
doing pooja at his home. In watery Cancer, the 4th house of the natural 
zodiac, Jupiter is excited to do some imaginative (watery) learning (4th house 
matter). In taamasik and earthy Capricorn, the 10th house of the natural 
zodiac, Jupiter hates doing tamasik and well-defined karma (action, 10th 

house matter). It is against his nature. Executing well-defined taamasik 
karma may be fine with taamasik planets Mars and Saturn, but Jupiter is 
unhappy with it. So Jupiter is debilitated in Cp. 

Take Mercury as another example. He is an intellectual planet and 
significator of communications. "Intelligent communication" is the most 
comfortable activity for him. So his home is intellectual Gemini, the 3rd 
house (communications) of the natural zodiac. However, intelligent debates 
and arguments are the formal job assigned to him. Virgo is the 6th house 
(arguments) of the natural zodiac and it is Mercury's moolatrikona! 

While saattwik and ethery Jupiter doesn't quite love the job of fiercely 
and fierily upholding dharma (by punishing demon king Bali in Vaamana 
avatara, for example), he does it with a sense of duty. But Mercury loves 
his official job! He loves engaging in intellectual debates. So Virgo (6th 
house of the natural zodiac) is not only his moolatrikona (office), but also his 
exaltation sign (favorite picnic spot). Still, "intelligent communications'" 
(Gemini) is what he is most comfortable with (home). 

Let us take one final example - Ketu. Ketu is most comfortable with 
occult activity, which are shown by the 8th house. So he owns the 8th house of 
the natural zodiac, i.e. Scorpio. His official duty, however, is giving 
upaasana (meditation) and moksha (liberation), which are shown by the 
12th house. So his moolatrikona is in the 12th house of the natural zodiac, i.e. 
Pisces. 

One should remember the above and understand the mood of a planet 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 31 

based on whether it is in own rasi or exaltation rasi or moolatrikona. Though 
all the three are good placements, there is a subtle difference in the mood of 
the planet and the results given by it. 
3.4    Planetary Relationships 

3.4.1  Natural Relationships 
For each planet, its friends and enemies are found as follows: Take the 

moolatrikona of the planet. Lord of the rasi where it is exalted is its friend. 
Lords of 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th and 12th rasis from it are also its natural friends. 
Lords of other rasis are its natural enemies. If a planet becomes a friend 
and an enemy on account of owning two rasis, then it is a neutral planet. 
The list of friends, neutral planets and enemies of all planets is listed in 
Table 7. 

Table 7: Natural relationships 
 

Planet Friends (mitra) Nuetral (sama) Enemies (satru)

Jupiter Sun, Moon, Mars Saturn Mars, Mercury, Venus 
Venus Mercury, Saturn Jupiter Sun, Moon 
Saturn Mercury, Venus Jupiter Sun, Moon, Mars 

3.4.2   Temporary Relationships 
In addition to the permanent relationship, we have temporary relationships 

based on the planetary position in a chart. These temporary (tatkaala) 
relationships are specific to a chart. 

Planets occupying the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th rasis counted from the 
rasi occupied by a planet are its temporary friends. Planet occupying 
other rasis are its temporary enemies. 
Example 4: Let us consider Lord Sree Rama's chart given in Figure 1 and 
find the temporary friends and temporary enemies of Sun and Moon. 

Sun: Sun is in Ar. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th rasis counted from Ar 
are Ta, Ge, Cn, Cp, Aq and Pi. Planets in those rasis are Mercury, 



32 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Moon, Jupiter, Mars and Venus. They are temporary friends of Sun in this 
chart. Saturn is the only temporary enemy. 

Moon: Moon is in Cn. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th rasis counted from 
Cn are Le, Vi, Li, Ar, Ta and Ge. Planets in those rasis are Saturn, Sun and 
Mercury. They are temporary friends of Moon in this chart. Temporary 
enemies are Mars, Jupiter, Venus. 
Exercise 5: Consider Lord Sree Rama's chart given in Figure 1 and find 
the temporary friends and temporary enemies of Jupiter and Venus. 
Note that Moon and Jupiter have the same temporary friends and temporary 
enemies. That is because they occupy the same rasi and temporary 
relationships are based on the rasis occupied by planets. 
3.4.3  Compound Relationships 
We get the compound relationships between planets by combining permanent 
and temporary relationships as shown in Table 8. 

Table 8: Compound Relationships 
 

 Temporary friend Temporary enemy 
Natural friend Adhimitra (good friend) Sama (neutral) 
Natural neutral Mitra (friend) Satru (enemy) 
Natural enemy Sama (neutral) Adhisatru (bad enemy) 

Example 5: Let us continue from Example 4 and find the friends and 
enemies of Sun and Moon in Lord Sree Rama's chart given in Figure 1. 

Sun: We found in Example 4 that Sun's temporary friends are Mercury, 
Moon, Jupiter, Mars and Venus. Of these, Moon, Mars and Jupiter are 
natural friends and they become adhimitras (good friends). Mercury is a 
neutral planet in natural relationship and he becomes a mitra (friend) in 
compound relationship. Venus is a natural enemy. Being a temporary friend, 
Venus becomes a sama (neutral) planet in compound relationship. 

Saturn is the only temporary enemy of Sun. Being a natural enemy too, 
he becomes an adhisatru (bad enemy) of Sun. 

Moon: We found in Example 4 that Moon's temporary friends are Sun, 
Mercury and Saturn. Of these, Sun and Mercury are natural friends and 
they become adhimitras (good friends). Saturn is a neutral in natural 
relationship and he becomes a mitra (friend) in compound relationship. 

Moon's temporary enemies are Mars, Jupiter and Venus. They are all 
natural neutrals and they become satru (enemies) in compound relationship. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 3 3 

Exercise 6: Continue from Exercise 5 and find the friends and enemies of 
Jupiter and Venus in Lord Sree Rama's chart given in Figure 1. 

Whenever we refer to a planet being in a friendly house or an inimical 
house in the rest of this book, we mean the compound relationships. A 
planet occupying a rasi owned by a mitra or adhimitra is in a friendly house. 
A planet occupying a rasi owned by a satru or adhisatru is in an inimical 
house. 
3.5    Answers to Exercises 
Exercise 5: 

Jupiter. Jupiter is in Cn. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th rasis counted 
from Cn are Le, Vi, Li, Ar, Ta and Ge. Planets in those rasis are Saturn, Sun 
and Mercury. They are temporary friends of Jupiter in this chart. Temporary 
enemies are Moon, Mars, Venus. 

Venus: Venus is in Pi. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12lh rasis counted from 
Pi are Ar, Ta, Ge, Sg, Cp and Aq. Planets in those rasis are Sun, Mercury 
and Mars. They are temporary friends of Venus in this chart. Temporary 
enemies are Moon, Jupiter, Saturn. 
Exercise 6: 

Jupiter: We found in Exercise 5 that the temporary friends of Jupiter 
are Sun, Mercury and Saturn. Being a natural friend, Sun becomes an 
adhimitra (good friend). Being a natural neutral, Saturn becomes a mitra 
(friend). Being a natural enemy, Mercury becomes a neutral planet in 
compound relationship. 

Temporary enemies of Jupiter are Moon, Mars and Venus. Being natural 
friends of Jupiter, Moon and Mars become sama (neutral) planets in 
compound relationship. Being a neutral planet in natural relationship, Venus 
becomes an enemy in compound relationship. 

Venus: We found in Exercise 5 that the temporary friends of Venus are 
Sun, Mars and Mercury. Being a natural friend, Mercury becomes an 
adhimitra (good friend). Being a neutral planet in natural relationship, Mars 
becomes a mitra (friend). Being an enemy in natural relationship, Sun 
becomes a sama (neutral) in compound relationship. 

Temporary enemies of Venus are Moon, Jupiter, Saturn. Of these, Saturn 
is a natural friend and he becomes a sama (neutral) in compound relationship. 
Jupiter is a natural neutral and he becomes a satru (enemy) of Venus in 
compound relationship. Moon is a natural enemy of Venus and he becomes 
an adhisatru (bad enemy) in compound relationship. 



4. Upagrahas 

4.1 Introduction 
There are 11 upagrahas (sub-planets or satellites) defined by Sage 

Parasara. They do not appear to correspond to any physical bodies (planets, 
stars etc). From Sage Parasara's definition, they appear to be some significant 
mathematical points. They will be defined in two groups. 
4.2 Sun-based Upagrahas 

Five upagrahas called Dhuma, Vyatipaata, Parivesha, Indrachaapa 
and Upaketu are defined based on Sun's longitude. The exact formulas 
are given in Table 9. All these upagrahas are very malefic in nature. Any 
houses occupied by them in rasi chart or divisional charts are spoiled by 
them. 

Table 9: Sun-based Upagrahas 
Upagraha Longitude Formula 
Dhuma Sun' s longitude + 13 3 °20' 
Vyatipaata 3 60°-Dhuma's longitude 
Parivesha Vyatipaata's longitude + 180° 
Indrachaapa 360°-Parivesha's longitude 
Upaketu Indrachaapa's longitude + 16°40' 

= Sun's longitude - 30° 
It may be noted that Dhuma and Indrachaapa are apart by 180° and 

Vyatipaata and Parivesha are apart by 180°. 
Example 6: 

Let us say Sun is at 9Sg36. Sg is the 9th rasi and so Sun's longitude can 
be expressed as 8s 9°36' (based on the notation introduced in 1.3.2). The 
length of each of the 8 rasis before Sg is 30°. So we can find the longitude 
of Sun (i.e., distance traversed by Sun from the beginning of the zodiac) as 
8x30°+9o36' = 249°36'. 

8 When adding or subtracting longitudes, we should subtract 360° if we get more than 
360° and we should add 360° if we get less than 0°. Adding or subtracting 360° 
means going around the zodiac once and coming to the same position. We should 
finally reduce all longitudes to a value between 0° and 360°, by adding or subtracting 
360° as many times as needed. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 35 

Adding 133°20' to it, we get 382°56'. This can be rewritten8 as 22°56'. 
That is the longitude of Dhuma. So Dhuma is at 22°56' in Ar. Because 
Dhuma and Indrachaapa are 180° apart, you can say without further 
computation that Indrachapa is in the 7th sign from Ar, which is Li. His 
advancement from the start of Li is also 22°56'. 
NOTE: You can verify that Aries and Libra, Taurus and Scorpio, Gemini and 
Sagittarius, Cancer and Capricorn, Leo and Aquarius, Virgo and Pisces are 
the signs that are 180° apart. So, if Dhuma is at 11°36' from the start of 
Aquarius, Indrachapa will be at 11°36' from the start of Leo. 

Vyatipata is obtained by subtracting Dhuma from 360°. We see that 
360° - 22°56' = 337°4'. So Vyatipata is at 337°4', i.e. at 7°4' from the start 
of Pi. Since Parivesha is at 180° from Vyatipata, he is at 7°4' in Vi. 
Exercise 7: If Sun is at 13°19' from the start of Ta, find the positions of all 
the five upagrahas defined so far. 

4.3    Other Upagrahas 
Six upagrahas called Kaala, Mrityu, Arthaprahaara, Yamaghantaka, 

Gulika and Maandi are more difficult to compute. Kaala is a malefic 
upagraha similar to Sun. Mrityu is a malefic upagraha similar to Mars. 
Arthaprahaara is similar to Mercury. Yamaghantaka is similar to Jupiter. 
Gulika and Maandi are similar to Saturn. 

A day starts at the time of sunrise and ends at the time of sunset. A 
night starts at the time of sunset and ends at the time of next day's sunrise. 
Depending on whether one is born during the day or the night, we divide the 
length of the day/night into 8 equal parts. 

Daytime births: The first part is ruled by the lord of weekday and then 
we cover planets in the order of weekdays. The part after the one ruled by 
Saturn is lord-less. After that, Sun's part comes. For example, the first 1/8* 
of the daytime on a Thursday is ruled by Jupiter. Next part is ruled by 
Venus. The 3rd part is ruled by Saturn. The 4th part is lord-less. The 5th part is 
ruled by Sun. The 6th part is ruled by Moon. The 7* part is ruled by Mars. 
The 8th part is ruled by Mercury.

Night time births: The first part is ruled by the 5th planet from the lord 
of weekday and then we cover planets in the order of weekdays. For 
example, the first 1/8th of a Thursday night is ruled by the 5th planet from 
Jupiter, i.e. Moon (Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Sun, Moon - that's the 5th one). 
Next part is ruled by Mars. The 3rd part is ruled by Mercury. The 4th part is 
ruled by Jupiter. The 5th part is ruled by Venus. The 6th part is ruled by 
Saturn. The 7th planet is lord-less. The 8th part is ruled by Sun. 

Table 10 gives the list of the ruling planets of all the eight parts of the 
daytime and night time on all weekdays. 

Once we divide the day/night of birth into 8 equal parts and identify the 
ruling planets of the 8 parts, we can find the longitudes of Kaala etc upagrahas 
using the following procedure: 
(1) Kaala rises at the middle of Sun's part9. In other words, we find the 

9  Some scholars suggest that Kaala rises at the beginning of Sun's part. The same thing 
applies to others. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 37 

time at the middle of Sun's part and find lagna rising then. That gives 
Kaala's longitude. 

(2) Mrityu rises at the middle of Mars's part. 
(3) Artha Praharaka rises at the middle of Mercury's part. 
(4) Yama ghantaka rises at the middle of Jupiter's part. 
(5) Gulika rises at the middle of Saturn's part. 
(6) Maandi rises at the beginning of Saturn's part. 

Suppose one is born on Thursday night and we want Yamaghantaka's 
longitude in his chart. Suppose night starts at 6 pm and ends at 6 am on the 
next day. We see from the table that Jupiter rules the 4th part of a Thursday 
night. Each part is 12/8 = 1.5 hours. The 4th part starts 4.5 hours after 
sunset, i.e. at 10:30 pm, and ends 1.5 hours later. So Jupiter's part extends 
from 10:30 pm to midnight. The middle point of this part is at 11:15 pm. We 
find lagna rising at 11:15 pm and that will be Yama ghantaka's longitude. 
4.4    Answer to Exercise 
Exercise 7: 
Dhuma: At 26°3 9' from the start of Vi 
Vyatipaata: At 3 °21' from the start of Li 
Parivesha: At 3°21' from the start of Ar 
Indrachaapa: At 26°39' from the start of Pi 
Upaketu: At 19° 1' from the start of Sc' 



5. Special Lagnas 

5.1 Introduction 
There are some special lagnas defined by Parasara. In this book, we 

will widely use Hora lagna and Ghati lagna and it is time to define them 
and other special lagnas. 
5.2 Bhaava Lagna 

Bhaava lagna is at the position of Sun at the time of sunrise. It moves at 
the rate of one rasi per 2 hours. In the rest of this book, bhava lagna will 
be denoted by BL.10

If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4°47' then, horalagna 
is at 6s 4°47 at 6:00 am, at 6s 19°47' at 7:00 am, at 7s 4°47' at 8:00 am, 8s 
4°47' at 10:00 am and so on. Bhavalagna moves at the rate of 1° per 4 
minutes (i.e., 15° per hour). 

The following method may be used for computing bhavalagna. 
(1) Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise. 
(2) Find the difference between the birthtime (or the event time) and the 

sunrise time found in (1) above. Convert the difference into minutes. 
The result is the advancement of bhavalagna since sunrise, in degrees. 

(3) Add Sun's longitude at sunrise (in degrees) to the above number. Expunge 
multiples of 360° and reduce the number to the range 0°-360°. 

(4) This is the longitude of bhavalagna (BL). 
Example 7: 

A gentleman was born at 7:23 pm. Sunrise at his birthplace was at 6:37 
am on his birthday. At 6:37 am, Sun was at 24° 1T in Capricorn. Let us find 
BL. 
(1) 19:23-6:37=12 hr 46 min=12x60 + 46 min = 766 min 
(2) Sun's longitude at sunrise is 270°+24°17'=294°17'. Add 766° to it. The 

result is 1060° 17'. Subtracting 360° twice, we get 340° 17'. So BL is at 
10° 17' in Pisces. 

5.3 Hora Lagna 
Hora lagna is at the position of Sun at the time of sunrise. It moves at 

the rate of one rasi per hora (hour). In the rest of this book, horalagna 
will be denoted by HL. 

10 BL is defined only for the sake of completeness. We will not use it in this book. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 39 

If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4°47' then, horalagna 
is at 6s 4°47' at 6:00 am, at 6s 19°47' at 6:30 am, at 7s 4°47' at 7:00 am, 8s 
4°47' at 8:00 am and so on. Horalagna moves at the rate of 1/2° per minute 
(i.e., 30° per hour). 

The following method may be used for computing horalagna. 
(1) Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise. 
(2) Find the difference between the birthtime (or the event time) and the 

sunrise time found in (1) above. Convert the difference into minutes. 
(3) Divide the number by 2. The result is the advancement of horalagna 

since sunrise, in degrees. 
(4) Add Sun's longitude at sunrise (in degrees) to the above number. Expunge 

multiples of 360° and reduce the number to the range 0°-360°. 
(5) This is the longitude of horalagna (HL). 
Example 8: 

A gentleman was born at 7:23 pm. Sunrise at his birthplace was at 6:37 
am on his birthday. At 6:37 am, Sun was at 24° 17' in Capricorn. Let us find 
HL. 
(1) 19:23-6:37=12 hr 46 min=12x60 + 46 min = 766 min 
(2) 766/2=383 
(3) Sun's longitude at sunrise is 270°+24° 17'=294° 17'. Add 383° to it. The 

result is 677° 17'. Subtracting 360°, we get 317° 17'. So HL is at 17° 17' 
in Aquarius. 

5.4    Ghati Lagna 
Ghati lagna is at the position of Sun at the time of sunrise. It moves at 

the rate of one rasi per ghati (ghati=l/60th of a day, i.e., 24 minutes). In 
the rest of this book, ghatilagna will be denoted by GL. Ghati lagna is also 
called "ghatika lagna". 

If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4°47' then, ghatilagna 
is at 6s 4°47' at 6:00 am, at 6s 19°47' at 6:12 am, at 7s 4°47' at 6:24 am, 8s 
4°47' at 6:48 am and so on. Ghatilagna moves at the rate of 1°15' per minute 
(i.e., 30° per 24 minutes). 

The following method may be used for computing ghatilagna. 
(1) Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise. 
(2) Find the difference between the birthtime (or the event time) and the 

sunrise time found in (1) above. Convert the difference into minutes. 
(3) Multiply the number by 5. Divide the result by 4. The result is the 

advancement of ghatilagna since sunrise, in degrees. 



40 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(4) Add Sun's longitude at sunrise (in degrees) to the above number. Expunge 
multiples of 360° and reduce the number to the range 0°-360°. 

(5) This is the longitude of ghatilagna (GL). 
Example 9: 

Let us find GL for the data in Example 8. (1) 
19:23-6:37=12 hr 46 min=766 min 
(1) 766x5/4=957.5 
(2) Sun's longitude at sunrise is 294° 17'. Add 957°30' to it. The result is 

1251°47'. Subtracting 360° three times, we get 171°47'. So GL is at 
21°47' in Virgo. 

Exercise 8: 
A lady was born at 3:11:48 am (hr, min, sec) in the early hours of May 28, 
1961. Sun was at 13° 1' in Taurus then. Sunrise was at 6:19:18 am on May 
27, 1961 at her birthplace. At that time, Sun was at 12° 11' in Taurus. Find 
the longitudes of HL and GL in her chart. 

5.5    Comments 
(1) If the birthtime changes by one minute, GL will change by 1.25° (i.e., 

1 ° 15'). This is quite large and it can cause some error in the position of 
GL in some divisional charts. So, ghati lagna is more sensitive to birthtime 
errors than normal lagna. When using GL in divisional charts, we should 
keep this in mind and try to correct the birthtime based on known events 
first. Wrong data produces wrong results. Our analysis can only be as 
good as our data! 

(2) Some astrologers don't like dealing with it, but birthtime errors are a 
fact of life and we have to live with them. If we prefer to choose 
methods that work in spite of deviation in birthtime by a few minutes, 
we are ignoring a key fact - there are many people in this world who 
are born a few minutes apart in nearby places and yet lead significantly 
different lives. Still some people hide from this fact and stick to methods 
that give the same results to everyone born in a 15-minute or one-hour 
or two-hour period, because they don't have to deal with the complicated 
issue of birthtime errors then! But that's not the right approach - we 
should give importance to finer techniques. After all, Sage Parasara 
must have written about all these fine techniques only because he thought 
they were useful. 

(3) Some people define sunrise as the time when the center of the visual 
disk representing Sun rises on the eastern horizon, i.e., the time when 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 41 

lagna and Sun are exactly at the same longitude. Some other people 
consider sunrise as the time when the upper tip of the visual disk 
representing Sun appears to be rising on the eastern horizon, i.e., the 
time when the first ray of Sun is seen. The latter approach is 
recommended. 

Exercise 9: 
Suppose (just suppose) that a key event from the known past of the lady of 
Exercise 8 makes us think that her GL has to be between 16° 15' and 17°30' 
in Virgo. Correct the given birthtime accordingly. 

5.6 Use of Special Lagnas 
Use of special lagnas will become clearer in future chapters. For now, 

it will suffice to say that hora lagna shows money and ghati lagna shows 
power. 

In any chart, normal lagna shows self. Hora lagna shows self, from the 
point of view of money, wealth and prosperity. Ghati lagna shows self, from 
the point of view of fame, power and authority. For example, when we time 
good and bad periods for a businessman, hora lagna may be very important. 
When we time good and bad periods for a politician, ghati lagna may be 
very important. 
5.7 Sree Lagna 

In Sanskrit, the word "Sree" means wealth. It also means Lakshmi, 
wife of Lord Narayana and goddess of wealth. Sree Lagna will be denoted 
by SL in the rest of this book. Sree Lagna is important for prosperity. Its use 
will be shown in the chapter on Sudasa. Computation of Sree Lagna will be 
explained for now. 
(1) Find the constellation occupied by Moon. 
(2) Find the fraction of the constellation traversed by Moon. 
(3) Find the same fraction of the zodiac (360°). 
(4) Add this amount to the longitude of lagna. Subtract multiples of 360° if 

necessary. The resulting amount is the longitude of Sree Lagna (SL). 
Example 10: 

Let us take a native with Moon at 13 Li 06 and lagna at 25 Vi 05. 
Moon's longitude is 180° + 13°6' = 193°6'. Lagna's longitude 150°+25°5' is 
175°5'. 
(1) Moon is in Swathi constellation, which runs from 6°40' to 20°0' in Libra. 
(2) Moon's advancement in his constellation is 13°6' - 6°40' = 6°26'. As 



4 2 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

fraction of the whole constellation, this is (6°26')/(13°20') = 3867800' = 
0.4825. 

(3) The same fraction of the zodiac is 0.4825 x 360° = 173.7° = 173°42'. 
(4) Adding this amount to the longitude of lagna, we get 175°5' + 173°42' = 

348°47. This is the longitude of SL. So SL is in Pisces at 18°47'. 

Exercise 10: 
Suppose someone has Moon at 15 Le 29 and lagna at 14 Sc 19. Find the 
longitude of SL (Sree Lagna). 
Warning: There are some more special lagnas defined by Parasara, but 
they are beyond the scope of this book. We will restrict ourselves to the 
ones defined in this book. 

5.8    Answers to Exercises 
Exercise 8: 
HL:8°26'in Aquarius. 
GL:17°48.5'in Virgo. 
Exercise 9: 
Birthtime has to be between 3:10:33 -3:11:33 am. 
[HINT: GL with given birthtime (3:11:48 am) is at 17°48.5' in Virgo. The 
error is between 18.5' and 1°33.5', i.e., 0.3083° and 1.5583°. Find the 
corresponding error in birthtime in minutes and convert it to seconds. Then 
subtract the error from birthtime.] 
Exercise 10: 
SL is at 12°22' in Capricorn. 



6. Divisional Charts 

6.1 Divisions of A Rasi 
Each rasi has many divisions. Divisions of rasis are again mapped to 

rasis. For example, a rasi may be divided into 4 parts and each part may be 
mapped to a different rasi. Ar may be divided into 4 parts and the 4 parts 
may be mapped to Ar, Cn, Li and Cp. Then the 4 parts of Ta may be 
mapped to Ta, Le, Sc and Aq. And so on. Like this, we may divide all rasis 
into 4 parts and map the 4 parts to different rasis. We may also divide rasis 
to 9 parts and map each part into a rasi. We can have many different 
divisions. 

Sage Parasara defined 16 different divisions of rasis. Jaimini and Tajaka 
writers mentioned 4 more divisions. It is possible that Parasara also dealt 
with these 4 special divisions in sections that are perhaps missing today. In 
addition, there are more higher and finer divisions that are normally not 
used. 

Based on the rasis occupied by planets in various divisions, "divisional 
charts" are drawn. As we have seen before, we need to know the rasis 
occupied by planets, upagrahas, lagna and special lagnas to draw any chart. 
In every division, we divide the rasi into different parts, find the part containing 
each planet and see the rasi to which that part is mapped. Then we place 
the planet in that rasi in the chart corresponding to that division. We can 
draw a chart for each division. A planet can occupy different rasis in different 
divisions. 

Chart of each division is called a divisional chart. Each divisional chart 
can be treated as a different chart and interpreted differently. Different 
aspects of life are seen in different divisional charts. Rasi chart is simply a 
special case of divisional charts. If we divide each rasi into just one part 
(i.e. in effect, no division), we get rasi chart. 

In the rest of this book, everything we describe will be applicable to all 
divisional charts, unless we explicitly state a chart. We can apply all the 
principles to all the divisional charts, but we should see only specific matters 
in a divisional chart. The list of matters to be seen in each divisional chart 
will be given after the details of computation are presented. 

In this book, D-n will denote the divisional chart based on the nth division 
of rasis, i.e. based on dividing rasis into n parts. 
6.2 Computing Divisional Charts 

We will explain the computation of 20 divisional charts in this section. 



44 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Higher divisional charts like D-108 and D-150 and variations in charts like 
D-2, D-3, D-8 and D-l 1 will not be covered in this book. 
6.2.1 Rasi Chart (D-1) 

A simple example of divisions is rasi chart itself. It is also called 
"kshetra chakra". It is denoted by D-l. Longitudes in the range 0°-30° 
are mapped to Aries, 30°-60° to Taurus and so on, as mentioned earlier. 
Using Table 1, we can find the rasi occupied by a body based on its longitude. 
By "body" here, we mean planets, upagrahas, lagna or special lagnas -
basically a physical or a mathematical point in the zodiac that has a longitude 
associated with it. 
6.2.2 Hora Chart (D-2) 

Each rasi is divided into 2 equal parts of 15° each. Bodies in the first 
15°ofoddrasisarein Sun's hora. Bodies in the second 15°of odd rasis are 
in Moon's hora. Bodies in the first 15° of even rasis are in Moon's hora. 
Bodies in the second 15° of even rasis are in Sun's hora. 
NOTE: Though absolutely correct, the above is not quite complete. Proper 
use of hora chart is beyond the scope of this book. So we will ignore and 
not use hora chart in this book. 
6.2.3 Drekkana Chart (D-3) 

Each rasi is divided into 3 equal parts of 10° each. Bodies in the first 
10° of a rasi are placed in drekkana chart in the same rasi. Bodies in the 
middle 10° of a rasi are placed in drekkana chart in the 5th from the rasi. 
Bodies in the last 10° of a rasi are placed in drekkana chart in the 9th from 
the rasi. 
Example 11: Let us say Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are together in Gemini 
in rasi chart. Mercury is at 3°. Jupiter is at 19°. Venus is at 21°. 

Then Mercury is in the first 10° (0°-10°), Jupiter is in the middle 10° 
(10°-20°) and Venus is in the last 10° (20°-30°). So Mercury is placed in 
Gemini itself in drekkana chart; Jupiter is placed in Libra (5th from Gemini) 
in drekkana chart; and, Venus is placed in Aquarius (9th from Gemini) in 
drekkana chart. 
6.2.4 Chaturthamsa Chart (D-4) 

Each rasi is divided into 4 equal parts of 7.5° each. Bodies in the first, 
second, third and fourth 7.5° arc of a rasi are in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10lh from 
that rasi (respectively) in chaturthamsa. In other words, planets in 0°-7.5° 
in a rasi go into 1st from that rasi; planets in 7.5°-15° go into 4th from that 
rasi; planets in 15°-22.5° go into the 7th from that rasi; and, planets in the 
22.5°-30° go into the 10th from that rasi. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 45 

This chart is also known as Chaturamsa or Turyamsa. 
Example 12: Let us say Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are together in Taurus. 
Mercury is at 3°, Jupiter is at 14° and Venus is at 23°. 
Mercury is in 0°-7.5° arc, i.e. the first 7.5° arc, of Ta. So he is in Ta (1st

from Ta) in D-4. 
Jupiter is in 7.5°-15° arc, i.e. the second 7.5° arc, of Ta. So he is in Le (4th

from Ta) in D-4. 
Venus is in 22.5°-30° arc, i.e. the fourth 7.5° arc, of Ta. So he is in Aq (10th

from Ta) in D-4. 
6.2.5 Panchamsa Chart (D-5) 

Each rasi is divided into 5 equal parts of 6° each. Bodies in the 5 parts 
of an odd rasi go into Ar, Aq, Sg, Ge and Li (respectively). Bodies in the 5 
parts of an even rasi go into Ta, Vi, Pi, Cp and Sc (respectively). 
6.2.6 Shashthamsa Chart (D-6) 

Each rasi is divided into 6 equal parts of 5° each. Bodies in the 6 parts 
of a rasi go into the 6 rasis starting from Ar or Li, based on whether the rasi 
is odd or even. 
Example 13: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 3rd part of the rasi and 19° is in the 4th part of the 
rasi. Ge is an odd rasi and counting starts from Ar. The 3rd from Ar is Ge. 
So the 3rd part in Ge goes into Ge in D-6. On the other hand, Sc is an even 
rasi and counting starts from Li. The 4th from Li is Cp. So the 4th part of Sc 
goes into Cp in D-6. So Mercury is in Ge and Jupiter is in Cp in D-6 for this 
example. 
6.2.7 Saptamsa Chart (D-7) 

Each rasi is divided into 7 equal parts of 4° 17' 8.57". Bodies in the 1st, 
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5,h, 6th and 7th parts of a rasi go into the 7 rasis starting from the rasi 
itself, if it is an odd rasi, or starting from the 7th sign from it, if it is an even 
rasi. 
Example 14: Let us say Mercury is at 10° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Vi. 
We see that 10° is in the 3rd part of the rasi and 19° is in the 5th part of the 
rasi. Because Ge is an odd rasi, the 3rd part in Ge goes into the 3rd from Ge, 
i.e. Le. On the other hand, Vi is an even sign and counting starts from the 
7th from it, i.e. Pi. The 5th from Pi is Cn. So the 5th part of Vi goes into Cn. 
So Mercury is in Le and Jupiter is in Cn in D-7 for this example. 
6.2.8 Ashtamsa Chart (D-8) 

Each rasi is divided into 8 equal parts of 3° 45' each. Bodies in the eight 



46 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

parts of a rasi go into the 8 rasis starting from Ar, Sg or Le, based on 
whether the rasi is a movable, fixed or dual sign. 
Example 15: Let us say Mercury is at 10° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 10° is in the 3rd part of the rasi and 19° is in the 6th part of the 
rasi. Because Ge is a dual rasi, counting starts from Le. The 3rd from Le is 
Li. So the 3rd part in Ge goes into Li in D-8. On the other hand, Sc is a fixed 
sign and counting starts from Sg. The 6th from Sg is Ta. So the 6th part of Sc 
goes into Ta in D-8. So Mercury is in Le and Jupiter is in Ta in D-8 for this 
example. 
6.2.9 Navamsa Chart (D-9) 

Each rasi is divided into 9 equal parts of 3° 20' each. Bodies in the 9 
parts of a rasi go into the 9 rasis starting from Ar, Cp, Li or Cn, based on 
whether the rasi is a fiery, earthy, airy or watery sign. 

This chart is also known as Dharmamsa. It is the most popular chart 
after rasi chart and some astrologers simply refer to it as "Amsa" (division). 
Example 16: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 4Ih part of the rasi and 19° is in the 6th part of the 
rasi. Because Ge is an airy rasi, counting starts from Li. The 4th from Li is 
Cp. So the 4th part in Ge goes into Cp in D-9. On the other hand, Sc is a 
watery sign and counting starts from Cn. The 6th from Cn is Sg. So the 6th 

part of Sc goes into Sg in D-9. So Mercury is in Cp and Jupiter is in Sg in D-
9 for this example. 
6.2.10 Dasamsa Chart (D-10) 

Each rasi is divided into 10 equal parts of 3° each. Bodies in the 10 
parts of a rasi go into the 10 rasis starting from the rasi itself or the 9th from 
it, based on whether the rasi is an odd or even sign. 

This chart is also known as Dasamaamsa or Karmamsa or 
Swargamsa. 
Example 17: Let us say Mercury is at 10° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 10° is in the 4th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 7th part of the 
rasi. Because Ge is an odd rasi, counting starts from Ge itself. The 4th from 
Ge is Vi. So the 4th part in Ge goes into Vi in D-10. On the other hand, Sc is 
an even sign and counting starts from the 9th from it, i.e. Cn. The 7th from 
Cn is Cp. So the 7th part of Sc goes into Cp in D-10. So Mercury is in Vi and 
Jupiter is in Cp in D-10 for this example. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 47 

6.2.11 Rudramsa Chart (D-11) 
Each rasi is divided into 11 equal parts of 2° 43' 38" each. Count rasis 

from Ar to the rasi being divided, in the zodiacal order. Count the same 
number of rasis anti-zodiacally" from Ar. Bodies in the 11 parts of the rasi 
go into the 11 rasis starting from the rasi found thus. 

This chart is also known as Ekadasamsa. Example 18: Let us say 
Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see that 11° is in the 
5th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 7th part of the rasi. In the case of Ge, it is 
the 3rd rasi from Ar. The 3rd rasi from Ar in the reverse order is Aq. So 
counting starts from the Aq. The 5th from Aq is Ge. So the 5th part in Ge 
goes into Ge in D-11. In the case of Sc, it is the 8th rasi from Ar. Counting 
the 8th rasi from Ar in the reverse order, we get Vi. So counting starts from 
Vi. The 7th from Vi is Pi. So the 7th part of Sc goes into Pi in D-11. So 
Mercury is in Ge and Jupiter is in Pi in D-11 for this example. 
6.2.12 Dwadasamsa Chart (D-12) 

Each rasi is divided into 12 equal parts of 2° 30' each. Bodies in the 12 
parts of a rasi go into the 12 rasis starting from the rasi itself. 
Example 19: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 5th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 8th part of the 
rasi. The 5th from Ge is Li. So the 5th part in Ge goes into Li in D-12. The 8th 

from Sc is Ge. So the 8th part of Sc goes into Ge in D-12. So Mercury is in 
Li and Jupiter is in Ge in D-12 for this example. 
6.2.13 Shodasamsa Chart (D-16) 

Each rasi is divided into 16 equal parts of 1° 52' 30" each. Bodies in the 
16 parts of a rasi go into the 16 rasis starting from Ar, Le and Sg, based on 
whether the rasi is movable, fixed or dual. When counting rasis from a 
given rasi, we go zodiacally. After going over the 12 rasis from a rasi, we 
get the same rasi as the 13th rasi. So the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th rasis from a 
rasi are simply the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th rasis. 

This chart is also known as Kalamsa. 
Example 20: Let us say Mercury is at 11 ° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 6th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 11th part of the 
rasi. Ge is a dual rasi and we start counting from Sg. The 6th from Sg is Ta. 
So the 6lh part in Ge goes into Ta in D-16. On the other hand, Sc is a fixed 

11 The zodiacal order is: Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le,... The anti-
zodiacal order is: Ar, Pi, Aq, Cp, Sg,... 



48 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

sign and we start counting from Le. The 11th from Le is Ge. So the 11th part 
of Sc goes into Ge in D-16. So Mercury is in Ta and Jupiter is in Ge in D-
16 for this example. 
6.2.14 Vimsamsa Chart (D-20) 

Each rasi is divided into 20 equal parts of 1° 30' each. Bodies in the 20 
parts of a rasi go into the 20 rasis starting from Ar, Sg and Le, based on 
whether the rasi is movable, fixed or dual. 
Example 21: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 8th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 13th part of the 
rasi. Because Ge is a dual rasi, we start counting from Le. The 8th from Le 
is Pi. So the 8th part in Ge goes into Pi in D-20. On the other hand, Sc is a 
fixed sign and the counting starts from Sg. The 13th from Sg is Sg itself (13th = 
1st, after removing 12). So the 13th part of Sc goes into Sg in D-20. So 
Mercury is in Pi and Jupiter is in Sg in D-20 for this example. 
6.2.15 Chaturvimsamsa Chart (D-24) 

Each rasi is divided into 24 equal parts of 1° 15' each. Bodies in the 24 
parts of a rasi go into the 24 rasis starting from Le or Cn, based on whether 
the rasi is odd or even. 

This chart is also called Siddhamsa. 
Example 22: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 9th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 16th part of the 
rasi. Ge is an odd rasi and counting starts from Le. The 9th from Le is Ar. 
So the 9th part in Ge goes into Ar in D-24. On the other hand, Sc is an even 
rasi and counting starts from Cn. The 16th from Cn is Li (16th = 4th, after 
removing 12). So the 16th part of Sc goes into Li in D-24. So Mercury is in 
Ar and Jupiter is in Li in D-24 for this example. 
6.2.16 Nakshatramsa Chart (D-27) 

Each rasi is divided into 27 equal parts of 1° 6' 40" each. Bodies in the 
27 parts of a rasi go into the 12 rasis starting from Ar, Cn, Li and Cp based 
on whether the rasi is a fiery, earthy, airy or watery rasi. 

This chart is also called Saptavimsamsa or Bhamsa. 
Example 23: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 10th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 18th part of the 
rasi. Because Ge is an airy rasi, counting starts from Li. The 10th from Li is 
Le. So the 10th part in Ge goes into Le in D-27. On the other hand, Sc is a 
watery sign and counting starts from Cp. The 18th from Cp is Ge (18th = 6th, 
after removing 12). So the 18th part of Sc goes into Ge in D-27. So Mercury 
is in Le and Jupiter is in Ge in D-27 for this example. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 49 

6.2.17 Trimsamsa Chart (D-30) 
D-30 positions of planets are computed based on the following rules: 

Odd Rasis: 
Bodies in 0°-5° in odd rasis are placed in Ar in D-30. 
Bodies in 5°-10° in odd rasis are placed in Aq in D-30. 
Bodies in 10°-18° in odd rasis are placed in Sg in D-30. 
Bodies in 18°-25° in odd rasis are placed in Ge in D-30. 
Bodies in 25°-30° in odd rasis are placed in Li in D-30. 

Even Rasis: 
Bodies in 0°-5° in even rasis are placed in Ta in D-30. 
Bodies in 5°-12° in even rasis are placed in Vi in D-30. 
Bodies in 12°-20° in even rasis are placed in Pi in D-30. 
Bodies in 20°-25° in even rasis are placed in Cp in D-30. 
Bodies in 25°-30° in even rasis are placed in Sc in D-30. 

6.2.18 Khavedamsa Chart (D-40) 
Each rasi is divided into 40 equal parts of 45' each. Bodies in the 40 

parts of a rasi go into the 40 rasis starting from Ar or Li, based on whether 
the rasi is odd or even. 

This chart is also called Chatvarimsamsa. 
Example 24: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 15th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 26th part of the 
rasi. Because Ge is an odd rasi, counting starts from Ar. The 15th from Ar 
is Ge (15th = 3rd, after removing 12). So the 15th part in Ge goes into Ge in D-
40. On the other hand, Sc is an even rasi and counting starts from Li. The 
26th from Li is Sc (26th = 2nd, after removing multiples of 12). So the 26th part 
of Sc goes into Sc in D-40. So Mercury is in Ge and Jupiter is in Sc in D-
40 for this example. 
6.2.19 Akshavedamsa Chart (D-45) 

Each rasi is divided into 45 equal parts of 40' each. Bodies in the 45 
parts of a rasi go into the 45 rasis starting from Ar, Le or Sg, based on 
whether the rasi is a movable, fixed or dual rasi. 

This chart is also called Pancha-chatvarimsamsa. 
Example 25: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. 
We see that 11° is in the 17th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 29th part of the 
rasi. Because Ge is a dual rasi, we start counting from Sg. The 17th from Sg 
is Ar (17th = 5th, after removing 12). So the 17th part in Ge goes into Ar in D- 



50 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

45. On the other hand, Sc is a fixed rasi and counting starts from Le. The 
29tn from Le is Sg. So the 29th part of Sc goes into Sg in D-45. So Mercury 
is in Ar and Jupiter is in Sg in D-45 for this example. 
6.2.20 Shaslttyamsa Chart (D-60) 

Each rasi is divided into 60 equal parts of 30' each. Bodies in the 60 
parts of a rasi go into the 60 rasis starting the rasi itself. 

To see the part occupied by a body, we can take its longitude from the 
beginning of the occupied rasi, multiply it by 2, take degrees and ignore 
minutes, add 1 to it. 
Example 26: Let us say Jupiter is at 222° 58' , i.e. 12° 58' in Scorpio. 
Multiplying 12° 58' by 2, we get 25° 56'. Taking degrees and ignoring minutes, 
we get 25. Adding 1, we get 26. So 12° 58' is in the 26th part of rasi (where 
each part is l/60th of rasi, i.e. 30'). So we have to count the 26th rasi from 
Sc. Removing multiples of 12 from 26, we get 2. The 2nd rasi from Sc is Sg. 
So Jupiter is in Sg in D-60 in this example. 
6.3    Divisional Chart Significations

6.4    Insights on Divisional Charts 
Divisional charts based on divisions between 1 and 12 operate in the 

physical plane. They show physical matters. Body, wealth, residence, wife, 
children, parents - these are all matters relating to the physical self. 

Divisional charts based on divisions between 13 and 24 (i.e. D-16, D-
20 and D-24) operate in the mental plane. They show matters that exist at 
the mental plane. Sense of pleasure and unhappiness, religiousness, learning 
and knowledge - these are all matters relating to the mind and intellect. 

Divisional charts based on divisions between 25 and 36 (i.e. D-27 and 
D-30) operate in the plane of sub-consciousness. One's strengths, 
weaknesses, inherent nature, evils, certain psychological imbalances-these 
are all matters relating to the sub-conscious self. 

Divisional charts based on divisions above 36 (i.e. D-40, D-45 and 



52 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

D-60) operate in a kaarmic plane of existence that is above physical self, 
mind and sub-conscious self. Based on the karma from previous lives, we 
all have an existence at a level that goes beyond the levels of body, mind and 
sub-consciousness. Existence at that level has a considerable role in deciding 
the pattern of one's life, along with existence at the physical, mental and 
sub-conscious levels. Higher divisional charts like D-40, D-45 and D-60 
throw light on this subtle aspect of chart analysis.12

6.5   Using Divisional Charts 
It is very important to memorize Table 11. We should choose the divisional 

chart to analyze, based on the matter we are interested in. If we want to 
know something about one's career, for example, we should analyze one's 
dasamsa chart (D-10). If we want to know something about one's luxuries 
and pleasures, we should analyze one's shodasamsa (D-16). Based on the 
matter of interest, we decide which area of life is relevant and analyze the 
corresponding divisional chart. 

We should remember which planets, rasis and houses show a particular 
matter and find links between them in the divisional chart of interest. 

Suppose we want to see when one would go abroad. It is related to 
residence and fortune and we should analyze one's chaturthamsa (D-4). 
The 9th and 12th houses show foreign residence. Rahu signifies foreign 
residence. We should now look for links. If 12th lord is with Rahu in the 9th 

house in D-4, it can suggest that one would live abroad, probably during the 
periods of Rahu or 12th lord or 9th house. 

Suppose we want to see when one would get a promotion at the office. 
Because D-10 shows one's career and achievements, we should analyze 
D-10. Because GL (ghati lagna) shows power and authority, planets or 
rasis giving a promotion are usually connected with GL. They are in GL or 
aspect GL. Because AL shows status, planets associating with AL or the 5th 

or the 10th from it are favorable. If the lord of AL is in the 10th from it and 
aspects GL, probably his period will give a promotion. 

In this manner, we should analyze the divisional chart that signifies the 
sphere of life that we are interested in and analyze the houses that show the 
matter of interest. This is the key to correct chart analysis. We will see 
many examples of this in coming chapters. 

12 The content of this paragraph has philosophical undercurrents that may be difficult to 
understand for students without a good background in Hindu philosophy. This 
knowledge should be learnt directly from a competent guru. Readers are advised to 
leave these higher charts until they find one. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 53 

6.6   Varga Grouping and Amsabala 
We have several varga groups, i.e. groups of divisional charts. 
If a planet is in its moolatrikona or an own rasi or its rasi of exaltation in 

a chart, it makes the planet very strong in that chart. In each group of 
divisional charts, we can count the divisional charts in which a planet occupies 
its moolatrikona or an own rasi or its rasi of exaltation. Based on the count 
of such good divisional charts for the planet, we say that the planet is in a 
particular amsa (the higher this number is, the stronger the planet is). 
6.6.1 Shadvarga 

"Shadvarga" literally means "six divisions". Shadvarga is a group of the 
following divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) D-9, (5) D-
12,and,(6)D-30. 

The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the corresponding count 
of divisional charts - from the above list - in which it occupies its 
moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation or an own rasi is listed below: 

Kimsukaamsa - 2, Vyanjanaamsa- 3, Chaamaraamsa - 4, Chatraamsa 
- 5, Kundalaamsa - 6. 

6.6.2 Sapta varga 
"Sapta varga" literally means "seven divisions". Sapta varga is a group 

of the following divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) D-7, 
(5) D-9, (6) D-12, and, (7) D-30. 

The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the corresponding count 
of divisional charts - from the above list - in which it occupies its 
moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation or an own rasi is listed below: ' 

Kimsukaamsa-2, Vyanjanaamsa-3, Chaamaraamsa - 4, Chatraamsa 
- 5, Kundalaamsa - 6, Mukutaamsa - 7. 

6.6.3 Dasa varga 
"Dasa varga" literally means "ten divisions". Dasa varga is a group of 

the following divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) D-7, (5) 
D-9, (6) D-10, (7) D-12, (8) D-16, (9) D-30, and, (10) D-60. 

The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the corresponding count 
of divisional charts - from the above list - in which it occupies its 
moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation or an own rasi is listed below: 

Paarijaataamsa - 2, Uttamaamsa - 3, Gopuraamsa- 4, 
Simhaasanaamsa - 5, Paaraavataamsa - 6, Devalokaamsa - 7, 
Brahmalokamsa - 8, Airaavataamsa - 9, Sreedhaamaamsa - 10. 



5 4 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

NOTE: This group is very important and some yogas- special combinations 
- make use of these amsas. For example, lagna lord or ghati lagna lord in 
Simhaasanaamsa would make one very famous. A quadrant lord with good 
amsabala in dasavarga makes one very successful. Readers should memorize 
the above amsas. 
6.6.4 Shodasa varga 

"Shodasa varga" literally means "sixteen divisions". Shodasa varga is a 
group of the following divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) 
D-4, (5) D-7, (6) D-9, (7) D-10, (8) D-12, (9) D-16, (10) D-20, (11) D-24, 
(12) D-27, (13) D-30, (14) D-40, (15) D-45, and, (16) D-60. 

The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the corresponding count 
of divisional charts - from the above list - in which it occupies its 
moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation or an own rasi is listed below: 

Bhedakaamsa - 2, Kusumaamsa - 3, Nagapurushaamsa - 4, 
Kandukaamsa - 5, Keralaamsa - 6, Kalpavrikshaamsa - 7, 
Chandanavanaamsa - 8, Poornachandraamsa - 9, Uchchaisravaamsa -10, 
Dhanvantaryamsa - 11, Sooryakaantaamsa - 12, Vidrumaamsa- 13, 
Indraasanaamsa - 14, Golokaamsa- 15, Sree Vallabhaamsa - 16. 
Example 27: Let us look at the chart of Bill Cosby. He is a famous TV and 
film actor in USA. He is one of the greatest theatrical personalities of the 
world and a natural actor. He is known as a charitable person who donated 
huge amounts of money for the education of African American kids. His 
birthdata is: 12th July 1937,12:30 am (Time Zone: 5:00 west of GMT), 75 W 
10, 39N57. 

The 9lh house shows charitable nature and the 12th house shows 
expenditure. Jupiter owns the 9th and 12th houses and occupies the 9th house 
here. This may be the reason for Mr. Cosby's charitable nature. Let us see 
the amsabala of Jupiter. Jupiter is at 29° 49' in Sg. The signs occupied by 
him in various charts are shown below: 

Rasi: Sg, D-2: Cn, D-3: Li, D-4: Vi, D-7: Ge, D-9: Sg, D-10: Vi, D-
12: Sc, D-16: Pi, D-20: Pi, D-24: Cn, D-27: Ge, D-30: Li, D-40: Cn, D-
45: Le, D-60: Sc. 

Jupiter owns Sg and Pi. His moolatrikona is Sg. He is exalted in Cn. So 
we have to count the charts in which he is in Cn, Sg or Pi. 
(1) Out of the 6 divisional charts of shadvarga, Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 

3 charts -Rasi, D-2 and D-9. So Jupiter is in Vyanjanaamsa. 
(2) Out of the 7 divisional charts of sapta varga, Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 

3 charts -Rasi, D-2 and D-9. So Jupiter is in Vyanjanaamsa. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 55 

(3) Out of the 10 divisional charts of dasa varga, Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 
4 charts -Rasi, D-2, D-9 and D-16. So Jupiter is in Gopuraamsa. 

(4) Out of the 16 divisional charts of shodasa varga, Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or 
Pi in 7 charts -Rasi, D-2, D-9, D-16, D-20, D-24 and D-40. So Jupiter 
is in Kalpavrikshaamsa. 
Being in Gopuramsa and Kalpavrikshamsa makes Jupiter very strong. 

6.7   Conclusion 
The science of Vedic astrology stands on the basis of 4 pillars - grahas 

(planets), rasis (signs), vargas (divisional charts) and bhavas (houses). This 
chapter covered the third pillar - divisional charts. If readers have an 
accurate software program that gives all the divisional charts for any chart, 
it may be acceptable to ignore the details of computation. However, it is 
good to be aware of the details. 

For D-8 and D-11, there are different versions. For D-2 and D-3 also, 
there are variations. Different variations of divisional charts show different 
spheres of activities. However, we will ignore the variations in this book. 

Twenty divisional charts are covered here. Each divisional chart throws 
light on a specific sphere of activity. For example, D-10 shows career, D-9 
shows marital life and D-7 shows the fortune of children. Choosing the 
correct divisional chart for analyzing the matter of interest is the key to 
correct analysis. 



7. Houses 

7.1 Introduction 
The zodiac consists of 12 rasis. Each rasi is said to form a house. When 

we talk about houses, we always have a point of reference. The rasi 
containing the point of reference is the 1st house. The next rasi is the 2nd 

house. The rasi after that is the 3rd house. Suppose Moon is in Aquarius and 
suppose we want houses with respect to Moon. Then Aquarius is the 1st 

house, Pisces is the 2nd house, Aries is the 3rd house, Taurus is the 4th house 
and so on. As we go around the zodiac, we reach Capricorn when we find 
the 12th house. 

In the same chart, Sun may be in Taurus. When we find houses with 
respect to Sun, Taurus contains the 1st house, Gemini contains the 2nd house, 
Cancer contains the 3rd house and so on. If Ghati Lagna is in Virgo in the 
same chart, then the 1st, 2nd and 3rd houses with respect to Ghati Lagna are in 
Virgo, Libra and Scorpio respectively. 

Thus we can find houses with respect to different references. The 
same sign may contain the 2nd house with respect to one reference and the 
6th house with respect to another reference. If we mention houses without 
clearly specifying the reference used, it means that the reference used is 
lagna (ascendant). Lagna is the default reference when finding houses. 

Different houses stand for different matters. The matters signified by a 
house also depend on the reference used. Each reference throws light on 
matters of a specific nature and that colors the meaning of a house. For 
example, the 11th house from lagna may stand for something and the 11th 

house from arudha lagna may stand for something else. It depends on the 
kind of matters shown by the two references - lagna and arudha lagna. 

In addition, the matters signified by a house depend on the divisional 
chart in which we are finding houses. Each divisional chart throws light on 
matters of a specific nature. Again, that colors the meaning of a house. The 
4th house from lagna in D-16 may mean something and the 4th house from 
lagna in D-24 may mean something else. We have already listed the areas 
of life seen from various divisional charts in the chapter on "Divisional 
Charts". 
7.2 Significations of Houses 

The matters signified by various houses are listed below. For further 
discussion on the results of various houses, readers may refer either to the 
ancient classics or to the modern classic - How to Judge a Horoscope 
(Vols I & II) by Dr. B.V. Raman. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 57 

First House: Physical body, complexion, appearance, head, intelligence, 
strength, energy, fame, success, nature of birth, caste. 

Second House: Wealth, assets, family, speech, eyes, mouth, face, voice, 
food. 

Third House: Younger co-borns, confidants, courage, mental strength, 
communication skills, creativity, throat, ears, arms, father's death (7th from 
9th), expenditure on vehicles and house (12th from 4th), travels. 

Fourth House: Mother, vehicles, house, lands, immovable property, 
motherland, childhood, wealth from real estate, education, relatives, 
happiness, comforts, pleasures, peace, state of mind, heart. 

Fifth House: Children, poorvapunya (good deeds of previous lives), 
intelligence, knowledge & scholarship, devotion, mantras (prayers), stomach, 
digestive system, authority/power, fame, love, affection, emotions, judgment, 
speculation. 

Sixth House: Enemies, service, servants, relatives, mental tension, 
injuries, health, diseases, agriculture, accidents, mental affliction, mother's 
younger brother, hips. 

Seventh House: Marriage, marital life, life partner, sex, passion (and 
related happiness), long journeys, partners, business, death, the portion of 
the body below the navel. 

Eighth House: Longevity, debts, disease, ill-fame, inheritance, loss of 
friends, occult studies, evils, gifts, unearned wealth, windfall, disgrace, secrets, 
genitals. 

Ninth House: Father, teacher, boss, fortune, religiousness, spirituality, 
God, higher studies & high knowledge, fortune in a foreign land, foreign 
trips, diksha (joining a religious order), past life and the cause of birth, 
grandchildren, principles, dharma, intuition, compassion, sympathy, leadership, 
charity, thighs. 

Tenth House: Growth, profession, career, karma (action), conduct in 
society, fame, honors, awards, self-respect, dignity, knees. 

Eleventh House: Elder co-borns, income, gains, realization of hopes, 
friends, ankles. 

Twelfth House: Losses, expenditure, punishment, imprisonment, 
hospitalization, pleasures in bed, misfortune, bad habits, sleep, meditation, 
donation, secret enemies, heaven, left eye, feet, residence away from the 
place of birth, moksha (emancipation/liberation). 

We can find houses from houses and concatenate the meanings in some 
places. For example, the 3 rd house shows younger brother. The 2nd house 
from the 3rd house is the 4th house (count 1, 2 from 3rd and get 3rd, 4th). So 



58 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

the 4th house shows the wealth, speech etc of younger brother. The 7th 

house from the 3rd house is the 9th house and it can show younger sibling's 
spouse. The 11th house from lagna shows friends and the 4th house from 
lagna is nothing but the 6th house from the 11th house. So the 4th house 
stands for enemies, diseases and debts of friends. In this manner, we can 
deduce many additional meanings of various houses. 
7.3    Common References for Houses 

It may be noted from the list above that each house shows many matters. 
It may be confusing at first to pick the right meaning that is relevant in a 
particular analysis. It becomes easier with experience. We have to note the 
area of life seen in the divisional chart under examination. We have to 
choose the meanings of houses that are relevant in that area of life. For 
example, the 4th house shows education, vehicle, house and mother (among 
other things). A list of the areas of life seen in various divisional charts is 
given in the chapter on "Divisional Charts". We see from it that learning is 
seen from D-24, pleasures and comforts from D-16, house and immovable 
property from D-4 and parents from D-12. So the 4th houses in D-24, D-16, 
D-4 and D-12 show education, vehicle, house and mother (respectively). 

We should also take cognisance of the kind of matters shown by various 
references and interpret the meaning of a house accordingly. The 4th house 
from lagna, the 4th house from arudha lagna and the 4th house from paaka 
lagna can mean different things, depending on the matters shown by lagna, 
arudha lagna and paaka lagna. Now we will learn about the most common 
references used in finding houses and the matters shown by them. 

Depending on the matter we are analyzing, we should look at the correct 
divisional chart, the correct reference and the correct house. Then only 
good results can be obtained. All this complexity may be perplexing to new 
students. However, there is something we should realize. Human existence 
is a very complicated thing and it is silly and unscientific to expect a simplistic 
model for the complicated human life. Though Vedic astrology has too many 
parameters used in chart analysis, they are all important as they give us the 
degrees of freedom necessary for modeling something as complicated as 
human life. However, if we do not understand what each parameter means 
and end up using them in a mixed-up way, we will get nowhere. So readers 
should strive to understand these basics very clearly. 
7.3.1  Lagna 

Lagna is the most commonly used reference when finding houses. If no 
reference is mentioned when houses are listed, it means that lagna - the 
default reference - was used. Lagna shows true self. If we are trying to 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 59 

understand someone's status in society, lagna may not be the correct 
reference. Status does not relate to "true self". It is a part of the illusion of 
this world. However, if we are trying to understand someone's intentions in 
doing something or someone's knowledge or someone's persistence, it relates 
to "true self". So they are seen from the houses counted from lagna. Lagna 
shows true self. It shows the overall spirit of "I" (self). 
7.3.2 Chandra Lagna (Moon lagna) 

Chandra lagna means Moon taken as a reference. We can find houses 
from Moon. Because Moon is the significator of mind, these houses show 
things from the perspective of mind. For example, someone may be working 
in a routine job, but he may have an active and enterprising mind and he 
may be using it in his career. In that case, the 10th house (career) from 
lagna may have the influence of Saturn (routine job) and the 10th house 
from Moon may have the influence of Mars (active and enterprising). 

Houses counted from Moon are useful in looking at things from the 
point of view of mind. When we judge how happy one is, how ambitious one 
is and how one views one's career, the role of mind is paramount. So Chandra 
lagna should not be ignored. 
7.3.3 Ravi Lagna (Sun lagna) 

Ravi lagna means Sun taken as a reference. We can find houses from 
Sun. Because Sun is the significator of soul, these houses show things from 
the perspective of soul. For things related to physical vitality also, Sun is an 
important reference. 
7.3.4 Arudha Lagna 

Computation of arudha lagna (AL) will be explained in the chapter on 
"Arudha Padas". For now, the readers should remember that arudha lagna 
shows how a native is perceived in the world. It also shows the status of a 
native. 

A planet in the 10th house from lagna may give some important 
developments in one's profession. A planet in the 10th house from Chandra 
lagna may give some important mental activity in one's profession. A planet 
in the 10th house from arudha lagna may give some important developments 
in one's professional status. 
7.3.5 Paaka Lagna 

Paaka lagna is important when analyzing the natal chart, dasas and 
transits. Paaka lagna is nothing but lagna lord taken as a reference. If 
someone with Pisces lagna has Jupiter in Cancer, then Cancer becomes 
paaka lagna. If someone with Leo lagna has Sun in Virgo, Virgo becomes 
paaka lagna. 



60 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Rasis represent situations and forces influencing the course of a native's 
life and planets represent individual beings. Lagna lord represents the physical 
self of a native. So that is what paaka lagna shows. Houses counted from 
paaka lagna throw light on matters related to the physical self of a native. 

Lagna shows the concept of self and it deals with one's true 
personality. The physical existence of the person is different from this 
conceptual self. This applies to all divisional charts. Let us take an example. 
The 5th house shows scholarship, memory and success in competition. All 
these are related to learning and they are seen in D-24, the chart of learning. 
But they are better seen from different references. Let us find the best 
reference for each. 

Success in competition is related to the illusions and perceptions of the 
world and so the most appropriate reference is arudha lagna. The 5* house 
from arudha lagna shows success in competition. Scholarship is not a 
measurable attribute of the physical existence. It is a property of one's true 
personality and one's conceptual self. So the 5th from lagna shows 
scholarship. If we take the self that exists physically and take its part as 
applicable to the area of life shown by D-24 {i.e. learning), memory is a 
direct attribute of that self. Memory is a property of one's self that physically 
exists. So the 5th house from paaka lagna shows memory the best. 

Saturn's transit13 over the rasi containing one's lagna may throw 
obstructions and hamper one's activities. Saturn's transit over the rasi 
containing one's Chandra lagna may create frustration and mental depression. 
Saturn's transit over the rasi containing one's paaka lagna may leave one 
feeling sick all the time and attack the physical vitality. 
7.3.6 Karakamsa Lagna 

Atma karaka stands for the soul of the person. Atma karaka is an 
important reference point in a chart. Because the soul is an important factor 
in deciding the nature of inner self than the physical existence, atma karaka 
is an important reference point in navamsa chart. Navamsa chart throws 
light on the inner self and the rasi occupied by atma karaka in it is called 
"Karakamsa". We can analyze navamsa chart with respect to Karakamsa. 
The 12th house from Karakamsa shows the liberation of the soul and the 
situation of Ketu there is conducive to moksha. Propitiation of the deities 
corresponding to the strongest planet in the 12th house in navamsa from 
Karakamsa lagna can take one's soul towards moksha. 
13 If a planet occupies, on a given day, a particular rasi, then it is said to "transit" in that 

sign on that day. Transit positions refer to the positions of planets on a given day and 
natal positions refer to the positions of planets at the time of one's birth. This will be 
dealt with in detail in the part "Transit Analysis". 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 61 

7.3.7 Ghati Lagna 
Ghati lagna (GL) shows self, from the point of view of power, authority 

and fame. When we analyze promotions in career or political power of 
politicians, this reference is very important. 
7.3.8 Hora Lagna 

Hora lagna (HL) shows self, from the point of view of wealth. This 
reference is important when analyzing one's wealth. 
7.3.9 Graha Lagnas 

Apart from the above references, we use several "graha lagnas" or 
planetary references. For each house, a planet works as the natural 
significator. To see matters signified by a house, we can take the relevant 
planet as the reference. The list of houses that can be seen from each 
planet is given in Table 12. 

Table 12: Houses signified by planets 
 

Planet Houses 
Sun 9th, 10th, 11th

Moon 4th, 1st, 2nd, 11th, 9th

Mars 3rd

Mercury 6th

Jupiter 5th

Venus 7th

Saturn 8th, 12th

When we analyze courage or persistence or weapons or younger 
brothers or the expenditure on house or the expenditure on car, we have to 
analyze the 3rd house in the relevant divisional chart. In all those cases, we 
can see the 3rd house from lagna and the 3rd house from Mars and draw 
conclusions based on the strength of both. If Mars is stronger than lagna, 
then the 3rd house from Mars may be more important than the 3rd house 
from lagna. Similarly, we see the 4th from lagna and the 4th from Moon for 
mother. We see the 9th from Sun and the 9* from lagna for father. We see 
the 12th from lagna and the 12th from Saturn for losses. We see the 5th from 
lagna and the 5th from Jupiter for progeny. We see the 7th from lagna and 
the 7th from Venus for marriage. 

In addition to the above list, we can find a house with respect to the 
naisargika karaka (natural significator) who signifies the matter shown 



62 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

by a house. For example, Venus signifies vehicles. D-16 is the chart that 
shows vehicles and pleasures. So the 4th from Venus in D-16 can show 
one's happiness from vehicles and other luxuries. As Mercury is the natural 
significator of speech, the 2nd house from lagna and the 2nd house from 
Mercury show speech (in rasi,D-9 and D-2714). A complete list of naisargika 
karakas of different matters can be found in the chapter on "Karakas". 
7.4    Special Categories 

There are some special categories of houses: 
(1) The 1st, 5th and 9th houses form a triangle and they are known as "konas" 

or "trikonas" or "trines". 
(2) The 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses are called "kendras" or "quadrants" or 

"angles". 
(3) The 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses are called "panapharas" or 

"succedants". These are basically the quadrants from the 2nd house. 
(4) The 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses are called "apoklimas" or "precedants". 

These are basically the quadrants from the 3rd house. 
(5) The 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th houses are called "upachayas". 
(6) The 6th, 8th and 12th houses are called "trik sthanas" or "dusthanas" 

(bad/evil houses). 
(7) The 4th and 8th houses are called "chaturasras". 

We can find trines, quadrants etc from lagna or other references or 
even from houses. We can find houses with respect to a reference and then 
find trines, quadrants etc with respect to those houses. For example, let us 
take the 3rd house from lagna. Trines from it are the 1st, 5th and 9th houses 
from it. The 5th house from the 3rd house is the 7th house (count 1, 2, 3, 4, and 
5 starting from the 3rd house. We get 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th. So the 5,h from 3rd is 
7th). The 9th house from the 3rd house is the 11th house. So 3rd, 7th and 11th houses 
are the trines from the 3rd house. Similarly, the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses are 
the quadrants from the 3rd house. And the 5th, 8th, 12th and 1st houses are the 
upachayas from the 3rd house. The 8th, 10th and 2nd houses are the dusthanas 
from the 3rd house. Thus we can find trines, quadrants etc from any 
house. 
14 Rasi chart shows the overall picture and the manifestation at the physical level. 

Navamsa shows basic skills and the way one interacts with others. D-27 shows one's 
strengths and weaknesses. All the three charts are important. One may have strong 
benefics in the 2nd from lagna in rasi and navamsa charts, but malefics in the 2nd 
from Mercury in D-27. In such a case, one will be a skilled speaker, but harsh speech 
may be his weakness. D-27 throws light on the subconscious self and shows one's 
inherent strengths and weaknesses. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 6 3 

7.4.1 Trines 
Trines are the abode of Goddess Lakshmi, who rules prosperity. Trines 

from any reference are houses that are beneficial to the reference. They 
bring prosperity and well-being to the reference. For example, trines from 
lagna shows prosperity of self. 

In Hinduism, there are 4 purushaarthas (purposes/goals of man) - (1) 
Dharma: righteousness and adherence to one's duty, (2) Artha: money and 
career, (3) Kaama: desiring things and getting them, and, (4) Moksha: final 
liberation of soul. 

Dharma is shown by the trines from the 1st house - 1st, 5th and 9th - and 
they show prosperity of self, intelligence and dharma15. They are called 
"dharma trikonas" (trines of duty). The character of a person, his intelligence 
and his righteousness decide how one follows dharma - the first purpose 
of human existence. 

Trines from the 2nd house are called "artha trikonas" (trines of money) 
and they show money related activities. The 2nd house shows wealth. The 
6th house shows service. The 10th house shows career and activities in 
society. These three houses show money related activities and how one 
follows artha - the second purpose of human existence. 

Trines from the 3rd house are called "kaama trikonas" (trines of desire) 
and they show one's desires and how one gets them. The 3rd house shows 
one's persistence. The 7th house shows relations and sex. The 11th house 
shows gains. These three houses show how one follows kaama - the third 
purpose of human existence. 

Trines from the 4th house (4th - harmony, 8th - occult studies and spiritual 
awakening and 12th - moksha) are called "moksha trikonas" (trines of 
liberation) and they show how one follows moksha - the fourth purpose of 
human existence. 

Digbala of planets who attain full digbala in various of these trines shows 
the strength of different purushaarthas in one's life. Dasas like "Trikona 
Dasa" which are based on trines show how one follows the four 
purushaarthas in life. 

Planets in mutual trines16 make each other prosper. 
7.4.2 Quadrants 

Quadrants are the abode of Sri Maha Vishnu, the Supreme Lord who 
sustains this universe as per Hinduism. Quadrants from any reference show 
15 Dharma literally means duty. However, it has come to mean righteousness. 
16 We say that two planets are in "mutual trines", if one planet is in a trine from the 

other. 



64 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

its sustenance. The 1st house (self), 4th house (comforts), 7th house (marriage 
and relations with others) and the 10th house (profession) sustain each other. 

Planets in mutual quadrants17 have a sustaining effect on each other. 
7.4.3 Upachayas 

Upachayas from a reference show forces causing gains and growth to 
the matters signified by the reference. For example, arudha lagna shows 
one's status and the upachayas from arudha lagna show improvement of 
status. 
7.4.4 Dusthanas 

Dusthanas from a reference show forces causing setbacks to the matters 
signified by it. If a dusthana is fortified or afflicted by malefics, it may show 
serious obstacles. If a dusthana is weak, it shows that obstacles will be 
easily overcome. For example, exalted 8th lord may show a lot of troubles 
and debilitated 8th lord may show easy sailing. 
7.4.5 Visible Half and Invisible Half 

The zodiac is divided into two halves in every chart: The 7th, 8th, 9th, 
10th, 11th and 12th houses form the "visible half of the zodiac. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 
4th, 5th and 6th houses form the "invisible half of the zodiac. The houses in the 
visible half of the zodiac with respect to a reference give results that can be 
seen in the material world and the houses in the invisible half of the zodiac 
give results that cannot be easily seen. It is for this reason that the bases of 
dharma trikona (1st house) and moksha trikona (4th house) are in the 
invisible half and the bases of artha trikona (10th house) and kaama 
trikona (7th house) are in the visible half. 
7.4.6 Quick Summary 
Trines: Prosperity and flourishing 
Quadrants: Sustenance and vital activity 
Upachayas: Gains and growth 
Dusthanas: Setbacks and obstacles 
Argala sthanas13: Decisive influences 

7.5    A Controversy 
Houses are found with respect to lagna, special lagnas and some planets. 

Houses are found in rasi chart and in all the divisional charts. Some scholars 
17 We say that two planets are in "mutual quadrants", if one planet is in a quadrant from 

the other. 
18 This will be covered in the chapter on "Aspects and Argalas". 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 6 5 

ignore all these and take houses only with respect to lagna and only in 
rasi chart. They prepare something called "bhaava chakra" or "chalit 
chakra", in which houses can start in one rasi and end in another. They 
take lagna" s longitude to be the mid-point of the first house and 
construct all the houses accordingly. In the "equal house method", they 
take a 30° arc with center at lagna as the 1st house. The next 30° arc is 
taken as the 2nd house and so on. This method is popular among Indian 
astrologers. Another method taught by Sripathi is more complicated and 
it is also popular. However, this author recommends neither. Each rasi is 
a house. The rasi containing the reference point chosen is the 1st house 
and the next rasi is the 2nd house. 

Though there are some indirect references in BPHS19 suggesting that 
Parasara supported house divisions placing houses in 2 rasis, there are 
quite a few direct references making it amply clear that each house falls 
in one rasi. Parasara taught us to find houses by counting rasis from the 
reference chosen. Moreover, only this approach is logical as we go to 
divisional charts. Parasara's treatment does not differentiate between rasi 
and divisional charts, as far as the basic techniques go. 

So readers are advised to ignore all the discussions found in other 
textbooks on house division methods, "bhaava chakra" and "chalit 
chakra". It may do good to follow the instructions in this chapter. 

19 "Brihat Paaraasara Hora Saastram" is a classic by Sage Parasara. It is the most 
authentic and final treatise on Vedic astrology. It was written more than 5,000 years 
ago. 



8. Karakas 

8.1    Introduction 
The word karaka20 means "one who causes". Karaka of a matter is 

the significator of the matter. He is the one who causes events related to 
that matter. 

There are 3 kinds of karakas: 
(1) Naisargika karakas (natural significators, 9 in number). 
(2) Chara karakas (variable significators, 8 in number), and, 
(3) Sthira karakas (fixed significators, 7 in number), 

One should not use the three types of karakas in a mixed-up way. 
Karakas of each type have a specific purpose. One should understand the 
distinction between chara, sthira and naisargika karakas clearly and use 
them accordingly. 

Naisargika karakas shows everything that exists in the creation. They 
include Rahu, Ketu and the seven planets. They are presided by Brahma. 
Naisargika karakas show not only human beings, but they show various 
impersonal things and matters. They show everything that exists in Brahma's 
creation and affects a person. Naisargika karakas are very useful in phalita 
Jyotish, i.e. analysis of general results. 

Chara karakas include Rahu and the seven planets. They do not include 
Ketu, as Ketu stands for moksha (emancipation) and does not stand for any 
person who affects one's sustenance. Chara karakas are presided by Vishnu 
and they show people who play a role in one's life. As Vishnu presides over 
activities related to sustenance, achievements and spiritual progress, chara 
karakas show these aspects of one's life. Chara karakas show people who 
play an important role in one's sustenance and achievements. Examples are 
- mother, father, wife, advisors etc. Chara karakas are very useful in Raja 
Yogas and in spiritual progress. They also show how our karma (cumulative 
sum of actions) is carried from one life to another. 

Sthira karakas include only 7 planets because only they have physical 
bodies. They are presided by Shiva. As Shiva presides over death21, they 
show the destruction of body. Sthira karakas are useful in timing the death 
of various near relatives. 

20 This is pronounced as "kaaraka". 
21 In Indian philosophy, death is nothing but praana (life) becoming sthira (fixed) 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 67 

8.2    Chara Karakas 
We use the following procedure to find chara karakas: 

(1) Take the eight planets - Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn 
and Rahu. For each planet, find its advancement from the beginning of the 
rasi occupied by it. For Rahu, measure the advancement from the end of his 
rasi. 

(2) Arrange them in the decreasing order of advancement. 
(3) The planet with the highest advancement is Atma Karaka (significator of 

self). We will denote him by AK. Find other chara karakas using Table 13. 
Table 13: Chara karakas 

 

Advancement Order Karaka Symbol Persons shown22

Highest 1 Atma Karaka AK Self 
 2 Amatya Karaka AmK Ministers23

 3 Bhratri Karaka BK Siblings 
 4 Matri Karaka MK Mother 
Lowest 5 Pitri Karaka PiK Father 
 6 Putra Karaka PK Children 
 7 Jnaati24 Karaka GK (JK) Rivals25

 8 Dara Karaka DK Spouse 

If two planets have the same degrees, we should compare minutes. If 
minutes are same, we should compare the seconds. If two planets are exactly at 
the same longitude, then they will hold a karakatwa (signification) together and 
the next karakatwa will have no ruler. We should use the corresponding sthira 
karaka in that case. However, this rarely becomes necessary, as two planets are 
rarely at exactly the same longitude. 
Example 28: Consider the following planetary position - Sun: 12Ge47, Moon: 
20Ar28, Mars: 13Ge51, Mercury: 25Gel8, Jupiter: 5Ta40, Venus: 17Ge21, 
Saturn: 2Ta28, Rahu: 1 Cn43. Advancements of planets in respective 

22 PK can also show subordinates and followers. PiK can show a boss. 
23 In practical terms, this means people who give advice (advisors and counsellors). 
24 In the symbol "jn" here, 'j' is the voiced palatal consonant and 'n' is the palatal nasal. 

This is a tough sound to pronounce correctly. Some people approximate it as as 
"gnaati" or "gyaati". 

25 This karaka is commonly used for enemies or rivals. However, the literal meaning of 
"jnaati" is "paternal cousin".

rasis are found and arranged in the decreasing order in Table 14. Based on 
it, chara karakas are listed.

So Rahu represents the self of the native for the purpose of raja yogas, 
analysis of sustenance, achievements and spiritual evolution. AK throws 
light on the inner self of a native. Rahu can show a spiritually advanced 
person or a saint on one hand and a revolutionary or an outcast on the other. 
Mercury represents the native's advisors and he shows intellectuals when 
strong and indecisive people when weak. 
Exercise 11: Consider the following planetary position- Sun: 9Sg36, Moon: 
15Le29, Mars: 13 Ar40, Mercury: 21 ScOO, Jupiter: 2Aq06, Venus: 17Sg42, 
Saturn: 9Sc41, Rahu: 14Ge30. Find chara karakas. Guess the nature of the 
inner self of the native. 

8.3   Sthira Karakas 
The following is the list of sthira karakas: 

Sun or Venus (stronger) 26: Father Moon or 
Mars (stronger): Mother 
Mars: Younger siblings, brother-in-law and sister-in-law (spouses of siblings) 
Mercury: Maternal relatives (uncles and aunts) 

26 For methods to compare the strengths of planets, one may refer to the chapter 
"Strength of Planets and Rasis". Some people opine that Sun should be taken as the 
fixed significator of father for daytime births and Venus for nighttime births. 
Similarly, Moon is taken as the fixed significator of mother for nighttime births and 
Mars for daytime births. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 6 9 

Jupiter: Husband, sons, paternal grandparents and other paternal relatives 
(uncles and aunts) 
Venus: Wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law & maternal grandparents Saturn: 
Elder siblings27

The use of sthirakarakas has already been explained. They are presided by 
Shiva and they are used in the timing of death of the above relatives. They 
should not be used in general predictive astrology in the place of naisargika 
karakas. For example, some astrologers use the 7th from Jupiter instead of the 7th 
from Venus to predict marriage. However, Venus is the natural significator of 
marriage and the 7th from Venus should be used for predicting marriage, both in 
male and female charts. When predicting the death of spouse, we use Jupiter in 
female charts and Venus in male charts.28

Another difference between sthira and naisargika karakas is that sthira 
karakas themselves represent the physical bodies of the relatives. In the case of 
naisargika karakas, we must take the relevant house from the karaka. For 
example, Jupiter represents the physical body of husband in a female chart, for 
the purpose of timing death. For the purpose of timing marriage, the 7th from 
Venus (and not Venus himself) shows husband. 

Chara karakas are also similar to sthira karakas in this aspect. We do not 
take the 7th from DK for spouse, but DK himself shows spouse. 

8.4   Naisargika Karakas 
We have seen that chara karakas are used in analyzing the influences of 

various persons on a native, from the point of view of sustenance, achievements 
and spiritual evolution. We have seen that sthira karakas are used in analyzing 
the death of relatives. In addition, we have naisargika karakas, who are the 
natural significators of various matters. These significations are used in general 
Phalita Jyotish. Table 15 gives a list of naisargika karakas. For example, the 4th 
house from Moon shows mother. The 5th house from Jupiter shows sons. If we 
want to analyze the birth of children or analyze some simple events from their 
lives, we should take the 5th from Jupiter. If we want to analyze some children-
related troubles that punish one's soul or if we want to analyze some 
achievements and happiness related to children, they will be more closely 
related to PK (putra karaka of chara karakas). If we want to time the death of a 
child, sthira karaka for children (Jupiter) should be used. 

27 Some scholars give Saturn as the sthira karaka for children instead of elder siblings. 
28 Some scholars take Jupiter as the sthira karaka of spouse in male charts also.

9. Arudha Padas 

9.1 Introduction 
Lagna shows true self. However, people's perceptions of a person can 

be different from reality. Usually, how one is perceived by others is more 
important in material life than who one really is. A political leader perceived 
by people as a powerful and influential person may in reality be a coward 
and a confused man always in doubt. But the reality does not matter in 
deciding his material life. Perceptions matter more. People perceive him as 
a strong leader and that matters the most in deciding his political career. 

A political leader generally perceived as an honest man may in reality 
be badly corrupt. A person generally perceived as an intelligent person may 
in reality be of average intelligence. An intelligent person may score poorly 
in examinations and people may not know his intelligence. 

If someone studied at IIT (a top engineering institute of India), people 
may think that he is very knowledgable. If someone studied at an obscure 
university, people may not get the same impression. But it is possible that 
people's perceptions are wrong and the person who studied at IIT is less 
knowledgable. If an astrologer is frequented by a top politician, people may 
get an impression that the astrologer is good. If an astrologer maintains a 
low profile, people may think that he is average. But the latter astrologer 
may be more learned in reality. 

What people perceive about a person can often be different from reality. 
However, perceptions and reality are both important to an astrologer. 
For predicting some matters, we need knowledge of the perceptions (e.g. 
success of a politician in elections, success in a competitive examination, 
promotion at office etc). For predicting some internal matters, on the other 
hand, true self should be clearly understood. 

So we, astrologers, should be able to separate reality from perceptions 
and understand both correctly. We should understand the true nature of a 
person and also how he is perceived by the world. Arudha padas are a very 
important concept of Vedic astrology and they help us with that tough, but 
important, task. 
9.2 Computation of Bhava Arudhas 

Arudha padas of all the 12 houses (bhavas) in all the divisional charts 
are defined as follows: 
(1) Take sign containing the house of interest in the divisional chart of interest. 
(2) Find the sign occupied by the lord of that house. 



Par: 1: Chart Analysis 73 

NOTE: Aquarius is owned by Saturn and Rahu. Scorpio is owned by 
Mars and Ketu. Take the stronger lord in the case of houses falling in 
these two signs. The chapter on "Strength of Planets and Rasis" will 
explain the rules used in comparing the strengths of planets. 

(3) Count signs from the house of interest to the sign containing its lord. 
Counting is in the zodiacal direction always. For example, if the house 
we are interested in is in Gemini and its lord Mercury is in Aquarius, we 
count signs from Gemini to Aquarius and get 9. 

(4) Count the same number of signs from the sign containing the lord and 
find the ending sign. In the above example, we count 9 signs from 
Aquarius and we end up in Libra. 

(5) Exception: If the sign found thus in step (4) is in the 1st or 7th from the 
original sign in step (1), then we take the 10th sign from the sign found in 
step (4). Otherwise we don't make any change. 

(6) The resulting sign contains the arudha pada of the house of interest. 
Arudha pada of a house is simply called arudha or pada also. In this 

book, we will denote the arudha pada on nth house with An. For example, 
arudha pada of 4lh house is A4 and arudha pada of 9th house is A9. 

There are two special cases: Arudha pada of lagna is denoted as AL 
(arudha lagna) and arudha pada of 12th house is denoted as UL (upapada 
lagna). 
Example 29: Consider Chart 1 and find the arudha padas of all the 12 
houses. 

 



74 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(1) First house is in Vi. Lord is Mercury and he is in Pi. Counting from Vi 
to Pi. we get a count of 7. Counting 7 signs from Pi, we get Vi. However, 
this is in the 1st from the original sign (Vi). So we take the 10th therefrom 
and get Ge. AL is in Ge. 

(2) Second house is in Li. Lord is Venus and he is in Pi. Counting from Li 
to Pi, we get a count of 6. Counting 6 signs from Pi, we get Le. A2 is 
in Le. 

(3) Third house is in Sc. Lord is Mars - he is stronger than Ketu, being 
with 2 other planets - and he is in Ar. Counting from Sc to Ar, we get 
a count of 6. Counting 6 signs from Ar, we get Vi. A3 is in Vi. 

(4) Fourth house is in Sg. Lord is Jupiter and he is in Ar. Counting from Sg 
to Ar, we get a count of 5. Counting 5 signs from Ar, we get Le. A4 is 
in Le. 

(5) Fifth house is in Cp. Lord is Saturn and he is in Ar. Counting from Cp 
to Ar, we get a count of 4. Counting 4 signs from Ar, we get Cn. 
However, this is in the 7th from the original sign (Cp). So we take the 
10th therefrom (from Cn) and get Ar. A5 is in Ar. 

(6) Sixth house is in Aq. Lord is Saturn - he is stronger than Rahu, being 
with 2 other planets - and he is in Ar. Counting from Aq to Ar, we get 
a count of 3. Counting 3 signs from Ar, we get Ge. A6 is in Ge. 

(7) Seventh house is in Pi. Lord is Jupiter and he is in Ar. Counting from 
Pi to Ar, we get a count of 2. Counting 2 signs from Ar, we get Ta. A7 
is in Ta. 

(8) Eighth house is in Ar. Lord is Mars and he is in Ar. Counting from Ar 
to Ar, we get a count of 1. Counting 1 sign from Ar, we get Ar itself. 
However, this is in the 1st from the original sign (Ar). So we take the 
10th therefrom and get Cp. A8 is in Cp. 

(9) Ninth house is in Ta. Lord is Venus and he is in Pi. Counting from Ta 
to Pi, we get a count of 11. Counting 11 signs from Pi, we get Cp. A9 
is in Cp. 

(10) Tenth house is in Ge. Lord is Mercury and he is in Pi. Counting from 
Ge to Pi, we get a count of 10. Counting 10 signs from Pi, we get Sg. 
However, this is in the 7th from the original sign (Ge). So we take the 
10th therefrom (from Sg) and get Vi. A10 is in Vi. 

(11) Eleventh house is in Cn. Lord is Moon and he is in Ge. Counting from 
Cn to Ge, we get a count of 12. Counting 12 signs from Ge, we get Ta. 
All is in Ta. 

(12) Twelfth house is in Le. Lord is Sun and he is in Pi. Counting from Le 
to Pi, we get a count of 8. Counting 8 signs from Pi, we get Li. UL is 
in Li.

Exercise 12: Find arudha padas of all the 12 houses in Chart 2. 

Hint: Mars is with 2 other planets and Ketu is with only one planet. So Mars 
is stronger than Ketu and works as the lord of Sc. Saturn is alone and Rahu 
is with another planet. So Rahu is stronger and works as the lord of Aq. 

9.3    Use of Arudha Lagna 
While lagna stands for true self, arudha lagna (AL) stands for the maya 

associated with self. It shows how the native is perceived in the material 
world. It shows the status of the native. A timid and confused individual 
may be perceived in the world as a strong leader. In that case, that is the 
maya associated with his personality and AL shows it. 

Because arudha lagna deals with maya, illusions, perceptions and 
impressions, it is very important in judging various materialistic things. For 
example, Parasara and Jaimini taught that the 11th and 12th houses from AL 
show financial gains and expenditures. Natural malefics in the 3rd and 6th 

nouses from AL show someone who is perceived as a bold person who hits 



76 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 2 

 
enemies hard. Since such impressions are usually formed about materially 
successful people, malefics in the 3rd and 6th from AL make one bold and 
materially successful. Natural benefics in the 3rd and 6th houses from AL 
make one very gentle and restrained in public behavior. Such a person does 
not fight with others boldly. This combination is usually found in the charts 
of saints and saintly and mild-natured people. 

The 10th house from lagna in D-10 shows one's true conduct in society. 
It shows the one's career and the true nature of one's karma (work). The 
10th house from AL in D-10 shows perceptions about one's conduct in 
society. It deals more with one's status in career. 
9.4 Use of Bhava Arudhas 

Arudha padas show the maya (illusion) of material world. Arudha pada 
of nth house shows the maya associated with the matters signified by of nth 

house. 
For example, 1st house stands for self. While the first house from lagna 

stands for true self, its arudha pada (AL) stands for the maya associated 
with self. It shows the how the native is perceived in the material world. It 
shows the status of the native. 

The 4th house in D-16 shows happiness from vehicle. It shows true 
happiness from a vehicle. 

One may be very happy with a Bajaj Chetak (an inexpensive two-
wheel vehicle popular in India) or even a bicycle and one owning three 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 77 

Mercedes Benz cars may be unhappy with them and always dreaming of 
owning a better vehicle. One's true happiness from vehicle has nothing to 
do with the type of vehicle owned. However, people perceive one with 3 
Mercedes Benz cars as a happier person in the matter of vehicle, compared 
to a Chetak owner. This is the maya associated with "happiness from vehicle" 
in this material world. So this is shown by A4. 

Benefics influencing the 4th house in D-16 show someone who is happy 
with his vehicle(s). Benefics influencing A4 in D-16 show someone who is 
perceived to be happy with his vehicle(s). So planets influencing A4 in D-16 
shed light on the physical vehicle owned by a person. Someone with Venus 
in own sign in A4 and Saturn in 4th (in D-16) may own luxurious vehicles 
(i.e. perceived to be happy with respect to vehicle) but not be happy. Someone 
with Saturn in A4 and Venus and Jupiter in 4th (in D-16) may own a small 
vehicle (i.e. perceived to be unhappy with respect to vehicles), but be happy 
with it. 

As shown above, 4th house in D-l6 deals with happiness from vehicles. 
In D-24, 4th house deals with learning and education. A4 in D-24 deals with 
the maya (illusion) associated with learning. What is it? 

If someone studied at IIT (a top engineering institute of India), people 
may think that he is very knowledgable. If someone studied at an obscure 
university, people may not get the same impression. But it is possible that 
people's perceptions are wrong and the person who studied at IIT is less 
knowledgable. 

So A4 in D-24 shows the school or university and the environment in 
which one's learning takes place. Usually that decides what impression 
people form about one's learning. 

Similarly, A10 in D-10 shows the maya associated with one's karma 
(action - career). We form an impression about one's career based on the 
place and environment where one's work takes place. So A10 in D-10 
shows one's workplace. One with Mars in A10 in D-10 may work at dynamic 
places or engineering companies. One with Jupiter in A10 in D-10 may 
work at a university or college or a court of law or a temple. 

One important arudha pada used in Jyotish is upapada lagna (UL) -the 
arudha pada of the 12th house. This shows one's marriage and spouse. 
Planets in UL show the kind of marriage one has and the kind of spouse one 
gets. For example, Mercury in UL can show intelligent (when good) or 
indecisive (when bad) spouse. Ketu in UL can show spiritual (when good) 
or short-tempered (when bad) spouse. Sun in UL can show a charming 
spouse from a respectable family. It can also show an authoritative spouse. 
Mars in UL may show a bold spouse (when good) and a quarrelsome spouse 
(when bad). 



78 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

The 8th house from UL shows the longevity of marriage and the 2nd and 
7th houses from UL show the end of marriage. Malefics like Mars, Saturn 
and nodes in these houses from UL can result in troubles for the marriage 
and even a divorce. 

Nature of spouse and the length of the marriage are two different issues. 
If Mars and Saturn are in UL and Jupiter is in the 8th from UL, it may show 
a long marriage to an argumentative and mean spouse. If Jupiter is in UL 
and Mars and Saturn in the 8th from it, one may have a noble spouse but the 
marital life will be very rough and there can even be a divorce. In such a 
case, propitiating Saturn and Mars can help (for more, see the chapter on 
"Remedial Measures"). 

The 7th house shows relations and A7 (darapada) shows the illusion 
associated with them, i.e. the kind of people one usually interacts with. 
Based on the kind of people one deals with, we perceive the nature of one's 
relations. If one has a friend who is a prostitute, people may get a negative 
impression about one's dealings. If one has a friend who is a famous film 
star, there is some glamour associated with one's relations. Thus darapada 
shows the kind of people one associates with and that plays an important 
role in forming people's impressions about one's relations. In D-10, darapada 
may show professional associates. In D-24, it may show friends at college 
or colleagues in the pursuit of knowledge. In D-20, it may show colleagues 
or friends in religious activities. 

The 3rd house shows one's boldness. The 3rd house from lagna and the 
3rd house from Mars show one's true boldness and the 3rd house from AL 
shows how bold one is perceived. In addition, A3 shows the maya surrounding 
one's boldness. It shows what drives the perceptions of people about one's 
boldness. The weapons one possesses may drive those perceptions and A3 
may show one's weapons. 

The 3rd house also shows one's communication skills. The 3rd house in 
D-24 (chart of learning and knowledge) and D-10 (achievements in society) 
may show one's writing skills. A3 shows the maya associated with one's 
writing skills. One may have excellent writing skills, but not write any book. 
In such a case, people may not really appreciate one's writing skills. One 
may be an average writer, but end up writing 20 books. In such a case, 
people may perceive him as a great writer. Thus the exact books written by 
one decide the perceptions of the world about one's writing skills. So A3 in 
D-24 and D-10 may show the books or articles written by him. In this 
author's D-10, for example, A3 is in Pisces. This can mean that he will be 
known for some books on saattwik and traditional subjects and astrology 
certainly fits the bill. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 7 9 

Let us take the 5th house as another example. It shows intelligence, 
following, devotion etc. The 5th house in D-20, the chart of religious activities, 
shows one's devotion (bhakti) in religious activities. A5 in D-20 shows the 
things based on which the world forms an impression about one's devotion. 
The mantras one recites, the poojas and the religious rituals one performs 
control the impression of the world about one's devotion in religious matters. 
So A5 shows them. 

The 5th house in D-10, the chart of career, shows the following one has. 
The world forms an impression about one's following based on the power 
wielded by one. A political leader in a position of power is assumed to have 
a lot of following. So A5 can show the trappings of power enjoyed by one. 
It can also show awards. 

In D-24, the chart of learning, the 5th house may show intelligence. A5 
in D-24 shows the things based on which the world forms an impression 
about one's intelligence in learning. These impressions are usually formed 
based on one's performances in examinations, one's scores in tests and 
one's academic distinctions. So that is what A5 in D-24 shows. 

Similarly, the 9th house shows one's fortune. In D-24, it may show fortune 
related to learning. It can show the guidance received by one (i.e. guru -
teacher). But the world forms an impression about one's fortune in learning, 
based on the degrees received by one. One with an advanced degree is 
assumed to be more fortunate with respect to learning than one with a 
simple degree. So A9 can show one's higher degrees. 

In this manner, intelligent and blessed students can clearly understand 
the meanings of various arudha padas in various divisional charts. One cannot 
become a good Vedic astrologer by memorizing a lot of tables. One needs 
to understand the basics clearly and apply them intelligently. 

All the principles of Vedic astrology should be understood and applied in 
the context of "desa" (country - place), "kaala" (time - age) and "paatra" 
(nature and class of the persons involved). When we interpret arudha padas, 
we are talking about the things based on which the world forms an impression 
about an aspect of the native. The things that drive the world's perceptions 
can be different based on which world we are living in. They vary significantly 
from one place to another, from one age to another and from one class to 
another. Intelligent use of arudhas requires an astrologer to understand the 
world that the native lives in. 
9.5 Computation of Graha Arudhas 

Just as arudha padas of all houses (bhavas) are defined, arudha padas 
of all the nine planets (grahas) are also defined and they are called graha 



8 0 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

arudhas. They are computed as follows: 
(1) Take the sign containing the planet of interest in the divisional chart of 

interest. 
(2) Find the sign owned by that planet. 
NOTE: Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn own 2 signs each. In their 

case, take the stronger sign owned by the planet. The chapter on 
"Strength of Planets and Rasis" will explain the rules used in comparing 
the strengths of signs. Take the two signs, apply those rules and find the 
stronger sign. 

(3) Count signs from the sign containing the planet of interest to the stronger 
sign owned by it. Counting is in the zodiacal direction always. For 
example, if the planet we are interested in is Sun and he is Gemini, we 
count signs from Gemini to Leo and get 3. 

(4) Count the same number of signs from the stronger sign owned and find 
the ending sign. In the above example, we count 3 signs from Leo and 
we end up in Libra. 

(5) Exception: If the sign found thus in step (4) is in the 1st or 7th from the 
original sign containing the planet, then we take the 10th sign from the 
sign found in step (4). Otherwise we don't make any change. 

(6) The resulting sign contains the arudha pada of the planet of interest. 
Example 30: Find the arudha padas of all the planets in Chart 1. 
(1) Sun is in Pi. From Pi, Sun's own sign Le is the 6th sign. Counting 6 signs 

from Le, we get Cp. So Cp contains Sun's arudha pada. 
(2) Moon is in Ge. From Ge, Moon's own sign Cn is the 2nd sign. Counting 

2 signs from Cn, we get Le. So Le contains Moon's arudha pada. 
(3) Mars is in Ar. He owns 2 signs - Ar and Sc. Ar is stronger as it contains 

more planets. From Ar, Ar is the 1st sign. Counting 1 sign from Ar, we 
get Ar. Because this is the 1st house from the sign containing Mars, we 
take the 10th therefrom and get Cp. So Cp contains the arudha pada of 
Mars. 

(4) Mercury is in Pi. He owns 2 signs - Ge and Vi. Ge is stronger as it has 
Moon and Vi is empty. From Pi, Ge is the 4th sign. Counting 4 signs 
from Ge, we get Vi. Since Vi is the 7th from Pi, we take the 10th from Vi 
and get Ge. So Ge contains Mercury's arudha pada. 

(5) Jupiter is in Ar. He owns 2 signs - Sg and Pi. Pi is stronger as it has 3 
planets and Sg is empty. From Ar, Pi is the 12th sign. Counting 12 signs 
from Pi, we get Aq. So Aq contains Jupiter's arudha pada. 

(6) Venus is in Pi. He owns 2 signs - Ta and Li. Li is stronger (it will 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 8 1 

become clear after reading the chapter on ''Strength of Planets and 
Rasis".). From Pi, Li is the 8th sign. Counting 8 signs from Li, we get 
Ta. So Ta contains the arudha pada of Venus. 

(7) Saturn is in Ar. He owns 2 signs - Aq and Cp. Cp is stronger as it has 
Ketu and Aq is empty. From Ar, Cp is the 10th sign. Counting 10 signs 
from Cp, we get Li. Since Li is the 7th from Ar, we take the 10th from Li 
and get Cn. So Cn contains Saturn's arudha pada. 

(8) Rahu is in Cn. From Cn, Rahu's own sign Aq is the 8th sign. Counting 8 
signs from Aq, we get Vi. So Vi contains Rahu's arudha pada. 

(9) Ketu is in Cp. From Cp, Ketu's own sign Sc is the 11th sign. Counting 11 
signs from Sc, we get Vi. So Vi contains Ketu's arudha pada. 

Exercise 13: Find arudha padas of all the nine planets in Chart 2. 

Hint: Out of the 2 signs owned by Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, 
Ar, Ta, Vi, Sg and Aq are stronger (respectively). 
NOTE: In divisional charts in which Ketu is in the 7th from Rahu, his maya 
(arudha pada) is with Rahu's maya. In divisional charts in which Rahu and 
Ketu are together, their mayas are in opposite rasis. The readers may ponder 
over the philosophical significance of this. 
9.6    Use of Graha Arudhas 

Just as arudha padas of various houses show the illusions of the world 
related to the matters signified by various houses, arudha padas of various 
planets show the illusions of the native related to the matters signified by 
various planets. Houses show various aspects of the person's life and their 
arudhas show how they are perceived in the world. Planets show various 
persons, forces and situations that impact various aspects of a person's life 
and their arudhas show the related perceptions by the person. 

Just as the perceptions of the world about a native can be totally different 
from the reality, perceptions of a native about himself, about the world and 
about the situations that (s)he goes through can be totally different from the 
reality. Graha arudhas throw light on these perceptions.  
Example 31: 
Let us consider Moon's periods for the native in Chart 1. Because Moon is 
in the 10th house, his periods will give important details of developments 
related to career. Because Moon owns the 2nd from AL and occupies AL, 
status of the native in the eyes of people will increase in Moon's periods. 
However, Moon's arudha pada is in the 12th from lagna. This will make the 
native feel frustrated. The native will be unhappy and under the illusion that 



82 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

things are going bad for him. But people will think that his status is increasing 
and in reality there will be some good developments in career. 
Example 32: 
Let us consider India's Prime Minister Sri A.B. Vajpayee's rasi chart given 
in Chart 3. Jupiter's period ran in 1980'sand 1990's. With Jupiter in the 2nd 

house from AL, his dasa can give a rise in material fortune. With Jupiter 
being a functional benefic for Scorpio lagna and occupying a quadrant, Jupiter 
dasa should give comforts in reality. However, Jupiter's arudha pada is in 
Libra, the 12th house from lagna. This can make the native feel unhappy, 
uncomfortable and alienated. Graha arudhas show how the native feels. 

In Rahu's sub-period in Jupiter's period, the native became India's Prime 
Minister. Rahu is in the 8th house from lagna and his periods should cause 
discomfort, frustration and health troubles in reality. However, being a natural 
malefic in the 6th house from AL, Rahu can give material success and 
victory over enemies and rivals. That is how the world perceives him. 
Rahu's arudha pada is in Libra, i.e. the 12th house from lagna. This can 
again make the native frustrated and unhappy. However, if we are interested 
in the native's material success, Rahu's 6th house placement from AL is the 
most important factor and success is ensured. 

Chart 3 

 
Example 33: 
Consider the native of Chart 4. Let us see what results Ketu's period can 
give him. Ketu is in lagna. Ketu in lagna can make one spiritual. In Ketu 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 8 3 

dasa, this native joined a spiritual movement and started meditating 
regularly. 

From AL, Ketu is in 3rd. As a natural malefic in the 3rd from AL, Ketu 
can give boldness and material success. He was indeed materially successful. 

How did the native feel in this dasa? Look at Ketu's arudha pada. It is 
in Capricorn, the 5th house from lagna. Ketu in 5th gives proficiency in 
mathematics and abstract analysis and makes one do intelligent work. This 
may be how the native felt about his activities in that period. 

In this manner, we can use graha arudha to understand the illusions the 
native is under. Illusion should not be looked at as a bad word here. We are 
all constantly under illusion. Basically graha arudhas show the perceptions 
of the native. They show how the native feels. 

Judging the positions of planets with respect to lagna, we can understand 
the real situation. Judging the positions of planets with respect to AL, we 
can understand the perceptions of people and the situation at a materialistic 
level. Judging the positions of the arudha padas of planets with respect to 
lagna, we can understand how the native perceives the situation and how 
the native feels. Unless we understand this aspect correctly, we cannot 
offer good astrological counselling. When we counsel a person, we must 
understand how the person feels and what drives those feelings. So, each 
of these 3 aspects of chart analysis is important in its own right. A good 
student of Vedic astrology will master all the 3 aspects.

9.7 Summary 
Arudha pada of a house shows the maya surrounding the matters 

signified by that house. It shows the factors based on which the impressions 
of people are formed. Arudha lagna or AL shows people's impressions 
about a native. It shows one's status in the material world. Darapada or A7 
shows one's relationships. Upapada (UL) shows one's marriage and spouse. 
A4 in D-16 shows one's vehicle. A4 in D-24 shows one's school or college 
or university (place of education). A10 in D-10 shows one's workplace. 

Arudha padas of planets show the perceptions of the native about the 
world, about himself or herself and about the situations developing in his or 
her life. 

Analysis of the positions of planets with respect to lagna shows reality. 
Analysis of the positions of planets with respect to AL shows perceptions 
of the world and material situation. Analysis of individual bhava arudhas 
throws light on various things based on which world forms impressions 
about a native. Analysis of the positions of the arudha padas of planets with 
respect to lagna shows the perceptions of the native.

10. Aspects and Argalas 

10.1 Introduction 
Planets aspect other planets, rasis and houses in astrology. A planet 

aspecting a house or a planet has some influence on the matters signified by 
that house or planet. The nature of the influence exerted and the degree to 
which that influence succeeds depends on the individual situation. 

There are 2 kinds of aspects: (1) graha drishti and (2) rasi drishti. Drishti 
means aspect. Each planet aspects certain houses from it with graha drishti 
(planetary aspect). The houses aspected are fixed based on the planet. In 
addition, rasis aspect each other and a planet aspects the rasis aspected by 
the rasi occupied by it. This is called rasi drishti (sign aspect). 
10.2 Graha Drishti 

All planets aspect the 7th house from them. For example, Sun in Ta 
aspects Sc. Mars in Ge aspects Sg. Moon in Le aspects Aq. Jupiter in Pi 
aspects Vi. Saturn in Cp aspects Cn. Find the 7th house from the planet and 
the planet aspects that house. 

In addition to the 7th house, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn have special 
aspects: 
• Jupiter aspects the 5th and 9th houses from him. 
• Mars aspects the 4th and 8th houses from him. 
• Saturn aspects the 3rd and 10th houses from him. 

We can decide the signs and houses aspected by a planet as above. If 
any planet occupies the aspected houses, then the planet is also aspected. 
For example, Jupiter in Ta will aspect Saturn in Cp, because Cp is the 9th 

house from Ta and Jupiter aspects the 9th from him.  
Example 34: 
Let us say Jupiter is in Ge, Mars in Le and Saturn in Sg. Jupiter in Ge will 
aspect the 5th, 7th and 9th from Ge. So Jupiter in Ge will aspect Li, Sg and 
Aq. Mars in Le will aspect the 4th, 7th and 8th from Le. So Mars in Le will 
aspect Sc, Aq and Pi. Saturn in Sg will aspect the 3rd, 7th and 10th from Sg. 
So Saturn in Sg will aspect Aq, Ge and Vi. 

Look at a few charts and figure out which planets are aspecting which 
houses and which planets are aspecting which planets. With experience, 
you can become good at it and this is an important skill required in interpreting 
charts.

Exercise 14: Find the rasis, houses and planets aspected with graha drishti 
by Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn in Chart 5. 

10.3  Rasi Drishti 
Rasis aspect other rasis based on the following rules: 

• A movable rasi aspects all fixed rasis except the one adjacent to it. 
• A fixed rasi aspects all movable rasis except the one adjacent to it. 
• A dual rasi aspects all other dual rasis. 
For example, Ar is a movable sign. It aspects all the fixed signs except the 
one adjacent to it, i.e. Ta. So Ar aspects Le, Sc and Aq. 
Ta is a fixed sign. It aspects all the movable signs except the one adjacent to 
it, i.e. Ar. So Ta aspects Cn, Li and Cp. 
Ge is a dual sign. It aspects all other dual signs. So Ge aspects Vi, Sg and Pi.

Figure 2: Rasi Aspects 

It may be noted that sign Y will aspect sign X if sign X aspects sign Y. 
A visual representation of rasi aspects is given in Figure 2. A line is drawn 
between every pair of signs that aspect each other. A planet aspects the 
signs aspected by the sign it occupies. It also aspects the houses and planets 
in those signs. This aspect is called rasi drishti (sign aspect). For example, a 
planet in Libra will aspect the houses and planets in Aq, Ta and Le. 
Exercise 15: Find the rasis, houses and planets aspected with rasi drishti 
by Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu in 
Chart 5. 
10.4  Graha Drishti vs Rasi Drishti 

A simple analogy will make things clearer. Look at planets as people. 
Let us take a priest as an example. Will he have some influence on his 
neighbors? Probably. Because he lives there, gets up early in the morning 
and recites mantras, it may influence his neighbors also. Because of the 
houses they live in, his neighbors come under his influence. How pious and 
god-fearing his influence makes his neighbors depends on other factors. If 
one of the neighbors is a dreaded criminal, he is not going to be influenced. 

Let us take a dreaded criminal as another example. He may also have 
an influence on his neighbors. Youngsters living in the neighboring houses 
may enter the criminal world because of him. Ladies in the neighboring 
houses may stay inside their houses at night and not come out after certain 
time. 



8 8 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Thus we are influenced by people in neighboring houses. Influence 
exerted by planets by rasi drishti is similar to this influence. 

Compared to this limited influence on the neighbors, a priest may have 
greater influence in the matters of the nearby temple where he works. He 
may have a lot of influence on devotees who come to visit the temple and 
who approach him for performing poojas, homas etc. Influence exerted by 
graha drishti is similar to this influence. 

Influence exerted by rasi drishti is due to the sign a planet is in. This is 
analogous to the influence people exert on their neighbors. All planets in a 
sign will have rasi drishti on the same signs, just as people living in the same 
house see the same neighbors everyday and exert some influence over the 
same neighbors. But the influence they exert may differ. A priest may tell 
his neighbors to pray to God. His movie-loving brother living in the same 
house may talk the same neighbors into watching all the movies of a particular 
actress. Thus, planets in the same sign exert influence on the same houses 
and planets through rasi drishti, but the nature of the influence varies from 
planet to planet. 

Influence exerted by graha drishti is due to the inherent nature of a 
planet. Different planets in the same sign may aspect different houses and 
planets with graha drishti. A priest may have great influence over the 
devotees at the temple he works at and his movie-loving brother living in the 
same house may have great influence over his movie-loving classmates and 
co-members of the fan club of an actress, of which he is president. Similarly, 
planets in the same sign may influence planets in different houses. However, 
everyone in a house may have a strong influence over friends of the family 
who visit the house frequently. Similarly, all planets aspect the 7th house 
from them and have an influence over it. 
10.5   Argala (Intervention) 

In addition to the influence caused by planets with graha drishti and rasi 
drishti, there is another influence called "argala". 

Argala is a very important concept in Vedic astrology. Literally speaking, 
argala means "a bolt". Argala on a house shows the influences that intervene 
in its affairs, decide some parts of it and close the bolt on it, so to speak. 
Planet having rasi drishti have a small influence. Planets having graha drishti 
have a more concrete influence. Planets with argala simply decide some 
parts of the matter signified by the house. The influence caused by argala is 
decisive. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 8 9 

A planet or house in the 2nd, 4th and 11th houses from a planet or 
house causes primary argala on the latter. Argala by a benefic planet is 
called a "subhaargala" (benefic intervention) and argala by a maiefic planet 
is called a "paapaargala" (malefic intervention). This simple concept can be 
better appreciated if some examples are given. 

The 4th house stands for education. The 2nd, 4th and 11th from the 4th house 
are 5th, 7th and 2nd houses respectively. One's intelligence (5th), interaction 
with others (7th) and overall character and samskara (2nd) make or break 
one's education. If Jupiter is in 5th house, he will give intelligence and his 
subhaargala (benefic intervention) on 4th will help one's education. If Rahu 
is in 5th house, his paapaargala (malefic intervention) on 4th will cause 
obstacles in one's education by way of poor intelligence. Similarly, 
benefics and malefics in the houses causing argala cause good and bad 
intervention. Basically, the point is that intelligence, interaction and samskara 
are the things that decide one's education. They have a decisive role. 

Let us take another example. Short journeys are seen from the 3rd 

house. What are the things necessary for a journey? One needs a vehicle 
(4th). One may need someone to serve one by driving the vehicle. Servants 
are seen from 6th. So, no wonder the 4th and 6th houses cause argala on the 3rd 
house, being the 2nd and 4th from it respectively! If one has papargala on 3rd 
from 4th, it may show trouble to the journey because of the vehicle. If one 
has papargala on 3rd from 6th, it may show trouble to the journey because of the 
driver. 

Let us take another example. Domestic harmony, comfort, well-being 
and happiness are seen from the 4th house. What are the things that can 
make or break domestic harmony? Of course, wife, children and other family 
members! Each of them can intervene in one's domestic harmony. No wonder 
the 5th, 7th and 2nd houses have an argala on the 4th house (being the 2nd, 4th and 
11th respectively from the 4th house)! If a malefic in 5th has paapaargala on 4th, 
it may show domestic clashes and lack of sukha (comfort/happiness) on 
account of a child. If a benefic in 7th has subhaargala on 4th, it may show 
domestic happiness due to a caring partner. 

Apart from the 2nd, 4th and 11th houses from a house, the 5th house from a 
house has a secondary argala on it. In the case of learning, argala of 8th 

house on 4th (8th is the 5th from 4th) shows the influence of hard work in 
learning. Hard work is another decider. In the case of journey, argala of 7th 

house on 3rd house (7th is the 5th from 3rd) shows the influence of partners in a 
journey. 



90 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

10.6 Virodhaargala (Obstruction) 
Virodhaargala shows the obstruction of argala. Planets and houses in 

the 12th, 10th, 3rd and 9th houses from a house or planet cause virodhaargala and 
obstruct the argala on it from the 2nd, 4th. 11th and 5th houses from it 
(respectively). For example, let us say Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn 
are in Ge, Pi, Ar and Vi respectively. Saturn is in the 4th from Mercury and 
Ge and he causes argala on them. With Saturn being a malefic, this is a 
paapaargala (malefic intervention). But Jupiter is in the 10th from Mercury 
and Ge. So he obstructs Saturn's argala and averts the troubles. Venus is in 
the 11th from Mercury and Ge and so he causes argala on them. With Venus 
being a benefic, it is a subhaargala (benefic intervention). If Le (3rd from 
Ge) is empty, this argala is unobstructed. 

NOTE: If a sign contains Ketu, argalas and virodhargalas on it are counted 
anti-zodiacally. For example, let us say Ketu is in Vi. Then Le, Ge, Sc and 
Ta are the 2nd, 4th, 11th and 5th from Vi (counted anti-zodiacally) and planets in 
those signs cause argala on Vi and on the planets in Vi. Virodhaargala is 
also counted similarly. 
Exercise 16: Find the planets causing argalas and virodhaargalas on all 
the 12 houses in Chart 5. 

There is a special principle regarding the 3rd house obstruction. If there 
are several malefics in the 3rd house from a house or a planet, they cause 
argala instead of virodhargala on that house or planet. 

10.7 Use of Argala 
Depending on the matter of interest, take the relevant house or the 

relevant karaka. Find argalas and virodhaargalas on it. If there are both, see 
if more planets cause argala or virodhaargala. If they are caused by the 
same number of planets, compare the strengths and decide whether argala 
dominates or virodhaargala. Based on the signs, houses and planets involved, 
guess the meaning of the argala or virodhaargala. 

Argala from the 2nd house shows the basic ingredient for the sustenance 
of a matter. For example, the 2nd house shows food and it is a basic ingredient 
for the sustenance of self (1st). The 5th house shows intelligence and it is a 
basic ingredient for the sustenance of learning (4th). 

Argala from the 4th house shows the basic factor that drives the mood, 
state and progress of a matter. For example, the 4th house shows comfort 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 91 

and it drives the mood and state of self (1st). The 7th house shows interaction 
and that drives one's learning (4th). 

Argala from the 11lh house shows the catalyst that can result in gains 
for a matter. For example, the 2nd house shows character, grooming and 
samskara and it is a catalyst in the process of learning (4th). 

Secondary argala from the 5th house shows the additional contributing 
factors. For example, the 5th house shows emotional situation and that 
contributes to the state of self (1st). The 8th house shows hard work and that 
contributes to one's learning (4th). 

Using the above guidelines, we can understand the meaning of argalas 
on houses and karakas. 

Chart 6 

 

Example 35: Consider India's former Prime Minister Sri P.V. Narasimha 
Rao's chart, shown in Chart 6. Let us find the planets having a decisive 
influence on his livelihood and karma (action) in society. 
Saturn is the significator of livelihood and karma. Argalas on him denote 
decisive influences on livelihood and karma. Mercury, Mars and Sun have 
an argala on Saturn, as they are in the 11th from him. Mercury's influence 
indicates writing and scholarliness. Sun and Mars suggest politics. 



92 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 7

Example 36: Consider the chart shown in Chart 7. It belongs to well-
known Hollywood actor and former US President Ronald Reagan. Let us 
find the planets having a decisive influence on his livelihood and karma. The 
only planet with an argala on Saturn is Venus in the 11th from Saturn. Thus 
he was an actor, entertainer and a showman. In Example 35, Sun has an 
argala on Saturn and politics was the native's livelihood. In this chart, on the 
other hand, Sun has no argala and the native entered politics late. His political 
power is indicated by Sun's unobstructed argala on GL. 
Exercise 17: Try to guess the nature of livelihood and karma (action) of 
the native in Chart 8. Don't look at the answer until you think a lot. 

Hint: Being in own house, Venus dominates over Jupiter and Mercury. Being 
the most advanced planet, Mercury is also strong. Mars dominates over 
Sun and Ketu, being in own house and being more advanced than Ketu -
the other owner of Sc.

Exercise 17: 
Saturn is the significator of livelihood and karma. He shows what kind of 
activity a native engages in. Being in a watery sign, he shows something 
flexible and fluid. By studying the argalas on him, we can see the decisive 
influences on the nature of his karma. 

Venus is in the 4th from Saturn. His argala on Saturn shows creative 
and aesthetic work (e.g. actor, poet etc). Though Venus is in own sign, 
Mercury is more advanced and Mercury also has influence over Saturn 
through his argala. Mercury and Venus together show intelligent and logical 
work of an aesthetic nature. Being the 4th house argala, this influence is the 
basic driving factor of the native's karma. 

Mars is very strong in the 5th house from Saturn and he also has a 
secondary argala. Martian influence gives discipline, systematicity and 
enterprise. He can denote some design work. Mars engineers things. 

Rahu is in the 11th from Saturn and he has a malefic argala on Saturn. 
Rahu stands for pathbreaking innovation and also shady elements of society. 
His 11th house argala can denote gains in his livelihood with those factors 
working as catalysts. 

The final answer. The native was a very famous and successful fashion 
designer. He had mafia connections. He was finally shot dead. 



11. Yogas 

11.1 Introduction 
We have seen in previous chapters the use of divisional charts, houses, 

karakas, arudha padas, aspects and argalas. Using all these tools, we can 
interpret charts and draw various conclusions about a native's fortune. 

In addition to these general guidelines, there are several particular 
combinations that give specific results. These are very important and called 
"Yogas". Readers are advised to refer to classics such as "Brihat Parasara 
Hora Sastram" and acquaint themselves with as many yogas as possible. 
Dr. B.V. Raman's "Three Hundred Important Combinations" is an excellent 
compendium on yogas. 

Some software programs list the yogas present in a chart. However, 
they are sometimes erroneous and one should be familiar with important 
yogas and be able to judge yogas by oneself, without relying on software. 
Many yogas are applicable in divisional charts. When we use yogas in 
divisional charts, we should interpret the results ascribed to a yoga based on 
the matters signified by the divisional chart. 

A few key yogas will be listed in this chapter, but the reader is urged to 
do more reading. In this book, yogas are divided into the following classes 
for convenience: 

• Ravi Yogas (solar combinations) 
• Chandra Yogas (lunar combinations) 
• Mahaapurusha Yogas (combinations producing 5 kinds of great men) 
• Naabhasa Yogas (classified celestial combinations) 
• Other Popular Yogas 
• Raaja Yogas (combinations giving power) 
• Raaja Sambandha Yogas (combinations for association with kings) 
• Dhana Yogas (combinations giving wealth) 
• Daridra Yogas (combinations giving poverty) 

11.2 Ravi Yogas 
Ravi yogas are the solar combinations. There are several yogas based 

on Sun. 
Because Mercury and Venus are with Sun or a sign away from him 

most of the time, the following yogas are very common in rasi chart. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 97 

However, they are less common in divisional charts. One can apply these 
yogas in D-9 and D-10 in particular. 
11.2.1 Vesi Yoga 

Definition: If there is a planet other than Moon in the 2nd house from 
Sun, then this yoga is present. For example, if Sun is in Gemini and Jupiter 
and Mercury are in Cancer, then this yoga is present. 

Results: One born with this yoga has a balanced outlook. He is truthful, 
tall and sluggish. He is happy and comfortable even with little wealth. 
11.2.2 Vosi Yoga 

Definition: If there is a planet other than Moon in the 12th house from 
Sun, then this yoga is present. For example, if Sun is in Aries and Jupiter 
and Venus are in Pisces, then this yoga is present.

11.2.4 Budha-Aaditya Yoga (Nipuna Yoga)

togetherness. If Sun and Mercury are together (in one sign), this yoga is 
present. 

Results: One born with this yoga is intelligent and skilful in all works. 
He is well-known, respected and happy. Nipuna means an expert. 
Note: If Mercury is too close to Sun, he is combust (asta or astangata). 
Yogas formed by combust planets lose some of their power to do good. This 
yoga is the most powerful in divisional charts like D-10. In rasi chart also, it 
can give results if Mercury is not combust. Suppose someone has Sun and 
Mercury together in Leo in D-10. Then that person has a powerful Budha-
Aditya yoga in career. The results will be felt throughout one's life and the 
periods of Sun, Mercury and Leo will give those results in particular. 
11.3    Chandra Yogas 

Chandra yogas are the lunar combinations. There are several yogas 
based on Moon. 



9 8 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

General Guidelines: 
(1) If Moon is in a quadrant from Sun, then one may possess little wealth, 

intelligence and skills. If Moon is in a panapara from Sun, then one 
may possess average wealth, intelligence and skills. If Moon is in an 
apoklima from Sun, then one may possess a lot of wealth, intelligence 
and skills. 

(2) If Moon is in own navamsa or that of an adhimitra (good friend), that is 
good. In such a situation, aspect of Jupiter on Moon beings wealth and 
comforts in the case of daytime birth (respectively). The same result is 
given by Venusian aspect on Moon in the case of night birth. On the 
other hand, Jupiter's aspect on Moon in a night birth and Venusian 
aspect on Moon in a daytime birth are detrimental to one's wealth and 
comforts. 

(3) If all the natural benefics occupy upachayas (3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th) 
from Moon, one has great wealth. If two benefics occupy upachayas 
from Moon, the native has medium wealth. If only one benefic occupies 
an upachaya from Moon, the native has little wealth.

on it. If the 2nd and 12th from a house have benefics, it is said to have a subha 
(benefic) kartari. Malefics in the same places cause paapa (malefic) kartari. Subha 
kartari on any house does good to the matters of that house and paapa kartari does 
harm. Subha kartari and paapa kartari are also known as "subha kartari yoga" and 
"paapa kartari yoga" and they can be seen with reference to any house or planet.

and character. He is happy, helpful and famous. Koorma means a tortoise. 

Khadga Yoga: If (1) the 2nd lord is in the 9th house, (2) the 9th lord is in 
the 2nd house, and, (3) lagna lord is in a quadrant or a trine, then this yoga is 
present. One born with this yoga is skilful, wealthy, learned, happy, fortunate, 
intelligent, grateful and mighty. Khadga means a sword. 

Kusuma Yoga: If (1) lagna is in a fixed sign, (2) Venus is in a quadrant, 
(3) Moon is in a trine with a benefic, and, (4) Saturn is in the 10th house, then 
this yoga is present. One born with this yoga becomes a king or an equal. 
He is charitable. He is endowed with pleasures and happiness. He is a 
leader of his community. He has character and scholarship. Kusuma means 
a flower. 

Kalaanidhi Yoga: If (1) Jupiter is in the 2nd house or the 5th house and 
(2) he is conjoined or aspected by Mercury and Venus, then this yoga is 
present. One born with this yoga is endowed with character, happiness, 
good health, wealth and learning. He is respected by kings. Kalaanidhi means 
a treasure of arts and skills. 

Kalpadruma Yoga: Consider (1) lagna lord, (2) his dispositor, (3) the 
latter's dispositor in rasi and (4) in navamsa. If all the four planets are all in 
quadrants, trines or exaltation signs, then this yoga is present. An example 
will make this clearer. 

One born with this yoga becomes a king. He likes wars34. He is very 
33 If this is to be applied strictly, 7th lord can be exalted in 10th only for Sagittarius 

lagna. 
34 This is not meant negatively. War and curbing bad elements are a king's duty. The 

results of this yoga include the words "principled" and "kind". So the expression 
"likes wars" (yuddhapriyah) should be taken in a positive sense. Shivaji's example 
may explain it further. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 109 

prosperous, principled, strong and kind. Kalpadruma is a celestial tree of the 
heaven. This yoga is also known as Paarijaata yoga. Paarijaata is a celestial 
flower. Some authors have simplified this yoga and wrote that one of the 
last two planets mentioned can bring the yoga if in a quadrant or a trine or 
exaltation sign. Taking all the four planets make this a less common yoga, 
which it ought to be. Let us follow Parasara. 

As an example, let us look at the rasi and navamsa charts of Chatrapati 
Shivaji, a great king of India (see Chart 9). Lagna lord is Sun. He is in Aq 
and his dispositor is Saturn (lord of Aq). Saturn is in Li and his dispositor is 
Venus. We also need Saturn's dispositor in navamsa. In navamsa, Saturn is 
in Aq and his dispositor is Saturn himself. 

Chart 9

Thus we get the four planets as — Sun, Saturn, Venus and Saturn. Sun 
is in a quadrant. Saturn is exalted. Venus is in a trine. Thus Shivaji had 
Kalpadruma yoga. In navamsa also, Sun is exalted, Saturn is in moolatrikona 
and Venus is in a lagna. This makes the yoga even more powerful. He was 
indeed a prosperous, principled, strong and kind king ever ready to take on 
powerful enemies. Even as he was fighting mighty Muslim emperors, he 
was open-minded and treated all his people equally. He respected every 
woman as a mother. He stood for every good thing that Hindu culture 
represented. About 400 years after his birth, name of this "dharma veera" 
(virtuous warrior) still inspires awe in Indians in general and Maharashtrians 
in particular. 

Lagnaadhi Yoga: If (1) the 7th and 8th houses from lagna are occupied 
by benefics and (2) no malefics conjoin or aspect these planets, then this 
yoga is present. One born with this yoga becomes a great person. He is 
learned and happy. Adhi means over or above. We have already seen Adhi 
Yoga among Chandra yogas. Lagnaadhi yoga means Adhi Yoga from lagna. 

Hari Yoga: If benefics occupy the 2nd, 12th and 8th houses counted 
from the 2nd lord, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is happy, 
learned and blessed with wealth and children. Hari is a name of Lord Vishnu. 
The 2nd house is the house of food and money and it is a trine from karma 
sthana - the 10th house. It stands for sustenance and its lord represents 
Hari - Sustainer of Hindu Trinity - in a chart. 

Hara Yoga: If benefics occupy the 4th, 9th and 8th houses counted 
from the 7th lord, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is happy, 
learned and blessed with wealth and children. Hara is a name of Lord 
Shiva. The 7th house rules death and Shiva is represented by its lord. This is 
why the 7th house shows genitalia and Shiva is worshipped in the form of a 
Linga - Phallus - in Hindu temples. 

Brahma Yoga: If benefics occupy the 4th, 10th and 11th houses counted 
from lagna lord, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is happy, 
learned and blessed with wealth and children. Brahma is the creator of this 
universe. Lagna rules birth and the Creator is represented in a chart by 
lagna lord. 
NOTE: (a) Some authors combine Hari yoga, Hara yoga and Brahma yoga 
and call it "Hari Hara Brahma yoga". Also, these three yogas are known as 
Trimurthi Yogas. Brahma is the Creator; Hari is the Sustainer; and, Shiva is 
the Destroyer. They form the Trinity of Gods (Trimurthis). 

(b) There is another variation of Brahma yoga: "If (1) Jupiter is in a 
quadrant from the 9th lord, (2) Venus is in a quadrant from the 11th lord, and, 
(3) Mercury is in a quadrant from the 1st lord or 10th lord, then this yoga is 
present."

11.7    Raaja Yogas 

Raaja means a king. Raaja yogas are the combinations that give power 
and prosperity to a native. They make one the best in something. 



114 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

11.7.1 Basics 
Basic Raaja Yoga: In any chart, Lord Vishnu sits in the quadrants and 

Goddess Lakshmi sits in the trines. If the lord of a quadrant is associated 
with the lord of a trine, that association brings the combined blessings of 
Lakshmi and Vishnu. This is called a Raaja Yoga. The native is powerful 
and prosperous. 

What do we mean by "association" here? There are 3 important 
associations: 
(1) The two planets are conjoined, 
(2) The two planets aspect each other with graha drishti, or, 
(3) The two planets have a parivartana (exchange). For example, if the 4th 

lord is in the 5th house and the 5th lord is in the 4th house, then we say 
that there is a parivartana between the 4th and 5th lords. This is an 
association. 
If the lord of a quadrant and the lord of a trine have one of the three 

kinds of associations mentioned above, it forms a Raaja Yoga. Lagna can 
be taken as a quadrant or a trine here. It is both. 

Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga: This is a special case of the above yoga. 
If the lords of dharma sthana (9th) and karma sthana (10th) form a raja 
yoga, it is known by this special name. The 9th house is the most important 
trine and the 10th house is the most important quadrant. Raaja yoga involving 
the lords of these two houses is excellent. One born with this yoga is sincere, 
devoted and righteous. He is fortunate and. 

Vipareeta Raaja Yoga: The 6th, 8th and 12th houses are known as trik 
sthanas or dusthanas (bad houses). If their lords occupies dusthanas or 
conjoin dusthanas, it results in this yoga. One having this yoga experiences 
tremendous success, typically after an initial struggle. Vipareeta means 
extreme. 

Because dusthanas show the obstacles one faces in life, situation of 
dusthana lords in dusthanas shows that obstacles will run into obstacles 
themselves. One experiences tremendous success in the face of obstacles. 

In the ideal case, the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses will all be 
together in one of the three houses (or the 3rd house or the 11th house), with 
no other planets conjoining them. But the results of this yoga may be 
experienced with just one or two dusthana lords occupying a dusthana. 
11.7.2 Magnitude of a Raaja Yoga 

We find the conjunction of the lords of a quadrant and a trine in many 
charts. The magnitude to which this raaja yoga fructifies depends on the 
strength of the two planets. The key factors that come into play are: 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 115 

(1) The two planets should be free from afflictions from functional malefics. 
(2) The conjunction or aspect responsible for the Raaja Yoga should be 

close (say, within 6° or so). 
If Mercury and Venus are at 2° and 26° in Ta for a native with Cp 
lagna, for example, their conjunction brings a Raaja Yoga (Dharma-
Karmadhipati Yoga in particular). However, the two planets are too far 
apart for this yoga to give its full results. They are still associated, but 
the association is not very strong. If Venus is at 3° in Ta in instead of 
26°, the conjunction is very close and the yoga can give its full results, if 
other factors are favorable. 

(3) The two planets should not be combust, debilitated or in an inimical 
house or in bad avasthas (states). 
Any blemishes here will considerably reduce the magnitude of the yoga. 

In addition to the above factors, Sage Parasara recommended looking at 
the amsas occupied by the 2 planets as per Dasa Varga (ten division) scheme. 
Count the divisional charts - out of the ten charts of Dasa Varga scheme -
in which a planet occupies an own, exaltation or moolatrikona sign. Based 
on the count of divisional charts with such a good placement for the planet 
in question, we say that it is in a particular amsa. Please see the chapter 
"Divisional Charts" for details. 

If the two planets giving raaja yoga have a count of one or zero, the 
yoga is ordinary and gives good results depending on the factors already 
outlined. 

If the two planets are in Paarijaataamsa (count of 2), then one becomes 
a king who rules his people well. If the two planets are in Uttamsaamsa 
(count of 3), then one becomes a good king with tremendous assets. If the 
two planets are in Gopuraamsa (count of 4), then one becomes a great king 
respected by many kings. 

If the two planets are in Simhaasanaamsa (count of 5), then one becomes 
a great emperor who rules the whole world. Parasara said that several 
great emperors of Indian mythology - like Harischandra, Manu, Bali, 
Vaiswaanara, Yudhisthira (also known as Dharmaraja) and Saalivaahana36 -
were born with this combination. 

Two planets giving Raaja Yoga can be in Paaraavataamsa (count of 6), 
Devalokamsa (count of 7), Brahmalokaamsa (count of 8) and Airaavataamsa 

36 Saalivaahana was yet to be born when Parasara wrote his classic "Brihat Paaraasara 
Horaa Saastram". He referred Dharmaraja of Mahabharata as "King Yudhisthira of 
this Yuga" and made a prediction about the birth of Saalivaahana with Raaja Yoga 
giving planets in Simhaasanaamsa. 



116 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(count of 9) only for divine persons such as Svaayambhuva Manu (Manu who 
was born by Himself), Brahma (Creator!!) and Vishnu's incarnations such as Sri 
Rama and Sri Krishna. 

Final Judgment: None of the above factors influences the end result 
completely. We should look at all the factors and make the final judgment. 

Chart 10 

 
India's former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi37 had lagna lord Sun and 5th 

lord Jupiter in lagna giving a Raaja Yoga. Both were in Simhaasanaamsa. 
However, they were more than 8° apart38 and functional malefics were with 
them. Saturn had a very close aspect on Jupiter. So the Yoga is pretty weak. 
However, the two planets are in Simhaasanaamsa and that raises the level of the 
Yoga. In the end, he only became India's prime minister and not an "emperor of 
the whole world". 

Let us look at India's emperor Akbar39 (see Chart 10). His chart has Libra 
lagna. Lagna lord Venus and 4th and 5th lord Saturn are in lagna. They give 
Mahapurusha yogas (Maalavya and Sasa) as well as a Raja Yoga. Moon and 
Mercury own 10th and 9th and they have a close aspect. They 

37 Birthdata:August 20,1944,7:11:40am(IST),72E49,18N58 
38 Anything greater than 5 or 6 degrees is too large for a Raaja Yoga to give its full 

results. 
39 Birthdata: December 4,1542,3:39 am (LMT), 69 E 47,25 N 19. This date may be 

written by some as November 24, 1542 based on the old calendar. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 117 

also form a Raja Yoga. But they are not even in Paarijaataamsa. Venus and 
Saturn are only in Uttamaamsa and Paarijaataamsa. 

However, Venus and Saturn are very strong and take part in other 
Yogas. Both the Raaja Yogas are very close. Venus and Saturn are less 
than a degree apart. They are afflicted by a functional malefic (Jupiter), but 
Jupiter is 22° away from them. Moreover, lord of GL is Mars and he gives 
another Mahapurusha Yoga - Ruchaka Yoga - and he is in Simhaasanaamsa. 

Due to all these reasons, Akbar was a great emperor of India although 
Raaja Yoga giving planets weren't in Simhaasanaamsa. We should always 
make the final judgment after looking at all the factors. 
11.7.3 More Raaja Yogas 

Some advanced Raaja Yogas will be listed below. 
(1) If (a) chara putra karaka (PK) and chara atmaka karaka (AK) are 

conjoined and (b) lagna and 5th lords conjoin, then Raaja Yoga is 
present and the native enjoys power and prosperity. If only one 
condition is satisfied, still the results may be felt, but not fully. 

(2) If (a) lagna lord is in 5th, (b) 5th lord is in lagna, (c) AK and PK are in 
lagna or the 5th house, and (d) those planets in owns rasi or amsa or 
in exaltation or aspected by benefics, then this yoga is present and the 
native becomes a great king (Maharajah) loved by his associates. 

(3) If the 9th lord and AK are in lagna, 5th or 7th, aspected by benefics, 
then Raaja Yoga is present. 

(4) If the 2nd, 4th and 5th houses from lagna lord and AK are occupied by 
benefics, one becomes a king. 

(5) If the 3 rd and 6th houses from lagna lord and AK are occupied or 
aspected by malefics, one becomes a king. 

(6) If lagna, HL and GL are joined or aspected by the same planet, then 
that planet gives a Raaja Yoga. One may add "owned" to "joined or 
aspected". 
Planets aspecting or joining HL and GL give wealth and power 
respectively. If such a planet is associated with lagna also, its potential 
to do good increases. 
Results of this yoga may be experienced if the conditions are not 
strictly met, but a planet has an association with lagna (or lagna lord), 
HL (or HL lord) and GL (or GL lord). Association here can mean 
ownership, conjunction or aspect. If lagna lord is in HL and aspects 
GL lord, for example, results of this Raaja Yoga may be experienced 
to some extent. 



118 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(7) If the same planet aspects lagna in the six divisional charts of shad 
vargas - Rasi, Navamsa, Hora, Drekkana, Dwadasamsa, Trimsamsa 
- then that planet gives a Raaja Yoga. 

(8) If lagna, HL and GL are occupied by a planet in own or exaltation 
sign, then the native becomes a king. [NOTE: It can be different planets.] 

(9) If lagna in Rasi, Navamsa and Drekkana charts is occupied by a 
planet in own or exaltation sign, then the native becomes a king. [NOTE: 
It can be different planets.] 

(10) If (a) the 3rd, 6th and 8th houses are occupied by one or two planets in 
debilitation and (b) lagna lord is in an own or exaltation sign and 
aspects lagna, it forms a Raaja Yoga. 

(11) If (a) the 6th, 8th and 12th lords are debilitated or combust or in inimical 
signs and (b) lagna lord is in an own or exaltation sign and aspects 
lagna, it forms a Raaja Yoga. 

(12) If the 5th and 9th lords are in a conjunction or a mutual aspect, it 
makes one prosperous. 

(13) If (a) the 4th lord is in the 10th house and the 10th lord is in the 4th house 
and (b) both of them are aspected by the 5th lord or the 9th lord, then a 
Raaja Yoga is formed. 

(14) If (a) the 5th lord is in the 1st, 4th or 10th house and (b) lagna lord or the 
9th lord joins him, then the native becomes a king. 

(15) If (a) Moon is strong and occupies vargottamamsa40 and (b) four or 
more planets aspect him, then one becomes a king. 

(16) If 4 or more planets occupy moolatrikonas or exaltation signs, one 
becomes a king even if he is from a lowly family. 

(17) If benefics are in quadrants and malefics are in the 3rd, 6th and 11th 

houses, one becomes a king even if he is from a lowly family. 
(18) If arudha lagna and darapada (arudha pada of the 7th house) are not 

in mutual 2nd/12th or 6th/8th positions, then Raja Yogas in the chart will be 
more effective. 

11.8  Raaja Sambandha Yogas 
Raaja means a king. Sambandha means relation or association. Raaja 

sambandha yogas are the combinations that give association with rulers. 
Those who have these yogas are typically powerful ministers, secretaries, 
counsellors and bureaucrats, associated with the rulers and powerful men. 
However, these yogas are very common. The magnitude of success depends 

40 A planet is in vargottamaamsa if it occupies the same sign in Rasi and Navamsa 
charts. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 119 

on the strength of the planets involved in raja yoga. 
(1) If the 10th lord is conjoined or aspected by AmK (chara amaatya 

kaaraka) or his dispositor, one becomes an important person in the 
court of a king. 

(2) If the 11th lord aspects the 11th house and there are no malefic planets 
joining or aspecting the 10th and 11th houses, one becomes an important 
person in the court of a king. 

(3) If AK (chara aatma kaaraka) and AmK conjoin, one is very intelligent 
and becomes a minister. 

(4) If AmK is very strong in own sign or his exaltation sign, then also one 
becomes a minister. 

(5) If AmK is in a trine from lagna, one becomes a famous minister. 
(6) If AmK is in a quadrant or a trine from AK, one is an associate liked 

by a king. 
(7) If malefics occupy the 3 rd and 6th houses from lagna, AL and AK, 

then one becomes a powerful chief of army. 
(8) If AK is in an own or exaltation sign in a quadrant or a trine and the 9th 

lord is conjoined or aspected by AK, one becomes a minister. 
(9) If AK happens to be Moon's dispositor and he occupies lagna along 

with a benefic, one becomes a minister at an old age. 
(10) If AK is in the 5th, 7th, 9th or 10th houses with a benefic, one will be 

associated with kings and earn money thus. 
(11) If bhagyapada (A9 - arudha pada of the 9th house) is in lagna or AK 

is in 9th, one is fortunate and associates with kings. 
(12) If the 11th lord is in the 11th house without aspects from any malefics 

and AK is with benefics, then one has gains from a king. 
(13) If lagna lord is in the 10th house and the 10th lord is in lagna, one is 

powerful and associated with kings. 
(14) If Moon and Venus are in the 4th house from AK, one is endowed with 

royal insignia. 
(15) If lagna lord or AK conjoins the 5th lord in a quadrant or a trine, one 

becomes a king's friend. 
11.9  Dhana Yogas 

Dhana means wealth. Dhana yogas are combinations that give one 
abundant riches. 

Basic Principle: The 5th and 9th lords and planets joining them are 



120 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

capable of giving money. They give dasas in their dasas. The 11th house is 
also important for material gains and it should be strong. The 2nd house is 
also important. If Moon, Mercury, Jupiter or Venus is exalted in the 2nd 

house, it makes the native very rich. 
In addition to these general principles, Parasara listed specific 

combinations for various lagnas. In all these combinations, the strength of 
the participating planets decides the magnitude of results experienced. 
(1) For Ar lagna: If Sun is in the 5th house and Saturn, Moon and Jupiter 

are in the 11th house, one becomes very affluent. If Mars occupies 
lagna conjoined or aspected by Mercury, Venus and Saturn, then also 
one becomes very rich. 

(2) For Ta lagna: If Mercury is in the 5th house and Moon, Mars and 
Jupiter are in the 11th house, one becomes very affluent. If Venus 
occupies lagna conjoined or aspected by Mercury and Saturn, then 
also one becomes very rich. 

(3) For Ge lagna: If Venus is in the 5th house and Mars is in the 11th 

house, one becomes very affluent. If Mercury occupies lagna conjoined 
or aspected by Jupiter and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich. 

(4) For Cn lagna: If Mars is in the 5th house and Venus is in the 11th 

house, one becomes very affluent. If Moon occupies lagna conjoined 
or aspected by Mercury and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich. 

(5) For Le lagna: If Jupiter is in the 5th house and Mercury is in the 11th 

house, one becomes very affluent. If Sun occupies lagna conjoined or 
aspected by Mars and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich. 

(6) For Vi lagna: If Saturn is in the 5th house and Sun and Moon are in 
the 11th house, one becomes very affluent. If Mercury occupies lagna 
conjoined or aspected by Jupiter and Saturn, then also one becomes 
very rich. 

(7) For Li lagna: If Saturn is in the 5th house and Sun and Moon are in 
the 11th house, one becomes very affluent. If Venus occupies lagna 
conjoined or aspected by Mercury and Saturn, then also one becomes 
very rich. 

(8) For Sc lagna: If Jupiter is in the 5th house and Mercury is in the 11th 

house, one becomes very affluent. If Mars occupies lagna conjoined 
or aspected by Mercury, Venus and Saturn, then also one becomes 
very rich. 

(9) For Sg lagna: If Mars is in the 5th house and Venus is in the 11th 

house, one becomes very affluent. If Jupiter occupies lagna 
conjoined or aspected by Mars and Mercury, then also one becomes 



Parr 1: Chart Analysis 121 

very rich. 
(10) For Cp lagna: If Venus is in the 5th house and Mars is in the 11th 

house, one becomes very affluent. If Saturn occupies lagna conjoined 
or aspected by Mars and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich. 

(11) For Aq lagna: If Mercury is in the 5th house and Moon, Mars and 
Jupiter are in the 11th house, one becomes very affluent. If Saturn 
occupies lagna conjoined or aspected by Mars and Jupiter, then also 
one becomes very rich. 

(12) For Pi lagna: If Moon is in the 5th house and in the 11th house, one 
becomes very affluent. If Jupiter occupies lagna conjoined or aspected 
by Mars and Mercury, then also one becomes veiy rich. 

11.10 Daridra Yogas 
One experiences poverty if the following yogas (combinations) are 

present in one's chart: 
(1) Lagna lord is in 12th and 12th lord is in lagna. They are conjoined or 

aspected by a maraka planet. 
NOTE: The 2nd and 7th houses are maraka (killer houses). Their lords 
are marakas (killers). Any malefics occupying 2nd and 7th or associating 
with 2nd and 7th lords also become malefics. 

(2) Lagna lord is in 6th and 6th lord is in lagna. They are conjoined or 
aspected by a maraka planet. 

(3) Lagna or Moon is with Ketu. Lagna lord is in 8th. A maraka planet 
conjoins or aspects lagna lord. 

(4) Lagna lord is with a malefic in a dusthana (6th, 8th or 12th) and 2nd lord is 
debilitated or in an enemy's sign. Even a royal scion with this 
combination becomes poor. 

(5) The 5th lord is in 6th and 9th lord is in 12th, with aspects from marakas. 
(6) Malefics occupy lagna without 9th and 10th lords, aspected or conjoined 

by marakas. 
(7) Lords of the signs occupied by 6th, 8th and 12th lords are in 6th, 8th and 

12th houses, conjoined or aspected by malefics. 
(8) Lord of the sign occupied by Moon in navamsa is with a maraka or 

occupies a maraka house (2nd and 7th).  
(9) Lords of lagna in rasi and navamsa are conjoined or aspected by 

marakas. 
(10) Benefics are in malefic houses and malefics are in benefic houses. 
(11) Planets conjoined by 6th, 8th and 12th lords give loss of wealth in their 



12 2 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

dasas, if they are not conjoined or aspected by the lords of trines. 
(12) Mars and Saturn are in 2nd and Mercury doesn't aspect them. 

(Exception: If Mercury aspects Mars and Saturn in 2nd, great wealth 
is generated.) 

(13) Sun in 2nd is aspected by Saturn. (Exception: If Saturn doesn't aspect. 
Sun in 2nd gives wealth.) 

The general principles emerging from the above combinations are: 
Dusthanas (6th, 8th and 12th) and their lords are detrimental to wealth. If 

lagna, lagna lord and trine lords are afflicted by them, one may be poor. 
Conjunction or aspect of marakas clinches the issue. However, conjunction 
or aspect of trine lords is a saving factor. In addition, the planets in the 2nd 

house and the strength of 2nd lord matter. 
11.11 Conclusion 

A lot of combinations and results have been given in this chapter. Readers 
are advised to read more literature and practice yogas on real charts. One 
should be able to find with a quick glance the yogas present in a chart. 
Experience certainly helps there. In the rest of this book, we will see some 
examples of yogas. 

When looking at the results ascribed to various yogas, try to fit them in 
today's world. For example, one with Kamala yoga may not really become 
a king, but probably become the Prime Minister of a nation or the Governor 
of a state. When using yogas in divisional charts, adapt the results to the 
matters signified by the chart. 

All the great results ascribed to some yogas may not materialize in 
reality, due to weaknesses in them. Unless a yoga is very strong, all the 
results cannot expected. Just one yoga cannot make or break a personality, 
unless it is very powerful. 

In the case of yogas with many conditions, partial results may sometimes 
be experienced if all the conditions are not satisfied. 



12. Ashtakavarga 

12.1 Introduction 
Analyzing a chart and making correct predictions requires mixing many 

different principles and making fine compromises and judgments. Sage 
Parasara said that it is difficult for even great Maharshis. In Kali Yuga41, 
human beings become sinful and the sins kill their intelligence. Parasara 
said that the intellectual pygmies of Kali Yuga cannot cope with too many 
complicated principles and presented ashtakavarga as a simple technique 
that lets them make reasonable predictions without much fuss. Ashtaka 
means "consisting of eight" and varga means "a group". Ashtakavarga is 
the system of analyzing a chart with respect to a group of 8 reference 
points. 

When we analyze the positions of planets with respect to lagna, we 
have the concept of good and bad placements. For example, Jupiter in the 
9th from lagna will be well placed and Jupiter in the 3rd will be badly placed. 
Mars in the 3rd from lagna will be well placed and Mars in the 9th will be 
badly placed. 

However, lagna is not the only reference point in a chart. We have Sun 
and Moon. In fact, all the planets serve as reference points in a chart and 
they represent the sources of various energies that are present in a native. 
Based on the houses in which different planets are placed in transit, they 
can be benefic with respect to some energy sources and malefic with respect 
to some. If a transiting planet is benefic with respect to more energy sources, 
then it brings good results. 

So ashtakavarga is essentially a system that tells us the benefic positions 
of lagna and seven planets with respect to each other. This can be used to 
analyze the strength of a natal chart, but it is much more important in analyzing 
transits. 
12.2 Benefic and Malefic Houses 

The benefic and malefic houses for Sun with respect to all the 8 
references are given in Table 19. 

41 As per Vedic science, time is divided into a cycle of four Yugas that keep repeating. 
Those are: Krita yuga (1,728,000 years), Treta yuga (1,296,000 years), Dwapara yuga 
(864,000 years) and Kali yuga (432,000 years). In Krita yuga, religiousness and 
virtuosity of human beings is exemplary. It is the worst in Kali yuga. It gradually 
worsens from Krita yuga to Kali yuga. We are currently in Kali yuga. It started about 
5,000 years back. 



124 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Table 19: Definition of Sun's Ashtakavarga

In Table 19, an entry of 0 denotes a malefic position or a "karana" or a 
bindu (dot). An entry of 1 denotes a benefic position or a "sthana" or a 
rekha (line)42. To understand how to read this table, let us go to the column 
titled "Merc" in Table 19. This shows benefic houses for Sun to occupy, 
with respect to Mercury. The 1st and 2nd houses have 0 and the 3rd house has 
1. So the first 2 houses from Mercury are malefic for Sun and the 3rd 

house is benefic for Sun. Table 20-Table 26 give the benefic and malefic 
houses of Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and lagna 
(respectively). 

42 Some astrologers (especially south Indian astrologers) use a different notation. They 
use "bindu" to describe a benefic house (1) and "rekha" to describe malefic house (0). 
Let us follow Parasara.

Readers without a computer program should memorize these tables. To 
the modern reader who is overly dependent on computers, memorizing these 
tables may seem like a daunting task. As our dependency on technology 
increases, several skills of our brain are left either unused or undeveloped 
and those skills slowly vanish. Computing ashtakavarga by hand is not as 
difficult as it may seem to be. In fact, even today, some people in India 
compute all the ashtakavarga tables by hand in a matter of a few minutes. 
Example 37: Let us say Venus is in Ge. Find the rasis in which Jupiter is 
benefic with respect to Venus. 

To find the rasis in which Jupiter is benefic, we should look at Jupiter's 
ashtakavarga (see Table 23). To find the rasis in which Jupiter is benefic 
with respect to Venus, we should look at the column of Venus. Only the 2nd, 
5th, 6th, 9th, 10th and 11th houses have a 1 (rekha - benefic point) against 
them. Venus is in Ge and finding these houses with respect to Venus, we get 
Cn, Li, Sc, Aq, Pi and Ar. So Jupiter is benefic with respect to Venus in 
these rasis. 

Exercise 18: Consider the rasi chart in Chart 6. Find the rasis in which 
Mercury is benefic with respect to different planets and lagna. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 129 

12.3 Bhinna Ashtakavarga 
In this book, we will denote ashtakavarga with AV. We prepare what is 

known as "Bhinna Ashtakavarga" for each planet. It is denoted with BAV. 
Bhinna means "separate". When preparing the BAV of a planet, we count 
the number of references from which the planet is benefic in each rasi and 
put that count in that rasi. For each planet, we prepare a different BAV. 
Sometimes we may simply use the word "ashtakavarga" (AV) to represent 
a BAV. 

The count in each rasi is between 0 to 8. It is called the number of 
rekhas (benefic points) in that rasi. If a planet is in a sign with a count of 5, 
6, 7 or 8, it means that the planet is benefic in that rasi with respect to more 
references. So the planet is favorable. If a planet is in a sign with a count of 
3, 2, 1 or 0, it means that the planet is malefic in that rasi with respect to 
more references. So the planet is unfavorable. If the count is 4, the planet is 
neutral. We can use this analysis in natal charts and also transit charts. 
Example 38: Let us go further with Exercise 18 now. After finding the 
rasis in which Mercury is benefic with respect to various references, let us 
count the references with respect to which Mercury is benefic in each rasi. 
From the answer to Exercise 18, we see that Mercury is benefic in Ar with 
respect to Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Saturn and lagna. In other 
words, Mercury is benefic in Ar with respect to 7 references. So we write 
7 in Ar. We see that Mercury is benefic in Ta with respect to Sun, Mercury, 
Venus and Saturn. In other words, Mercury is benefic in Ta with respect to 
4 references. So we write 4 in Ta. We find the count of references for each 
rasi and prepare a chart. This is called Mercury's BAV or simply Mercury's 
AV. Readers may complete the calculations and verify with Chart 11. 

In Ar and Ge, we have 7 rekhas. So Mercury is benefic in those rasis 
with respect to 7 references out of 8. In Aq, we have 6 rekhas. So these 
three rasis are particularly favorable for Mercury. In Vi and Cp, we have 3 
rekhas and that is the lowest. So Mercury is particularly unfavorable in Vi 
and Cp. We can use this information to interpret how favorable Mercury is 
in the natal chart or in a transit chart. Here Mercury is in Ge in the natal 
chart and Ge has 7 rekhas in Mercury's AV. That means that Mercury is a 
very favorable planet. Being the lagna lord and being in a quadrant from 
lagna in own sign (i.e. Bhadra yoga) makes him even stronger. Because of 
this, Mercury is extremely favorable in this chart. No wonder Sri P.V. 
Narasimha Rao is a brilliant scholar, well versed in many languages. He is 
an excellent writer and he won a prestigious literary award for a literary 
work in a language that is not his mother tongue. 



130 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 11 

 

Exercise 19: Find the number of rekhas in all the rasis in the BAVs of Sun, 
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn for the same rasi chart 
(see Chart 6). 
12.4  Samudaaya Ashtakavarga 

Samudaaya means "group". Samudaaya Ashtakavarga is nothing but 
the sum of the ashtakavargas of seven planets. In each rasi, we add the 
number of rekhas in the BAVs of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus 
and Saturn. The sum denotes the number of rekhas in that rasi in Samudaaya 
Ashtakavarga. It will be denoted with SAV. It is also called "Sarva 
Ashtakavarga" (sarva = all). 

Let us continue with the rasi chart in Chart 6. From the answer to 
Exercise 19, we see that the BAVs of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
Venus and Saturn have 5, 3, 4, 7, 4, 8 and 3 rekhas in Ar (respectively). 
Adding them all, we get 34. So SAV has 34 rekhas in Ar and we write 34 in 
Ar. We can find the number of rekhas in all the rasis in the same manner 
and prepare a chart with the number of rekhas written in each rasi. 
Exercise 20: Find the number of rekhas in all the rasis in SAV for the 
same rasi chart (see Chart 6). 

A rasi with 30 or more rekhas becomes strong. Matters signified by the 
house falling in such a rasi flourish and planets transiting in such a rasi bring 
good results. A rasi with 25-30 rekhas is average. A rasi with less than 25 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 131 

rekhas becomes weak. Matters signified by the house falling in such a rasi 
suffer and planets transiting in such a rasi bring bad results. 

When choosing muhurtas43 for auspicious activities like a wedding or 
housewarming, one should look at the strengths, as per SAV of the natal 
chart, of the rasis containing lagna, Moon and Sun in the muhurta chart. 
Rasis containing 30 or more rekhas in SAV are favorable. 
12.5   Divisional Charts 

There is a misconception that ashtakavarga is applicable only to rasi 
charts. Parasara does not say it. Parasara lists the divisional charts in which 
different areas of life are seen, at the very beginning of BPHS. So all the 
analysis in the rest of his classic applies to all the divisional charts, unless 
Parasara explicitly mentions rasi chart. For example, Parasara says that D-
12 shows matters related to father. So any principles based on ashtakavarga 
and sodhya pindas that let us predict matters related to father must use D-
12. This is a logical deduction and Parasara does not have to mention it 
explicitly each time. 

If we can judge the benefic positions of various planets with respect to 
8 references in rasi chart, there is no reason why we should not do it in all 
the divisional charts. In fact, this becomes invaluable when we interpret 
transits in rasi chart with respect to the natal positions in divisional charts 
and transits in divisional charts with respect to the natal positions in rasi 
chart. 

Ashtakavarga of divisional charts is prepared in the same manner as 
that of rasi chart. The benefic houses for each planet with respect to the 8 
references are the same. We can apply the same rules and find the BAVs 
of all planets. In fact, we can find SAV of a divisional chart too. 
Example 39: Let us consider the rasi chart and D-10 of India's Prime 
Minister Sri A.B. Vajpayee (see Chart 3 for birthdata). 

Readers may find SAV of rasi and D-10 and verify the following: 
 

SAV of Rasi chart: 
 Ar T Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Rekhas 29 22 27 29 28 38 29 26 23 34 28 24
SAV of D-10 chart: 
 Ar T Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Rekhas 23 26 33 20 28 33 26 35 28 31 24 30

43. Muhurta is an auspicious pre-set time at which one begins important activities. 



132 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

In rasi chart, the 11th house has the maximum number of rekhas (38) 
showing excellent gains. The 3rd house of communication has 34 rekhas. 
With the significator of communication Mercury and the artistic Moon in 
the 3rd house, he is an excellent communicator, great orator and poet. Though 
Sri Vajpayee's career wasn't a bed of roses - he struggled in the opposition 
parties for most of his career - he finally became India's Prime Minister 
and one must agree that he had a very successful career. He is known as a 
man of great character. With lagna and the 10th house in the SAV of rasi 
chart containing only 26 and 28 rekhas - which is just average - why did he 
have such a successful career? 

The answer lies in the SAV of D-10. Lagna in D-10 is Sc and it contains 
35 rekhas - maximum in D-10's SAV. Arudha lagna also contains more 
than 30 rekhas. These factors explain his success and good name. The 3rd 

house in D-10 also has more than 30 rekhas - like in the rasi chart - and 
that increases the chance of being an excellent communicator in public life. 
Though D-10 is powerful with lagna and arudha lagna containing more than 
30 rekhas, one may notice that the 8th house in D-10 (Ge) has 33 rekhas in 
D-10's SAV. This explains the struggle in Vajpayee's career. 

Chart 12 

 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 133 

12.6 Prastaara Ashtakavarga 
Using the Bhinna Ashtakavarga (BAV) of a planet, we can find out the 

rasis in which it is benefic with respect to more references and the rasis in 
which it is malefic with respect to more references. To interpret transits, 
this is sometimes not enough. For example, if we know that a planet is 
benefic in Ta with respect to 5 references, that may not be enough. We may 
need to know exactly what those 5 references are. If we are looking for 
Jupiter's transit that brings marriage, for example, we may want Jupiter to 
be benefic in his transit rasi with respect to certain planets (Venus or DK or 
7th lord in navamsa, for example). In such situations, we need to know 
exactly which references a planet is benefic from. 

For this purpose, we prepare "Prastaara Astakavarga". It will be 
denoted with PAV. Prastaara means "spread-out". PAV is a spreadsheet 
that shows the exact references from which a planet is benefic in a rasi. 
We prepare one PAV for each planet. Different people may represent 
PAV differently. Some people may cast a chart and write the list of 
benefic references in each rasi. For some people, the answer to Exercise 
18 may qualify as Mercury's PAV. Some people may prefer to represent 
the same information as shown in Table 27. 

Table 27: Mercury's PAV for Exercise 18 

 
The basic purpose of a planet's PAV is to show the references with 

respect to which the planet is benefic in each rasi. 



134 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

NOTE: From PAV, we can construct BAV easily. From Table 27, we may 
note that the sum of all the entries in each column - rasi - in a PAV gives 
the number of rekhas in that rasi in BAV. This is shown in the last row. 
12.7 Sodhya Pindas 

We discussed the computation of BAV before. By applying some 
reductions on the values in BAV, we get "Sodhita Ashtakavarga" (SoAV). 
Using it, we find Sodhya Pindas of different planets. These pindas are very 
important in predicting key events and we will talk about them again in the 
part "Transit Analysis". 
12.7.1  Trikona Sodhana (Trinal Reduction) 

Consider the BAV of a planet. Look at different sets of mutual trines 
separately (e.g. First set: Ar, Le and Sg, Second set: Ta, Vi and Cp) and 
apply the following rules on each set: 
(1) If atleast one rasi has zero, no reduction is necessary.44 
(2) If the three rasis have the same value, make them all zero. 
(3) Take the lowest value out of the three. Subtract it from all the values. 
Example 40: As an example, let us take Mercury's BAV given in Chart 
11. Let us takes fiery trines. Ar, Le and Sg have 7,4 and 4 rekhas. Rules (1) 
and (2) don't apply and we go to (3). The lowest value is 4. Subtracting it 
from the three values, we write 3,0 and 0 in Ar, Le and Sg respectively. Let 
us take the watery trines now. Cn, Sc and Pi have 4 rekhas each. Rule (2) 
applies and we write zero in all the three rasis. Readers may carry out the 
reduction for the remaining two sets of trines and verify that we get the 
following table after Trikona Sodhana: 

 

 Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Mercury 3 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 

12.7.2 Ekaadhipatya Sodhana (Co-owned Reduction) 
After we carry out Trikona Sodhana, we cany out another reduction on the 
pairs of signs that are owned by the same planet. Ar and Sc are owned by 
Mars; Ta and Li are owned by Venus; Ge and Vi are owned by Mercury; 
Sg and Pi are owned by Jupiter; and, Cp and Aq are owned by Saturn. We 

44 Some authors suggest that this applies only if there is zero in exactly one rasi. If two 
rasis have a zero, they suggest making the third one also zero. But this is inconsistent 
with the spirit of the other rules. The idea is to subtract the lowest value from others. 
In that sense, (1) and (2) are special cases cases of (3). The change suggested by these 
authors is inconsistent with this. Let us follow Parasara. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 135 

apply a reduction on these pairs of rasis separately, using the following 
rules: 
(1) If atleast one of the rasis has a zero in it, no reduction is necessary and 

stop here. 
(2) If both the rasis are occupied by a planet (or planets), again no reduction 

is necessary and stop here. 
(3) If one rasi is occupied by a planet (or planets) and the other is empty, 

then do the following: 
 

(a) If the empty rasi has a lower value, replace the value with a zero. 
(b) If the empty rasi has a higher value, replace the value with the 

value in the other rasi. 
(4) If both the rasis are empty, then do the following: 

(a) If both the rasis have the same value, replace both with zero. 
(b) If they have different values, replace the higher value with the 

lower value. 
Example 41: Let us continue with Example 40. Let us take Ar and Sc. Sc 
has zero in it and (1) applies. So there is no reduction. In fact, (1) applies to 
all pairs and so all the values remain unchanged after Ekaadhipatya reduction. 
Example 42: Let us consider some other hypothetical examples to 
understand all the rules correctly. 
(a) Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let 

us say Ta is occupied by Mars and Li by Jupiter and Saturn. In this 
case, rule (2) applies and we do not alter the values. 

(b) Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let 
us say Ta is occupied by Mars and Li is empty. In this case, rule (3a) 
applies and we write zero in Li, as Li is empty and it has a lower value 
than Ta. 

(c) Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let 
us say Ta is empty and Li is occupied by Jupiter and Saturn. In this 
case, rule (3 b) applies and we write 2 in Ta, as Ta is empty and it has a 
higher value than Li. 

(d) Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let 
us say Ta and Li are empty. In this case, rule (4b) applies and we 
replace the higher value 4 with the lower value 2. So we write 2 in Ta. 

(e) Let us say Ta and Li have 2 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let 
us say Ta and Li are empty. In this case, rule (4a) applies and we write 
zero in Ta and Li.

12.7.3 Sodhya Pindas 
After carrying out Trikona sodhana and then Ekaadhipatya sodhana on 

the BAV of a planet, we get the "Sodhita Ashtakavarga" of that planet. We 
denote Sodhita Ashtakavarga with SoAV.45 From it, we find "Sodhya Pinda"" 
of each planet. This will be used in transit analysis. 

For each rasi, we multiply the number in that rasi in SoAV with the 
multiplier of that rasi (shown in Table 28). We find such a product for all the 
12 rasis. We find the sum of the products of all the 12 rasis and the sum is 
called rasi pinda. 

For each planet, we multiply the number in the rasi containing that planet 
with the multiplier of that planet (shown in Table 29). We find such a product 
for all the 7 planets. We find the sum of the products of all the 7 planets and 
the sum is called graha pinda.

By adding rasi pinda and graha pinda, we get "Sodhya Pinda" of the 
planet whose SoAV we are working with. 
Example 43: Let us continue with Mercury's SoAV found in Example 40 
and Example 41.

45 This chart has several purposes which will not be covered in this book. An example is 
Vaastu or Sthaapatya Veda or the Vedic Science of Architecture. The direction 
signified by the rasis containing most rekhas in the SoAV of a planet should contain 
the room in which the activity related to the planet takes place. For example, we 
should look at the SoAV of Venus to decide where bedroom should be. We should 
look Jupiter's SoAV to decide where money and jewels should be kept. We should 
look at Moon's SoAV to decide the living room (hall). Mercury is important for the 
study room. Sun is important for the pooja room. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 137 

Rasi Pinda: Product for Ar is 3 X 7 = 21. Product for Ta is 1 X 10 = 10. 
Product for Ge is 3 X 8 = 24. Product for Aq is 2 x 11 = 22. Product for other 
rasis is zero, because they contain zero and we get zero by multiplying zero 
with any number. The sum of all the products is 21 + 10 + 24 + 22 = 77. So 
rasi pinda is 77. 

Graha Pinda: Sun, Mars and Mercury are in Ge, which has 3 rekhas in 
SoAV. Product of Sun is 3 X 5 = 15. Product of Mars is 3 x 8 = 24. Product 
of Mercury is 3 x 5 = 15. Venus is in Ar, which has 3. Product of Venus is 
3x7 = 21. Other planets are in rasis with zero in them. So the product is 
zero for them. The sum of all the products is 15 + 24 + 15 + 21 = 75. So 
graha pinda is 75. 

We get sodhya pinda of Mercury by adding rasi pinda and graha pinda. 
We get 77 + 75 = 152. So Mercury's sodhya pinda in this chart is 152. 
Exercise 22: Find BAV, SoAV and sodhya pinda of all planets in Chart 7. 

12.8 Controversies 
With some authors using the term bindu (dot) to denote a benefic house 

and the term rekha (line) to denote a malefic house - which is the opposite 
of what we learnt in this chapter - readers may be confused when reading 
other books. So they should keep in mind that there are different conventions 
in vogue. We are following Parasara's conventions in this book. 

The above is merely a problem of different naming conventions. It is 
not a serious issue at all. It is just a matter of getting used to different 
nomenclature. But there is another issue, which is far more serious. There 
are a few inconsistencies between the lists of benefic houses of Moon and 
Venus as given by Maharshi Parasara and the great astrologer Varahamihira, 
who is relatively modern, as he belongs to 600 AD. These inconsistencies 
may have arisen due to corruption of texts in time46. 

To define a planet's ashtakavarga, Parasara first gives the count of 
references from which the planet is malefic in the 1st house and then he lists 
the references. He does the same thing for all houses. So we can crosscheck. 
As if this isn't enough, the Sage then lists the references from which the 
planet is benefic. He does it in all the houses again. Just as "checksum" 
values are transmitted in today's digital communication schemes to provide 
resilience to transmission errors the Sage, who normally uses words sparingly, 
takes plenty of care to ensure that his teachings on ashtakavarga remain 
46 In India, books seldom existed on paper and classics were transmitted from one 

generation to the other, mostly by word of mouth. People got the classics by heart and 
recited them to their children and students. Books were written in poetry, using nice 
meters, to facilitate memorization. 



138 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

difficult to corrupt. To corrupt one house value in Parasara's account of 
ashtakavarga, one has to consciously re-write the verses in three different 
places in a consistent fashion. With the direct approach adopted by other 
authors, one can change the table just by changing one word. For example, 
changing "sukha" (comfort - 4th) to "suta" (son - 5th) changes one value 
without affecting the meter used in the verses. With Parasara's indirect 
approach, consistent changes in multiple places are required for a single 
value change. So Parasara's indirect approach is superior in corruption 
resistance. We will follow Parasara in this book. 

Just for the information of the reader, the places of conflict will be 
mentioned below: 
(1) Moon's ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Moon is benefic in the 9* from 

Moon and malefic in the 9th from Mars As per Varahamihira, Moon is 
malefic in the 9th from Moon and benefic in the 9th from Mars. 

(2) Moon's ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Moon is benefic in the 2nd 

from Jupiter and malefic in the 12th from Jupiter. As per Varahamihira, 
Moon is malefic in the 2nd from Jupiter and benefic in the 12th from 
Jupiter. 

(3) Venus's ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Venus is benefic in the 4th 

from Mars and malefic in the 5th from Mars. As per Varahamihira, 
Venus is malefic in the 4th from Mars and benefic in the 5th from Mars. 
The definitions and calculations given in this chapter strictly follow 

Parasara for the reasons already mentioned. However, readers are welcome 
to experiment and draw their own conclusions. Until authentic and conclusive 
researches are conducted into the use of sodhya pindas in the timing of 
events, we cannot conclusively resolve the above controversy. 

Apart from this, there is another needless controversy related to 
ashtakavarga. Some people prepare "bhava chakra" or "chalit chakra" using 
Sripathi's (or Porphyry's) house devision method and use that chart to cast 
ashtakavarga. If Saturn is at 3° in Vi and lagna is at 27° in Le, they are very 
close and these people argue that Saturn is in the 1st house from lagna and 
not in the 2nd house. These people make a bhava chakra accordingly and 
use it in ashtakavarga. However, if lagna is at 15° in Le, Saturn is at 3° in Vi 
and Jupiter is at 27° in Le, they may take Saturn to be in the 2nd house from 
Jupiter. They compute a bhava chakra with multi-sign houses only with 
respect to lagna and not with respect to all the references used in 
ashtakavarga. So their approach is neither here nor there. 

The stand of this book is very clear - each bhava (house) with respect 
to one reference can only be in one rasi. Even if Saturn is at 1° in Vi and 
lagna is at 29° in Le, we still say that the 1st house is in Le, the 2nd house is 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 13 9 

in Li and Saturn is in the 2nd house (though he is only 2° away from lagna). 
We do not recognize the house division methods of Porphyry and others in 
this book. Each rasi is a house and the 1st house is the rasi containing the 
reference. Readers will do well to follow Maharshi Parasara and ignore the 
creations and borrowings of later day Indian astrologers. 
12.9 Answers to Exercises 
Exercise 18: 

See Table 22 for Mercury's ashtakavarga. Looking at the columns of 
different planets, find the houses from the planets in which Mercury is 
benefic. Count those houses from the respective planets and find the rasis.

Exercise 21: 
SAV of D-10 is as eiven below: 

 

 Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Rekhas 24 25 31 28 27 39 33 29 26 22 28 25

Lagna is in Vi in Chart 12. Vi it has 39 rekhas. That's a lot more than 
30! The 10th house (Ge) also has more than 30 rekhas. So this D-10 is very 
powerful and it possibly cannot belong to an unsuccessful waiter at a small 
restaurant. This has to be someone pretty successful. 

Now let us guess her career. 
Apart from the 1st and 10th houses, the 2nd house is strong in D-10's 

SAV, with 33 rekhas. This shows the importance of speech and voice in her 
career. Ghati lagna is in Taurus and its lord Venus occupies it. This makes 
ghati lagna and 9th house very powerful. This shows a fortunate (9th) and 
famous (GL) entertainer (Venus). Saturn's 11th house argala on GL suggests 
popular mass support as a catalyst in her success. Rahu's unobstructed 2nd 

house argala on lagna shows unconventional behavior in public life.47

Final Answer: The chart belongs to Madonna, a pop diva of USA.

13. Interpreting Charts 

13.1 Introduction 
In the previous chapters, we have learnt various parameters and tools 

available in Vedic astrology. When it comes to putting them all together and 
interpreting charts, there is no substitute for experience. One should also 
refer to classics and "How to Judge a Horoscope" (Vols I & II) by Dr. B.V. 
Raman, to become familiar with the standard results attributed to different 
planets being in different houses and the lords of different houses being in 
various houses. In this chapter, we will cover some topics not covered yet 
and go through a couple of examples of interpreting charts. We will see 
many more examples in the rest of this book. 
13.2 Functional Nature 

We learnt that Jupiter, Venus, waxing Moon and well-associated 
Mercury are natural benefics. We learnt that Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu, 
Ketu, waning Moon and ill-associated Mercury are natural malefics. In 
addition, we have the concept of functional benefics and functional 
malefics. 

The lords of trines from lagna are functional benefics. The lords of 3rd, 6th 

and 11th are functional malefics. The lord of a quadrant is a functional malefic 
if he is a natural benefic and functionally neutral if he is a natural malefic. 
The lords of 2nd, 8th and 12th are functionally neutral. Of these, the 8th house is 
more malefic than the other two. 

Planet owning a quadrant and a trine becomes a yogakaraka (excellent 
planet). 

In the case of planets owning two rasis, we need to judiciously combine 
the two indications. The list of yogakarakas, functional benefics, functional 
neutrals and functional malefics for each lagna is given in Table 30. Moon is 
not listed for movable rasis, because his functional nature depends on whether 
he is waxing or waning. Waxing Moon is a natural benefic and he becomes 
a functional malefic with quadrant ownership. Waning Moon, on the other 
hand, is a natural malefic and quadrant ownership makes him functionally 
neutral. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 143

Table 30: Functional nature of planets

 

A functional benefic is a favorable planet in a chart. Placement of a 
functional benefic in quadrants (sustenance) and trines (prosperity) brings 
good results. Placement of a functional malefic in these houses is not good, 
unless it is very strong. A functional malefic placed in the 3rd house and 
dusthanas (6th, 8th and 12th houses) brings good results, by spoiling the 
significations of the bad houses. 



144 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

If a planet aspects or conjoins or owns HL and lagna, it becomes a 
yogada (giver of yoga) in money matters. If a planet aspects or conjoins or 
owns GL and lagna, it becomes a yogada in the matters of power and 
authority. Irrespective of their functional nature, planets that become yogada 
bring goodluck. Similarly, planets involved in important yogas also bring good 
luck. 

We should consider the inherent nature and the functional nature of 
planets. Whether a planet is a natural benefic or a natural malefic is analogous 
to whether a person is inherently good or bad. Whether a planet is a functional 
benefic or a functional malefic is analogous to whether a person does good 
or bad to one. Just as a nice person may harm one and a bad person may do 
good, natural benefics can become functional malefics and natural malefics 
can become functional benefics. 

13.3 Baadhakas 
For a house falling in a movable/fixed/dual rasi, the 11th/9th/7th house 

(respectively) from there becomes baadhaka sthaana (troubling spot). Its 
lord is called a "baadhaka" (troublemaker) for the original house. The list of 
baadhaka sthaanas and baadhakas corresponding to each rasi is given in 
Table 31. 

For example, suppose lagna in someone's D-10 is in Ge. Then Jupiter is 
baadhaka for lagna. The periods of Jupiter and planets in Sg can create 
some obstructions and troubles in career. Let us take another house. Aq is 
the 9th house and the 9th house in D-10 shows the guidance one gets in 
one's career. It can show manager and elders giving guidance. Baadhaka 
sthana for Aq is Li. So the periods of Venus and occupants of Li can create 
some troubles related to the guidance one gets. There may be some troubles 
related to manager. Thus we can consider baadhaka from every house and 
arudha pada in every divisional chart. 

13.4 Analyzing Charts 

13.4.1 Basic Guidelines 
When we analyze the charts, we should remember all the concepts we 

have learnt in the previous chapters. The following factors must be 
remembered: 
(1) Divisional Chart: Use the correct divisional chart for the matter of 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 14 5 

Table 31: Baadhakas 
 

Rasi Baadhaka sthaana Baadhaka 
Ar Aq Saturn & Rahu 
Ta Cp Saturn 

Ge Sg Jupiter 
Cn Ta Venus 
Le Ar Mars 
Vi Pi Jupiter 
Li Le Sun 
Sc Cn Moon 
Sg Ge Mercury 
Cp Sc Mars & Ketu 
Aq Li Venus 
Pi Vi Mercury 

interest. Suppose we are looking at happiness from a vehicle. D-16 is 
the best chart. Suppose we are trying to analyze a criminars psychology. 
D-30 is the best chart. Suppose we are analyzing marriage. D-9 is the 
best chart. Suppose we are analyzing marriage in a culture where 
marriage is not a dharma (duty) and a union of souls, but it is merely 
living together of two people, then rasi chart may be better than D-9. 
Suppose we want to study one's religious activities. Then D-20 is the 
chart. If we want to study one's learning, D-24 is the chart. Suppose 
we want to study one's career and achievements in society, D-10 chart 
is the correct chart. In this manner, we should choose the correct 
divisional chart. 

(2) House: We should choose the correct house after choosing the correct 
divisional chart. Let us say that we are analyzing someone's learning 
related activities and decided to look at D-24. If we want to see his 
education, we see the 4th house. If we want to see his intelligence, 
scholarship, academic reputation, academic distinctions/awards, students 
etc, we should look at the 5th house. If we want to see how one, in one's 
pursuit of knowledge, interacts with others and what kind of people one 



146 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

interacts with, then we should see the 7th house. Like that, we choose 
the correct house for the matter of interest. 

(1) Reference: We should choose the correct reference for counting 
houses. In the above example of D-24, academic reputation is related 
more to the perceived self (AL) than the true self (lagna). So it is seen 
from the 5th from arudha lagna (AL). Intelligence and scholarship, on 
the other hand, are related to the true self and they are seen from the 
5th from lagna. When the relevant karakas are stronger, we can use 
them as references instead of lagna. So scholarship can be seen from 
the 5th from Mercury. Students can be seen from the 5th lord. Intelligence 
can be seen from the 5th from Jupiter. Academic reputation can be 
seen in D-24 from the 5th from Sun. 

(2) House vs Arudha: Sometimes, an arudha pada is more appropriate to 
see a matter than a house. For example, we can see darapada (A7) in 
D-24 to figure out what kind of people one typically interacts with in 
one's learning related activities. We can see one's academic distinctions/ 
awards in A5, because they are maya (illusion) related to intelligence 
and scholarship. The world forms an impression about one's intelligence 
and scholarship based on one's scores, ranks, grades, distinctions and 
awards. 

(3) Influences: After we choose a house/arudha in a divisional chart to 
represent the matter of interest, the next step is to analyze the influences 
on it. Planets influence it with rasi drishti and graha drishti. We should 
also check for argala. We should judge the meaning of each influence. 
We can also judge the influences on a house by finding houses with 
respect to that house. Planets in the quadrants from a house sustain it. 
Planets in trines from a house let it prosper. Planets in upachayas let it 
grow. Planets in dusthanas bring obstacles. Suppose we are analyzing 
A3 in an author's D-10. While the 3rd house shows one's writing skills, 
it is A3 that shows one's books. If a planet is in a quadrant from A3, its 
periods may result in book writing. If a planet is in the 8th house from 
A3, its periods may bring obstacles in book writing. If a planet is a 
baadhaka from A3, it can create troubles in book-writing. 

(4) Standard Results: There are many standard results given in literature 
for various planets and house lords in various houses. These results 
should be mastered. 
Attention should be paid to the strength and avasthas of various planets 

and ashtakavarga strength of various houses. The presence of yogas should 
also be noted. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 14 7 

13.4.2 Family Members 
We can analyze the fortunes of family members from one's chart. For 

parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts, we should see D-12. For children, 
children-in-law and grandchildren, we should see D-7. For brothers, sisters, 
brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, we should see D-3. For spouse and his/ 
her family members, we should see D-9. 

In each of these charts, we should look at the house that shows the 
person of interest and consider the rasi containing the lord of that house as 
lagna. We can consider the corresponding arudha pada also. For example, 
the 9th lord or the arudha pada of 9th house in D-12 shows father. The 4th 

lord or the arudha pada of 4th house in D-12 shows mother. 
In D-3, we see siblings. The 3rd house shows younger sibling and the 

11th house shows elder sibling. Being the 3rd from the 3rd house, the 5th house 
shows younger brother's younger brother, i.e. second younger brother. Being 
the 11th from the 11th house, the 9th house shows elder brother's elder brother, 
i.e. second elder brother. We take the 3rd lord, 5th lord, 7th lord etc as lagnas 
of first (immediate) younger sibling, second younger sibling, third younger 
sibling etc. We take the 11th lord, 9th lord, 7th lord etc as lagnas of first 
(immediate) elder sibling, second elder sibling, third elder sibling etc. 

Similarly, the 5th house house shows children in D-7. The 7th house is 
the 3rd from 5th and shows one's child's younger sibling. So the 5th lord 
shows the first child, the 7th lord shows the second child, the 9th house 
shows the third chiid and so on. 

When we count houses corresponding to siblings and children in D-3 
and D-7, we count in the forward or backward direction based on whether 
lagna is odd or even (respectively). If lagna in D-7 is in Ge, Venus (lord of 
Li) shows first child, Jupiter (lord of Sg) shows the second child and so on. 
On the other hand, if lagna in D-7 is in Cn, Jupiter (lord of Pi) shows the first 
child, Saturn (lord of Cp) shows the second child and so on. 
NOTE: After covering all the odd or even signs, we move from odd to even 
signs or even to odd signs, instead of coming back to where we started. 

13.5   Examples 
After going through a couple of examples, readers may be able to 

appreciate the process of interpreting charts. 
Example 44: Let us consider the rasi chart given in Chart 13 and start 
making some observations. 

Lagna in Leo can show someone royal and authoritative. Lagna lord 
Sun is in the 10th house with 5th lord Jupiter. This forms a raajayoga. With 



148 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Jupiter in Uttamaamsa, this yoga is powerful. Moreover, this yoga takes 
place in the 7th from AL. That makes it more powerful. 

However, we note that debilitated Moon occupies AL in a Martian sign 
and Saturn aspects him. Debilitated Moon in AL shows that the mind is 
turned away from the material world. Saturn is the significator of hard-
work, service and austerity and he also signifies renunciation. His aspect on 
Moon can give renunciation. Moreover, Saturn is with Ketu here. Overall, 
there are parivraaja yogas48 here. So this native is likely to have renounced 
the world. 

Chart 13 

 
48 Parivraaja yogas are combinations that give renunciation of the material world.



Part 1: Chart Analysis 149 

Saturn is the planet of hard-work. Ketu is the planet of selflessness, 
evolution and rising above the shackles of the material world. Venus is the 
planet of passion. If two of these planets are together and the third planet 
aspects them, it gives Tapaswi49 yoga. If AK (chara atma karaka - soul) 
also aspects or conjoins the planets involved in Tapaswi yoga, this tapas will 
be more fruitful and will be a continuation of the efforts of the past lives 
(AK is one's link with the past lives). 

Here Saturn and Ketu are together in Virgo and exalted Venus aspects 
them from Pisces. This gives Tapaswi yoga. Tapaswi yoga is particularly 
powerful when formed with a planet in the 8th house (hard-work, research, 
discovery and occult knowledge). Here Venus is in the 8* house. AK is 
also involved in Tapaswi yoga. 

So this native is likely to be a renunciate who did tapas in something and 
dedicated his life to it. His soul is likely to have found its purpose in his 
tapas. However, at the same time, there is a powerful rajayoga involving 
lagna lord and GL lord in the 7th from AL. That yoga cannot go waste. So 
this native must've enjoyed some power and influence in the society. 

Let us consider his D-20 now (see Chart 13). D-20 shows religious and 
spiritual activities. Lagna is in Pisces and lord Jupiter is in the 9th house. 
This shows religiousness and also being guided by a brilliant guru/parampara. 
GL in D-20 is in Sc and Jupiter occupies it. It shows a powerful position in 
religion. 

If the 5th and 9th lords conjoin and aspect lagna, we learnt that it forms 
a rajayoga. Here 5th lord Moon and 9th lord Mars join in Vi and aspect lagna 
in Pi. This shows a powerful rajayoga giving a powerful and prosperous 
position related to religious matters. Venus, the planet of passion, is in the 8th 

house in own rasi. That shows sincere efforts and hard-work in religious 
matters. The 2nd house has Sun and Mercury in it. The 2nd house shows 
speech among other things. Mercury is the planet of speech and he has 6 
rekhas in his D-20 BAV. Sun is a charismatic planet and he has 5 rekhas in 
D-20 BAV. They together give Budha-Aaditya yoga in the house of speech. 
The native is likely to be an excellent orator of religious matters. 

This chart belongs to Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswathi, who was the 
chief pontiff of Kanchi Kama Koti Peetham. He was a great scholar and a 
keen student of many subjects. He was a true tapaswi and made a Herculean

something single-mindedly. Tapaswis usually dedicate themselves to research and 
uncover the secrets of the world. A tapaswi can be into yoga, mantra, tantra, 
astrology or even physics or chemistry.

contribution in restoring the place of Vedic knowledge in Indian society. He 
was a brilliant orator. He commanded the respect of presidents, prime 
ministers, chief ministers and millions of Indians. 

Chart 14 

 

Example 45: Let us consider the D-3 chart of Late Rajiv Gandhi (see 
Chart 14). 

Based on his D-3, let us try to say something about his younger Sanjay 
Gandhi. Lagna in D-3 is in Sg, an odd sign. So we count houses normally. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 151 

The 3rd house is Aq. Saturn is its lord and we should take Li as lagna in 
Rajiv Gandhi's D-3 to analyze Sanjay Gandhi's fortune. 

Lagna has exalted Saturn in it. This shows Sasa yoga. This shows 
someone with many loyal followers. The 10th house has 5th lord Rahu. If the 
5th lord is in 10th, it can show power. Because it is Rahu, it can show forceful 
nature in career. However, the 10th lord Moon is in a fiery sign in the 3rd 

house with Jupiter and Venus, two rank benefics. The 3rd house shows 
one's parakrama (boldness and initiative). This shows a very positive and 
pro-active attitude. It shows a doer. 

It may be interesting to note the similarities between Rajiv Gandhi's D-
3 and Sanjay Gandhi's rasi chart (shown in Chart 14). In both, Saturn is on 
the lagna axis. In the former, Saturn is in lagna and Saturn owns lagna in the 
latter. In the former, Moon owns 10th and joins Jupiter and Venus. In the 
latter, Jupiter and Venus are in 10th, aspected by Moon. In the former, 5th 

lord Rahu is in 10th. In the latter, Rahu is in 5th and aspects 10th. In the 
former, Sun is in own sign in 11th, aspected by Mercury, Saturn and Ketu. In 
the latter, Sun, Mercury and Ketu are in 11th and Saturn aspects them. In 
both, Mars is in the 12th house. 

Usually, we have such links between the charts of related people. 
Example 46: Let us consider the D-24 charts (see Chart 15) and D-27 
charts (see Chart 16) of twins Satyam Gaur and Shivam Gaur, who were 
born just 2 minutes apart. They have the same rasi chart, but Satyam Gaur 
was a brilliant student and Shivam Gaur was a mediocre student. Satyam 
studied commerce and accountancy and scored well. Shivam was a 
mediocre student except in mathematics. Satyam is jovial, amicable and 
optimistic. Shivam is a skeptic. He does not believe in astrology and always 
seeks rational explanations. Let us try to explain these facts. 



152 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 15 

 

D-24 is the chart that shows education. In Satyam's case, lagna is in Li 
and lagna lord Venus is well-placed in a trine in a friendly house. Moreover, 
the sign occupied by lagna lord is Ge, an intellectual sign. Mercury is in the 
5th house and that gives good memory and intelligence. It also gives skills in 
commerce and accounting. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 153 

Chart 16 

 

Moreover, AL has Mercury and it shows a person who is perceived as 
an intellectual person as far as learning goes. Mars in 6th, Venus in 5th and 
nodes in 11th are well-placed from AL. 

In Shivam's D-24, lagna moved to Sc and lagna lord is debilitated. The 
strength of lagna and lagna lord is very important in any chart. Moreover, 



154 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

5th lord Jupiter is also debilitated. Still, exalted Ketu's aspect on Pi, the 5th 

house, gave him some skills in mathematics. But the debilitation of lagna 
lord and 5th lord makes him a mediocre student. From AL also, Mars in 7th, 
Venus in 6th, nodes in 12lh are badly placed. Malefics in 3rd, 6th and 11th from AL 
and benefics in trines from it will give good results. 

To see one's inherent nature, strengths and weaknesses, we should 
look at D-27. In Satyam's D-27, lagna is in Ge and lagna lord Mercury 
aspects it. This gives Bhadra yoga like results. The 5th house of emotions 
and judgment is Libra and its lord Venus occupies it. This strength of lagna 
and 5th house made him a very jovial, amicable, cheerful and balanced person. 

On the other hand, lagna in Shivam's D-27 is in Cn. Lagna lord Moon is 
debilitated in the 5th house of emotions. This gives an unhappy spirit. The 5th 

house shows emotions and judgment and the 5th lord Mars is in Vi. The 8th 

lord (skepticism) Saturn has an aspect with him from Pi. This makes him 
skeptical and depressed. Mars in taamasik and analytical sign Vi, with an 
aspect with 8th lord, makes him seek rational explanations for everything. 
13.6   Conclusion 

In this chapter, we tried to recapitulate what we learnt in the previous 
chapters. A couple of examples were given to illustrate the process of 
interpreting charts. In the rest of the book, we will see many more examples. 



14. Topics Related to Longevity 

14.1 Introduction 
Many human beings are curious about how long they will live. An ethical 

astrologer will not scare a client by predicting death, but he may caution a 
client gently before critical periods and suggest some remedial measures to 
ward off an impending danger. An estimation of longevity is also helpful in 
matchmaking. After all, if one person will live for 81 years and the other 
only for 36 years, it is not advisable to approve a match between those two 
people. In matchmaking, it is desirable that the bridegroom and the bride 
have comparable longevity. 

In this chapter, we will study some basic tools that are used in longevity 
determination techniques. There are formulas for determining longevity, based 
on ashtakavarga. But they do not always work and they will not be covered 
in this book. We will cover the estimation of longevity based on natal chart 
and dasas. Though there are many dasas that help us in timing death, we 
will cover only Shoola dasa in this book. 
14.2 Marakas (Killers) 

Each chart has some rasis and planets that are called marakas (killers). 
Since death is an event relating to the physical existence, rasi chart is of 
utmost importance in seeing death. Rudramsa (D-11) shows the forces of 
death and destruction and it can also give insight into death. D-30 shows 
one's evils and punishment for the evils. Death can be a punishment for 
one's evils and so we should look at D-30 also. However, the most important 
chart is the rasi chart. 

The 3rd and 8th houses are the houses of life. The 3 rd house shows 
the vitality of one's existence and the 8th house shows the longevity. The 
12th house from any house shows losses related to the matters signified by 
that house. So the 12th house from these two houses shows death. So the 
2nd and 7th houses are the houses of death. For good longevity, the 3rd and 
8th houses and their lords should be strong and the 2nd and 7th houses and 
their lords should be weak. 

The rasis containing the 2nd and 7th houses are called maraka sthanas 
(killer stations). When we use rasi-ruled dasas that can show death, dasas 
of these rasis can bring death. Lords of the 2nd and 7th houses are called 
maraka grahas (killer planets). When we use planet-ruled dasas that can 
show death, dasas of these planets can bring death. 



156 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

There are other maraka grahas too. If a malefic planet powerfully 
conjoins or aspects, using graha drishti, the 2nd and 7th houses or their lords, 
then it qualifies as a maraka graha. Let us look at an example. Suppose 
lagna is in Le, Saturn is in Sg and Mars is in Ge. Then Saturn is a maraka on 
account of owning the 7th house (Aq). Mars is a malefic and he is in Ge. He 
aspects the 2nd house (Vi, with the 4th house aspect) and the 7th lord (Saturn in 
Sg - with the 7th house aspect). Because of these two factors, Mars is a 
maraka. Let us take another example. Suppose lagna is in Pi, Mars is in Ge, 
Mercury is in Cp and Saturn is in Ar. On account of owning the 2nd and 7th 

houses, Mars and Mercury are marakas. Look at Saturn. He is in the 2nd 

house and aspects the 2nd lord Mars (with the 3 rd house aspect) and the 7th 

lord Mercury (with the 10th house aspect). So Saturn is also a maraka and 
he may in fact be a stronger maraka than Mars and Mercury. 

When we time one's death using a dasa, we should look for the 
involvement of maraka sthanas and maraka grahas. We can also use marakas 
when timing death using the transits of planets. 
14.3   Rudra, Trishoola and Maheswara 

In Indian mythology, there are eleven Rudras. They are all different 
forms of Lord Shiva. They bring suffering and death to a native. Trishoola 
or trident is the weapon of Lord Shiva. Maheswara is the Supreme form of 
Lord Shiva and he gives emancipation to the soul. 

For every person, there are eleven rasis that represent the eleven Rudras. 
These rasis bring suffering related to various areas of life. 

Out of all the eleven Rudras, the one who brings suffering to the physical 
self is the most important one. In each chart, there is one planet that plays 
this role. That planet is simply called "Rudra". That planet stands for the 
suffering and destruction of the native. There are three rasis designated as 
Trishoola rasis and they bring death. Let us see the astrological 
defintions. 

Table 32: Eighth House for Rudra Calculation 
 

Rasi Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
The 8th Sc Ge Cp Sg Cn Aq Ta Sg Cn Ge Cp Le 
house 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 157 

Rudra 
Consider the lord of the 8th house from (i) lagna and (ii) the 7th house. 

Find the 8th house using Table 32 and not in the normal way50. The stronger 
of the two planets becomes Rudra. If the weaker planet is afflicted, it can 
also become Rudra. We say that a planet is stronger if it conjoins more 
planets. If both planets conjoin the same number of planets, a planet in 
exaltation or own rasi is stronger. A planet joining exalted planets is stronger. 
A planet aspected by many planets (rasi aspect) is stronger. Finally, a planet 
which is more advanced in its rasi is stronger. We find the stronger planet in 
this manner and it becomes Rudra. However, if the weaker planet is debilitated 
or in an inimical sign and conjoined/aspected by malefics like Mars, Saturn, 
Rahu and Ketu, then it becomes Rudra. 
Trishoola Rasis 

The three trines from the rasi occupied by Rudra in rasi chart represent 
the three spikes of Shiva's Trishoola/trident. They are called Trishoola rasis. 
Depending on whether a native has short life or middle life or long life, one 
of the three Trishoola rasis kills the native during its Shoola dasa. 
Maheswara 

The lord of the 8th house from AK (chara atma karaka) is called 
Maheswara. AK stands for the soul and the 8th lord from him stands for the 
liberation of soul. He represents the channels through which one's soul 
strives for liberation. 

There are a couple of exceptions: 
(1) If the 8th lord from AK is in own rasi or exaltation rasi, then take the 

stronger of the 8th and 12th lords from him. Suppose AK is Mars and he is 
in Ge. Then the 8th house from AK is Cp and Saturn is Maheswara. 
Now let us say that Saturn is exalted in Li. From Saturn (Li), Venus 
owns the 8th house (Ta) and Mercury owns the 12th house (Vi). The 
stronger of Mercury and Venus becomes Maheswara. 

(2) If Rahu or Ketu joins AK or the 8th from him, then we find the 6th lord 
from AK instead of the 8th lord. Please note that this is equivalent to 
taking the 8th lord in the anti-zodiacal order. Suppose AK is Mars and 
he is in Taurus. Then Sg is the 8th house from Mars and Jupiter, lord of 
Sg, becomes Maheswara. Now, suppose Ketu is in Ta or Sg. Because 

50 For odd rasis, we count houses zodiacally. For even rasis, we count houses anti-
zodiacally. For Brahma and Vishnu rasis, we use the regular motion. For Shiva rasis, 
we use Shiva's motion. That is how Table 32 is constructed. Shiva's rasis and Shiva's 
motion will be discussed in "Narayana Dasa". 



158 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

of Ketu's presence, we find the 6th house from Mars instead of the 8th house. 
It is Li. Venus owns it and he becomes Maheswara. (3) If Rahu becomes 
Maheswara. we take Mercury instead. If Ketu becomes Maheswara, we 
take Jupiter instead. 
14.4 The Method of Three Pairs 

This method allows us to determine the approximate range of one's 
longevity. In this method, we look at 3 pairs of planets/mathematical points. 
In each pair, we look at the two planets and see if they occupy a movable or 
fixed or dual rasi. Using Table 33, we look at the longevity category 
corresponding to the combination. 
(1) Lagna lord and 8th lord (find the 8th house and its lord using Table 32) 
(2) Moon and Saturn 
(3) Lagna and Horalagna (HL) 

Table 33: Longevity Category for Each Pair 
 

Combination 1 Combination 2 Result 
Fixed + Dual Movable + Movable Long life 
Movable + Fixed Dual + Dual Middle life 
Movable + Dual Fixed + Fixed Short life 

Long life means 72-108 years. Middle life means 36-72 years. Short life 
means 0-36 years. We learnt how to find the longevity category corresponding 
to each pair. Now, we should learn how the results of the three pairs can be 
combined for one final result. 

If all the three pairs result in the same longevity category, that will be the 
combined classification. If two pairs give one result and the third pair gives 
a different result, then the result given by two pairs dominates. Parasara 
gave further hints regarding this case and suggested finding the maximum 
longevity (paramaayush) of a person using Table 34. 

Table 34: Paramaayush Reckoner 
 

Two Pairs Short life Middle life Long life 
Third Pair 
Short life 32 years 64 years 96 years 
Middle life 36 years 72 years 108 years 
Long life 40 years 80 years 120 years 

If all the three pairs give three different results (i.e. one giving short life, 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 159 

one giving middle life and one giving long life), then we should give preference 
to the third pair of lagna and horalagna. However, if Moon is in lagna or the 
7th house, then the second pair of Moon and Saturn should be given 
preference. 
Example 47: Let us say that lagna is in Ta, HL is in Ar, Moon is in Ta, 
Mercury is in Cn, Venus is in Cp, and Saturn is in Ge. 
Pair 1: Lagna lord Venus is in Cp, a movable rasi. The 8th house is in Ge 
(see Table 32) and Mercury owns it. He is in Cn, another movable rasi. 
Looking for the combination "Movable + Movable" in the table, we see that 
"long life" is the result. 
Pair 2: Moon is in Ta, a fixed rasi. Saturn is in Ge, a dual rasi. Looking for 
the combination "Fixed + Dual" in the table, we see that "long life" is the 
result. 
Pair 3: Lagna in Ta, a fixed rasi. Horalagna is in Ar, a movable rasi. Looking 
for the combination "Movable + Fixed" in the table, we see that "middle 
life" is the result. 

We see that two pairs indicate long life and one pair indicates middle 
life. So "long life" dominates and the native has long life. Using Table 34, 
we see that the paramaayush for this case is 108 years. 
14.5 The Eighth Lord Method 

Parasara and Jaimini prescribed another method for estimating the 
longevity category. Find the stronger of lagna and 7th house and take it as 
the reference. Find the 8th lord from it and see where he is placed from it. If 
he is in a quadrant, long life is indicated. If he is in a panaphara, middle life 
is indicated. If he is in an apoklima, short life is indicated. 
Example 48: Let us say that lagna is in Ar and Li is stronger than Ar. Then 
we take Li as the reference. The 8th lord is Venus. If Venus is in Li, Cp, Ar 
or Cn (i.e. a quadrant from Li), it shows long life. If Venus is in Sc, Aq, Ta 
or Le (i.e. a panaphara from Li), it shows middle life. If Venus is in Sg, Pi, 
Ge or Vi (i.e. an apoklima from Li), it shows short life. 
Exercise 23: Consider the rasi chart shown in Chart 8. Identify the maraka 
planets in this chart. Find Rudra, Trishoolas and Maheswara. Finally estimate 
the longevity category of the native using the method of three pairs and the 
eighth lord method. 

14.6 Conclusion 
The definitions and methods given in this chapter will be useful in timing 

death using dasas. The two methods of outlined here for determining the 



160 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

longevity category are not infallible. There are some exceptions not covered 
in this book. So one should not be biased by these calculations. 

It is worthwhile to emphasize once more that this knowledge should not 
be misused for fame or for scaring clients. One should only gently caution 
clients and prescribe remedial measures. Sages have warned that one 
misusing the knowledge of astrology will live in misery and distress. 
14.7 Answer to Exercise 
Exercise 23: 
Marakas: Jupiter and Venus own the 2nd and 7th houses. Rahu is in the 7th 

house. These three planets are the main marakas. Mercury owns 8th and 
joins Jupiter and Venus. So he may also be considered a maraka. 
Rudra & Trishoola: The 8th house from lagna is Sg (see Table 32) and its 
lord is Jupiter. The 8th house from Ta (the 7th house) is Ge and its lord is 
Mercury. Mercury is stronger, as he is more advanced in his rasi. He is 
Rudra. Rudra is in Libra. So Trishoola (Destroyer Shiva's trident) has spikes 
in Ge, Li and Aq. 
Maheswara: Mercury is AK. The 8th from him is Ta. The 8th from him has 
Rahu. So we take the 6th from Li and get Pi. Its lord Jupiter is Maheswara. 
Method of Three pairs: Lagna lord and 8th lord show middle life 
(fixed+movable). Moon and Saturn show middle life (fixed+movable). Lagna 
and horalagna show short life (fixed+fixed). So the longevity category is 
"middle life" (36-72 years). The native died at the age of 50 years. 
The Eighth Lord Method: Lagna is stronger than the 7th house. So let us 
take Sc as the reference. The 8th lord from it is Mercury. He is in an apoklima 
from Sc (12th). So the result is "short life". This method did not work here. 



15. Strength of Planets and Rasis 

15.1 Introduction 
When judging the results given by houses and planets, we have to judge 

their strength. Sometimes we have to compare the strength of two planets 
and see which one will dominate. For example, when finding the arudha 
pada of a house falling in Scorpio, we learnt that we have to take the stronger 
of Mars and Ketu as the lord of Scorpio. In several rasi dasas, dasas start 
from the stronger of lagna and the 7th house. We need to be able to compare 
them and judge which is stronger. A house may be influenced by several 
planets and they may suggest contradictory results. In such a case, we 
need to decide which influence dominates. 

There are different ways of measuring the strengths of planets and 
rasis for different purposes. We will learn some of them in this section. 
15.2 Why Different Strengths 

Why do we need different strengths for different purposes? Why can't 
we use the same strength? To understand this, let us consider an analogy. 

Suppose X is an engineer. Suppose Y is another engineer with exactly 
the same background and suppose Y comes to the house of X for a few 
days. Suppose Y sleeps in the afternoon and X doesn't. Suppose it is 1 pm 
and Y is ready for his afternoon nap. Suppose the two engineers have 
promised a charity in town that they would give a big donation together and 
suppose someone from the charity comes to X's house. Because it is not his 
house and because he is sleepy, Y is probably not going to play a prominent 
role and X is probably going to talk pleasantries and then give a cheque on 
behalf of Y and himself. The money is both his and Y's, but X is in a better 
position to handle it. Shadbalas are similar to this. When two or more planets 
take part in a yoga, the one that is stronger as per shadbala ends up giving 
the results. 

Both X and Y may have to deal with contractors, workers and vendors 
for their professional work. If Y has better relations with the people he 
deals with, he will be more productive at his work as an engineer. Similarly, 
strength as per ashtakavarga shows the ability of planets to deliver their 
goods in harmony with other planetary forces at work in a chart. Even if a 
planet has good shadbala, it will be unable to deliver its goods if it is at odds 
with other planets in the chart, i.e. has a low ashtakavarga strength. 

An engineer who has good relations with workers, vendors and 
contractors related to one project may not go along well with people involved 



162 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

in another project. In that case, he will produce excellent results in the 
former project and he may not be effective in the latter. Similarly, a planet 
may have good ashtakavarga strength in one divisional chart and poor 
ashtakavarga strength in another divisional chart. Then it will give its results 
more effectively in the area of life related to the first chart. 

Despite good capabilities and potential to get work done, Y may be 
unable to get his work done if he is depressed about something or if he is 
absent-minded for some reason. If he is in a cheerful state, he may get his 
work done well. Thus the state one is in decides one's final output. Similarly, 
a planet must be in a good "avastha'" (state) to give good results. There are 
different kinds of states - states related to age, states related to alertness, 
states related to mood and states related to activity. 

When one hires an engineer as an employee or when one assigns a 
project to an engineer, one is concerned about how effective he will be in 
the project. But suppose one is considering the same engineer as a partner 
in business. Then his effectiveness in a particular project does not matter 
much. What matters now is how well rounded he is. He should have good 
overall knowledge of various projects. Vimsopaka bala is analogous to this. 
When we consider the overall effectiveness of a planet in one's life, we no 
longer look at its effectiveness to give results in a specific area of life. 
Instead, we look at Vimsopaka bala. It shows the overall strength of a 
planet and its ability to play an important role in one's life (rather than a 
specific area of life). 

If X and Y have to decide who eats a cake first or who gets to drink the 
only can of soft drink left in the refrigerator, they are probably not going to 
argue about it. Their qualifications or productivity at work or mental state or 
overall ability are not going to matter. For something so trivial, they will 
probably toss a coin or have a friendly arm-wrestling or simply do what 
their friends present in the room suggest. If Y has more friends in the room 
and they say "let Y have it", then Y is going to have it. Similarly, for trivial 
things like determining who initiates dasas, antardasas etc, we have very 
simple rules that are different from shadbala, ashtakavarga bala, avastha 
bala, Vimsopaka bala etc. 

As it has been emphasized many times in this book, Vedic astrology has 
a rich variety of parameters, tools and techniques. Attempting to use various 
techniques in an interchangable manner only leads to confusion. One should 
strive to understand the meanings of various parameters and tools and use 
the right set of parameters and tools for the occasion. Though we have 
different ways of measuring a planet's strength, their meanings are different 
and accordingly they are used for different purposes. We will learn the 
most common ones in this chapter. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 163 

15.3 Shadbala and Astakavarga Bala 
There are six sources of strength - strength due to placement, strength 

due to time, strength due to directions, strength due to aspects, strength due 
to motion and strength due to inherent nature. Shadbala is a measure of the 
strength of a planet based on these six sources of strength. Explaining the 
computation of shadbalas is beyond the scope of this book. For the details 
of its computation, one may refer to "Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram" by 
Parasara or "Graha and Bhava Balas" by Dr. B.V. Raman. Most computer 
software programs give shadbala, though there are minor differences 
between the definitions used by them. 

When two or planets influence the same house or when they participate 
in a yoga, then the planet with the highest shadbala is the most likely give 
the results. The planet with the strongest shadbala is like a group leader 
who acts on the group's behalf. 

On the other hand, ashtakavarga bala shows how other planets support 
or oppose a planet. It does not show how capable the planet is of leading 
and giving the results of a group of planets, unlike shadbala. It shows how 
capable a planet is of giving its own results, in harmony with other planetary 
forces. 
15.4 Avasthas (States) 

Avastha literally means "state". There are different possible states of a 
planet and we will learn them in this section. 
15.4.1 State Related to Age 

One of the states of a planet has to do with its age. Just as a 10-year old 
child or an 80-year old man have their limitations and cannot execute 
certain tasks efficiently, a planet in childhood or old age may not be very 
effective. 

Table 35: Avasthas related to age 
 

In odd rasis In even rasis Avastha Meaning Results 

0°-6° 24°-30° Saisava Child Quarter 
6°-12° 18°-24° Kumaara Adolescent Half 
12°-18° 12°-18° Yuva Youth Full 
18°-24° 6°-12° Vriddha Old Some 
24°-30° 0°-6° Mrita Dead None 



164 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

A planet at 23° in Cn will be in Kumaara avastha (adolescence) and it 
will give half of its results. A planet at 19° in Li will be in Vriddha avastha 
(old age) and it will not be very effective. A planet at 14° in Sg will be in 
Yuva avastha (young age) and it will give all of its results. A planet at 27° in 
Pi will be at Saisava avastha (childhood) and it will give one quarter of its 
results. 

One should not be carried away with these avasthas. Just as there are 
some child prodigies and wizards with wrinkles, a planet can give good 
results irrespective of its age-related state. Age is just one of the factors 
deciding a person's productivity. Similarly, age-related state is just one of 
the factors deciding a planet's effectiveness. 
15.4.2 State Related to Alertness 

We have 3 alertness-related states of planets: 
(1) A planet in its exaltation rasi or an own rasi is said to be in "Jaagrita" 

avastha (awake). It gives full results. 
(2) A planet in a rasi owned by a neutral or friendly planet is said to be in 

"Swapna" avastha (dreaming). It gives medium results. 
(3) A planet in its debilitation rasi or a rasi owned by an enemy is said to be 

in "Sushupta" avastha (asleep). The results it gives are negligible. 
15.4.3 State Related to Attitude and Mood 

We have 9 states of planets that are related to attitude and mood : 
(1) A planet in its exaltation rasi is said to be in "Deepta" avastha (bright). 
(2) A planet in its own rasi is said to be in "Swastha" avastha (doing well, 

contented, comfortable, natural). 
(3) A planet in a good friend's rasi is said to be in "Mudita" avastha 

(delighted). 
(4) A planet in a friend's rasi is said to be in "Saanta" avastha (peaceful). 
(5) A planet in a neutral planet's rasi is said to be in "Deena" avastha (sad, 

depressed). 
(6) A planet in an enemy's rasi is said to be in "Dukhita" avastha (distressed, 

miserable). 
(7) A planet joined by malefic planets is said to be in "Vikala" avastha 

(crippled, confused). 
(8) A planet in a malefic planet's rasi is said to be in "Khala" avastha 

(mischievous, scheming). 
(9) A planet joined closely by Sun is said to be in "Kopita" avastha (angry). 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 165 

We have 6 additional states of planets that are related to attitude and 
mood: 
(1) A planet in the 5th house joined by Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu is 

said to be in "Lajjita" avastha (ashamed). 
(2) A planet in its exaltation rasi or moolatrikona rasi is said to be in "Garvita" 

avastha (proud). 
(3) A planet is in an enemy's rasi or conjoined by enemies or aspected by 

enemies or conjoined by Saturn, it is said to be in "Kshudhita" avastha 
(hungry). 

(4) A planet stationed in a watery rasi and aspected by enemies without 
the aspect of benefics is said to be in "Trishita" avastha (thirsty). 

(5) A planet in a friend's sign, conjoined or aspected by friends and conjoined 
by Jupiter, is said to be in "Mudita" avastha (delighted). 

(6) A planet conjoined by Sun and aspected by malefics or enemies is said 
to be in "Kshobhita" avastha (shaken, agitated). 
Planets give results based on the state they are in. If a house contains 

planets in Kshudhita or Kshobhita avasthas, the significations of the house 
are affected. If a planet in the 5th house is in Lajjita avastha, there may be 
losses related to progeny. If a planet in the 7th house is in Kshobhita avastha, 
there may be loss of spouse. 
15.4.4 States Relates to Activity 

There are 12 possible states of a planet related to its activity. This state 
is the most important of all states. For each planet, we use the following 
formula to find its avastha. 

Suppose C is the number of the constellation occupied by the planet (1 
for Aswini, 2 for Bharani and so on). Suppose P is the index of the planet 
whose avastha we are finding (1 for Sun, 2 for Moon). Suppose A is the 
index of the amsa (navamsa) occupied by the planet in its rasi51. Suppose 
M is the constellation occupied by Moon. Suppose G is the ghati running at 
birth.52 Suppose L is the rasi occupied by lagna (1 for Ar, 2 for Ta and so 
on). Then we compute (C X P x A) + M + G + L, divide it by 12 and take the 

51 For example, let us say Mercury is in 22Ge14. Each navamsa has a length of 3 °20' 
(1/9 of30°)and 22°14' in Ge is in the 7 navamsa of Ge (please note that we are not 
talking about the rasi occupied by the planet in navamsa). Then we use A = 7 for 
Mercury. 

52 Suppose sunrise was at 6 am and someone was born at 11 pm. So 17 hours were over. 
Each hour has 2.5 ghatis and 17 hours =17x2.5= 42.5. So the 43rd ghati was running 
at birth. 



166 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

remainder. Using the resulting number as the avastha index and referring to 
Table 36. we find out the avastha of the planet. 

Table 36: Sayanaadi Avasthas 
 

Avastha Avastha name Meaning 
Index 

1 Sayana Lying down, resting 
2 Upavesana Sitting down 
3 Netrapaani Eyes and hands 
4 Prakaasana Shining 
5 Gamana Going (on the move) 
6 Aagamana Coming, returning 
7 Sabhaa (Sabhaa vasati) Being at an assembly 
8 Aagama Coming/Acquiring 
9 Bhojana Eating 

10 Nriyalipsaa Longing to dance 
11 Kautuka Being eager 
12 Nidraa Sleeping 

After we find the avastha index, we can multiply it with itself and add 
the number corresponding to the first sound in the first syllable of the name, 
as found from Table 37. We can take the remainder when that number is 
divided by 12. Then we can add a planetary adjustment to the remainder. 
We use 5 for Sun and Jupiter, 2 for Moon and Mars, 3 for Mercury, Venus 
and Saturn and 4 for Rahu and Ketu. We divide the sum by 3 and take the 
remainder. This gives the strength of the activity. A value of 1 means "drishti" 
and medium results. A value of 2 means "cheshta" and full results. A value 
of 3 (or 0) means "vicheshta" and gives very little results. Based on the 
activity-related state of a planet, we can guess the results given by it. Based 
on whether it is in Cheshta, Drishti or Vicheshta, the results will be full, 
medium or little. An example will clarify this computation.

Example 49: Let us take a native born at 5:50 pm (IST) on 4th April 1970 
at Machilipatnam, India (81E12, 16N15). Let us find the activity-related 



/ 
/172 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

states of Mercury. Jupiter and Venus for this native. The native's given 
name starts with "V". 

Moon is in Poorvabhadrapada, i.e. the 25th constellation. So M = 25. 
The native was born at 5:50 pm and sunrise was at 6 am. So 11:50 hours 
passed since sunrise. In minutes, this is 710 minutes. Because a ghati contains 
24 minutes, this is 29.6 ghatis. So the 30lh ghati after sunrise was running at 
birth. So G = 30. Lagna is in Virgo, the 6th rasi from Aries and so L = 6. The 
native's given name starts with "V" and the number corresponding to this 
sound is 1. 

Mercury: Mercury is at 3Ar08. He is in Aswini, i.e. 1st constellation. So 
C = 1. Because Mercury is the 4th planet from Sun, P = 4. Mercury is in the 
first 1/9th of Ar and so A = 1. Using the formula, we get (C X P x A) + M + 
G + L = ( l x 4 x l )  + 25 + 30 + 6 = 65. Dividing it by 12, we get a remainder 
of 5. From Table 36, we see that an avastha index of 5 means "Gamana" 
avastha (going/on the move). We see that 5 x 5 is 25. Adding 1 (corresponding 
to the sound), we get 26. Remainder when this is divided by 12 is 2. Adding 
3 (Mercury's planetary adjustment), we get 5. When we divide it by 3, 
remainder is 2. It shows "Cheshta". So Mercury's results due to "Gamana" 
avastha are given in full. We see that the standard results are "visits the 
courts of kings frequently, wealthy". 

Jupiter. Jupiter is at 9Li46. He is in Swaati, i.e. 15th constellation. So 
C = 15. Because Jupiter is the 5th planet from Sun, P = 5. Jupiter is in the 
third l/9th of Li and so A = 3. Using the formula, we get (C x P x A) + M + 
G + L = (15 X 5 X 3) + 25 + 30 + 6 = 286. Dividing it by 12, we get a 
remainder of 10. From Table 36, we see that an avastha index of 10 means 
"Nriyalipsaa" avastha (urge for dance). We see that 10 x 10 is 100. Adding 
1 (corresponding to the sound), we get 101. Remainder when this is divided 
by 12 is 5. Adding 5 (Jupiter's planetary adjustment), we get 10. When we 
divide it by 3, remainder is 1. It shows "Drishti". So Jupiter's results due to 
"Nriyalipsaa" avastha are given only to a medium extent. We see that the 
standard results are: "honored by kings, wealthy, learned in dharma sastra 
and tantra, revered by powerful men, respected by learned men, a scholar 
and faultless in grammar and etymology'". 

Venus: Venus is at 7Ar55. He is in Aswini, i.e. 1st constellation. SoC = 
1. Because Venus is the 6th planet from Sun, P = 6. Venus is in the third 1/9 th 
of Ar and so A = 3. Using the formula, we get (C X P X A) + M + G + L = 
(1 X 6 x 3) + 25 + 30 + 6 = 79. Dividing it by 12, we get a remainder of 7. 
From Table 36, we see that an avastha index of 7 means "Sabhaa" avastha 
(assemby/council). We see that 7 x 7 is 49. Adding 1 (corresponding to the 
sound), we get 50. Remainder when this is divided by 12 is 2. Adding 3 
(planetary adjustment of Venus), we get 5. When we divide it by 3, remainder 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 173 

is 2. It shows "Cheshta". So Venus's results due to "Sabhaa" avastha are 
given in full. We see that the standard results are "eminent in a king's court, 
virtuous, destroyer of enemies, wealthy and charitable". 
Exercise 24: Consider a gentleman born at 8:30 am (LMT) on 8th November 
1927 at 67E03, 24N52. Find the activity-related states of Sun, Mars and 
Jupiter and interpret them. His name starts with the sound "L". 
Importance of Sayanaadi Avasthas: 

Sayanaadi (Sayana etc) avasthas are the most important of all avasthas. 
In addition to the results listed above, Parasara listed some special results. 
If a benefic is in Sayana avastha, the house benefits from his presence. If a 
malefic is in Nidraa avastha in the 7th house without the conjunction or 
aspect of another malefic, it is auspicious. If a malefic is in Bhojana avastha, 
the house containing it is destroyed. If a malefic is in the 5th house in Sayana 
or Nidraa avastha, it is auspicious. If a malefic is in the 8th house in Sayana 
or Nidraa avastha, it brings death by royal wrath. If a malefic occupies the 
10th house in Bhojana or Sayana avastha, all kinds of miseries may be 
expected. If a benefic or a planet in own or exaltation rasi occupies in the 
1st, 5th, 7th or 10th house in Prakasana, Nrityalipsaa or Kautuka avasthas, it 
brings Raja Yoga. Parasara specifically mentioned Moon in the 10th house 
in Kautuka or Prakaasana avasthas. 

However, one should not be carried away with avasthas and one 
should remember that they are only the "states" of the planet. The state of 
a planet related to age, alertness, mood and activity will have a role in the 
results given by it, but the houses influenced by it in various divisional charts 
are more important in deciding the results. We should avoid the temptation 
to make predictions based on thumbrules and look-up tables. 
15.5 Other Simple Strengths 

15.5.1 Stronger Co-Lord 
When we find the arudha pada of a house falling in Scorpio or Aquarius, 

we need to find the stronger of Mars & Ketu (co-lords of Sc) and Saturn & 
Rahu (co-lords of Aq). The stronger lord acts its lord and decides the arudha 
pada. The stronger lord of Sc (or Aq) is also used in finding the duration of 
its dasa in many rasi dasas (e.g. Narayana dasa). 

Basic rule: If one of the co-lords is in the rasi, take the other planet. For 
example, if Saturn is in Aq and Rahu is in a rasi other than Aq, Rahu becomes 
the primary lord of Aq. If not, we find the stronger of the 2 planets and the 
stronger planet becomes the primary lord. 

The stronger planet of two planets is determined using the following 



174 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

rules. We go from one rule to the next, only if we do not have a winner. If 
we have a winner in one step, we do not go through the remaining steps. 
(1) If one planet is joined by more planets than the other, it is stronger. 

Suppose Saturn is in Pi with Mars and Sun and Rahu is in Ar with 
Jupiter. Then Saturn is stronger than Rahu, because he is with 2 planets 
and Rahu is only with one planet. So Saturn becomes the primary lord 
of Aq. 

(2) We find how many of the following planets conjoin/aspect a planet: (1) 
Jupiter, (2) Mercury, and, (3) dispositor. A planet conjoined/aspected by 
more of these 3 planets is stronger. We must use rasi aspects here. 
Suppose Saturn is in Ge with Mercury, Rahu is in Ar, Mars is in Le, 
Jupiter is in Ta. Saturn is conjoined by Mercury and his dispositor (who 
is Mercury again). His count is 2. Rahu in Ar is aspected by Mars, his 
dispositor, from Le. Neither Jupiter nor Mercury aspects or conjoins 
Rahu. So Rahu's count of 1 loses to Saturn's count of 2 and Saturn is 
the stronger planet. He becomes the lord of Aq. 

(3) If one planet is exalted and the other not, then the exalted planet is 
stronger. Suppose Saturn is in Li and Rahu is in Cn, with the same 
number of planets. Suppose we have a tie after step (2). Then we note 
that Saturn is exalted in Li and declare him as the stronger planet. He 
becomes the primary lord of Aq. 

(4) If we have a tie after (3), we consider the natural strength of the rasi 
containing the planet. Dual rasis are stronger than fixed rasis and fixed 
rasis are stronger than movable rasis. Suppose Mars is in Ge and Ketu 
is in Aq and we have a tie between them after step (3). Then we 
declare Mars as the stronger planet and the primary lord of Sc, because 
he is in a dual rasi and Ketu is in a fixed rasi. 

(5) (a) When finding dasa duration: If we have a tie after (4), we take 
the planet giving a larger length for dasa. Suppose Saturn is in Ge and 
Rahu is in Vi and suppose we have a tie after (4). Suppose we want to 
find the stronger lord for Narayana dasa. Rahu in Vi gives 5 years and 
Saturn in Ge gives 8 years53. So Saturn is used instead of Rahu. 
(b) When finding the lord for arudha padas etc: If we have a tie after 
(4), we take the planet that is more advanced in its rasi. We measure the 
advancement of Rahu and Ketu from the end of the rasi. Suppose 
Mars is at 23Lil7 and Ketu is at 5Cn54. Suppose we have a tie after 
(4). Advancement of Mars in Li is 23° 17'. Advancement of Ketu from 

53 We will learn the computation of dasa years in Narayana dasa later. 



Part 1: Chart Analysis 175 

the end of Cn is 30° - 5°54' = 24°6'. Because Ketu is more advanced. 
Ketu is stronger than Mars and becomes the primary lord of Sc. 

Exercise 25: Find the primary lord of Aq and Sc in Chart 12 for the purpose 
of arudha padas. 
15.5.2 Stronger Rasi 
When computing rasi dasas, we sometimes need to find the strongest rasi 
out of 2 or 3 or 4 rasis. In this book, we will mainly use Narayana dasa and 
we will only need to compare the strengths of 2 rasis. To conclude that one 
rasi is stronger than another rasi for the purpose of rasi dasas, we use the 
following rules. We use the same rules for finding the stronger rasi owned 
by a planet, when computing its graha arudha. We go from one rule to the 
next only if there is no winner after the rule. When we have a winner, we 
stop and do not go to the next rule. 
(1) If one rasi contains more planets than the other rasi, then it is stronger. 

Suppose we are comparing the strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose Ar 
contains Saturn and Jupiter and Li contains Venus. Then Ar is stronger, 
as it contains more planets. 

(2) We find how many of the following planets occupy/aspect a rasi: (1) 
Jupiter, (2) Mercury, and, (3) the rasi's lord. A rasi occupied/aspected 
by more of these 3 planets is stronger. We must use rasi aspects here. 
Suppose we are comparing the strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose Jupiter 
is in Ar, Mercury and Venus are in Ta and Mars is in Vi. Then Ar is 
occupied by Jupiter and not by the other two (Mercury and lord Mars). 
Its count is 1. Li is aspected by two (Mercury and lord Venus) and only 
Jupiter doesn't aspect it (we are using rasi aspects). So Li's count of 2 
beats Ar's count of 1 and Li is stronger than Ar. 

(3) If one rasi contains an exalted planet and the other does not, then the 
former rasi is stronger. Suppose we are comparing the strengths of Ar 
and Li. Suppose Saturn and Mercury are in Li and Jupiter and Venus 
are in Ar. Suppose we have a tie between Ar and Li after rule (2). 
Then we note that Saturn is exalted in Li and declare Li as the stronger 
rasi. 

(4) A rasi whose lord is in a rasi with a different oddity (odd/even) is stronger 
than a rasi whose lord is in a rasi with the same oddity. Suppose we are 
comparing the strengths of Ar and Li and we have a tie after rule (3). 
Suppose Venus is in Cn, an even rasi and Mars is in Le, an odd rasi. 
Both Ar and Li are odd rasis. Because the lord of Li is in an even rasi 
(i.e. a rasi with a different oddity) and the lord of Ar is in an odd rasi 
(i.e. a rasi with the same oddity), Li is stronger. 



176 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

NOTE: If we have a tie upto rule (3) when finding the stronger rasi 
owned by a planet for computing its graha arudha, this rule will surely 
resolve the tie, because the two rasis owned by each planet have a 
different oddity. So one of them will have the lord in a rasi with a different 
oddity. 

(5) If we have a tie after rule (4), we use the natural strength of rasis. Dual 
rasis are stronger than fixed rasis and fixed rasis are stronger than 
movable rasis. This rule is not useful in Narayana dasa, because we 
always compare a rasi and the 7th from it. If a rasi is dual/fixed/movable, 
the 7th from it is also of the same type. However, this rule is useful in 
some other dasas. 

(6) If we have a tie after rule (5), we look at the longitudes of the lords of 
the two rasis. We measure the advancement of each planet from the 
beginning of the rasi occupied by it (from the end of the rasi in the case 
of Rahu and Ketu) and compare them. The rasi owned by the planet 
with the higher advancement is stronger. Suppose we are comparing 
the strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose we have a tie after rule (5). Suppose 
Mars is at 23Gel7 and Venus is at 19Le51. Advancement of Mars 
(lord of Ar) in his rasi is 23° 17. Advancement of Venus (lord of Li) in 
his rasi is 19°51'. Because Mars is more advanced, his Ar is stronger 
than Li. 
NOTE: In the case of Aq and Sc, we use the stronger lord. For Rahu and 
Ketu, advancement in rasi is measured from the end of the rasi. If 
Rahu is at 9Sc34, his advancement in Sc is 30° - 9°34' = 20°26'. 

Exercise 26: Consider Chart 12. Identify the stronger rasi from each pair 
below: 
(1) Ar & Li, (2) Ta & Sc, (3) Ge & Sg, (4) Cn & Cp, (5) Le & Aq, and, (6) 
Vi & Pi. 

Warning: The above rules are too general. One should understand the 
meaning of each rule and adapt based on the situation. For example, aspect 
of Mercury, Jupiter and lord is important for Narayana dasa and other phalita 
dasas. In ayur dasas that show longevity, aspect of luminaries (Sun and 
Moon) are important. Aspect of all other planets is equally important. There 
is no significance for the aspect of lord. In dasas based on AK (e.g. 
Atmakaraka kendradi graha/rasi dasas), the sign containing AK is stronger 
than any other rasi. After we check for the aspects of Mercury, Jupiter and 
rasi lord, we should look at the placement of rasi lord from AK. A rasi who 
lord is in a quadrant from AK is stronger than a rasi whose lord is in a 
panaphara from AK. These rules, however, are not applicable to all dasas.

15.6  Anwers to Exercises 
Exercise 24: 

Sun is in "Sabhaa" avastha and his strength is "Cheshta". His results 
are "helps others, possesses wealth, gems and lands, virtuous, very strong, 
affectionate and kind". They are given in full. 

Mars is in "Nidraa" avastha and his strength is "Drishti". His results 
are "angry, unintelligent, poor, wicked, fallen from the virtuous path, sick" 
and they are given to a medium degree. 

Jupiter is in "Aagama" avastha and his strength is "Cheshta". His results 
are "many conveyances, comforts, honors, servants, happiness from progeny, 
knowledge, friends, learning and noble path" and they are given in full. 
Exercise 25: 

Rahu is alone and so is Saturn We have a tie after rule (1). Saturn is 
aspected by Mercury and not aspected/conjoined by Jupiter and his dispositor 
(Jupiter again). Rahu is aspected by Venus (his dispositor) and not aspected 
by Mercury and Jupiter. Both have a count of one and we have a tie after 
rule (2). Neither Saturn nor Rahu is exalted after rule (3). Now we use rule 
(4). Saturn is in a dual rasi and Rahu is in a movable rasi. So Saturn is 
stronger and he becomes the primary lord of Aq. 

Mars is in Sc and Ketu is elsewhere (in Ar). So we don't even have to 
go through the rules to find the stronger planet. We use the "basic rule" and 
declare Ketu as the primary lord of Sc. 
Exercise 26: 
(1) Ar and Li have one planet each. There is a tie in rule (1). Ar is aspected 

by Jupiter & lord Mars. Li is aspected only by lord Venus. Ar is stronger 
than Li, from rule (2). 

(2) Sc has 2 planets and Ta has 1. Sc is stronger than Ta, from rule (1). 
(3) Sg has 2 planets and Ge is empty. Sg is stronger than Ta, from rule (1). 
(4) Cp has 1 planet and Cn is empty. Cp is stronger than Cn, from rule (1). 
(5) Le and Aq are empty. There is a tie after rule (1). Le is not aspected by 

any of Jupiter, Mercury and lord Sun. Aq is aspected by co-lord Rahu 
(though Saturn is the primary/stronger lord, Rahu's aspect also counts). 
Aq is stronger than Le, from rule (2). 

(6) Pi has 1 planet and Vi is empty. Pi is stronger than Vi, from rule (1). 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 

One unique feature of Vedic astrology is its concept of "dasa" systems. 
Dasa means "a period". One's lifetime is divided into several periods, sub-
periods, sub-sub-periods and so on. These are ruled by different planets or 
rasis. Planets and rasis give their results in their respective periods and sub-
periods. Each dasa system has a specific use. The nature of results given 
by planets and rasis in their respective periods and sub-periods depends on 
the dasa system being used. 

There are many classifications of dasa systems: 
(1) Nakshatra dasas and Rasi dasas: Nakshatra dasas are based on 

Moon's nakshatra (constellation). Rasi dasas are based on rasis occupied 
by planets and dasas are owned by rasis in rasi dasas. 

(2) Phalita dasas and Ayur dasas: Phalita means results and ayur means 
longevity. Phalita dasas are used for general results and ayur dasas are 
used for predicting death. 
Hundreds of dasa systems were enumerated by the seers of Vedic 

astrologey. Specific uses of these dasa systems weren't clearly mentioned 
in classics. These are hidden in remote corners of India as family secrets. 

In this part, the use of the following dasa systems is explained in detail: 
• Vimsottari dasa: Nakshatra dasa (phalita/ayur) 
• Ashtottari dasa: Nakshatra dasa (ayur/phalita) 
• Narayana dasa: Rasi dasa (phalita - general) 
• Lagna Kendradi 

Rasi dasa: Rasi dasa (phalita - material fortune) 
• Sudasa: Rasi dasa (phalita - material fortune) 
• Drigdasa: Rasi dasa (phalita-spirituality) 
• Niryaana Shoola dasa: Rasi dasa (ayur) 
• Shoola dasa: Rasi dasa (ayur) 
• Kalachakra dasa: Nakshatra dasa (phalita) 
Sudarsana Chakra dasa is one of the most important dasas mentioned by 
Parasara. However, for reasons that will become clear later, we will learn it 
in the part "Tajaka Analysis". 



16. Vimsottari Dasa 

16.1 Introduction 
Vimsottari dasa is the most popular dasa system among Vedic astrologers 

of today. Sage Parasara mentions in "Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram" that 
this dasa system is the most suitable dasa system in Kali yuga. 

Vimsottari means 120. Vimsottari dasa is a dasa system where the total 
duration of the dasa cycle is 120 years. Dasas of different planets are for 
different number of years, but the sum of all dasas is 120 years. 

In Kali yuga, paramaayush (maximum longevity) of human beings is 
supposed to be 120 years. Consequently, Vimsottari dasa is the most suitable 
dasa in Kali yuga. 

Dasas are reckoned here based on the constellation occupied by Moon. 
There are other variations that are more applicable in some cases. Many 
contemporary Vedic astrologers ignore these variations and always reckon 
dasas from the lord of the constellation occupied by Moon. However, this 
may not result in the best predictions always. In this book, we will look at 
some of the variations. 

One's life is divided into dasas - periods - ruled by the nine planets. A 
dasa is also called a "mahadasa" (mahadasa = master period). Each 
mahadasa is again divided into 9 sub-periods ruled by 9 planets. These sub-
periods in mahadasas are called "antardasas". We can have further divisions. 
Sub-periods in antardasas are called "pratyantardasas". Sub-periods in 
pratyantardasas are called "sookshma-antardasas" or simply sookshma 
dasas. Sub-periods in sookshma dasas are called "prana-antardasas" or 
simply prana dasas. Sub-periods in prana dasas are called "deha-antardasas". 
In this book, we will denote mahadasa with MD, antardasa with AD, 
pratyantardasa with PD, sookshma dasa with SD, prana-antardasa with 
PAD and deha-antardasa with DAD. 
16.2 Dasa Computation 

The lengths of the dasas (periods) of various planets are given in Table 
38. The order of dasas is also as indicated in that table. For example, let us 
say that the first dasa is Sun's. It will be of 6 years. Then 10 years of Moon 
dasa will follow. Then 7 years of Mars dasa will follow. And so on. At the 
end of the table, we come back to the first entry. For example, let us say 
that the first dasa is of Jupiter. Then the order of dasas will be Jupiter, 
Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun (go back), Moon, Mars and Rahu. 



182 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Table 38: Vimsottari Dasa Lengths 
 

Planet Dasa length (in years) 
Sun 6 
Moon 10 
Mars 7 
Rahu 18 
Jupiter 16 
Saturn 19 
Mercury 17 
Ketu 7 
Venus 20 
Total 120 

In this manner, we can find the order of dasas and dasa lengths, given 
the first dasa. 

For computing Vimsottari dasa, use the following steps: 
(1) Find the constellation occupied by Moon. 
(2) Find the advancement of Moon in the constellation. 
(3) Find the part of the constellation that is yet to be traversed by Moon, as 

a fraction of the length of the constellation. [NOTE: Length of each 
constellation is 13°20'.] 

(4) First dasa will belong to the lord of the constellation. 
(5) Find the sequence of dasas and dasa lengths from Table 38. 
(6) Multiply the length of the first dasa by the fraction found in step (3). 

Only this amount in the first dasa is left at birth. The rest was over 
before birth. 

Controversy: Dasa length of each planet was given in years in Table 38. 
For example, Sun dasa is for 6 years. However, what is the meaning of "a 
year" here? Do we mean the normal solar year, i.e. 365.2425 days? Or, do 
we mean a savana year of 360 days that is used when finding the running 
year for calculating varsha bala (year strength) in shadbalas? Or, do we 
mean a period in which Moon traverses through 360 constellations? Or, do 
we mean a period of 360 tithis (luni-solar days)? Most scholars, including 
this author's guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, use solar years. However, this author 
prefers savana years based on the teachings of his father. Savana years 
will be used with nakshatra dasas in all the calculations given in this book. 
This is not meant to be a recommendation. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 183 

Example 50: Let us say someone was born at 5:50 am on 2000 April 28 
(time zone: 4 hours west of GMT). Moon is at 2°23' in Aq at the time of 
birth. 
(1) This is in the 3rd pada (quarter) of Dhanishtha constellation. Dhanishtha 

constellation starts at 23°20' in Cp and ends at 6°40' in Aq. 
(2) Moon's advancement in Dhanishtha = 2Aq23 - 23Cp20 = 32°23' -

23°20' = 9o3\ 
(3) The total length of the constellation is 13°20'. The length yet to be 

traversed in this constellation as a fraction of the total constellation 
length = (13o20'-9o3')/13o20' = 4°17/13°20' = (4x60+17)/(13x60+20) = 
257/800 = 0.32125. This is the fraction of the constellation yet to be 
traversed by Moon. 

(4) First dasa belongs to the lord of Dhanishtha. It is Mars. 
(5) Let us start from Mars. From Table 38, dasa sequence is: Mars (7 

years), Rahu (18 years), Jupiter (16 years), Saturn (19 years), Mercury 
(17 years), Ketu (7 years), Venus (20 years), Sun (6 years), Moon (10 
years). 

(6) First dasa needs a correction. Out of 7 years of Mars dasa, the amount 
left at birth = 7 x 0.32125 = 2.24875 years = 2 years 2 months 29 days 
33 ghatis. [NOTE: Ghati = l/60th of a day, i.e. 24 minutes.] 
The native was born at 5:50 am on 2000 April 28. We can get the end 

date of Mars dasa by adding 2 years 2 months 29 days 33 ghatis to it. We 
get about 7 pm on 2002 July 15. Mars dasa will be over then and Rahu dasa 
will start. We get Rahu dasa's end date by adding 18 years to this date. 
Similarly, we can find the start and end dates of all dasas. 
16.3   Antardasa Computation 

Each mahadasa is divided into 9 antardasas. Take the planet ruling the 
mahadasa. First antardasa will belong to the same planet and antardasas go 
in the same sequence as dasas. The complete length of the mahadasa is 
ditributed among antardasas in the ratio of mahadasa years of planets. 

For example, let us take Venus dasa of the native of Example 50. Venus 
dasa runs for 20 years. Antardasas in Venus dasa start from Venus and go 
in the order given in Table 38. So antardasa order in Venus dasa is — 
Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and Ketu. Length 
of Venus antardasa is 20/120 of the total dasa length, i.e. 20*20/120 years 
= 3 years and 4 months. Length of Sun antardasa is 6/120 of the total dasa 
length, i.e. 20*6/120 years = 1 year. Length of Moon antardasa is 10/120 of 
the total dasa length, i.e. 20x10/120 years = 1 year and 8 months. Length of 
Mars antardasa is 7/120 of the total dasa length, i.e. 20*7/120 years = 1 



184 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

year and 2 months. In this manner, we proportionally divide the period of a 
mahadasa into 9 antardasas. 

We use the same procedure to d iv ide  each antardasa into 9 
pratyantardasas, each pratvantardasa into 9 sookshma dasas and so on. 

In the case of the first dasa, we don't divide the remainder at birth 
(2.24875 years of Mars dasa remainder, for example, in Example 50) into 9 
antardasas. Instead, we divide the complete duration of the first dasa (7 
years of Mars dasa, for example, in Example 50) into 9 antardasas. So a 
few antardasas may be over before birth and only a few antardasas may be 
left at birth. 

From now on, it will be assumed that the reader is familiar with the 
computations. If the reader does not have any software and needs to compute 
dasas by hand, he or she should practice with many charts. 
16.4 Vimsottari Dasa Variations 

16.4.1 Computation of Variations 
We always compute the fraction left at birth in the first dasa based on 

the fraction of the constellation occupied by Moon, that is yet to be traversed 
by Moon. However, we need not always take the lord of Moon's constellation 
as the planet ruling the first dasa. We can take the lord of the 4th, 5th or 8th 

constellation from Moon's constellation to start the first dasa. These 3 stars 
are called kshema, utpanna and adhana stars. 
Example 51: Let us consider the data of Example 50 and calculate 
Vimsottari dasa from 4th, 5th and 8th stars. 

The 4th star from Moon's star is Uttarabhadrapada owned by Saturn. 
Using the 4th star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa sequence as — 
Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus etc. Dasa lengths are the same as before, but 
the part of Saturn dasa left at birth is 19 x 0.32125 = 6.10375 years. Then 
Mercury dasa is for 17 years, Ketu dasa is for 7 years and so on. 

In the same example, the 5th star from Moon's star is Revathi owned by 
Mercury. Using the 5th star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa 
sequence as — Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun etc. Mercury dasa left at birth 
is 17 x0.32125 = 5.46125 years. Then Ketu dasa is for 7 years, Venus dasa 
is for 20 years and so on. 

In the same example, the 8th star from Moon's star is Krittika owned by 
Sun. Using the 8th star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa sequence 
as — Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu ect. Sun dasa left at birth is 6 x 0.32125 = 
1.9275 years. Then Moon dasa is for 10 years, Mars dasa is for 7 years and 
soon. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 185 

16.4.2 Dasa from Lagna 
Some authorities have also recommended Vimsottari dasa from the 

longitude of lagna instead of Moon. In practice, this will give better results 
only when lagna is considerably more powerful than Moon. 
16.5 Using Vimsottari Dasa 
16.5.1 General Principles 

Vimsottari dasa is a very general phalita dasa that can also be used as 
an ayur dasa. All kinds of general results can be seen from it. A planet 
gives the results promised by its positions in various divisional charts. Here 
are just a few examples: 
(1) Period of the 5th lord in D-7 can give a child. 
(2) Period of the 8th lord in rasi chart can give some troubles and frustration. 
(3) Period of a planet exalted in GL in D-10 can give power and authority 

in career. 
(4) Period of an exalted planet in the 12th from AK in D-9 can give serious 

thoughts related to spiritual liberation. 
(5) Period of the 7th lord in D-9 can give marriage. 
(6) Period of a planet with Rahu in the 9th in D-4 can give foreign residence. 
(7) Period of an exalted planet aspecting HL from the 11th from AL in rasi 

chart can give a lot of wealth. 
(8) Period of a planet joined by Moon and Saturn in the 8th house in D-30 

may give serious psychological problems and suicidal tendencies. 
(9) Period of a well-disposed planet aspecting A3 in D-10 may make one 

write some books. 
These are just a few examples. One should look at various divisional 

charts and figure out the results indicated by different planets. Each planet 
gives the results indicated by it in its dasas and antardasas. When analyzing 
antardasas, we can take the dasa lord as a temporary lagna and analyze the 
charts. 
16.5.2 Using Dasa Variations 

If the sign containing the 5th star from Moon is stronger than the sign 
containing Moon, Vimsottari dasa started from utpanna star may be preferred 
for general results. If the 5th star spans across 2 signs, take the sign containing 
the same quarter as occupied by Moon in birthstar. If Moon is in Makha 3rd 

pada (quarter), for example, 5th star is Chitra and it starts in Virgo and ends 
in Libra. So we should take the 3rd quarter of Chitra and we then get Libra. 
So Leo's strength should be compared to Libra's. 



186 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

How do we know which sign is stronger? There are no clear guidelines 
in the literature to compare the strengths. A sign aspected by Jupiter and 
occupied by more planets may be taken to be stronger. We can also use 
known events to see which dasa is working better. 

Vimsottari dasa started from the 4th and 8th stars is used mainly for the 
purposes of longevity determination. Look at the signs containing Moon and 
these 2 stars and find the strongest sign. Here a sign aspected by marakas 
and malefics becomes stronger. Start Vimsottari dasa from the star in the 
strongest of these 3 signs and use it in longevity analysis. If Moon is in 
Makha 3rd pada in Leo, 4th and 8th stars are Hasta (Virgo) and Anuradha 
(Scorpio). We should compare the strengths of Leo, Virgo and Scorpio. 
16.5.3 Rath's "Tripod of Life" Principle 

Sun, Moon and lagna form the "tripod of life". Parasara clearly said 
that we should analyze all charts with respect to the positions of Sun, Moon 
and lagna. He advised drawing Sudarsana chakra with the innermost chakra 
representing the houses with respect to lagna (body), next chakra representing 
the houses with respect to Moon (mind) and the outermost chakra 
representing the houses with respect to Sun (soul). 

The results experienced due to soul (Sun) last long and change slowly. 
The results experienced due to mind (Moon) last shorter and change fast. 
The results experienced due to body (lagna) change even faster. 

Sun is an important reference point in rasi and divisional charts when 
judging the results of a mahadasa. Moon is an important reference point 
when judging the results of an antardasa. Lagna is an important reference 
point when judging the results of a pratyantardasa. 

If a planet takes part in a Ravi yoga (solar combination), it gives the 
results of the yoga in its mahadasa. If a planet takes part in a Chandra Yoga 
(lunar combination), it gives the results of the yoga in its antardasas. If a 
planet takes part in other yogas (e.g. a Raja Yoga), it gives the results of the 
yoga primarily in its pratyantardasas. 

In addition, dasa lord can be taken as a reference point when interpreting 
antardasas. 
16.6 Practical Examples 

16.6.1 As A Phalita Dasa 
Example 52: Consider the dasamsa chart of Pandit Sanjay Rath, a Vedic 
astrology author and founder of Sri Jagannath Vedic Centre (see Chart 17). 
Dasamsa shows one's achievements in society. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 187 

Chart 17 

 

Just a few days of Rahu dasa were left at birth. Mercury dasa has been 
running since 1998. During Mercury dasa, he published a brilliant book "Crux 
of Vedic Astrology - Timing of Events" and he is writing more books. Why 
did Mercury give book writing? 

Dasamsa shows achievements in society and A3 (arudha pada of 3rd 

house) shows the books authored by one. A3 is in Vi here. It has argalas 
from the 11th from it by Venus and Jupiter and that shows saattwik and 
brilliant traditional knowledge as the catalyst bringing gains in his book-
writing. Mercury is the significator of writing and communication and he 
has argala on A3 from the 4th from it. This shows that good communication 
skills and scholarship (Mercury) are the basic driving factor in his book-
writing. 

In addition to containing A3, Virgo is the 3rd from GL. GL stands for 
power, authority and fame. The 3rd house from GL stands for fame as a 
communicator. Mercury owns and aspects it. In rasi chart, Mercury gives 
Vesi yoga being in the 2nd from Sun. So his dasa should bring the results of 
Vesi yoga. 



188 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 18 

 
all these reasons, Mercury dasa can bring him book-writing activities and 
the fame that goes with it. He will author many more excellent books. 
Example 53: Let us consider the D-7 chart of a lady who had her first 
child in November 1994 and second child in December 1996 (see Chart 
18). 

Moon is in Sun's constellation. First dasa belongs to Sun. About 1 year 
and 3 months of Sun dasa was over before birth and the remainder of Sun 
dasa at birth was about 4 years and 9 months. Rahu dasa started at the end 
of 1993. This dasa gave her children. Let us explain why Rahu gave children. 

D-7 chart shows progeny. The 5th house shows children and it is in Aq 
here. It is owned bv Saturn and Rahu. If one of the owners occupies the 
sign, the other owner acts as the main owner, according to Parasara. Saturn 
is in Aq. So Rahu acts as the 5th lord in this chart. He is in the 11th house of 
gains, with lagna lord Venus. His conjunction with Venus - conjunction of 
1st and 5th lords - consists of a raja yoga in the house of gains. For these 
reasons, Rahu can give the happiness of getting a child. Antardasas at the 
time of childbirth belonged to Rahu and Jupiter. Jupiter is the naisargika and 
chara puttra karaka and he is in the 5th house here. 

Rahu is the primary 5th lord here. But, after all, Saturn also owns 5th and 
moreover he occupies 5th with Jupiter. He is the strongest planet in 5th. 
Hence pratyantardasa at the time of both the childbirths belonged to Saturn. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 189 

Pratyantardasa running at the time of an event usually belongs to the most 
important planet influencing the house of interest in the divisional chart of 
interest. 
Example 54: Let us consider the rasi chart of Sri Navin Patnaik (see 
Chart 19). He was elected as the Chief Minister of India's Orissa state in 
early 2000. 

First dasa is of Mars and Mercury dasa started in July 1999. Mercury 
antardasa in Mercury mahadasa was running when he became Orissa's 
CM. 

Mercury is in Libra. Rajya saham and GL are also in Libra. So Mercury 
has the potential to bring kingdom. 

From AL, Mercury is in the 6th house. Upachayas from AL bring gains 
in status and a planet in the 6th from AL can bring an improvement in status. 

Let us apply Rath's "tripod of life" principle. Sun is in Vi. We should 
judge mahadasa from Sun. Where is Mercury with respect to Sun? Mercury 
is Sun's dispositor and he is in the 2nd from Sun. This results in a powerful 
Vesi yoga. 

Chart 19 

 

Even taking Moon as the reference, Mercury is 1st lord and he is in a 
trine. So he is favorably placed from Moon also. For this reason, Mercury's 
antardasa is a good antardasa and there was success in the very first AD of 
Mercury MD. 



190 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Of course. Mercury is a functional benefic in dasamsa, aspects GL and 
occupies rajya pada (A 10) in a quadrant from lagna. These factors also 
contributed to success in Mercury dasa. 
Example 55: Let us consider the rasi chart of an engineer who came from 
India to USA (see Chart 20). He studied at a reputed institution in India and 
had a good job at a big company in USA. He had a wife and two children. 

Chart 20 

 

He had a cruel shock when his wife filed a lawsuit against him in a US 
court at the end of 1995, accusing him of many wrong things that he hadn't 
done. She had his bank accounts frozen and had him evicted from his house. 
He was then running Jupiter-Moon antardasa (i.e. Jupiter dasa, Moon 
antardasa) as per Vimsottari dasa. This author predicted to him that things 
would just be fine and he would win the suit in Mars antardasa. However, 
he could not go through with it, surrendered everything to his wife, left his 
excellent job, left his house and kids to his wife and mother-in-law and went 
back to India in mid-1996. He returned to USA in 1998 to start fresh and 
started searching for a job. This author's prediction went wrong because he 
blindly used Vimsottari dasa started from Moon's star. 

Why did Jupiter-Moon antardasa bring such a catastrophe? Why was 
his life turned upside down? Jupiter is an exalted functional benefic in a 
trine. Moon is an exalted functional benefic in a quadrant. Of course, we 
can give vague reasons to justify almost anything, but that's not the right 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 191 

approach. If we use the right variation of the dasa, we don't have to bend 
backwards or beat around the bush to explain events. 

Let us consider utpanna star. Moon is in Rohini. The 5th star Pushyami 
is in Cancer and exalted Jupiter occupies it. Occupied by an exalted planet 
and owned by another exalted planet, Cancer is very strong. It is a tough 
call in this case, but dasas started from Pushyami explain the events better 
than dasas started from Rohini. 

First dasa belongs to Saturn. Venus dasa of 20 years runs from February 
1987 to October 2006. Venus is lagna lord and he gives Vesi yoga being in 
the 2nd from Sun. So his dasa is good. However, being the 8th lord from AL, he 
can also give a fall in status. 

Rahu's antardasa runs during 1994-1997. As per Rath's "tripod of life" 
principle, we should give importance to Rahu's position from Moon. Rahu is 
in the 8th house from Moon and his antardasa is unfavorable. It can bring 
unexpected troubles and frustration. Debilitated Rahu's rasi aspect on AL 
can also cast a shadow on one's image and affect one's status. 

Ketu's pratyantardasa ran during December 1995-February 1996 when 
a lot of this drama unfolded and he was evicted from house with his accounts 
frozen. That shook him up. We should give importance to lagna when judging 
pratyantardasas. Ketu is lagna lord in the 8th house. Again it is a bad period. 

Sun's pratyantardasa was running when he went back to India, leaving 
everything he had behind - including his job at a big company. Sun is the 
10th lord and he is debilitated in the 12th house, afflicted by Saturn and 8th 

lord. Moreover Sun is in the 8th house from AL and that adds to the indications 
of a fall in status. So Sun's pratyantardasa can bring losses and fall in status. 
During this pratyantardasa, he gave up everything he had and went back to 
India. 

Jupiter is the 8th and 11th lord from Moon. He is in the 3rd from Moon. 
Jupiter in 3rd gives a positive spirit. Jupiter antardasa can inject some energy 
into his nearly destroyed life. He came back to US in Jupiter antardasa. 
Saturn is an exalted yogakaraka from Moon and his antardasa should bring 
gains again. 
16.6.2 As An Ayur Dasa 

We have so far seen examples of Vimsottari dasa used as a phalita 
dasa. We will now see its use as an ayur dasa. 
Example 56: We will consider John F. Kennedy, Jr's rasi chart (see Chart 
21). He passed away on the night of July 16, 1999. 



192 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Parasara mentioned that the 3rd and 8th houses are the houses of life 
and the 2nd and 7th houses are the houses of death. He said that the 2nd 

house is particularly a maraka (killer) house. Lords and occupants of these 
houses can kill a native. 

Chart 21 

 

Here the 2nd house is Virgo. Its lord Mercury is in mrityu bhaga in the 
3rd house. He is a strong maraka. Saturn is the 7th lord. He is also 
Maheswara, being the 8th lord from AK Mars. He joins Jupiter, who is 
Rudra. Saturn is also a strong maraka. Mr. Kennedy was running Saturn-
Mercury antardasa when he passed away. 
Example 57: Let us consider the rasi chart of a lady who committed suicide 
on April 6, 1988 (see Chart 22). 

Jupiter is the 7th lord here and he is exalted. He is a very strong maraka. 
Venus is 2nd lord in 2nd and he can kill too. 

Moon is in the 1st quarter of Bharani constellation. The 4th constellation 
is Mrigasira. Because the 1st quarter of Mrigasira is in Taurus, we should 
take Taurus as the sign of 4th star. The 8th star is Aasresha in Cancer. 
Cancer contains 7th lord Jupiter, a maraka. However, it is not aspected by 
2nd lord. Taurus, on the other hand, has the rasi aspect of both Jupiter and 
Venus. Aspect of marakas makes a sign stronger. So start dasas from the 
4th star. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 193 

Chart 22 

 

First dasa belongs to Mars and Jupiter-Venus antardasa was running at 
death. Both the planets are marakas. 
Example 58: Let us consider the rasi chart of great astrologer Dr. B.V. 
Raman (see Chart 23). He passed away on 20th December 1998, leaving a 
void in the astrological community. 

As per Vimsottari dasa reckoned from Moon's star, he passed away in 
Venus-Sun antardasa. Venus is a maraka being in the 7th house, but he is not 
a very strong maraka. Though Sun owns 7th, he is in 6th, i.e. in the 12th from 7th 
and the 11th from 8th. The likelihood of Sun killing the native is small. 

Who are the strongest marakas in this chart? Certainly, Mercury is the 
strongest maraka. He owns 8th and occupies 7th. Malefics in the 2nd house are 
strong marakas. So Rahu in the 2nd is also a maraka. Mars is also a 
maraka, being the 3rd lord in 7th. 

Let us consider the variations of Vimsottari dasa based on 4th and 8th 

stars. The 4th star is Pushyami in Cancer. The 8th star is Uttaraphalguni and 
its 1st quarter is in Leo. Because Leo is the strongest sign, we can start 
dasas from Sun who owns Uttaraphalguni (8th star from Moon's star). 

Starting Vimsottari dasa from the 8th star, we can see that Mercury-
Rahu antardasa was running in December 1998. Killership of both the planets 
has already been addressed.

16.7 Conclusion 

In this chapter, Vimsottari dasa and its variations are explained and 
their use is demonstrated. Use of Vimsottari dasa as a phalita dasa as well 
as an ayur dasa is demonstrated. As this is the most common constellation-
based dasa system, readers should master its use through practical experience. 

Though many people limit themselves to Vimsottari dasa started from 
the birthstar, one is advised to use the variations mentioned in this chapter 
for the best results. 

If all the quadrants from the stronger of lagna and Moon are occupied 
by planets, "Kendradi Graha Dasa" is more appropriate than Vimsottari 
dasa. Results from Vimsottari dasa may not be very good in such cases. 

In addition, it should be noted that the error in the start/end dates of 
dasas have an error of approximately m.n/4 days, if there is an error of m 
minutes in birthtime and the complete duration of the first dasa is n years. 

For example, if the first dasa belongs to Venus, then n = 20. So an error 
of 5 minutes in the birthtime results in an error of 5x20/4 = 25 days in dasas 
(this is approximate). Considering this, we cannot use low level sub-periods 
of Vimsottari dasa (like sookshma dasas) confidently, unless we rectify the 
birthtime. 

It is a good idea to allow a margin of error when we examine the dates 
on which dasas start and end. 



17. Ashtottari Dasa 

17.1 Introduction 
Ashtottari dasa is perhaps the most popular dasa system in India after 

Vimsottari dasa. Sage Parasara listed it as a conditional dasa applicable 
only in some charts. The conditions for its applicability are highly 
controversial. 

In this system, the sum of all dasas is 108 years. Ashtottari means 
"ashtottara sata", i.e. one hundred and eight. Because poornaayush (full 
life) of a man is 108 years, some scholars have suggested that ashtottari 
dasa is best used as an ayur dasa, i.e. a dasa that shows longevity. 

Some other scholars suggest that Ashtottari dasa can be used as a 
phalita dasa. Because only chara karakas, i. e. Rahu and the seven planets, 
have dasas under the Ashtottari dasa scheme, it may also be suggested that 
it shows events related to sustenance, achievements, raja yogas and moksha 
(just like chara karakas do). Some people, however, prefer to see all matters 
in Ashtottari dasa. 

17.2 Computation 

17.2.1 Dasas 
Order of dasas and the length of dasas is as shown in Table 39. Each 

planet covers an arc of either 53°20' (4 nakshatras) or 40°0' (3 nakshatras) 
in the zodiac, as shown in that table. 

We note natal Moon's longitude and see which of the eight arcs it belongs 
to. The planet ruling the arc will rule the first dasa. The fraction of the arc 
that is yet to be traversed by natal Moon is calculated and the same fraction 
of the dasa length of the first dasa lord is left at birth. After that, dasas will 
come in the order shown in the table and the length of a planet's dasa is the 
full dasa length given in the table. After Venus, we come back to Sun at the 
beginning of the table.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis 197 

Example 59: Suppose Moon is at 24° in Leo. That is equivalent to 24°0' + 
120°0' = 144°0'. We see that 144° is between 120°0' and 160°0'. So it is in 
the 2nd arc of Table 39, which is ruled by Moon. The full dasa length is 15 
years. Here we have to find the fraction of the arc that is yet to be traversed. 
The arc starts at 120°0' and ends at 160°0'. So the part of the arc that is yet 
to be traversed by Moon is (160°0' - 144°0') = 16°. As a fraction of the arc 
length (40°), this is 16°/40° = 0.4. The same fraction of the full dasa length 
of Moon is 15 x 0.4 = 6 years. The native will run Moon dasa of 6 years 
from his birth. Then 8 years of Mars dasa will run. Then 17 years of Mercury 
dasa will run. Then 10 years of Saturn dasa will run. And so on. 
NOTE: One has to be careful with the calculation if the first dasa is Rahu 
dasa. The arc ruled by Rahu starts at 333°20' and ends at 26°40'. The 
ending longitude 26°40' is equivalent to 386°40' and we should use either 
26°40' or 386°40' based on Moon's longitude. For example, if Moon is at 10° 
in Aries, then the part of the arc that is yet to be traversed is 26°40' - 10° = 
16°40'. If Moon is at 20° in Pisces, i.e. at 350°, then the part of the arc that 
is yet to be traversed is 386°40' - 350° = 36°40'. 
17.2.2 Antardasas 

The first antardasa belongs to the planet that comes in the table after 
the dasa lord. Then antardasas go in the same order as dasas and the last 
antardasa belongs to dasa lord. For example, antardasas in Jupiter dasa go 
as: Rahu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Saturn and Jupiter. Antardasas 
in Moon dasa go as: Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu, Venus, Sun and 
Moon. 

The length of a dasa is divided into eight antardasas in the ratio of the 
dasa lengths. For example, Sun dasa is of 6 years. Moon antardasa in Sun 
dasa is of 6 x 15/108 = 0.8333 year = 10 months. Mars antardasa in Sun 
dasa is of 6 x 8/108 = 0.4444 year = 5 months 10 days. Mercury antardasa 
in Sun dasa is of 6 x 17/108 = 0.9444 years = 11 months 10 days. And so on. 
17.2.3 Application 

There are three different views on the applicability of Ashtottari dasa: 
(1) Ashtottari dasa is applicable in all charts. 
(2) Ashtottari dasa is applicable if Rahu, who is not in lagna, is in a quadrant 

or a trine from lagna lord. 
(3) Ashtottari dasa is applicable for daytime births in Krishna paksha (darker 

fortnight) and night time births in Sukla paksha (brighter fortnight). 
Some people use Ashtottari dasa as an ayur dasa and see longevity in 

it. Some other people use Ashtottari dasa as a phalita dasa. Because only 



198 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

chara karakas, i.e. Rahu and the seven planets, have dasas under the 
Ashtottari dasa scheme, it may also be suggested that it shows events related 
to sustenance, achievements, raja yogas and moksha (just like chara karakas 
do). Some people, however, prefer to see all matters in Ashtottari dasa. 
17.3 Examples 
Example 60: We saw the chart of great astrologer Dr. B.V. Raman in 
Example 58. We noted that his sad demise on 20th December 1998 makes 
better sense with Vimsottari dasa started from the 8th nakshatra from Moon's 
nakshatra than Vimsottari dasa started from Moon's nakshatra. As per the 
former, he passed away in Mercury-Rahu antardasa. Mercury is the 8th 

lord in the 7th house of death and Rahu is a malefic in the 2nd house of death. 
One may compute Ashtottari dasa for the birthdata given in Chart 23 

and find that Rahu-Mercury antardasa was running at the time of his death. 
For reasons already explained, Rahu and Mercury are the strongest marakas 
in this chart. It is significant that the same planets gave death in both dasas. 
Example 61: Let us consider the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Her 
birthdata and assassination data are given in Example 110 (in a later chapter). 
Her rasi chart is given in Chart 61. 

One may calculate Ashtottari dasa for her and find that Moon dasa ran 
from 1980-1995. Saturn antardasa was running at the time of her 
assassination. 

Saturn is the 7th lord in lagna and Moon is in the 7th house. They are the 
only planets strongly associated with the 7th house of death. They can give 
death. 
Example 62: Let us consider Sri P.V. Narasimha Rao's rasi chart given in 
Chart 6. He held important ministerial berths in Indian government during 
1980-1989 and he was India's Prime Minister during 1991-1996. 

If one calculates his Ashtottari dasa, one will find that Mercury dasa 
ran during 1981-1997. Mercury is lagna lord and he occupies an own sign. 
He is in the the 7th house from AL and GL and certainly promises power. 
The planet bringing a link between lagna and GL by way of aspect, ownership 
and occupancy brings power. Mercury is lagna lord and he has a rasi aspect 
on both lagna and GL. He can give power. 

Moreover, Sri Rao's chart has a powerful Vipareeta Raja yoga (VRY) 
between 3rd and 8th lord Mars and 12th lord Sun, who are within a 17' from 
each other. If the planets involved in VRY have a conjunction or rasi aspect 
with lagna lord, then VRY can give permanent results and the power is 
transferred to lagna lord. Here Mercury is the dispositor of Mars and Sun 
and joins them in his own rasi. He has 7 rekhas in BAV and his rasi Gemini 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 199 

has 34 rekhas in SAV. Mercury is in Uttamamsa. For all these reasons, 
Mercury is a great yoga karaka. So his dasa (1981 -1997) was excellent for 
Sri Rao.  

17.4     Conclusion 
Ashtottari dasa is a popular dasa, but its applicability as well as application 

are controversial. Readers should keep this in mind and keep their minds 
open to alternative views. What is taught in this book is not the final truth. 
Of course, this applies to everything taught in this book, but it is especially 
applicable to this chapter. 



18. Narayana Dasa 

18.1 Introduction 
Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita dasa. It 

shows general results. Narayana dasa is computed differently for different 
divisional charts and we can use Narayana dasa of a divisional chart to 
predict matters related to that divisional chart. 

Narayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one's life. As 
one dasa ends and another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna 
and another rasi becomes one's progressed lagna. Using the progressed 
lagna as the reference, we find out the events that happen in that dasa. 
Thus we get twelve charts for each person, with each chart applicable in 
one dasa. 

This is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould pay attention to 
the details of calculation. 
18.2 Computation 

18.2.1 Dasa Progression 
Dasas start from lagna or the 7th house, whichever is stronger. We use 

the rules of strength explained in the chapter "Strength of Planets and Rasis". 
Let us denote the stronger of lagna and 7th house by the expression "dasa 
seed". 

Movable signs are governed by Brahma. Fixed signs are governed by 
Shiva. Dual signs are govenred by Vishnu.54 Brahma is associated with the 
regular movement of 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. Vishnu is associated with the trinal 
movement, i.e. 1st, 5th, 9th, then 10th, 2nd, 6th and so on. We cover the trines from 
dasa seed first, go to another quadrant and cover its trines and so on. Shiva, 
on the other hand, is associated with the 6th movment. We take dasa seed, 
6th from there, 6th from there and so on. 

The direction of reckoning these houses is based on the 9th house from 
dasa seed. If the 9th house from dasa seed is an odd-footed sign (Ar, Ta, Ge 
and Li, Sc, Sg), the direction is forward. If the 9th house from dasa seed is 
an even-footed sign (Cn, Le, Vi and Cp, Aq, Pi), the direction is backward. 
Example 63: Suppose someone has lagna in Ta. Suppose Sc is stronger 
than Ta. Let us find the dasa progression. 

54 Brahma is the God of creation. Vishnu is the God of sustenance. Shiva is the God of 
destruction. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are together known as "Trimurthis" (the 
"Trinity of Gods"). 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 201 

Because the 7th house is stronger than lagna, it becomes the dasa seed. 
So the dasa seed is Sc. Because it is a fixed sign, we use every 6th progression 
governed by Shiva. The 9th house from Sc is Cn. It is an even-footed sign. 
So the overall direction is backward. So we should count houses in the 
backward direction. The 6th house from Sc. counted backwards, is Ge. The 
6th therefrom is Cp. We count the 6th house from every rasi in the backward 
direction and get the complete dasa sequence as: 

Sc, Ge, Cp, Le, Pi, Li, Ta, Sg, Cn, Aq, Vi and Ar 
This is the order of dasas for the native.  

Example 64: Suppose someone has lagna in Pi. Suppose Pi is stronger than 
Vi. Let us find the dasa progression. 

Because lagna is stronger than the 7th house, it becomes the dasa seed. 
So the dasa seed is Pi. Because it is a dual sign, we use the trinal progression 
governed by Vishnu. The 9th house from Pi is Sc. It is an odd-footed sign. 
So the overall direction is forward. So we should count houses in the forward 
direction. We count the 1st, 5th, 9th houses from dasa seed, then count the 
same houses from the 10th house, then from the 7th house and finally from 
the 4th house. Trines from Pi are Pi, Cn and Sc. Trines from the 10th (Sg) 
are Sg, Ar and Le. We get the complete dasa sequence as: 

Pi, Cn, Sc, Sg, Ar, Le, Vi, Cp, Ta, Ge, Li and Aq. This is the order of 
dasas for the native.  
Example 65: Suppose someone has lagna in Cn. Suppose Cp is stronger than 
Cn. Let us find the dasa progression. 
Because the 7th house is stronger than lagna, it becomes the dasa seed. So 
the dasa seed is Cp. Because it is a movable sign, we use the regular (1st, 
2nd, 3rd) progression governed by Brahma. The 9th house from Cp is Vi. It is an 
even-footed sign. So the overall direction is backward. So we should count 
houses in the backward direction. We count the lst, 2nd, 3rd etc houses from 
dasa seed backwards. We get the complete dasa sequence as: Cp, Sg, Sc, 
Li, Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Pi and Aq. 

This is the order of dasas for the native. 
Saturn exception: 

If Saturn occupies dasa seed, dasa progression becomes regular and 
zodiacal. If Sc is dasa seed and it contains Saturn, dasa progression becomes 
Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar etc. If Pi is dasa seed and it contains Saturn, dasa 
progression becomes Pi, Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le etc. We basically make the 
direction "forward" and use Brahma's progression. 
Ketu exception: 

If Ketu occupies dasa seed, the basic direction of dasa progression 



202 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

becomes reversed. If it is normally forward, it becomes backward. If it is 
normally backward, it becomes forward. If Sc is dasa seed and it contains 
Ketu, dasa progression becomes Sc, Ar, Vi, Aq, Cn, Sg etc (comparing this 
with Example 63, readers may note that the 6th house is counted in the 
forward direction instead of the backward direction). If Pi is dasa seed and 
it contains Ketu, dasa progression becomes Pi, Sc, Cn, Ge, Aq, Li etc 
(comparing this with Example 64, readers may note that the 5th, 9th, 10th etc 
house etc are counted in the backward direction instead of the forward 
direction.). 

Dasa progressions for various dasa seeds are given in Table 40. Three 
cases are covered for each dasa seed — (a) the normal case, (b) with 
Saturn exception, and, (c) with Ketu exception.

(b) Saturn: Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq Pi, 
(c) Ketu: Sc, Cn, Ge, Aq, Li, Vi, Ta, Cp, Sg, Le, Ar 

We should choose the dasa progression based on dasa seed. If neither 
Saturn nor Ketu occupies dasa seed, we should use the normal progression. 
If Saturn occupies dasa seed, we should apply the Saturn exception. If 
Ketu occupies dasa seed, we should apply the Ketu exception. 
18.2.2 Dasa Length 

The length of a dasa is determined by the position of the lord of dasa 
rasi with respect to dasa rasi. Counting is forward if dasa rasi is odd-footed. 
Counting is backward if dasa rasi is even-footed. Count houses from dasa 
rasi to its lord. Subtract one from the count. That gives dasa length in years. 
Exceptions: 
(1) If the count of houses from dasa rasi to its lord is one, i.e. dasa rasi 

contains its lord, then we get zero by subtracting one from one. However, 
dasa length becomes 12 years then.

(2) If the lord of dasa rasi is exalted, add one year to dasa length. 
(3) If the lord of dasa rasi is debilitated, subtract one year from dasa length. 
Special Notes: 

 

(1) If dasa rasi is Aq or Sc, it has two lords. We should take the stronger 
lord when computing Narayana dasa. 

(2) After dasas of all the rasis are over, the second cycle starts. In the 
second cycle, dasa lengths of various rasis are obtained by subtracting 
the dasa length in the first cycle from 12 years. 

Example 66: Let us take the rasi chart in Chart 23 and compute Narayana 
dasa. Because the 7th house (Le) is stronger than lagna (Aq), dasa seed is 
Le. Because it is a fixed sign, we use the "every 6th" progression governed 
by Shiva. Because the 9th from Le (Ar) is odd-footed, we count in the 
forward direction. Neither Saturn nor Ketu occupies Le and the exceptions 
don't apply. Dasa sequence is — Le, Cp, Ge, Sc, Ar, Vi, Aq, Cn, Sg, Ta, Li, 
Pi. Let us now find the lengths of various dasas. 

Le is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Le to its lord Sun 
in the backward direction. Sun is in Cn, i.e. the 2nd house from Le in the 
backward direction. So dasa length is 2-1=1 year. The native was born in 
August 1912. This dasa runs from Aug 1912 to Aug 1913. 

Cp is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Cp to its lord 
Saturn in the backward direction. Saturn is in Ta, i.e. the 9th house from Cp 
in the backward direction. So dasa length is 9-1=8 years. This dasa runs 
from Aug 1913 to Aug 1921. 

Ge is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Ge to its lord Mercury 
in the forward direction. Mercury is in Le, i.e. the 3rd house from Ge in the 
forward direction. So dasa length is 3-1=2 years. This dasa runs from Aug 
1921 to Aug 1923. 

Sc is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Sc to its lord Mars 
in the forward direction. Mars is in Le, i.e. the 10th house from Sc in the 
forward direction. So dasa length is 10-1=9 years. This dasa runs from 
Aug 1923 to Aug 1932. 

Ar is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Ar to its lord Mars 
in the forward direction. Mars is in Le, i.e. the 5th house from Ar in the 
forward direction. So dasa length is 5-1=4 years. This dasa runs from Aug 
1932 to Aug 1936. 

Vi is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Vi to its lord Mercury 
in the backward direction. Mercury is in Le, i.e. the 2nd house from Vi in the 
backward direction. So dasa length is 2-1=1 year. This dasa runs from Aug 
1936 to Aug 1937. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 205 

Aq is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Aq to its lord 
Saturn in the backward direction. Saturn is in Ta, i.e. the 10th house from 
Aq in the backward direction. So dasa length is 10-1=9 years. This dasa 
runs from Aug 1937 to Aug 1946. 

Cn is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Cn to its lord 
Moon in the backward direction. Moon is in Ta, i.e. the 3rd house from Cn in 
the backward direction. So dasa length is 3-1=2 years. However, Moon is 
exalted and we add one year. We get 2+1=3 years. This dasa runs from 
Aug 1946 to Aug 1949. 

Sg is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Sg to its lord Jupiter 
in the forward direction. Jupiter is in Sc, i.e. the 12th house from Sg in the 
forward direction. So dasa length is 12-1=11 years. This dasa runs from 
Aug 1949 to Aug 1960. 

Ta is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Ta to its lord Venus 
in the forward direction. Venus is in Le, i.e. the 4th house from Ta in the 
forward direction. So dasa length is 4-1=3 years. This dasa runs from Aug 
1960 to Aug 1963. 

Li is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Li to its lord Venus in 
the forward direction. Venus is in Le, i.e. the 11th house from Li in the 
forward direction. So dasa length is 11-1=10 years. This dasa runs from 
Aug 1963 to Aug 1973. 

Pi is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Pi to its lord Jupiter 
in the backward direction. Jupiter is in Sc, i.e. the 5th house from Pi in the 
backward direction. So dasa length is 5-1=4 years. This dasa runs from 
Aug 1973 to Aug 1977. 

Thus the first cycle of dasas ends in Aug 1977. The second cycle starts 
then. Dasas will come in the same order as in the first cycle. Let us compute 
the second cycle. 

Because Le dasa is of 1 year in the 1st cycle, it is 12-1=11 years in the 
2nd cycle. This dasa runs from Aug 1977 to Aug 1988. 

Because Cp dasa is of 8 years in the 1st cycle, it is 12-8=4 years in the 
2nd cycle. This dasa runs from Aug 1988 to Aug 1992. 

Because Ge dasa is of 2 years in the 1st cycle, it is 12-2=10 years in the 
2nd cycle. This dasa runs from Aug 1992 to Aug 2002. 
Exercise 27: Calculate Narayana dasa for the rasi chart given in Chart 21. 
(Hints: Saturn is the stronger lord of Aq and Ketu is the stronger lord of Sc. 
Aq is stronger than Le.) 



206 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

18.3 Antardasas 
Each dasa is divided into 12 antardasas. All the antardasas have an equal 

length. If a dasa is of n years, then each antardasa in that dasa is for n 
months. 

Antardasas start from the rasi containing the lord of dasa rasi or the rasi 
containing the lord of the 7th house from dasa rasi. Let us denote the stronger 
of dasa rasi and the 7th from it with the expression "antardasa seed". 
Antardasas start from the rasi containing the lord of antardasa seed and we 
take the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc houses from there. The direction of counting houses 
is forward or backward based on whether the rasi from which antardasas start 
is an odd rasi or even rasi. (NOTE: We are talking about odd and even signs 
here and not about odd-footed and even-footed signs). 
Example 67: Suppose Cp dasa of 5 years is running. Lords of Cp and Cn are 
Saturn and Moon respectively. Suppose Saturn is in Le and Moon is in Ta. 
Antardasas start from either Le or Ta. If Cp is stronger than Cn (or Saturn is 
much stronger than Moon), then we start from Le. If Cn is stronger than Cp (or 
Moon is much stronger than Saturn), then we start from Ta. Let us say Cn is 
stronger than Cp and Saturn is not much stronger than Moon. Then antardasas 
start from Ta, which contains Moon. Because Ta is an even sign, counting is 
backward. So antardasas go as — Ta, Ar, Pi, Aq, Cp, Sg, Sc, Li, Vi, Le, Cn 
and Ge. Each antardasa is of 5 months. 

Exceptions: If Saturn occupies antardasa seed rasi, antardasas go in the 
forward direction. If Ketu occupies antardasa seed rasi, antardasa direction is 
reversed (from forward to backward or from backward to forward). In the 
above example, antardasa sequence becomes Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Sg, 
Cp, Aq and Pi, if Ketu occupies Cn. 
18.4 Interpretation 

Narayana dasa gives the progression of lagna in life. During the dasa of a 
rasi, that rasi acts as lagna. If dasas are started from the 7th house from lagna, 
then Narayana dasa gives the progression of the 7th house. So the 7th from dasa 
rasi gives the progressed lagna, i.e. the rasi that acts as lagna during the dasa. 

Treat the dasa rasi or the 7th from it - based on whether dasas start from 
lagna or the 7th house - as lagna and analyze the chart, to see fortune in a dasa. 
We will denote it with "dasa lagna". We will denote the rasi containing the 
lord of dasa lagna with "paaka rasi". 
Just as the strength of lagna lord is very important in a natal chart, 
 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 207 

strength of the lord of dasa lagna is the key to interpreting a dasa. In addition, 
a lot of principles were mentioned by Parasara: 

Natural malefics in the 3 rd and 6th from dasa lagna give success in 
ventures. Natural benefics in those houses give failures. Natural benefics in 
trines and 8th from dasa lagna give happiness and success. Natural malefics 
in those houses give failures, obstructions and unhappiness. Situation of a 
planet - benefic or a malefic - in the 11th house ensures gains. Rahu in the 
8th and 12th houses from dasa lagna gives constant fear. If the lord of dasa 
lagna or the lord of a trine or a quadrant from it is exalted or in own house, 
it gives excellent results. Debilitation, on the other hand, is bad. If the lord of 
a dusthana from dasa lagna is debilitated, it gives good results. If the 4* 
house from dasa lagna has malefics, there will be discomfort and lack of 
happiness. Benefics in the same house give happiness, well-being and 
pleasures. Benefics in the 2nd and 5th houses from dasa lagna give good 
name, fame and favors from authorities. Malefics in the same houses bring 
bad results in the same areas. If the 7th house from dasa lagna and paaka 
rasi is afflicted by malefics, there may be troubles in marriage. Raja yogas 
and dhana yogas with respect to dasa lagna bring success. If dasa lagna or 
paaka rasi is associated with an exalted planet or a planet in own house, 
there will be allround success and accumulation of wealth in that dasa. 

In addition to interpreting dasas taking dasa lagna as lagna, we can 
interpret dasas from the natal references also. For example, dasa of raajya 
pada gives success in career. Dasa of upapada may bring marriage. Dasa 
of the 2nd house or the 7th house from upapada may bring troubles in marriage. 
Dasa of GL may bring power. In particular, antardasas aspected by GL 
may bring promotions. Antardasas aspecting upapada may bring marriage. 
Arudha padas aspected by antardasa rasi are important in deciding the 
results in an antardasa. 

We also judge the results given in antardasas by looking at the house 
occupied by antardasa lord from dasa rasi. 

Another approach is to divide each dasa into three equal parts. The rasi 
dominates in the first part. Its lord dominates in the second part and gives 
his results. Occupants of the rasi and those who aspect it dominate in the 
third part. 
Example 68: Let us consider the rasi chart of Bill Gates, the well-known 
billionaire of computer software giant Microsoft Corporation (see Chart 
24). Lagna is stronger than the 7th house as its exalted lord aspects it. So 
dasas start from Ge. 



208 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 24 

 

Narayana dasa calculations are given below: 
 

Ge (04 years) Oct 1955 -    Oct 1959 
Aq (05 years) Oct 1959 -    Oct 1964 
Li (12 years) Oct 1964 -    Oct 1976 
Vi (12 years) Oct 1976 -    Oct 1988 
Ta (05 years) Oct 1988 -    Oct 1993 
Cp (04 years) Oct 1993 -    Oct 1997 
Sg (08 years) Oct 1997 -     Oct 2005 

During Cp dasa, Mr. Gates had a phenomenal rise in stature and 
finances. His company Microsoft became the powerhouse of computer 
software. Why was Cp dasa such a good dasa? 
(1) Cp contains raajya pada (A10 - arudha pada of the 10th house). 
(2) During Cp dasa, dasa lagna is Cp and paaka rasi is Li. Lord of dasa 

lagna is Saturn. He is exalted in the 10th house with the 10th lord Venus 
(from dasa lagna). They form a powerful raja yoga with respect to 
dasa lagna as well as paaka rasi. 

(3) Exalted Mercury is in a trine from dasa lagna and Jupiter is in 8th from 
dasa lagna. Rahu is in 11th. Two powerful planets are in 10th. All these 
are favorable placements. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 209 

(4) Sun owns the 8th house from dasa lagna and he is debilitated. 
At the time of writing this book, Mr. Gates is going through Sg dasa. 

How will Sg dasa be? 
(1) Dasa lagna is Sg and paaka rasi is Le. The lord of dasa lagna is not 

particularly strong (not as strong as the previous dasa's dasa lagna 
lord). But he is not weak either. So things can slow down. 

(2) Dasa lagna lord Jupiter occupies the 9th house suggesting some noble 
acts of charity. 

(3) Rahu occupies the 12th house. This shows constant fear. (Microsoft 
Corporation is facing law suits from the federal government and several 
state governments in US, for being a monopoly). 

(4) Sun, the lord of the 9th house from dasa lagna, is debilitated. He is also 
the lord of paaka rasi. This can suggest some loss of fortune. 

(5) However, other planets are favorably placed with respect to dasa lagna. 
The 10th and 11th houses from dasa lagna are particularly strong. Exalted 
Mercury occupies the 10th house from dasa lagna and he has a raaja 
yoga with Mars with respect to dasa lagna. So Mr. Gates may continue 
to be a successful and innovative entrepreneur. 

Example 69: Let us consider the rasi chart of India's independence chart 
and look at the 1990's (see Chart 25). Narayana dasa calculations are given 
below: 

 

Ta (02 years) Aug 1947 -    Aug 1949 
Sg (10 years) Aug 1949 -    Aug 1959 
Cn (12 years) Aug 1959 -    Aug 1971 
Aq (07 years) Aug 1971 -    Aug 1978 
Vi (02 years) Aug 1978 -    Aug 1980 
Ar (02 years) Aug 1980 -    Aug 1982 
Sc (07 years) Aug 1982 -    Aug 1989 
Ge (01 years) Aug 1989 -    Aug 1990 
Cp (06 years) Aug 1990 -    Aug 1996 
Le (01 years) Aug 1996 -    Aug 1997 
Pi (05 years) Aug 1997 -    Aug 2002 



210 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 25 

 

Capricorn dasa runs during 1990-1996. Mars in the 6th house, Jupiter in 
the 10th house and Ketu in the 11th house from dasa lagna are well-placed. 
Conglomeration of planets in the 7th house (relations with other nations) and 
Ketu in the 11th house gives gains from foreign sources. From paaka rasi 
also, Rahu is in the 11th house and it shows the same thing. So Indian economy 
was liberalized. Jupiter in the 10th house shows a versatile, intelligent and 
knowledgable Brahmin leader (Sri P.V. Narasimha Rao). Aspect of Mars 
on the analytical and tamasik rasi Vi containing the 9th house from dasa 
lagna made the judiciary system relatively aggressive. This resulted in the 
probe into hawala55 scam that shook national politics. 

While there was progress during 1990-1996 due to the good placement 
of most planets with respect to dasa lagna, India experienced disorder, 
confiasion and instability during 1996-1997. During this time, India had a 
minority government formed by a conglomeration of minor parties that formed 
a "third force" in Indian politics. During this period, India ran Le dasa. 

Dasa lagna during Le dasa is Le itself. Except Mars, no planet is well-
placed with respect to Le. In particular, planetary conglomeration in the 12th 

house shows constant fear and turbulence. It signals instability. Rahu in the 
10th house from dasa lagna denies stable and capable leadership. 

55 Hawala means "bribes for favors" 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 211 

During 1997-2002, India runs Pisces dasa. Most planets are well-placed 
with respect to Pisces. So Pisces dasa is a better dasa. As Pisces is a 
conservative rasi, conservative thought may be predominant in the nation. 
Jupiter owns the 10th house and Mars aspects it. So India has another learned 
and intelligent Brahmin leader who has Martian strength in his horoscope 
(Sri A.B. Vajpayee). 

Chart 26 

 

Ketu in the 9th house from dasa lagna may denote religious clashes and 
violence. Mars in the 4th house may denote lack of comfort and the absence 
of a feeling of well-being. These two are bad placements that stand out. 
Rahu in the 3rd house from dasa lagna makes India very bold and assertive. 
Rahu in the 3rd can also give aggressive weapon development, as the 3rd 

house shows weapons. India conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. 
Antardasas in Pisces dasa start from Libra and proceed in the forward 
direction. Antardasa at the time of nuclear tests was Sc. Sc aspects A3, 
which is in Ar. A3 shows the illusion related to boldness or the things based 
on which the world forms impression about one's boldness, i.e. one's 
weapons. Antardasas aspecting A3 can bring weapons, just as antardasas 
aspecting UL can bring marriage. 



212 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Exercise 28: The native of Chart 26 had an excellent career in India until 
1997. Then he had to go to US with his wife, who is a software engineer. 
He could not find the right job for his qualifications in US. He could not 
succeed in his efforts to redeem his career. He had to depend on his wife 
and went through a lot of hard times. Calculate Narayana dasa and explain 
the events. 

18.5 Narayana Dasa of Vargas 
Narayana dasa may be calculated for vargas (divisional charts) also. 

Narayana dasa of a varga throws light on the progress of matters shown in 
that varga. For example, we can use Naryana dasa of D-4 to time changes 
in residence, happiness from home and stay in foreign countries. We can 
use Narayana dasa of D-10 to time events in career. We can use Narayana 
dasa of D-24 to time events related to learning and knowledge. We can use 
Narayana dasa of D-9 to time marriage and to predict events in marital life. 
We can use Narayana dasa of D-7 to predict happiness from children. We 
can use Narayana dasa of D-12 to predict relations with parents. 

Narayana dasa of vargas is computed a little differently. Each divisional 
chart is based on a seed house. The seed for D-n is the nth house. For 
example, the seed of D-9 is the 9th house. D-9 shows dharma (duty). To get 
married, to live with one's spouse and to perform religious ceremonies with 
spouse are one's duties or dharma. This is why Navamsa is also called 
Dharmamsa. The seed of D-10 is the 10th house. That is why D-10 shows 
one's karma or action in society. The seed of D-7 is the 7th house. Sex is 
for procreation and begetting progeny. The seed of D-4 (house) and D-16 
(vehicles and pleasures) is the 4th house. D-12 in the physical plane (it 
shows the lineage one belongs to) and D-24 in the mental plane (it shows 
one's learning) show the evolution of one's self in the respective planes. 
They are both based on the 12th house as the seed, which shows the evolution 
of self. 

To get the seed of D-n, just take the nth house. For example, the seed of 
D11 is the 11th house. If n is greater than 12, subtract multiples of 12 from 
n. For example, the seed of D-16 is 16—12=4th house. The seed of D-27 is 
27-24=3rd house. The seed of D-30 is 30-24=6th house. The seed of D-24 
is 24-12=12th house. The seed of D-40 is 40-36=4th house. 
Procedure: 
(1) Find the seed house of the divisional chart of interest. 
(2) Take that house in rasi chart. 
(3) Find its lord. Take the stronger lord in the case of Aq and Sc. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 213 

(4) Take the rasi occupied by him in the divisional chart of interest as lagna 
and find Narayana dasa of the divisional chart just as if it were a rasi 
chart. Use the rules explained in the previous sections. 
Warning on Interpretation: Narayana dasa of vargas is not the 

progression of lagna or the 7th house. So taking dasa rasi or the 7th from it as 
lagna and analyzing dasas has no technical basis. It applies only to the rasi 
chart. 
Example 70: Suppose someone's rasi chart has lagna in Cn. Suppose we 
want Narayana dasa of D-10 to time some events in career. The 10th house 
is the seed of D-10. The 10th house in rasi chart is Ar. Its lord is Mars. 
Suppose D-10 has lagna in Ta and Mars in Vi. We ignore lagna in D-10 and 
treat the rasi containing Mars in D-10 as lagna and use the rules of Narayana 
dasa of rasi chart. So we treat Vi as lagna. We take the stronger of Vi and 
Pi as the dasa seed. Suppose Vi is stronger and it does not contain Saturn or 
Ketu. Then dasas go as Vi, Cp, Ta, Ge, Li, Aq etc. We find the lengths of 
dasas and antardasas taking D-10 and applying the rules taught for rasi 
chart. 
Example 71: Let us time the foreign stay of the native of Chart 27 using 
Narayana dasa of D-4. Readers may recall that D-4 shows one's residence 
and fortune. It is the appropriate chart for timing foreign stay. 

Chart 27 

 



214 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Lagna is at 14 Vi 52. The 4th house in rasi chart is Sg and Jupiter owns 
it. He occupies Cp in D-4. Let us treat Cp as lagna. So dasa seed is the 
stronger rasi of Cp and Cn (which is the 7th from Cp). As 2 planets occupy 
Cp, it is stronger than Cn. So dasas start from Cp. Narayana dasa 
calculations are given below: 

 

Cp (04 years) :     Apr 1970 -  Apr 1974 
Sg (00 years) —  
Sc (03 years) :     Apr 1974 -  Apr 1977 
Li (09 years) :     Apr 1977 -  Apr 1986 
Vi (05 years) :     Apr 1986 -  Apr 1991 
Le (11 years) :     Apr 1991 -  Apr 2002 
NOTES: 
(1) Saturn is in the 4th house from Cp, reckoned in the backward direction 

because Cp is an even-footed rasi. We get 4-1=3. However, Saturn is 
exalted and we have to add one year. So Cp dasa is of 4 years. 

(2) Jupiter is in the 2nd house from Sg. We get 2-1 = 1. However, Jupiter is 
debilitated and we have to subtract one year. So Sg dasa is of zero 
years. However, Sg dasa of 12 years will come in the second cycle. 
We can see that Le is the 9th house. The 9th house shows prospering in a 

foreign land. Rahu signifies foreign things and he occupies Le. Exalted 
12th lord Mars aspects Le. For these reasons, Le dasa is a natural candidate 
for giving foreign stay. We can see that 11-year Le dasa started in April 
1991. The native moved from his motherland to US on 15th August 1991 
for higher studies. He is working as a software engineer in US now. 

Antardasa: To find antardasas in Le dasa, we should take the stronger 
of Le and Aq. Both have one planet each. Le is aspected by Mercury and 
Jupiter, while Aq is aspected by Mercury and its co-lord Saturn. Neither 
contains an exalted planet. Aq is an odd sign and its stronger lord is also in 
an odd sign. On the other hand, Le is an odd sign and its lord is in an even 
sign. So Le is stronger and antardasas start from the rasi containing Sun -
the lord of Le. So antardasas start from Vi. Because Vi is an even sign, 
they go in the backward direction. Antardasas of 11 months go as Le, Vi, 
Cn, Ge etc. The native went abroad in Vi antardasa containing Sun. Sun 
owns the 9th house in D-4 and owns the 12th house in rasi chart. Lord of Vi is 
Mercury and he occupies the 9th house from dasa rasi. 

Pratyantardasa: Vi is stronger than Pi, as it has a planet. Lord of Vi is 
Mercury. He is in Ar - an odd rasi. So pratyantardasas in Vi antardasa go 
as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le etc. Vi antardasa is of 11 months and it runs from 4th 

April 1991 to 4th March 1992. Dividing it into 12 equal parts, we see that 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 215 

the 5th pratyantardasa runs from 27th July 1991 to 25th August 1991. So Le 
pratyantardasa was running when the native landed in US. Le is the 9th 

house containing Rahu. 
Example 72: Let us consider the navamsa chart of a lady who got married 
in mid-1993(see Chart 28). 
Lagna in rasi chart is Li. The seed for navamsa (D-9) is the 9th house. The 
9th lord in rasi chart is Mercury. He is in Ge in navamsa and Ge is stronger 
than Sg. So dasas start from Ge. Narayana dasa calculations are given 
below: 

 

Ge (12 years) :  Sep 1971 - Sep 1983 
Aq (08 years) :  Sep 1983 - Sep 1991 
Li (02 years) :  Sep 1991 - Sep 1993 

Chart 28 

 

When she got married in August 1993, she was running Li's Navamsa 
Narayana dasa. Why did Li's dasa give marriage? 

Lagna in navamsa shows self, from the point of view of dharma and 
marital life. So lagna's dasa is favorable for marriage. Dasas of the 1st, 3rd 

and 8th houses from upapada (UL) are also favorable for marriage. On the 
other hand, dasas of 6th house from lagna, dasas of the 2nd and 7th houses 



216 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

from UL can bring trouble in marriage and even a divorce when the chart 
has such indications. Because UL shows marriage, the 1st, 3rd and 8th houses 
from it show its birth, vitality and life (longevity). The 2nd and 7th houses 
from it show its end. 

Here Li is lagna. So its dasa can certainly bring marriage. 
Example 73: Let us consider the navamsa chart of another lady and guess 
when she got married. See Chart 29. 

Lagna is at 4 Vi 08. So the 9th house in rasi chart-is Ta. Lord is Venus. 
He is in Pi in Navamsa. Vi is stronger than Pi, as its lord Mercury aspects it. 
So dasas start from Vi. narayana dasa calculations are given below: 

 

Vi (09 years) Jul 1969 - Jul 1978 
Cp (05 years) Jul 1978 - Jul 1983

Chart 29 

 

Dasas of lagna and UL do not run at the ages when marriage is likely. 
Dasa of Taurus runs from the age of 14 years to 25 years. Taurus is the 3rd 

from UL and its lord is exalted in UL. So Taurus dasa can give marriage. 
Which antardasa can give marriage? Certainly, Aq with lagna and UL lord 
is a strong candidate and Pi with UL and exalted Venus (significator of 
marriage) is an even stronger candidate. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 217 

As Sc is aspected by co-lord Ketu, it is stronger than Ta. However, 
Mars is the stronger lord of Sc, as he is aspected by Mercury and his 
dispositor (Mercury again). Ketu is aspected only by his dispositor (Saturn) 
and Mars' count of 2 beats Ketu's count of 1. So antardasas start from Vi. 
The 7th antardasa belongs to Pi. Each antardasa is of 11 months and the 7th 

antardasa starts after 5.5 years. It runs during Jan-Dec 1989. The lady got 
married in May 1989. So Pi antardasa brought marriage. 

Exercise 29: Consider the lady whose Navamsa is given in Chart 30. 
Despite wise counsel by elders, this lady insisted on leaving her husband 
and ended her marriage in early June 2000. Find the antardasa running then 
as per Navamsa Narayana dasa and explain the event. 

Chart 30 

 

Example 74: Let us consider the D-10 of an electrical engineer who faced 
some setbacks in career during 1994-1996 (see Chart 31). His enemies 
conspired and laid a trap for him and he was suspended by the government 
from his job for a mistake he did not make. He had to suffer for a long time. 

Lagna is at 16 Aq 50. The 10th house in rasi chart is Sc and Mars is its 
lord. Mars is in Cp in D-10. Cn is stronger than Cp, as Jupiter occupies it 
and its lord Moon aspects it. Narayana dasa starts from Cn and the 
calculations are given below: 



218 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 
 

Cn (03 years) Sep 1947 - Sep 1950 
Ge (11 years) Sep 1950 - Sep 1961 
Ta (11 years) Sep 1961 - Sep 1972 
Ar (10 years) Sep 1972 - Sep 1982 
Pi (09 years) Sep 1982 - Sep 1991 
Aq (05 years) Sep 1991 - Sep 1996 

 
The setbacks occurred in Aq dasa. Why is Aq a bad dasa? 
Aq is the 8th house from lagna in D-10 and it gives tension, frustration, 

worries and setbacks (related to career). It is the 12th house of losses from 
AL, showing some setbacks in professional status. The 2nd and 5th houses 
and also Sun show recognition from authorities in a chart. Sun owns the 2nd 

house here and he is in Aq, afflicted by enemy Rahu. Affliction of Sun by 
Rahu in dasa rasi can show scandals and making a bad name with authorities. 
Aquarius has Satru pada (arudha pada of 6th house) and it can show trouble 
from enemies. Because of the exaltation of Saturn in a quadrant, the middle 
part of this dasa must be good. Because the occupants of a rasi dominate 
the last one-third of a dasa, that was when Sun and Rahu gave the troubles. 
Exercise 30: Consider the gentleman whose D-10 is given in Chart 32. 
Find Dasamsa Narayana dasa running in 1996-1998 and judge whether that 
period should be good or bad for his career. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 219 

Chart 32 

 

Example 75: Let us consider the native whose D-16 is given in Chart 33. 
D-16 shows vehicles, comforts and discomforts. The native had a vehicular 
accident in December 1996. Let us find the antardasa running then and see 
if the event makes sense. 

Lagna is at 14 Vi 52. The seed of D-16 is the 4th house, as 16-12=4. 
The 4th lord in Rasi chart is Jupiter. In D-16, he is in Vi and Vi is stronger 
than Pi. So dasas start from Vi. Narayana dasa calculations of D-16 are 
given below: 

Vi (04 years): Apr 1970 - Apr 1974 
Cp (01 years): Apr 1974 - Apr 1975 
Ta (03 years): Apr 1975 - Apr 1978 
Ge (11 years): Apr 1978 - Apr 1989 
Li (10 years): Apr 1989 - Apr 1999 



220 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 33 

 

In Li dasa, antardasas start from the lord of Li or Ar. Li is aspected by 
Mercury and its lord Venus and it is stronger. Its lord Venus is in Le, an odd 
rasi. So antardasas start from Le and go in the forward direction. Li dasa 
started in April 1989 and this event happened in December 1996. From 
April 1989 to December 1996, a period of 7 years and 8 months (7x12+8=92 
months) passed. Each antardasa is of 10 months as Li dasa is of 10 years. 
So 9 antardasas finish after 90 months and the 10th antardasa runs in the 
92nd month. The 10th house from Le is Ta. Why did Ta antardasa bring an 
accident? 

Ta is the 12th from vahanapada (A4 - arudha pada of the 4th house). It 
can give losses to the vehicle. Lord of A4 is Mercury and he is with Rahu 
and Ketu in Ta. So vehicle can be involved in an accident. Moreover, mrityu 
pada (A8) is in Ta and troubles related to vehicles can be expected. Nobody 
was hurt in the accident, but the car was badly damaged and the native was 
given a new car by his insurance company. In the next 6 months, his new 
car was damaged twice while parked in a parking lot. One of the damages 
was serious. So Ta antardasa continued to give vehicular troubles. 

One may wonder why we are looking at antardasa and not mahadasa. 
Events shown by mahadasa suggest the overall mood of the whole 10 year 
period, while events shown by antardasa are applicable to 10 months here. 
With Li being the 4th house and having the argala of lord Venus, the native 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 221 

had the comfort of vehicles in Li dasa. However, Ta antardasa was bad due 
to Rahu and A8. Based on the event of interest, we shouldjudiciously choose 
mahadasa or antardasa or pratyantardasa for examination. If an event plays 
a role in a native's life for just a week, it is probably shown in pratyantardasa. 
If an event plays a role in a native's life for a few months, it is probably 
shown in antardasa. Mahadasa shows the mood of longer periods. If we 
want to analyze a temporary activity that remains in a native's mind for just 
an hour, it is probably seen in the praana-antardasa or deha-antardasa running 
then. We should determine the effective period of an event and judiciously 
choose the dasa division in which it should be seen. 
18.6    Sub-divisions of Narayana Dasa 

Narayana dasa is a versatile rasi dasa. It is a general purpose phalita 
dasa. It can be computed separately for each divisional chart for precise 
timing of events related to the matters associated with that divisional chart. 
We can go down to the precision of a day or an hour by using fine 
subdivisions of dasas. As in Example 71, we can divide each antardasa into 
12 equal pratyantardasas. This is done in the same manner as each dasa is 
divided into 12 equal antardasas. In the same manner, we can divide each 
pratyantardasa into 12 equal sookshma-antardasas (or simply sookshma 
dasas), each sookshma-antardasa into 12 equal praana-antardasas (or simply 
praana dasas) and each praana-antardasa into 12 equal deha-antardasas. 

When we say that a period is divided into 12 equal sub-periods, what 
do we mean by "equal"? We obviously mean that the twelve sub-periods 
have the same length. The next question is — how do we measure the 
length of a sub-period? In days, hours, minutes and seconds? No! We 
measure the length of a period (or a sub-period) by the angle of the arc 
traversed by Sun during that period (or sub-period). Two periods are said to 
be equal if and only if Sun moves by the same degrees, minutes and seconds 
during the two periods. In other words, we take 1 year=12 months and 1 
month=30 days, where 1 day is the time in which Sun moves by 1°. 

Motion of Sun is the basis for measuring time in rasi dasas. Suppose a 
dasa of 5 years starts after the native completes 37 years. If Sun is at 23° 
50' 25" in Aq in the birthchart of a native born in 1960, he finishes 37 years 
when Sun reaches the same longitude in 1997. If the dasa is of 5 years, 
each antardasa is of 5 months. This corresponds to the time in which Sun 
moves by 5x30°= 150°. When each antardasa divided into 12 equal 
pratyantardasas, Sun moves by exactly 150°/12=12°30' during each 
pratyantardasa. 

Thus we should divide time in the space of Sun's longitude when dividing 
dasas upto praana-antardasas or deha-antardasas. Then only correct results 



222 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

will be obtained. A free software program for computers using Microsoft 
Windows operating systems can be downloaded at http://www.sjvc.net56. 
Given the birthdata and the start year and length of a mahadasa, this software 
program can divide the mahadasa upto the level of deha-antardasas using 
Sun's longitude as the measure of time. This software program is called 
"Rasi Dasa Division"'. 
18.2 Conclusion 

Narayana dasa may be said to be the most important phalita dasa. Its 
versatility lies in the fact that it can be computed separately for each divisional 
chart for precise timing of specific matters. In fact, we can compute more 
than one Narayana dasa for each divisional chart. Narayana dasa of D-12 
seeded from the 12th lord is native-centric. It shows events in a native's life 
that are related to parents. Even when looking at the events in the lives of 
parents, it takes the native as the reference. To see events in the lives of 
parents directly, we can use different seeds. Similarly, 12th house used as 
the seed in D-24 Narayana dasa shows the learning from the point of view 
of one's evolution. One can use the 4th house (formal learning) as the seed 
in D-24 Narayana dasa to see formal education. By using a different seed, 
we can examine the events related to the chosen divisional chart from a 
different angle. Readers should try to master this fantastic dasa system. 
18.3 Answers to Exercises 
Exercise 27: 

The 7th house has 2 planets and lagna has only one. So the 7th house 
acts as dasa seed. Progression for Aq is: every 6th. Because Li (9th from 
Aq) is odd-footed, direction is normally "forward". But Ketu's presence in 
Aq reverses it and makes it "backward". Saturn acts as the lord of Aq and 
Ketu as the lord of Sc. Dasas go as: 

Aq (02 years): Nov 1960-Nov 1962 
Vi (11 years): Nov 1962 - Nov 1973 
Ar (02years): Nov 1973 - Nov 1975 
Sc (03 years): Nov 1975 - Nov 1978 
Ge (04 years): Nov 1978 - Nov 1982 
Cp (01 years): Nov 1982 - Nov 1983 
Le (09 years): Nov 1983 - Nov 1992

years): Nov 2073 - Nov 2082 

We stop here because 120 years is the paramayush of human beings. 
Exercise 28: 
Both Ge and Sg are unoccupied. Neither is occupied or aspected by Jupiter, 
Mercury or lord. Ge is an odd rasi and Mercury is also in an odd rasi. But Sg 
is an odd rasi and Jupiter is in an even rasi. So Sg is stronger. Narayana 
dasa calculations are given below: 

Sg (11 years): May 1971 - May 1982 
Le (05 years): May 1982 - May 1987 
Ar (10 years): May 1987 - May 1997 
Pi (04 years): May 1997 - May 2001 
Sc (03 years): May 2001 - May 2004 

Because we started dasas from the 7th house instead of lagna, Narayana 
dasa shows the progression of the 7th house instead of lagna. So dasa lagna 
is the 7th from dasa rasi. During Ar dasa, dasa lagna is Li. Due to the 
exaltation of dasa lagna lord Venus (among other things), it was a very good 
dasa. During Pi dasa, dasa lagna is Vi. Lord of Vi is Mercury and he is in 
the 8th house from it. Lords of two dusthanas - Mars and Sun - are exalted 
and that suggests hard times. Jupiter in the 3rd from dasa lagna suggests 
failures. There are no malefics in the 3rd or 6th from dasa lagna. Saturn in 
the 9th house suggests loss of fortune or struggle for fortune in far away 
places. Ketu in the 11th house shows gains from foreign sources. Exalted 
9th lord Venus is in the 7th house. So he went abroad following his wife. 



224 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Exercise 29: 
Lagna is at 0 Sc 39. Moon is the 9th lord in rasi chart. He is in Aq. Le is 
stronger than Aq because Sun is more advanced in his rasi than Saturn. 
Dasas start from Le. Because of the presence of Saturn in Le, they go in 
the regular zodiacal order. Narayana dasa calculations are given below: 

Le (02 years): Jun 1976 - Jun 1978 
Vi (08 years): Jun 1978 - Jun 1986 
Li (07 years): Jun 1986 - Jun 1993 
Sc (10 years): Jun 1993 - Jun 2003 

Let us find antardasas in Sc dasa. Ta is stronger than Sc. Lord of Ta is 
Venus. He is in Ta itself. So antardasas start from Ta. Because Ta is an 
even rasi, antardasas go in the backward order. Each antardasa lasts 10 
months. It takes 80 months (or 6 years and 8 months) for 8 antardasas to 
finish. So the 9* antardasa starts in February 2000 and runs for 8 months. 
The 9th antardasa belongs to the 9th house from Ta in the backward direction. It 
is Vi. 

Vi is the 2nd house from UL and it shows the end of marriage. Ketu 
occupies it and Sun, Mars and Rahu aspect it. Because of these malefic 
influences, Vi periods can break her marriage. Sun's aspect on the 2nd from 
UL can denote father's influence in the break-up. This lady encountered 
resistance from mother and maternal relatives, but her father encouraged 
her to end the marriage. 
Exercise 30: 
Sg contains Mercury who owns the 10th house in rasi chart. Sg is stronger 
than Ge and dasas start from Sg. Dasamsa Narayana dasa calculations are 
given below: 

Sg(11 years): Jul 1961-Jul 1972 
Le (03 years): Jul 1972 - Jul 1975 

 Ar (11 years): Jul 1975 - Jul 1986 
Pi (04 years): Jul 1986 - Jul 1990 
Sc (04 years): Jul 1990 - Jul 1994 
Cn (05 years): Jul 1994 - Jul 1999 

Cancer dasa was running in 1996-1998. Is it good or bad? 
Cancer is the 5th house from lagna and it shows recognition. It contains 

AL in D-10 and shows status in career. Cancer has argalas and rasi aspects 
from lagna lord Jupiter and Sun. Moreover, it has bhaagya pada (A9 -
arudha pada of the 9th house). A9 shows the illusion associated with fortune 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 225 

(in career, because this is D-10). It shows the things based on which people 
form impression about one's fortune. It essentially shows the trappings of 
fortune, like good position and money. Dasa of A9 in D-10 can give excellent 
position in career. So this period must have been excellent for the native's 
career. 

In fact, it was. The native owned a private company specializing in 
computer software and hardware for a niche market. He sold his company 
to a large corporation for several millions of dollars in February 1997 and 
became a VicePresident of that corporation. It was predicted to him by this 
author in mid-1996 that a very important event in his professional and financial 
life would take place in the middle of February 1997. 



19. Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa 

19.1 Introduction 
There is a dasa called "Kendradi Graha Dasa" or "Moola dasa", which 

goes through the dasas of planets in quadrants, panapharas and apoklimas 
from the stronger of lagna and Moon (some authors include Sun). Vimsottari 
dasa years with moolatrikona correction are used. According to some 
authors, this dasa is applicable to all people. In particular, if there are 4 
planets in quadrants from the stronger of lagna and Moon, this dasa gives 
much better results than Vimsottari dasa. 

Moola dasa is beyond the scope of this book. But we will cover a 
similar dasa, which belongs to rasis instead of planets. It is called "Kendradi 
Rasi Dasa". In particular, we will cover "Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa". 

Kendra means "quadrants" and adi means "starting with". In this dasa, 
we cover the rasis in quadrants from lagna first and then cover panapharas 
and apoklimas. 

This is a phalita dasa that shows material success well. 
19.2 Computation 
(1) Dasas start from the stronger of lagna and 7th house. Let us call this 

rasi "dasa seed". 
(2) The direction of reckoning dasas is forward or backward based on 

whether lagna is in an odd sign or an even sign. If Saturn is in the 
stronger of lagna and 7th, dasa order is forward. If Ketu is in the 
stronger of lagna and 7th, dasa order is reversed. 
NOTE: We are talking about odd and even signs here and not about 
odd-footed and even-footed signs. 

(3) First 4 dasas will belong to the kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th) from dasa 
seed. 

(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to the panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th) from 
dasa seed. 

(5) Last 4 dasas will belong to the apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th) from 
dasa seed. 

(6) Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system are found just like in 
Narayana dasa. 

Suppose lagna is in Ge and Ge is stronger than Sg. Then dasas start from 
Ge. Because Ge is an odd sign, we go in the forward order and get dasa 
order as: 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 227 

Ge (1st), Vi (4th), Sg (7th), Pi (10th), Cn (2nd), Li (5th), Cp (8th), Ar (11th), Le (3rd), 
Sc(6th), Aq(9th),Ta(12th). 

Suppose lagna is in Ta and Ta is stronger than Sc. Then dasas start 
from Ta. Because Ta is an even sign, we go in the backward order and 
count houses in the backward direction. We get dasa order as: 

Ta (1st), Aq (4th), Sc (7th) , Le (10th), Ar (2nd), Cp (5th), Li (8th) , Cn 
(11th), Pi (3td), Sg (6th), Vi (9th), Ge (12th). 

19.3   Interpretation 
Parasara taught that the quadrants are ruled by Sri Maha Vishnu and 

the trines are ruled by Sri Maha Lakshmi. If we cover the trines of lagna, 
then go to the trines of another quadrant and cover all the 12 signs in that 
fashion (i.e. as the trines from quadrants), that sequence is quadrant-based 
and hence Narayana rules it. This progression is seen for dual signs in 
Narayana dasa. On the other hand, if we cover the quadrants of lagna first, 
then go to the quadrants of 5th/9th and finally cover the quadrants of the 3rd 

trine, then the sequence is trine-based and Sri Lakshmi rules it. 
In other words, the sequence lth, 5th, 9th, 10th etc is quadrant-based and it 

is ruled by Narayana. The sequence 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th is trine-based and it is 
ruled by Lakshmi. 

So Kendradi rasi dasa uses the movement ruled by Lakshmi. Lakshmi 
is the goddess of wealth and prosperity. So this dasa shows the periods of 
prosperity. It shows the progression of lagna using the movement ruled by 
Sri Lakshmi. 
NOTE: We will learn Sudasa in a later chapter. Sudasa is also a Kendradi 
Rasi Dasa, but started from Sree Lagna instead of lagna. Sree Lagna is the 
Lakshmi sthana57 in a horoscope. So its progression using the movement 
ruled by Sri Lakshmi is more important. 
Example 76: Let us consider the horoscope of former US President Ronald 
Reagan (see Chart 34). 

Lagna is in Sc. Ta is stronger than Sc, as it has Jupiter's aspect. So 
dasas start from Ta. Because Ta is an even rasi, we go anti-zodiacally. 
Dasas go as shown in Table 41. 

57 Residence of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity

Rasi Ta Aq Sc Le Ar Cp Li Cn Pi Sg Vi Ge 
Dasa 9 10 11 7 8 8 4 3 5 10 9 6 
(years) 

Dasas from Ta to Pi add up to 65 years and run during 1911-1976. Sg 
dasa runs during 1976-1986. Mr. Reagan became US President in 1980. 
Why did Sg dasa bring such success? 
(1) Usually rasis containing AK give success. Sg has AK. 
(2) Signs having a strong argala of AmK show coming under the decisive 

influence of good advisors, ministers and bureaucrats. We find in the 
charts of politicians that rasis having strong argalas from AmK give 
political power. That is because political power usually brings a leader 
in the company of excellent advisors, ministers, secretaries or 
bureaucrats. Here Sg has an unobstructed argala from AmK Sun, who 
is in the 2nd from Sg in Gopuramsa with 6 rekhas in ashtakavarga. This 
shows very capable political advisors. 

(3) More than anything else, Sg has GL. GL is the seat of power in a chart. 
(4) Lagna lord Mars is in Sg and he connects lagna to GL. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 229 

19.4 Conclusion 
This dasa shows material success as it is based on a movement ruled 

by Sri Maha Lakshmi. It may be used in conjunction with Sudasa to predict 
material success. However, Sudasa is a superior dasa. 

A noted author who wrote a book on "Mandooka dasa" made some 
changes to "Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa" and presented it as "Mandooka 
dasa". However the quadrants-panapharas-apoklimas movement is called 
"kendraadi gati" and certainly not mandooki gati. Mandooki gati was clearly 
explained by Parasara in his discussion on Kalachakra dasa and it is the 3rd/ 
11th jump. Mandooka dasa is based on mandooki gati and Mandooka dasa 
of Rudramsa is used for predicting the results of wars and death. The dasa 
presented by the gentleman in question is certainly not Mandooka dasa. It is 
only a variation of the dasa discussed in this chapter. 



20. Sudasa 

20.1 Introduction 
Sudasa is a rasi dasa. It is also called "Sree Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa" 

or simply "Rasi Dasa". Its computation is based on kendras etc from Sree 
Lagna. Sudasa is important for materialistic things like money, power and 
authority. It can be used to predict financial matters and matters related to 
status and power. If a political leader occupies a post of power, he must be 
enjoying a favorable dasa as per Sudasa. If a businessman sees increasing 
profits, he must be enjoying a favorable dasa as per Sudasa. If someone 
struggles with tight finances, he must be going through an unfavorable dasa 
as per Sudasa. 
20.2 Computation 
(1) In Sudasa, dasas start from the sign containing Sree Lagna (see the 

chapter on special lagnas). 
(2) The direction of reckoning dasas is forward or backward based on 

whether SL is in an odd sign or an even sign. 
NOTE: We are talking about odd and even signs here and not about 
odd-footed and even-footed signs. 

(3) First 4 dasas will belong to the kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th) from SL. 
(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to the panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th) from 

SL. 
(5) Last 4 dasas will belong to the apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th) from SL. 
(6) Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system are found just like in 

Narayana dasa. 
(7) But there is an exception in the case of first dasa. Only a fraction of 

first dasa is left at birth. This fraction is found using the formula: (30° -
SL's advancement in its sign)/30°. 

Example 77: Consider Sri Vajpayee's rasi chart shown in Chart 3. His SL 
is at 12°21' in Capricorn. 
(1) Dasas start from Capricorn, the sign containing SL. 
(2) Because Capricorn is an even sign, the direction of reckoning dasas is 

backward. 
(3) First 4 dasas will belong to kendras from Cp, reckoned in the backward 

direction. They are Cp, Li, Cn and Ar. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 231 

(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to panapharas from Cp, reckoned in the 
backward direction. They are Sg, Vi, Ge and Pi. 

(5) Last 4 dasas will belong to apoklimas from Cp, reckoned in the backward 
direction. They are Sc, Le, Ta and Aq. 

(6) Dasa periods are found as in Narayana dasa. We get dasa periods as: 
 

Cp: 2 years 
Li: 2 years 
Cn: 11 years 
Ar: 12 years 
Sg: 2 years 
Vi: 10 years 
Ge: 5 years 
Pi: 1 year 
Sc: 2 years 
Le: 8 years 
Ta: 7 years 
Aq: 3 years 

(7) SL is at 12°21' in Capricorn. The fraction of the first dasa left at birth 
= (30° - 12°21'/30° = (1800 - 741)/1800 = 0.5883. 
First dasa of Cp is of 2 years and 0.5883 of it is 1.1766 years, i.e., 1 
year 2 months 3 days 14 hours. So this is the remainder of Cp dasa at 
birth. After this, Li dasa of 2 years will start. 

20.3 Interpretation 
(1) Dasas of HL, 7th from HL and the signs aspecting HL bring financial 

prosperity. 
If the lord of the dasa sign occupies or aspects HL, it will improve the 
chance of financial prosperity. Similarly, if the lord of HL occupies or 
aspects dasa sign, it will also improve the chances of financial prosperity. 
For example, say HL is in Aries, Mars is in Leo and Sun is in Scorpio. 
Then (a) Leo aspects HL, (b) lord of Leo aspects HL and (c) lord of 
HL occupies Leo. So Leo dasa is triply likely to bring financial prosperity. 

(2) Same thing holds for GL and the prescribed results are power and 
authority instead of financial prosperity. 

(3) Upachayas from any house stand for the growth of matters signified by 
that house. AL stands for one's status. So dasas of upachayas from 



232 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

AL bring growth of status. Dasa of the 11th house from AL is particularly 
favorable. (4) The 8th and 12th houses from AL bring setbacks to one's 
status. Their dasas can be unfavorable. 
Example 78: Consider Sri Vajpayee, whose Sudasa was calculated in 
Example 77. His GL is in Cancer. Capricorn is the 7th house from GL and it 
can bring power and authority. Its lord Saturn aspects GL. Moon is the lord 
of GL and he aspects Cp. So Cp dasa is very favorable for attaining a 
position of power and authority. Moreover, Cp contains AL and A5. AL 
shows status and A5 can show power. The 5th house shows one's following. 
A5 shows things based on which the world forms an impression about one's 
following. It can show the trappings of power. Capricorn dasa in the second 
cycle made him the Prime Minister of India. 
Of course, Narayana is important for power, though Sri Lakshmi gives 
prosperity. So we should always check Narayana dasa along with Sudasa. 
Sri Vajpayee was running the Narayana dasa of Sc during the same time 
and so he became the Prime Minister. Scorpio is lagna and houses a powerful 
raja yoga between AK (Mercury) and PK (Saturn). We studied in the chapter 
"Yogas" that the conjunction of AK and PK is a raaja yoga, especially in 1st 

and 5th. 
Example 79: Consider Indian political leader Jayalalita's chart shown in 
Chart 35. She was the Chief Minister of an important state in south India 
during 1991-1996. 

Chart 35 

 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis  233 

Her SL is in 22 Sg 22. So dasas start from Sg. Because Sg is an odd 
sign, counting of houses is in the zodiacal direction. Dasas go as Sg, Pi, Ge, 
Vi (quadrants); Cp, Ar, Cn, Li (panapharas); Aq, Ta, Le, Sc (apoklimas). 
The first dasa of Sg is of 12 years, because its lord Jupiter is in Sg. But SL 
is at 22°22' in Sg and the remainder in first dasa at birth is 12 x (30° -
22°22')/30°= 12 x 0.2544 years = 3 years 19 days. After that, 3 years of Pi 
dasa, 8 years of Ge dasa, 7 years of Vi dasa, 6 years of Cp dasa, 4 years of 
Ar dasa, 11 years of Cn dasa and 6 years of Li dasa follow. Li dasa ran 
during Feb l990-Feb l996. 

As Libra contains AL, GL and HL, its dasa as per Sudasa must give 
status, power and wealth. No wonder the native became a powerful Chief 
Minister. 



21. Drigdasa 

21.1 Introduction 
Drigdasa is a rasi dasa. Drik means vision and drigdasa is a dasa based 

on aspects. It shows how spiritual vision develops in a native and steers 
one's life. If a native's chart promises spiritual growth, this dasa shows 
religious and spiritual activities and the evolution of one's soul. 
21.2 Computation 
(1) Dasas start from the 9th house. 
(2) First 4 dasas belong to the 9th house and the 3 signs aspected by it. 

Order of reckoning is forward or backward based on whether the 9th 

house is odd-footed or even-footed. 
(3) Next 4 dasas belong to the next house (10th house) and the 3 signs 

aspected by it. Order of reckoning is forward or backward based on 
whether the 10th house is odd-footed or even-footed. 

(4) Last 4 dasas belong to the house after that (11th house) and the 3 signs 
aspected by it. Order of reckoning is forward or backward based on 
whether the 11th house is odd-footed or even-footed. 

(5) Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system are found just like in 
Narayana dasa. 

Example 80: Consider the gentleman in Chart 36. His lagna is in Libra. Ge 
is the 9th house, Cn is the 10th house and Le is the 11th house. 
(1) Dasas start from the 9th house, i.e., Ge. 
(2) Because Ge is an odd-footed sign, we should go forward as Ge, Cn, Le, 

Vi, Li etc and find the signs that aspect Ge. We get Ge, Vi, Sg and Pi. 
(3) Next 4 dasas will belong to the 10th house (Cn) and rasis aspected by it. 

Because Cn is an even-footed sign, we should go backward as Cn, Ge, 
Ta, Ar, Pi etc and find the signs that aspect Cn. We get Cn, Ta, Aq and 
Sc. 

(4) Last 4 dasas will belong to the 11th house (Le) and rasis aspected by it. 
Because Le is an even-footed sign, we should go backward as Le, Cn, 
Ge, Ta, Ar etc and find the signs that aspect Le. We get Le, Ar, Cp and 
Li. 

(5) So dasas go as Ge, Vi, Sg, Pi, Cn, Ta, Aq, Sc, Le, Ar, Cp and Li. Dasa 
periods of individual signs are found just as in Narayana dasa. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 235 

Chart 36 

 

So we get the following as the dasa table: 
 

Ge: 4 years 
Vi: 11 years 
Sg: 2 years 
Pi: 1 year 
Cn: 6 years 
Ta: 3 years 
Aq: 8 years 
Sc: 10 years 
Le: 11 years 
Ar: 5 years 
Cp: 7 years 
Li: 10 years 

21.1  Interpretation 
(1) Dasa of arudha lagna can bring renunciation if there are parivraja yogas in 

the chart, indicating renunciation. 
(2) Dasas of signs aspecting arudha lagna can bring external activities that are 

important for one's spiritual evolution. 



236 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(3) Dasa of lagna and the 7th house can bring internal awakening and self-
realization. 

(4) Dasa of lagna can also bring fame and power related to spreading 
spiritual knowledge. A monk may, for example, become the Chief 
Pontiff of a monastery. 

(5) Dasas of signs containing or aspecting mantrapada (A5, arudha pada 
of the 5th house) can bring a religious initiation or sadhana (rigorous 
practice) of a mantra. 

(6) Dasa of the sign containing mrityupada (A8, arudha pada of 8th house) 
can bring yogic sadhana. It can activate Kundalini sakti. 

(7) Ketu is the significator of moksha (final liberation). Dasa of the sign 
containing Ketu can bring spiritual activities that take one towards 
liberation. Ketu is the only planet who can give real spiritual awakening 
and liberation. 

(8) Dasa of the sign containing Rahu can create progress after internal 
turmoil if Rahu is favorable. If Rahu is unfavorable, it can take the 
native in the direction of materialism. 

Example 81: Consider the gentleman in Chart 36, whose Drigdasa was 
computed in Example 80. Let us analyze Ta dasa that comes during 24-27 
years of age. Ta has mokshakaraka Ketu in it. Lagna and mantrapada are 
in Li and Ta aspects both. Because of these reasons, Ta dasa can bring 
internal progress and spiritual evolution. It can make the native learn and 
use mantras. 
Example 82: Chart 37 gives the rasi chart of an ISKCON58 devotee who 
was disillusioned with the materialistic world, left his education in 
mathematics at a Russian university, wandered in the forests for a few 
months and then found ISKCON. He was introduced to ISKCON and 
moved to a monastery in 1990. 

Lagna is in Aq. The 9th house is in Li. It is an odd-footed sign. So we 
start from Li, go zodiacally and list the rasis aspecting Li. They are Li, Aq, 
Ta and Le. The 10th house is in Sc. It is an odd-footed sign. So we start 
from Sc, go zodiacally and list the rasis aspecting Sc. They are Sc, Cp, Ar 

58 ISKCON is an acronym for "International Society for Krishna Consciousness", which 
was founded by Srila Prabhupada for spreading Krishna consciousness and 
Vaishnava thought in the world. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 237 

Chart 37 

 

and Cn. The 11th house is in Sg. It is an odd-footed sign. So we start from 
Sg, go zodiacally and list the rasis aspecting Sg. They are Sg, Pi, Ge and Vi. 
So dasas go as 

Li, Aq, Ta, Le, Sc, Cp, Ar, Cn, Sg, Pi, Ge, Vi 
Lengths of dasas are found as in Narayana dasa. Dasa sequence is 

given below: 
Li: 1 year 
Aq: 9 years 
Ta: 6 years 
Le: 7 years 

Leo dasa runs during Jan 1987-Jan 1994. Leo is the 7th from lagna and it 
contains Ketu. It can give spiritual awakening. 
Example 83: Chart 38 shows the rasi chart of Sri Aurobindo Ghose. He 
was an Indian political activist, freedom fighter, yogi, spiritual teacher and a 
renowned author who wrote excellent commentaries on Vedas, Upanishats 
etc. 

After his education in England, he returned to India to take part in 
India's freedom movement. He was imprisoned by the British in 1908. During 
his time in the prison, he went through a spiritual evolution. He realized that 
Indians had lost their independence not only politically, but also culturally 



238 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 38 

 
and religiously59. He dedicated himself to spreading Indian culture and 
religion. When he was released in 1910, he withdrew from active politics 
and started an aashram (monastery) in Pondicherry, India. During 1906-
1913, he was running Scorpio's dasa as per Drigdasa. Scorpio is the 7th 

house from AL; it aspects lagna; and, it contains its lord Ketu. For these 
reasons, Scorpio dasa can bring internal awakening and take one close to 
liberation. AL and the 7th from it can also play an important role in external 
activities such as renunciation and moving to (or starting) a monastery. 

However, his aashram had only a handful of followers in the beginning. 
As his magazine and books were read by more people, he started becoming 
popular. In early 1920's, the number of students in his aashram grew manifold. 
During 1918-1925, he ran Cn dasa. As Cn contains lagna, its dasa brings 
true enlightenment and also recognition. During lagna's dasa, a monk can 
become a chief of a monastery. Here he got recognition and his aashram 
grew. 

Libra's dasa started in August 1925. Sri Aurobindo left the material and 
spiritual charge of his aashram to the Mother and retired into seclusion to 
pursue yogic sadhana. Libra contains mrityupada and has the argala of 
Ketu. No wonder he wanted yogic sadhana in seclusion, rather than spreading 
religious learning in the world. 
59 This is partly true even today. It is amazing to see how an average Indian intellectual 

undervalues the achievements of Indian culture and the wisdom in the teachings of 
ancient maharshis. 



22. Niryaana Shoola Dasa 

22.1 Introduction 
Niryaana means death and shoola is a weapon of Lord Shiva, who is 

the lord of destruction. Niryaana Shoola dasa is one of the most reliable 
dasa systems for the timing of death. Parasara simply called it "Shoola 
dasa", but some scholars60 use the name Shoola dasa to denote a different 
dasa. We will learn it in another chapter. In order to avoid confusion, we will 
call the dasa to be learnt in this chapter as "Niryaana Shoola dasa". 
22.2 Computation and Interpretation 

 22.2.1 Computation 
Find the stronger of the 2nd and 8th houses. Start from the rasi containing 

that house. If the rasi is odd, go in the forward (zodiacal) direction and 
cover the 12 rasis. If the rasi is even, go in the backward (anti-zodiacal) 
direction and cover the 12 rasis. Dasas of movable, fixed and dual rasis 
have 7, 8 and 9 years respectively.61

Classics are not clear about how we go about finding antardasas. This 
author suggests using the same rules used for Narayana dasa. 
22.2.2 Interpretation 

Dasa of strong maraka rasis and dasas of rasis containing strong maraka 
grahas can bring death. Usually death occurs in the dasa of a Trishoola rasi. 
There are three Trishoola rasis and we can identify the correct rasi based 
on the longevity category (short, middle or long life). 

If Trishoolas don't bring death, the rasi containing Rudra in the 12th 

house can bring death. 
Antardasa at the time of death can be the 6th, 7th, 8th or 12th rasi from 

dasa rasi. It can also be a rasi that aspects the rasi that, in navamsa, contains 
the owner of the 8th house from dasa rasi. Suppose dasa rasi at death is Ta 
and Jupiter is in Le in navamsa. Then the antardasas of the 6th, 7th, 8th and 
12th houses from Ta (i.e. Li, Sc, Sg and Ar) can bring death. Also the 
antardasas of Ar, Le, Li and Cp - rasis that aspect Le, which contains 

60 An example is my guru Pundit Sanjay Rath, author of "Jaimini Maharishi' s Upadesa 
Sutras" and "Crux of Vedic Astrology: Timing of Events". 

61 Sthira dasa, Mandooka dasa etc also use the same dasa years, though dasa 
sequences are different under those dasa systems. 



240 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Jupiter in navamsa - can bring death. If there is a common rasi between 
these two principles, it can be a strong candidate. 
Example 84: Let us consider the native of Chart 8. Rudra, Trishoola etc 
were found for this native in Exercise 23. Let us calculate Niryaana Shoola 
dasa. 

We have to find the stronger of 2nd (Sg) and 8th (Ge). Sg is stronger. It is 
an odd rasi. So dasas start from Sg and go as Sg (9 years), Cp (7 years), Aq 
(8 years), Pi (9 years), Ar (7 years), Ta (8 years), Ge (9 years) etc. It may 
be seen that Ge dasa starts after 9+7+8+9+7+8 = 48 years. It runs till the 
age of 57 years. The native died at an age of 50 years. So he died in Ge 
dasa. Why? 

Well, we found in Exercise 23 that Ge, Li and Aq form Trishoola and 
the native has middle life. Ge is the only Trishoola rasi whose dasa comes in 
the middle life range (36-72 years). 

Ge dasa ran during Dec 1994-Dec 2003. When he died in July 1997, the 
4th antardasa was running (each antardasa is of 9 months). Antardasas in 
Ge dasa start from Li and go as Li, Sc, Sg, Cp etc. The 4th antardasa is Cp. 
It may be noted that Cp is the 8th house from Ge and Cp aspects Le, which 
contains Saturns in navamsa. Saturn is the 8th lord from dasa rasi. So Ge-
Cp antardasa (Ge dasa, Cp antardasa) brought death. 
Example 85: Let us consider Rajiv Gandhi's chart (see Chart 39). He was 
assassinated in May 1991. 

Chart 39 

 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 241 

The 2nd house is stronger than the 8th house, as it is occupied by a planet 
(Mars). Dasas start from Vi. It is an even rasi and so dasas go backwards. 
We get Vi dasa of 9 years, Le dasa of 8 years, Cn dasa of 7 years, Ge dasa 
of 9 years, Ta dasa is of 8 years and Ar dasa of 7 years. Ar dasa ran during 
Aug 1985-Aug 1992. Mr. Gandhi died in this dasa. Why? 

Rudra is the stronger of the 8th lords from Le and Aq. So Rudra is the 
stronger of Moon and Saturn (see Table 32). Moon is stronger and he 
becomes Rudra. He is in Le. So Trishoola spikes are in Ar, Le and Sg. 
Being a Trishoola rasi, Ar can kill. 

In Ar dasa, each antardasa is of 7 months. During May 1991, the 10th 

antardasa was running. In Ar dasa, antardasas start from the lord of the 
stronger of Ar and Li. Li is stronger as its lord Venus aspects it. So dasas 
start from Le, which contains Venus. The 10th from Le is Ta. From Ar, the 
8th lord is Ketu and he is in Cp with Mars in navamsa. Ta aspects Cp. 
Example 86: Let us consider India Gandhi's rasi chart given in Chart 61 
(in a later chapter). She was assassinated on October 31, 1984. 

Because Saturn is in Cn, we take the 8th houses from Cn and Cp in the 
normal way, instead of using Table 32. The 8th lord Rahu is debilitated and 
he joins another planet. The 2nd lord Sun also joins another planet. But 
debilitated 8th lord is a better candidate for being Rudra. So Trishoola is in 
the trines from Sg, i.e. Ar, Le and Sg. 

Because the 2nd house with a planet is stronger than the empty 8th 

house, dasas start from the 2nd house. As Le is an odd rasi, dasas go zodiacally. 
Dasas go as Le, Vi, Sc, Sg etc. It may be verified that Ar dasa runs during 
Nov 1982-Nov 1989. Ar is a Trishoola rasi. 

Let us find antardasas in Ar dasa. Ar is stronger than Li, as its lord 
Mars aspects it. Antardasas start from Mars in Le and go as Le, Vi, Le, Sc 
etc. Each antardasa is of 7 months as Ar dasa is of 7 years. Nov 1982-June 
1983 is the first antardasa of Le. June 1983-Jan 1984 is the second 
antardasaof Vi. Jan 1984-Aug 1984 is the third antardasa of Li. The fourth 
antardasa of Sc runs during Aug 1984-Mar 1985. This is the one that brought 
death. 

Sc is the 8th from dasa rasi Ar. So the first antardasa principle we 
described is correct. Ketu owns the 8th from Ar and he is in Cp in navamsa. 
Sc aspects Cp and the second principle is also satisfied. 
Example 87: Let us consider the rasi chart of a male given in Chart 40. He 
expired towards the end of 1949. Antardasa at the time of death does not 
follow the principles explained here, but dasa follows the Trishoola principle. 
Let us verify it. 



242 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

The 8th lords from Ar and Li are Ketu and Venus. Venus is stronger 
than Ketu. So Venus is Rudra. He is in Cp and so Ta, Vi and Cp form 
Trishoola. Niryaana Shoola dasa starts from the stronger of Ta and Sc. Sc 
is stronger as it has one planet. Sc is an even rasi and normally dasas should 
go as Sc, Li, Vi etc. However, Saturn occupies Sc and the "Saturn exception" 
applies. So dasas go as Sc, Sg, Cp etc. Sc dasa of 8 years ran during 1927-
1935. Sg dasa of 9 years ran during 1935-1944. Cp dasa of 7 years ran 
during 1944-1951 and it brought death. As we have seen, Cp is a Trishoola 
rasi. 

Chart 40 

 

Using the principle of three pairs, we get "short life" as the result (lagna 
and 8th lord show short life; Moon and Saturn show short life. Lagna and 
HL show long life). That is why death came in Cp dasa and not in Ta or Vi 
dasa. 

In fact, this native was a brilliant scholar of many subjects and also a 
good astrologer. He knew that he might have a short life. He was sick and 
bed-ridden during his college days. He missed most of his classes at college, 
but he studied on his own and appeared at the exams with special permission 
from his university (there was a minimum attendance requirement and he 
needed a waiver). Despite chronic sickness, he graduated with distinction 
and first rank. He found a good job at a young age, but chose not to marry 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 243 

till an age of 24. At his time, people in India used to get married at a very 
young age. He thought that he had a praanagandam (danger to life) and 
decided to stay a bachelor till 24. He did not want to marry a lady knowing 
he might pass away in a few years. He is an example of the positive use of 
astrology. 
Example 88: Let us consider the rasi chart of a gentleman shown in Chart 
41. He passed away in 1967. 

Chart 41 

 

The 8th lords from Ge and Sg are Saturn and Moon. Saturn is stronger 
and becomes Rudra. Trishoola is in Ta, Vi and Cp. Shiva's Trishoola can 
strike the native (kill the native) in one of the three dasas. Let us find dasas 
now. 

The 8th house is stronger than the 2nd house and it starts dasas. As Cp is 
an even rasi, dasas normally go as Cp, Sg, Sc etc. Here they go as Cp, 
Aq, Pi, Ar etc, due to Saturn's presence in Cp. We can see that Vi dasa 
starts after 63 years (7+8+9+7+8+9+7+8)". So Vi dasa runs during March 
1965-March 1974. Being a Trishoola rasi, Vi brought death in its Niryaana 
Shoola dasa. 
62 One thumbrule that can help in calculating Niryaana Shoola dasa is that the sum of the 
first 3 dasas is always 24 years (7+8+9). The sum of the next 3 dasas is also 24 years. 



244 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Exercise 31: Consider the native whose rasi chart is shown in Chart 42. 
Using the method of three pairs, estimate his longevity category. Then identify 
the dasa of a Trishoola rasi falling in that longevity category. Try to guess 
the antardasa of death. Give the dates instead of just mentioning the dasa 
rasi and antardasa rasi. 

Chart 42 

 

22.3 Conclusion 
Niryaana Shoola dasa is a dasa dedicated to timing one's death. Niryaana 

means death. In this author's humble opinion, this dasa is the best for timing 
death. Usually dasa of one of the three Trishoola rasis brings death. However, 
many special cases, exceptions and special rules mentioned by Maharshis 
were omited in this book. Timing of the antardasa of death wasn't given due 
attention. Readers should be aware that what is taught here is only the tip of 
an iceberg. Further details are beyond the scope of this book. 
22.4 Answer to Exercise 
Exercise 31: 

Lagna lord and 8th lord is Venus. He is in a movable rasi. So we get 
"long life". Moon and Saturn are in dual and movable rasis. So we get 
"short life". Lagna and HL are in movable and fixed rasis. So we get "middle 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 245 

life". When there is a three-way tie, we use the Moon-Saturn pair if 
Moon is in lagna or 7th. That is not the case here. So we use the lagna 
and horalagna pair. This gives "middle life" as the longevity category 
(36-72 years). 

The 8th lord, Venus, and 8th lord from 7th, Mars, are in Aries. So 
Rudra is in Aries. Trishoola rasis are Ar, Le and Sg. Death can 
happen in one of the three dasas. 

As the 2nd house Sc is stronger due to the aspect of its lord, dasas 
start from Sc. As Sc is even, they go as Sc, Li, Vi, Le etc. Ar dasa 
starts after 56 years (56=24+24+8; 24 years for Sc, Li and Vi; 24 years 
for Le, Cn and Ge; 8 years for Ta). So Ar dasa starts on April 21, 
1945 and runs for 7 years. The native is likely to pass away in this 
period. 

Antardasa is tough to guess. The 8th lords from Ar are Mars and 
Ketu. They are in Sc in navamsa. The signs aspecting it are Ar, Cn, Sc 
and Cp. Of these, Sc is the strongest candidate as it is also the 8th from 
dasa rasi Aries. However, the native died in Aries antardasa itself 
(April 21,1945-Nov 21, 1945), due to the strength of Aries in rasi 
chart. Aries not only contains Rudra, but it is also the 7th house and it 
contains 2nd, 7th and 8th lords. It is a strong maraka sthana. 

This birthdata belongs to Adolf Hitler. History says that he 
committed suicide on April 30, 1945. Russian investigations after World 
War II supported this. 



23. Shoola Dasa 

23.1 Introduction 
We looked at "Niryaana Shoola dasa" used for timing one's death. 

There is another dasa called Shoola dasa that can also be used for timing 
death. It shows death, diseases, suffering and death of relatives. 
23.2 Computation 

Find the stronger of lagna and the 7th house. Dasas start there and 
always go in the regular zodiacal order. For example, if lagna is in Sc and 
Ta is stronger than Sc, dasas go as Ta, Ge, Cn, Le etc. If lagna is in Le and 
Aq is stronger than Le, dasas go as Aq, Pi, Ar, Ta etc. Each dasa is of 9 
years. Each dasa is divided into 12 equal antardasas. Antardasas are found 
using the same rules as dasas, but treating dasa rasi as lagna. If Cn dasa is 
running and Cn is stronger than Cp, then antardasas go as Cn, Le, Vi, Li etc 
and each antardasa will last 9 months. 

Human beings live in the womb for an average of 9 months. For animals 
with an average of gestation period of n months, each dasa and antardasa 
will be of n years and n months respectively. 

In mundane astrology, we can use Shoola dasa by compressing 108 
years to the time period of effect of the chart. For example, suppose we 
want compressed Shoola dasa for the swearing-in chart of an Indian Prime 
Minister. Then, 108 years of Shoola dasa are compressed to 5 years or 60 
months (which is the term of an Indian Prime Minister) and a dasa of 9 
years is compressed 60/12 = 5 months. 
23.3 Interpretation 

Like in Niryana Shoola dasa, dasa of a Trishoola rasi can bring death. 
Because the 2nd and 8th rasis in the natural zodiac are owned by Mars and 
Venus, rasi aspect on either of them by Moon generates Rudra yoga and 
rasis aspected by Rudra yoga planets can give death. 

This author found the following rules to hold true in many cases: 
"AL or the trines from it can give death. If malefics or marakas occupy 

or aspect the 3rd from AL or the 8th from AL, those 2 houses can give 
death." 

Lagna and 7th house both show the self of a person. They stand for the 
invisible and visible selves. Niryaana Shoola dasa starts from the 8th house 
from one of them. Niryaana Shoola dasa essentially shows the progress of 
the 8th house. It shows the motion of praana (life). That is why it has an 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 247 

uneven motion. It goes forward in some charts and backward in some 
charts. Also the lengths of dasas can be 7, 8 or 9 years. All this shows that 
different people have different motion of praana. When praana reaches 
Shiva's Trishoola or a powerful maraka rasi. the native can die. In 
Shoola dasa, however, the motion has a constant rate of 9 years per dasa 
and the order of dasas is always fixed. This fixed motion is like the 
motion of a quartz crystal. It is not the motion of praana and it must be a 
universal motion. It is suggested that Shoola dasas show the force of 
Lord Shiva. The force of Lord Shiva starts from one's self and moves at 
a constant rate in a fixed direction. So Shoola dasa rasi hitting Trishoola 
rasis is less significant than Niryaana Shoola dasa rasi hitting Trishoola 
rasis. In the case of Shoola dasa, death occurs when Shiva's motion hits 
AL or the trines from it or the houses of vitality from AL (3rd and 8th). AL 
is involved instead of lagna, because our existence is a maya (illusion) and 
what Lord Shiva destroys is the illusion of our existence. The physical 
body (lagna) simply merges with the material universe, when burnt or 
buried, and the perceived self or the maya of existence (AL) is what is 
completely destroyed by Lord Shiva. 
Lesson: Niryaana Shoola dasa shows the motion of praana (life). Death 
occurs when praana hits maraka rasis and the trines from Rudra (Trishoola 
rasis). Shoola dasa is the reverse. It shows the motion of Shiva. Death 
occurs primarily when Shiva's motion hits the trines from AL or the 3rd 

house from AL or the 8th house from AL. 
We have listed several rasis above. How do we choose one answer 

from the list? There are 2 criteria: (1) Usually a rasi occupied or aspected 
by AK or Jupiter does not kill a native, unless that planet happens to be 
Rudra. (2) Based on whether the native is of short/middle/long life, we 
are limited to just 4 dasas. The first 4 Shoola dasas (0-36 years) bring 
death to a person of the short life category. The middle 4 Shoola dasas 
(36-72 years) bring death to a person of the middle life category. The last 4 
Shoola dasas (72-108 years) bring death to a person of the long life 
category. We should choose a good candidate from those dasas. 
23.4   Examples 
Example 89: Let us revisit Example 84 that we analyzed using Niryaana 
Shoola dasa. 

Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Sc. They go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq 
etc Each dasa is of 9 years. First 5 dasas are over after 45 years. The 
native died in the 50th year. From his 45th year, the 6th dasa was running. So 
the 6th dasa of Ar killed the native. One can see that Ar is a trine from AL. 
It is the only trine in the middle life range. 



248 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Example 90: Let us revisit Example 85 that we analyzed using Niryaana 
Shoola dasa. 

Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Le. They go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc 
etc. Each dasa is of 9 years. First 5 dasas are over after 45 years. The 
native died in his 47th year. From his 45th year, the 6th dasa was running. So 
the 6th dasa of Cp killed the native. One can see that Cp is the only trine 
from AL in the middle life range. 
Example 91: Let us revisit Example 86 that we analyzed using Niryaana 
Shoola dasa. 

The 7th house Cp is stronger and dasas start from Cp. They go as Cp, 
Aq, Pi, Ar etc. Each dasa is of 9 years. First 7 dasas are over after 63 years. 
The native died in her 67th year. From her 63rd year, the 8th dasa was running. 
So the 8th dasa of Le killed the native. One can see that Le is a trine from 
AL and it contains the lord of AL. So Shiva destroyed the material existence 
of the native in Cp's Shoola dasa. 
Example 92: Let us revisit Example 87 that we analyzed using Niryaana 
Shoola dasa. 

Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Ar. They go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn 
etc. Each dasa is of 9 years. First 2 dasas are over after 18 years. The 
native died in the 23rd year. From his 18th year, the 3rd dasa was running. So 
the 3rd dasa of Ge killed the native. One can see that Ge is the 8th house 
from AL (see Table 3263) and it contains Rahu. In other words, Ge is 
afflicted and it is the house of longevity of material self. When Shiva's 
motion hit that rasi, the native died. 
Exercise 32: Consider the native of Chart 43. Using the method of three 
pairs, estimate whether he has short or middle or long life. Then evaluate 
Shoola dasa and identify the four dasas in the estimated longevity range. 
Consider the trines from AL and the 3rd and 8th houses (using Table 32). 
Think hard and choose the dasa that must have given death.  

23.5 Death of Near Relatives 
Shoola dasa shows Shiva's punishment. It shows misfortune, suffering 

and death. Using it, death of near relatives can also be timed. 
For each relative, we treat the house that shows him/her as lagna and 

find Shoola dasa based on it. Shoola dasa starts from the stronger of that 
rasi and the 7th from it. We have different names for Shoola dasas started 

63 The 8  house for the purpose of Rudra, the principle of 3 pairs and ayur dasa 
interpretation should be found from Table 32. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 249 

Chart 43 

 

from different houses. For example, Pitri Shoola dasa (pitri = father) starts 
from the stronger of 9th and 3rd houses. It is used in the timing of father's 
death. Bhratri Shoola dasa (bhratri = brother) also starts from the stronger 
of 3rd and 9th houses and it shows the death of younger siblings. Matri 
Shoola dasa (matri = mother) starts from the stronger of 4th and 10th houses. 
Dara Shoola dasa (dara = wife) starts from the stronger of 7th and 1st 

houses and it shows the death of wife (this dasa will be identical to the 
native's normal Shoola dasa). Putra Shoola dasa (putra = son) starts from 
the stronger of 5th and 11th houses and it shows the death of a child. 

We mentioned earlier that sthira karakas are useful in timing death. 
Sthira karaka of father represents father in a chart, for the purpose of 
matters controlled by Shiva (i.e. suffering and death). Pitri Shoola dasa 
shows the motion of Shiva's force for the father. When Shiva's force strikes 
trines from sthira karaka of father, father's death can take place. Trines 
from the corresponding arudha pada can also give death. 

Similarly, we can time the death of other near relatives. Let us see a 
couple of examples. 
Example 93: Let us consider the native of Chart 44. His father passed 
away in the second half of 1995. 

Exalted Sun joins Mercury and Jupiter aspects him. So Sun is stronger 
than Venus. He becomes sthira pitri karaka (fixed significator of father). 



250 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Death can occur in trines from him, i.e. Ar, Le and Sg. Pitri pada (A9, 
arudha pada of 9th house) is in Sg. Trines from it are the same. 

The 9th house is in Aq. Among Aq and Le, Aq is stronger as its lord 
Rahu is in a rasi with a different oddity. Dasas go as Aq, Pi, Ar etc. 

DasaofAq runs during 1971-1980. DasaofPi runs during 1980-1989. 
Dasa of Ar runs during 1989-1998. Death occurred in this dasa. As already 
noted, Ar contains sthira karaka of father and it is a trine from A9. 

Chart 44 

 
Example 94: Let us consider Indira Gandhi's birthdata given in Chart 61 
(in a later chapter). Her father Jawaharlal Nehru died in May 1964. Her 
husband Feroze Gandhi died in 1960. Her son Sanjay Gandhi died in June 
1980. 

Sthira karaka of father is Venus here, as he is in a dual rasi. He shows 
father, for the purpose of matters ruled by Shiva. Death of father can occur 
in the trines from Venus, i.e. Sg, Ar and Le. Pitri Shoola dasa starts from Pi 
(9th house) and goes as Pi, Ar, Ta, Ge etc. Le dasa starts after 5 dasas, i.e. 
in 1917 + 45 = 1962. It runs till 1971. Her father died in 1964 in this dasa. 

Jupiter is sthira karaka of husband. He shows husband, for the purpose 
of matters ruled by Shiva. Death of husband can occur in trines from Jupiter. 
Dara Shoola dasa starts from Cp and goes as Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar etc. Jupiter is 
in Ta and Ta dasa runs from 1917 + 36= 1953. It ends in 1962. Her husband 
died in 1960 in this dasa. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 251 

Jupiter is also sthira karaka of children. He shows children, for the 
purpose of matters ruled by Shiva. Death of son can occur in trines from 
Jupiter. Putra Shoola dasa starts from Sc (5th house and stronger than Ta) 
and goes as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc. Jupiter is in Ta and Ta dasa runs from 1917 
+ 54 = 1971. It ends in November 1980. Her son Sanjay Gandhi died in June 
1980. He died in Ta dasa. 
Exercise 33: Consider the rasi chart of a lady born in 1950, given in Chart 
45. Compute Shoola dasa and identify the dasas that can give death to her 
husband. Looking at the 3rd from sthira karaka for husband, guess whether 
the death was violent or peaceful. 

Chart 45 

 
23.1  Answers to Exercises 
Exercise 32: 

Method of three pairs: (1) Lagna lord and 8th lord is Venus and he is in 
dual rasi. Dual + Dual gives middle life. (2) Moon is in a fixed rasi and 
Saturn is in a dual rasi. Fixed + Dual gives long life. (3) Lagna and HL are 
in movable rasis. Movable + Movable gives long life. So the final result is 
"long life". This range covers 72-108 years. So the last 4 Shoola dasas can 
bring death. 

Shoola dasa: The 7th house Aries is stronger as it has the aspect of 
Sun, Mercury and its lord Mars. Dasas start from Ar and go as Ar, Ta, Ge, 
Cn etc. The first 8 dasas are over after 72 years (8 X 9). The 9th dasa of Sg 
runs during 72-81 years of age. The 10th dasa of Cp runs during 81 -90 years 
of age. The 11th dasa of Aq runs during 90-99 years of age. The 12th dasa 



252 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

of Pi runs during 99-108 years of age. These are the four dasas in the long 
life range. 

Death when: Arudha lagna is in Aq. The trines are Aq, Ge and Li. The 
only trine in the long life range, i.e. among the 4 rasis mentioned above, is 
Aq. Its dasa can give death. However, it contains Jupiter who is also AK. 
So its dasa is unlikely to kill. We can try the 8th house from AL. From Table 
32, we find that Cp is the 8th house from Aq. It is afflicted by Rahu here 
(just as in Example 92). So it is a good candidate. 

Final Answer: This chart belongs to Frank Sinatra, a legendary singer 
and actor of US. He died of a heart attack on May 14, 1998. He died in his 
83rd year. Shoola dasa of Cp was running then. 
Exercise 33: 

Shoola dasa starts from Sg and goes thus - Sg: 1950-1959, Cp: 1959-
1968, Aq: 1968-1977, Pi: 1977-1986, Ar: 1986-1995, Ta: 1995-2004, Ge: 
2004-2013. Sthira karaka of husband is Jupiter and he is in Cp. So death can 
occur in Cp, Ta and Vi. Of these, Cp dasa comes too early. Most likely 
candidate is Ta dasa (1995-2004). 

Sthira karaka for husband is Jupiter. The 3rd from him is Pi, occupied by 
Moon and Rahu. Mars also aspects it. So the death is likely to be violent. 

Husband of this lady passed away in a road accident in 2000. 



24. Kalachakra Dasa 

24.1 Introduction 
Sage Parasara said in his classic "Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram": 

It means, "there is another dasa called Kalachakra dasa, which is the 
most respectable of all dasa systems". Kalachakra literally means "the wheel 
of Time". It shows how the wheel of time unfolds events in the life of an 
individual. Parasara said that Lord Shiva explained this dasa to Goddess 
Parvati. 
24.2 Computation 

Nakshatras are divided into two groups - Savya (zodiacal) group and 
Apasavya (anti-zodiacal group), as shown in Table 42. Note that the first 3 
nakshatras belong to the savya group, the next 3 constellations to the apasavya 
group and so on. 

Table 42: Nakshatra Classification 
 

Savya Group Aswini, Bharani, Krittika 
Punarvasu, Pushyami, Aasresha 
Hasta, Chira, Swaati 
Moola, Poorvaashaadha, Uttaraashaadha 
Poorvabhaadrapada, Uttarabhaadrapada, Revati 

Apasavya Group Rohini, Mrigasira, Aardra Makha, Poorva 
Phalguni, Uttara Phalguni Visaakha, 
Anooraadha, Jyeshtha Sravanam, 
Dhanishtha, Satabhisha 

Parasara taught that we can draw Kalachakra (wheel of Time) by 
drawing 2 sets of 12 houses for savya and apasavya groups of nakshatras, 
then repeating them and distributing them between nakshatras. Savya means 
"zodiacal" and apasavya means "anti-zodiacal". 

We write the 12 rasis in one set (either zodiacally or anti-zodiacally). In 
the other set, we write their mirror images, i.e. the other sign owned by the 
same planet. The mirror image of Ar is Sc. The mirror image of Ta is Li. 
The mirror image of Cp is Aq. However, the mirror image of Cn is Cn itself 
and that of Le is Le itself, as they are the only signs owned by their lords. 



254 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

The main sequence and the mirrored sequence together form a sequence 
of 24 rasis. We have two such sequences - one for the savya group and 
the other for the apasavva group (see Table 43). We find antardasas and 
dasas by repeating these 24-rasi sequences and going through them. 

Table 43: Parasara's Kalachakra Basis 
Savya Group 

 

Main Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Mirrored Sc Li Vi Cn Le Ge Ta Ar Pi Aq Cp Sg 

Apasavya Group 
 

Mirrored Sg Cp Aq Pi Ar Ta Ge Le Cn Vi Li Sc 
Main Pi Aq Cp Sg Sc Li Vi Le Cn Ge Ta Ar 

The first pada (quarter) of Aswini is associated with the first 9 rasis in 
the savya group above (Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Sg). The dasa running 
at birth will be one of these 9 rasis and one will run dasas of 9 rasis starting 
from that rasi. One born with Moon at the beginning of the first pada of 
Aswini will run Ar dasa at birth and run Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc and Sg 
dasas after it. One born with Moon in the middle of the first pada of Aswini 
may run Le dasa at birth and run Vi, Li, Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi and Sc dasas 
after it. One born with Moon towards the end of the first pada of Aswini 
may run Sg dasa at birth and Cp, Aq, Pi, Sc, Li, Vi, Cn and Le dasas after it. 
Based on the elapsed fraction of the 1st pada of Aswini, we choose the 
initial dasa from the 9 rasis associated with that nakshatra pada and then 
proceed along Kalachakra and list 9 rasis starting from it. The second pada 
of Aswini is associated with the next 9 rasis in the savya group above (Cp, 
Aq, Pi, Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge). 

Like this, as we go from one nakshatra pada (constellation quarter) to 
the next in the savya group, we move from one set of 9 rasis to the next. 
When we reach the end of the 24 rasis, we go to the beginning. In this 
manner, we can find a set of 9 rasis associated with each nakshatra pada. 
The first of the nine rasis is called "Deha rasi" (body sign) and the last one 
is called "Jeeva rasi" (spirit/life sign). 

At the end of the 4th quarter of Aswini, the 1st quarter of Bharani starts 
and we do the same thing. We go to the next 9 rasis in the set of 24 rasis. 

We can do the same thing in the case of apasavya nakshatras and use 
the 24-rasi sequence given for the apasavya group in Table 43. In the case 
of apasavya nakshatras, the first rasi in the nine rasis corresponding to a 
nakshatra pada is called "Jeeva rasi" and the last one is called "Deha rasi" 
(note that the definition has reversed). 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 255 

For the sake of those who do not understand the above logic well enough to 
list the nine rasis associated with each nakshatra pada, they are explicitly 
given in Table 44-Table 47. For the purpose of these tables, we will divide 
savya and apasavya groups of nakshatras into two sub-groups each.

256 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

It may be noted in the tables above that there is a column called 
"paramaayush". This gives the sum of the dasas of the nine rasis associated 
with the constellation quarter. We now need to define the durations of various 
dasas. The duration of a dasa is based in its owner, as shown in Table 48. 
Two rasis owned by the same planet have the same duration. 

Table 48: Dasa Years in Kalachakra Dasa 
 

Rasi owner Rasis Dasa years 
Sun Le 5 
Moon Cn 21 
Mars Ar&Sc 7 
Mercury Ge&Vi 9 
Jupiter Sg&Pi 10 
Venus Ta&Li 16 
Saturn Cp&Aq 4 

Let us go through the procedure used in finding dasas and antardasas, in 
case it is not yet obvious to the reader: 
(1) Find the nakshatra pada occupied by natal Moon. Identify the 9-rasi 

sequence associated with it, using Table 44-Table 47. Also, note down 
the paramayush. 

(2) Find the fraction of the nakshatra pada that was covered by Moon at 
birth. 

(3) Find the same fraction of the paramayush. That represents the portion 
of the paramayush (dasas of the nine rasis) that was over before birth. 
Based on this, we can find which of the nine dasas runs at birth and 
how much of the dasa remains at birth. 

(4) After this dasa, we go to the next rasi in the nine rasis. When we finish 
the nine rasis of the nakshatra pada, we go to the nine rasis of the next 
nakshatra pada. After the nine rasis of the 4th pada of a nakshatra, we 
go to the nine rasis corresponding to the 1st pada of the next nakshatra 
(i.e. 1st pada of the constellations belonging to the other sub-group in 
the same group). For example, after the nine rasis of the 4th pada of 
Savya-1 constellations, we go to the nine rasis of the 1st pada of Savya-2 
constellations. After the nine rasis of the 4th pada of Apasavya-2 
constellations, we go to the nine rasis of the 1st pada of Apasavya-1 
constellations. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 257 

(5) In each dasa, antardasas start from dasa rasi itself. After the first 
antardasa, we go to the next rasi. After that, we go to the next rasi. 
And so on. We take 9 rasis starting from dasa rasi and antardasas will 
belong to those rasis. We distribute the dasa length among the 9 
antardasas proportionally (in proportion to their respective dasa lengths 
as given in Table 48). If we reach the end of the nine rasis corresponding 
to the nakshatra pada when counting 9 rasis from dasa rasi, we proceed 
to the next nakshatra pada as described in rule (4) above. 
All this may seem complicated to a casual reader, but it must be obvious 

to anyone who clearly understood Kalachakra shown in Table 43 and followed 
how Table 44-Table 47 are derived from it. A couple of examples may 
make this clearer. 
Example 95: Suppose Moon is at 15Ta50 in someone's natal chart. Let us 
find Kalachakra dasa for him. 

Moon is in Rohini 2nd pada,wvhich runs from 13Ta20 to 16Ta40. From 
Table 46, we find that the 9 rasis associated with this nakshatra pada are: 
Vi, Li, Sc, Pi, Aq, Cp, Sg, Sc, Li. 

Table 49: Calculation for Example 95 
 

 Vi Li Sc Pi Aq Cp Sg Sc Li 
Years 9 16 7 10 4 4 10 7 16 
Cumulative 9 25 32 42 46 50 60 67 83 

The amount of the nakshatra pada traversed by Moon is 15°50' - 13°20' 
= 2°30'. The fraction of the nakshatra pada64 traversed by Moon is (2°30')/ 
(3°20') = 150'/200' = 0.75. The same fraction of paramayush (83 years) is 
0.75 x 83 = 62.25 years. So 62.25 years out of the 83 years were over 
before birth. We see from Table 49 that 60 years were over by the end of 
Sg dasa and 2.25 years of Sc dasa added to it makes it 62.25 years. So Sc 
dasa was running at birth and 7 - 2.25 = 4.75 years of Sc dasa were remaining 
at birth. By adding 4 years 9 months to the birthdate, we get the date on 
which Sc dasa ends. Then Li dasa of 16 years will run till an age of 20 years 
9 months. With Li dasa, we finish the nine rasis associated with the 2nd pada 
of Rohini (Apasavya-1). So we go to the 3rd pada in the same table. The 

64 The complete length of each nakshatra pada is 3°20'. 



258 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

next 7 dasas65 will be Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg. Their lengths are as given 
in Table 48.66

Example 96: Suppose Moon is at 3Cn00 in someone's natal chart. Let us 
find Kalachakra dasa for him. 
Moon is in Punarvasu 4th pada, which runs from 0Cn00 to 3Cn20. From 
Table 44, we find that the 9 rasis associated with this nakshatra pada are: 
Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi. 

Table 50: Calculation for Example 96 
 

 Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Years 21 5 9 16 7 10 4 4 10 
Cumulative 21 26 35 51 58 68 72 76 86 

The fraction of the pada traversed by Moon is (3°0')/( 3°20') = 180'/200' 
= 0.9. The same fraction of paramayush (86 years) is 0.9 x 86 = 77.4 years. 
So 77.4 out of the 86 years were over before birth. We see from Table 50 
that 76 years were over by the end of Aq dasa and 1.4 years of Pi dasa 
added to it makes it 77.4 years. So Pi dasa was running at birth and 10-1.4 
= 8.6 years of Pi dasa were remaining at birth. By adding 8 years 7 months 
6 days to the birthdate, we get the date on which Pi dasa ends. With Pi dasa, 
we finish the nine rasis associated with the 4th pada of Punarvasu (Savya-
1). So we go to the 1st pada of Savya-2 nakshatras (Table 45). The next 8 
dasas will be Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar. Their lengths are as given in 
Table 48. 

Exercise 34: Suppose Moon is at 5Aq50 in someone's natal chart. Let us 
find Kalachakra dasa for him. 
Example 97: Let us find the antardasa sequences in the 1st, 2nd, 3 rd and 4th 

dasas in Example 95. 
The 1st dasa is Sc (from the 2nd pada of Apasavya-1 constellations). 

We should start from Sc and find 9 rasis. After Sc, we have Li and the 9 
rasis corresponding to the 2nd pada end there (see Table 46). So the next 7 
65 Parasara suggested taking the dasas of nine rasis starting from the rasi whose dasa is 

running at birth. Sc dasa was running at birth and Sc and Li dasas belong to the set of 
nine rasis associated with Rohini 2nd pada. We already have 2 rasis. So we just need 
7 rasis from the next pada. 

66 We again have the issue of solar years vs savana years. This author prefers savana 
years with all nakshatra dasas. Kalachakra dasa is a nakshatra dasa. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 259 

rasis should be taken from the 9 rasis corresponding to the next pada, i.e. 
3rd pada. So we get antardasas in Sc dasa as Sc. Li. Vi. Le. Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, 
Sg.67

Similarly, one can see that antardasas in Li dasa (2nd dasa) go as Li, Vi, 
Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp. Antardasas in Vi dasa (3rd dasa) go as Vi, Le, 
Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, Aq. Antardasas in Le dasa (4th dasa) go as Le, Cn, 
Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi. 

One can notice that dasa sequences and antardasa sequences all come 
from the two 24-rasi sequences given in Kalachakra (see Table 43). In the 
cases of dasas, the starting point in the 24-rasi sequence is determined by 
the nakshatra pada of Moon and the portion elapsed in it. In the case of 
antardasas, the starting point is based on dasa rasi. 

To learn how the lengths of antardasas are computed, let us take Le 
dasa as an example. We found that antardasas in Le dasa are Le, Cn, Ge, 
Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi. By adding the dasa lengths of these 9 rasis (see 
Table 48), we get 86 years. So we divide Le dasa of 5 years into 86 parts 
and give 5 parts to Le antardasa, 21 parts to Cn antardasa, 9 parts to Ge 
antardasa and so on. 

24.3 Interpretation 

24.3.1 Basics 
Dasa of a rasi gives the natural results of the rasi. For example, dasa of 

Pisces may give saattwik religious activities. Dasa of Aries may give 
enterprise or quarrels or wounds. 

More importantly, dasa of a rasi gives the results of the house and 
planets in that rasi. If Aries has the 5th house in D-7, its dasa may give 
children. If Pisces has the 8th house in D-6, its dasa may give diseases. If 
Gemini has lagna in D-24, its dasa may give all-round progress in the 
accumulation of knowledge. If Sc has AL in D-10 and its lord Mars occupies 
it, its dasa may bring good developments related to career and status. Dasa 
of a rasi containing the 8th from AL in D-10 may give a fall in status at 
workplace. Dasa of a rasi may also give the results of its lord. If Mars is in 
the 5th house in D-7, Aries dasa may give children. 

Samudaaya Ashtakavarga (SAV) plays an important role in deciding 
the results in a dasa. If a rasi has too many or too few rekhas in SAV of a 

67 However, we see from Example 95 that 2.25 years of Sc dasa were over before birth. 
So some of these antardasas may be over before birth. 



260 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

particular divisional chart, then its dasa may bring favorable or unfavorable 
results, respectively, relating to the significations of that house in that divisional 
chart. Usually dasas of rasis with 30 or more rekhas in D-10 SAV bring the 
best phases in one's career and dasas of rasis with 30 or more rekhas in in 
D-24 SAV bring the best periods for learning. One should keep SAV of 
various divisional charts with one when interpreting Kalachakra dasa. 
24.3.2 Deha and Jeeva Rasis 

In Table 44-Table 47, we listed the deha and jeeva rasis of different 
nakshatra padas. However, these hold for one born at the beginning of the 
nakshatra pada. One can have different deha and jeeva rasis based on the 
elapsed portion in the nakshatra pada. 
Deha and jeeva rasis are simply the rasis of the first and the ninth dasas 
in the case of one born in a savya nakshatra. In the case of one born in an 
apasavya nakshatra, deha and jeeva rasis are the rasis of the ninth and the 
first dasas. 
In Example 95, the first dasa is Sc and the ninth dasa is Sg. Since Rohini is 
an apasavya nakshatra, Sc becomes jeeva rasi and Sg becomes deha rasi. 
In Example 96, the first dasa is Pi and the ninth dasa is Ar. Since Punarvasu 
is a savya nakshatra, Pi becomes deha rasi and Ar becomes jeeva rasi. 

Deha rasi shows body and jeeva rasi shows the spirit. Benefics and 
malefics transiting in them affect them positively and negatively 
(respectively). If Jupiter, Mercury and Venus are transiting in one's jeeva 
rasi, one may exhibit a positive spirit and be cheerful. If Mars, Sun, Saturn 
and Rahu are transiting in one's jeeva rasi, one may be without any 
enthusiasm. If Mars, Sun, Saturn and Rahu are transiting in one's deha rasi, 
one may face accidents or death. 

24.3.3 Gatis (special movements) 
We see that dasas progress in a regular fashion in Kalachakra dasa. 

We either go as Ar, Ta, Ge etc or as Pi, Aq, Cp etc. However, some 
irregularities can be, found. The rasis whose dasas come after an irregular 
leap go by special names and special results are attributed to those dasas in 
classics. 
(1) A trinal leap (from Sg to Ar or vice versa; from Pi to Sc or vice versa) 

is called "Simhaavalokana gati" (lion's leap)68. 
68 Simhavalokana doesn't really mean a lion. It strictly means a lion's view of the jungle 

from an elevated vantage point. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 261 

(2) Temporary reversal of the direction is called "Markati gati" (monkey's 
leap). When we go as Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar etc in savya 
nakshatras, we temporarily reverse the direction when we go from Cn 
to Le. So Le is a markati gati rasi. Similarly, when we go as Ar, Ta, Ge, 
Le, Cn, Vi, Li, Sc etc in apasavya nakshatras, we temporarily reverse 
the direction when we go from Le to Cn. So Cn is a markati gati rasi. 

(3) Leaving one rasi and jumping over it is called "Mandooki gati" (frog's 
leap). When we go as Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar etc in savya 
nakshatras, we have 2 jumps - (i) from Vi to Cn and (ii) Le to Ge. So 
Cn and Ge are mandooki gati rasis. Similarly, when we go as Ar, Ta, 
Ge, Le, Cn, Vi, Li, Sc etc in apasavya nakshatras, we have 2 jumps - (i) 
from Ge to Le and (ii) Cn to Vi. So Le and Vi are mandooki gati rasis. 
The results attributed to various leaps are given in Table 51. 

Table 51: Results of gatis (leaps) 
 

Leap Savya nakshatras Apasavya nakshatras 

Lion Fear of animals, loss of friends, distress to Death of father or elders, 
near relations, fall in dungeons, danger loss of position 
from poison and weapons, fall from a 
vehicle, fever, destruction of house 

Monkey Loss of wealth, agriculture and animals, Danger from water, 
death of father or elders distress to father, loss of 

position, anger of rulers, 
wandering in the forests 

Frog Distress to relatives, elders and father, Distress to wife, loss of 
trouble from poison, weapons, enemies, children, fever, sickness 
thieves. In Le-to-Ge leap, death of mother and loss of position 
or, death of native, trouble from rulers and 
diseases are possible. 

In addition, Parasara listed the directions to prefer and the directions to 
avoid, while travelling and relocating, during different leaps. 
(1)     In the leap from Vi to Cn, east will give great results. One can take 

up an auspicious journey in the northern direction. 
(2)     In the leap from Le to Ge, east should be avoided. A journey to the 

southwest will be fruitful. 



262 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(3) In the leap from Cn to Le, a move in the southern direction results in 
losses. West is favorable. 

(4) In the leap from Pi to Sc and in the normal movement from Sg to Cp, 
there will be troubles in the northern direction. 

(5) In the leap from Sg to Ar, journeys should be avoided, as they may 
result in sickness, imprisonment or death. 

(6) In the normal movement from Sg to Sc, journeys will bring comforts, 
wealth and sexual pleasures. 

(7) In the leap from Le to Cn, western direction should be avoided. 

24.4  Practical Examples 
Example 98: The navamsa chart of a male who got married in Dec 1994 
is shown in Chart 46. 

Readers can verify that the native had about 5 years of Sc dasa left at 
birth and the next dasas are Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi, Sc, Li, Vi, Cn. At the time of 
wedding, the native was running Pi-Pi (Pi dasa & Pi antardasa). Why did 
Pisces give marriage? 

Well, it has lagna in navamsa and its lord Jupiter is in the 7th house! 
Naturally Pi and Vi are the front-runners for giving marriage. Moreover, Pi 
is the 2nd from Venus. Venus symbolizes domestic happiness and marital 
bliss. The 2nd from him in navamsa can show the sense of family happiness. 
It can show a new person coming into the family. 

In addition, one may note that exalted Venus occupies Pi in rasi chart 
and he owns darapada, which is in Libra. So Pisces is conducive to physical 
relationship and marital pleasures. 

Venus is in Aq in navamsa. While rasi shows what exists at the physical 
level, navamsa shows the inner self and the sense of connectedness. So Aq 
dasa can activate Venusian influence at navamsa level and give some 
romance. During Aq dasa (1990-1994), this native had a love affair with the 
lady he was to marry in December 1994. 
Example 99: The D-24 shown in Chart 47 belongs to an astrologer. He 
learnt astrology at a young age, but he has been seriously into astrology 
since 1993. In particular, 1996-2000 was a very fruitful period. Knowledge 
came to him like rain from monsoon clouds. He never felt as fulfilled as he 
did with the knowledge that came to him in 1996-2000. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 263 

Chart 46

One may note that about 3 years and 2 months of Sg dasa was left at 
birth and Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn etc dasas run after it. One may find that Gemini 
dasa of 9 years started in 1996. This dasa brought fine knowledge and 
intellectual satisfaction. Why? 

Gemini contains lagna in D-24. Lagna stands for all-round progress. 
This is D-24 and lagna in it shows all-round progress related to learning and 
knowledge. Its lord Mercury is in the 5th house of scholarship from lagna. 
So this dasa can increase scholarship. Mercury and Venus are in trines 
from Ge and they contribute to the prosperity of the indications of Ge. 
Moreover, Ge is very strong in D-24 with 34 rekhas in SAV. Any rasi with 
30 or more rekhas brings favorable results related to that house in that 
divisional chart. 

The strongest houses in this D-24 SAV are Le (36 rekhas), Ge (34 
rekhas) and Pi (33 rekhas). They are the 7th, 5th and 2nd houses from AL. As 
these are the houses conducive to recognition and awards, this D-24 
shows a person with academic achievements and associated recognition. 
With Ge being the 5th house from AL and also A5, this dasa can bring some 
reputation for his knowledge. So this dasa brings knowledge, scholarship 
and also recognition for it. 
Example 100: Let us consider the native whose D-12 is given in Chart 48. 
Father passed away in 1967. 



264 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 47 

 

We can see that about 1 year and 8 months of Pi dasa was remaining at 
birth and the dasas coming after it are Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta and Ar. Cn 
dasa started in September 1966 and Cn-Cn antardasa was running at the 
time of his father's demise. 

Chart 48 

 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 265 

Lagna in D-12 is in Vi. The 9th house is in Ta. The 9th house in D-12 
shows the relation with father and the associated happiness. It stands for 
the "concept" of father and paternal guidance. The "physical body" of the 
father is an illusion related to the concept of father and A9 represents it. 
So we can use the 9th lord or A9 to see the physical body of father. Here A9 
is in Cp. Taking Cp as lagna, we see that Cn is the 7th house of death and its 
lord Moon is exalted. Moon is not only exalted, but he afflicts Sun, who 
owns the 8th house from Cp. So Cn-Cn antardasa can result in the death of 
father. Moreover, Cn dasa here comes after Vi and involves mandooki gati 
(frog's leap). We see from the previous discussions that mandooki gati in 
savya nakshatras can bring distress to father. 
Exercise 35: The native of Example 100 lost his mother in Li-Li antardasa. 
Why? 
Example 101: Sri A.B. Vajpayee's birthdata and D-10 chart is given in 
Chart 3. He has been India's Prime Minister since March 1998. 

About 4.5 years of Vi dasa was left at birth. The dasas to follow are Le, 
Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp and Aq. His 4-year Cp dasa runs during 1998-2002. 

We can see that Cp has 31 rekhas in the SAV of D-10 and 34 rekhas in 
the SAV of rasi chart. Because Cp is strong in both charts, Cp dasa must be 
good. 

The houses having 30 or more rekhas are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th 

houses from AL. Most of these houses are important for fame and recognition 
(and AL is the most appropriate reference for judging fame and recognition). 
The strength of these houses in D-10 SAV means that the native has a 
successful and famous career. Being the 5th house from AL, Cp can bring 
reputation and power. Moreover, the lord of Cp is exalted in GL. In addition, 
Cp contains A5 in rasi chart and D-10. A5 shows the illusion associated 
with the 5th house matters. In D-24, A5 shows the illusion associated with 
scholarship (5th house), i.e. one's degrees, academic distinctions and awards. 
In D-10, it shows the illusion associated with one's following (5th house), 
i.e. the positions held and the power wielded by one. For this reason, the 
presence of A5 in Cp adds to the probability of power in Cp dasa. 
Example 102: Let us revisit Example 82. Chart 49 gives the D-20 chart of 
the devotee whose rasi chart was considered in that example. 

Ta dasa of about 9.5 years was left at birth. The dasas to follow are Ar, 
Pi, Aq, Cp, Sg, Ar, Ta and Ge. Pi dasa started in July 1987 and Sg antardasa 
in it was running when he moved to the monastery. 

Pi and Sg are owned by Jupiter and they can give religious knowledge. 
Pi is the 12th house in D-20 and Sg is the 9th house. The 12th house in D-20 



266 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

shows spiritual evolution and activities related to moksha. It has 33 rekhas 
in SAV and hence it is strong. So its dasa can take in the direction of liberation 
from material bonds and evolution of soul. 

Chart 49 

 

The antardasa sign Sg is the 9th house from lagna. The 9th house shows 
guidance. In D-20, it shows one's spiritual guru or organized religion or 
religious practices. It can also show pilgrimages. It can certainly show 
moving to a monastery. Darapada (A7) of D-20 is in Sg. The 7th house 
shows relations with others. Its arudha pada shows the illusion associated 
with relationships or the things based on which the world forms an impression 
about one's relationship with others. It shows the people one associates 
with. Darapada in D-20 shows the people one associates with, in one's 
spiritual life. So antardasa of the rasi containing darapada in D-20 can bring 
him to the people he will associate with for the rest of his religious life. With 
Sg containing Sun, natural significator of soul, and the nodes, his soul went 
through a churning during Sg antardasa and he wandered in forests thinking 
about what life is. But Sg is also the 9th house and its antardasa brought him 
to a monastery before its end. 

The next antardasa belonged to Ar, which contains lagna. So there was 
all-round progress in spiritual matters. Ar has 33 rekhas in D-20 SAV and it 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 267 

is strong. In addition, Ar contains A5 (mantra pada, arudha pada of the 5th 

house) and this antardasa may have brought some religious initiation and 
practice of some mantras. It should be noted that the 5th house in D-20 
shows one's devotion and bhakti in religious matters. A5 shows the maya 
relating to devotion, i.e. practice of mantras and religious rituals. 

One may note that the 3rd house (Ge) and A3 (Li) have 30 or more 
rekhas in the SAV. The 3rd house shows one's communication skills. In D-
20, it shows communication skills as applicable in religious activities. A3 
shows the associated illusion, i. e. the things based on which the world forms 
impressions about one's communication skills. It can show the books and 
articles authored by one. In D-20, it shows one's religious works. If one 
casts D-10 of this native, one will see that the 3rd house and A3 have 30 or 
more rekhas, in D-10 SAV also. Houses with 30 or more rekhas in SAV are 
strengthened as per Parasara. So the 3rd house and A3 are strong in both 
D-20 and D-10. One can conclude that this native will be a good communicator 
and will be known for some religious literature. In fact, he is already authoring 
a translation of "Sreemadbhaagavatam" into his mother tongue and travels 
with some ISKCON gurus as an interpreter. A lot of worthy religious 
literature and translations will emerge from the pen of this blessed soul in 
the years to come. 

Exercise 36: The lady whose rasi and navamsa charts are given in Chart 
50 was married in Sg dasa and divorced in the same dasa. Sg contains 
Venus, the significator of marriage. However, Venus also owns the 2nd and 
7th from upapada in rasi and navamsa. This dasa brought her marriage as 
well as divorce. Guess the antardasa that may have brought the marriage 
and the antardasa that may have brought the divorce.

Chart 51 

 

24.5 Conclusion 
Kalachakra dasa was called "the most respectable dasa of all dasas" 

by Parasara. There are many controversies regarding its computation. This 
book follows the approach that this author found the most acceptable based 
on his study of "Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram" and his practical researches. 
A significant percentage of this author's successful long-range life-phase 
predictions were made using Kalachakra dasa69 and that is his favorite 
dasa. 

When we learn a new dasa, the first question we should ask is "when 
should it be applied and what results should be seen in it". It is illogical to 
use 10 different dasas interchangably. Mixing up various dasas without 
knowing the subtle differences between them results in vague explanations. 
An intelligent astrologer will realize that different dasas are good at showing 
different kinds of events. Even when different dasas show the same 
event, they show it from different angles and focus on different 
aspects of the same event. Without appreciating this, one cannot 
understand why maharshis described tens, if not hundreds, of dasa systems. 

69 And, a significant percentage his successful short-term predictions (focussing on a 
period of one or two weeks) were made using Tajaka annual and monthly charts. 



270 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Hence it is important to learn when a dasa can be applied and what kind 
of results it shows. Some authors suggested that Kalachakra dasa applies 
only when Moon is stronger in navamsa chart than in rasi chart. However, 
this author opines that Kalachakra dasa is applicable to all people, as Parasara 
did not impose any conditions on its applicability and went to the extent of 
calling it "the most respectable dasa". 

Vimsottari dasa is based on the nakshatra of Moon. It throws light on 
the state of the native's mind as time progresses. It focusses on mind. 
Narayana dasa shows the progress of lagna in one's life and it shows the 
direction taken by one's life. The focus is no longer on mind, but it is on the 
real happenings. Of course, one's mental state directly depends on the 
direction taken by one's life and the real happenings in one's life. In that 
sense, Vimsottari dasa and Narayana dasa show the same events. But the 
focus is different. 

Kalachakra dasa depends on Moon's navamsa. Navamsa shows one's 
adherence of dharma or duty and throws light on the inner self. So the focus 
in Kalachakra dasa is state of the inner self and the sense of connectedness 
in one's mind. It shows how connected one is with respect to the events in 
one's life. For example, a political leader may be running D-10 Narayana 
dasa of a yogakaraka rasi and he may land political power. He may be 
running the Vimsottari dasa of Sun who may be exalted in D-10 and so he 
may be feeling powerful. However, if Kalachakra dasa of a weak and 
afflicted house in D-10 runs at the same time, his inner self may not feel 
connected with the events in his career and he may feel a void. On the 
other hand, if Kalachakra dasa rasi is strong and occupied by benefics in D-
10, then one may be successfully involved in activities that keep his inner 
self engaged. 

Narayana dasa specializes in showing what happens in one's life; Vimsottari 
dasa specializes in showing how one's mind views what happens in one's 
life; and, Kalachakra dasa specializes in showing how one relates to what 
happens in one's life and how connected one feels. These three are the 
most important of all general purpose phalita dasas. 

Different dasas do not provide different alternatives that can be used 
interchangeably to understand what happens in one's life, but they provide 
different angles - or vantage points - to view the same kaleidoscope that 
life is. 



Part 2: Dasa Analysis 271 

24.6 Answers to Exercises 
Exercise 34: 

Moon at 5Aq50 is in Dhanishtha 4th pada, which runs from 3Aq20 to 
6Aq40. From Table 47, we find that the 9 rasis associated with this nakshatra 
pada are: Sg, Sc, Li, Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar. 

Table 52: Calculation for Exercise 34 
 

 Sg Sc Li Vi Le Cn Ge Ta Ar 
Years 10 7 16 9 5 21 9 16 7 
Cumulative 10 17 33 42 47 68 77 93 100 

The fraction of the pada traversed by Moon is (2°30')/( 3°20') = 150'/ 
200' = 0.75. The same fraction of paramayush (100 years) is 0.75 x 100 = 
75 years. So 75 years out of the 100 years were over before birth. We see 
from Table 52 that 68 years were over by the end of Cn dasa and 7 years of 
Ge dasa added to it makes it 75 years. So Ge dasa was running at birth and 
9-7 = 2 years of Ge dasa were remaining at birth. By adding 2 years to the 
birthdate, we get the date on which Ge dasa ends. Then we run 16 years of 
Ta dasa and 7 years of Ar dasa. With Ar dasa, we finish the nine rasis 
associated with the 4th pada of Dhanishtha (Apasavya-2). So we go to the 
1st pada of Apasavya-1 nakshatras (Table 46). The next 7 dasas will be Sg, 
Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar, Ta, Ge. So we get the following calculations: 
Ge dasa (02 years): 00-02 years of age 
Ta dasa  (16 years): 02-18 years of age 
Ar dasa  (07 years): 18-25 years of age 
Sg dasa  (10 years): 25-35 years of age 
Cp dasa (04 years): 35-39 years of age 
Aq dasa (04 years): 39-43 years of age 
Pi dasa   (10 years): 43-53 years of age 
Ar dasa (07 years): 53-60 years of age 
Ta dasa (16 years): 60-76 years of age 
Ge dasa (09 years): 76-85 years of age 

Exercise 35: 
The 4th house is in Sg. A4 or the arudha pada of 4th house is in Vi. From 

Vi, Li is the 2nd house. Its lord Venus is in exalted in the 7th house and 



272 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

afflicts the debilitated 1st lord (all from Vi). So Li is a strong maraka rasi 
from Vi. So Li-Li antardasa resulted in the death of mother. 
Exercise 36: 
Let us take navamsa. Ge contains A7 in navamsa and can show a relationship. 
It contains the 3rd from UL (upapada lagna) and can show the start of a 
marriage. It is the 7th house from Venus. It is the 4th house of harmony and 
bliss from lagna. Its lord Mercury is exalted in the 7th house. Ge has 33 
rekhas in SAV. For all these reasons, Ge can be the antardasa. The 7th 

house Vi is also a candidate, but it is very weak with only 22 rekhas in SAV. 
For divorce, the 6th and 8th houses from lagna and the 2nd and 7th houses 

from UL are good candidates. The 6th and 8th houses from lagna bring 
marital troubles and quarrels. The 2nd and 7th houses from upapada bring the 
end of marriage. Here Li is the 8th house from lagna and the 7th house from 
upapada. It is the 7th house from upapada in rasi also. In navamsa, it has 30 
rekhas in SAV. While the 7th house has only 22 rekhas, the 8th house has 30 
rekhas and so the 8th house is strong. Evil houses, when strong, only bring 
evil results. 

Final Answer: The lady got married in Ge antardasa in Feb 1992 and 
got divorced in Li antardasa in late 1995. 
Exercise 37: 
Ta dasa of about 13 years was left at birth. Then Ge dasa of 9 years, Le 
dasa 5 years and Cn dasa of 21 years followed. Cn dasa ran during 1964-
1984. 

Cn is the 10th from lagna. Its lord Moon is in the 5th from lagna. 
Moreover, Cn contains AL and shows status in career. Its strength is decided 
by SAV. SAV of D-10 is shown below: 

 

 Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Rekhas 24 28 21 38 34 21 26 26 37 31 25 26

In SAV, Cn has 38 rekhas. That is exceedingly strong. With the rasi 
containing AL having 38 rekhas in SAV, the status of this actor must be 
high. He must be a well-known actor. And, Cn dasa must've brought excellent 
results and increased his stature as an actor. 

Final Answer. This chart belongs to Bill Cosby, one of the most gifted 
entertainers that the US television industry has ever seen. He had a successful 
acting career in films too. He came to limelight in 1965 with a lighthearted 
adventure TV serial called "I Spy". He was the first black American to star 
in a prime-time television drama series in US, and for his performances on 
the show he won the Emmy Award for best actor in 1966, 1967, and 1968. 
The onset of Cn dasa brought him status. 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 

The constant movement of planets in the skies is what is meant by the 
word "transits" in astrology. Planets keep moving. The relationship between 
(1) the positions of planets at a given time and (2) the positions of planets at 
a person's birthtime, will have a major impact on the kind of results that 
planets can give the person at the time. 

Position of planets at any given time can be found out from computer 
programs/software or ephemeris or almanacs (panchangas). Judging the 
results for a person based on those, given the natal (birth) chart, is the 
subject of this part. 

There are many special techniques in Vedic astrology for interpreting 
transits. Some of those techniques are explained in this part. 



25. Transits and Natal References 

25.1 Introduction 
By transits or gochaara, we mean the motion of planets in the skies. By 

the transit or chaara or gochaara position of a planet, we mean the position 
occupied by a planet at a given time. By the natal or radical or birth or 
janma position of a planet, we mean the position occupied by a planet at the 
time of one's birth. 

By correlating the transit positions on a given day with the natal positions 
of several reference points, we can draw some conclusions about the nature 
of results experienced by the native then. Some methods normally employed 
in such correlation will be studied in this chapter. 

25.2 Transits from Moon 

The most popular natal reference in transit analysis is Moon. Moon is 
the significator of mind and analysis of planetary positions with respect to 
Moon shows the mental state. Depending on the houses occupied by transit 
planets with respect to natal Moon, they exert different influences on one's 
mental state. The transit of Vimsottari dasa lord is particularly important, 
because he is the one who has the greatest influence on one's mental state 
during a period. 

The rasi occupied by Moon in the natal chart is called "janma rasi" and 
planets give different results when transiting in different houses from 
janma rasi. The standard results given in literature are given in Table 53 -
Table 59. 

These results are given only for reference. In reality, not everyone with 
the same janma rasi experiences the same results on a given day (or week 
or month). The results given by planets depend on what they stand for in the 
natal chart. For example, if Mars is the 5th lord in a natal chart, then the 
worries given by him during his transit in the 8th house from janma rasi may 
pertain to children. If Mars is the 10th lord in natal chart, then the worries 
given by him during his transit in the 8th house from janma rasi may pertain 
to career.

Chart 52 

 



280 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Example 103: Suppose someone has Moon in Ge in natal chart. Let us 
analyze the transits on June 7, 1999. The transit chart is shown in Chart 52. 

Janma rasi is Ge. Transit Jupiter and Saturn are in Ar, the 11th house 
from janma rasi. This is a good transit and shows gains. The native may 
have gains in the matters signified by the houses ruled and occupied by 
Jupiter and Saturn in natal rasi chart and natal divisional charts. Because 
Jupiter signifies children and tradition and Saturn signifies livelihood, the 
gains may also be related to children, traditional cermemonies, livelihood 
etc. 

Transit Sun is in Ta, the 12th house from janma rasi. That gives 
expenditure and losses. One may have losses in the matters signified by the 
houses ruled and occupied by Sun. Because Sun signifies authorities and 
health, it may also be related to those. 

Mercury is in janma rasi (Ge). This suggests "quarrels, imprisonment, 
losses, poor advice". However, Mercury is strong being in own house 
(intellectual Gemini). So the results may be intellectual debates and 
arguments. 

In this manner, we can analyze transits of all the planets. We can use 
the results given in literature, but we should adapt them intelligently to the 
chart at hand. We should understand what each planet stands for in a chart. 

In addition, there are natal references other than Moon, though Moon is 
the most important natal reference when interpreting transits. 

25.3   Other Natal References 
We can analyze transits with respect to lagna and paaka lagna. Lagna 

is the hub of vitality and one's personality in a chart. Using the ashtakavarga 
tables, we can decipher whether the transit of a planet in a house from 
lagna is favorable or not. We can see which house a planet is transiting in, 
with respect to natal lagna, and expect the planet to influence the matters of 
that house. The influence exerted by a transit planet on the house occupied 
by it depends on its inherent nature and its significations in the natal chart. 
For example, Jupiter transiting in the Ta may give marriage to someone 
born in Sc lagna, because Ta is the 7th house from Sc. Saturn transiting in 
Ar may give relationship problems or marital problems for someone born in 
Li lagna, because Ar is the 7th house from Li. 

We can also look at the aspects cast by transiting planets. Suppose 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 281 

Jupiter is transiting in Vi and someone has lagna in Sc. Jupiter aspects Ta, 
the 7th house from Sc, when he is in Vi. So Jupiter can give marriage during 
his Vi transit also. We can look at the aspects cast by transiting planets on 
the rasis containing the natal houses and the natal planets. Suppose someone 
has lagna in Sc and Venus in Pi in natal chart. Then the 7th house is in Ta 
and Venus, the significator of marriage, is in Pi. Jupiter transiting in Vi aspects 
both Ta and Pi and hence he may give marriage. 

Thus we should look at the rasis occupied and aspected by planets in 
their transit and find out which houses and planets occupy those rasis in the 
natal chart. Based on that, we should guess the results given by the planets. 
A planet occupying or aspecting a rasi in transit influences the matters 
signified by the houses and planets stationed in that rasi in the natal 
chart. The exact nature of the influence exerted by a planet depends on its 
inherent nature and the matters it stands for in the natal chart. For example, 
if the 5th lord in the natal chart is occupying the 8th house from natal lagna in 
transit, some troubles related to children may be expected. If Mars is the 8th 

lord in the natal chart and aspects, in transit, the rasis occupied by Venus 
and 7th lord in the natal chart, then some disturbances in marital life may be 
expected. 

Sahams are useful in transit analysis. Sahams are the significant points 
in the zodiac. For example, when the 7th lord or Venus transits close to 
vivaha saham, one may get married. When the 6th lord or 8th lord or Mars or 
Rahu transits close to kali saham, one may have an accident. 

A malefic planet transiting in janma rasi may give mental worries and a 
malefic planet transiting in natal lagna may affect the vitality of the native 
and create obstacles in his efforts. On the other hand, paaka lagna explicitly 
stands for the physical self and a malefic planet transiting in paaka lagna 
may give bodily complaints. Similarly planets occupying or aspecting arudha 
padas in transit may give relevant results. For example, Saturn's transit in 
A10 can be bad for career, Jupiter's transit in A9 is good for fortune and so 
on. 
Example 104: Let us consider the natal chart of a lady and the transit 
chart at the time of her wedding (see Chart 53). 



282 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 53 

 

The 7th house in the natal chart is in Vi. Mercury is the 7th lord and he is 
in Cn in natal chart. Venus is the significator of marriage and he is in Le in 
the natal chart. Vivaha saham is at 1° in Cp in the natal chart. If important 
planets influence these reference points in transit, they can give marriage. 

Jupiter is a natural benefic and also lagna lord here. His transit is important 
for timing auspicious events. On the day of wedding, Jupiter occupied Pi, 
aspecting Vi (natal 7th house) and Cn (has natal 7th lord). Natal 7th lord 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 283 

Mercury occupied Cp in transit and aspected Cn, rasi occupied by him in 
the natal chart. In addition, transit Mercury was stationed about 1° away 
from natal vivaha saham. Venus also aspected his natal position in transit. 

25.4 Transits and Divisional Charts 
Though the motivation for the approach described here comes from 

some principles described in classics, the actual approach is essentially based 
on this author's own researches. This author heard about "Bhrigu 
transits", which correlate the transit positions in navamsa chart with the 
natal positions in rasi chart. However, he does not know much about the 
tradition of Bhrigu transits to conclude whether or not his findings are loosely 
related to that tradition. 

Though this author prefers to teach only those approaches that have 
the sanction of maharshis, he finds this particular approach superior to most 
other techniques of transit analysis. Moreover, this approach does not violate 
any teachings of maharshis. This is also a fertile area for research and 
deserves our attention. Hence it will be covered here. However, readers 
are advised to keep in mind that what follows is a product of the very limited 
intelligence of this author and hence prone to errors. Readers are encouraged 
to question and to conduct further researches in this area. 

We said that a planet occupying or aspecting a rasi in transit influences 
the matters signified by the houses and planets stationed in that rasi in the 
natal chart. For example, we said that Jupiter transiting over Venus1 may 
give marriage. However, we know that navamsa is the chart that shows 
marriage. So, is there any significance for Jupiter's rasi chart transit over 
the navamsa of Venus? In other words, if Venus is in Cancer in navamsa, 
can Jupiter transiting in Cancer in rasi chart bring marriage? 

We do not have different zodiacs for different divisional charts. All the 
divisional charts use the same zodiac. So Cancer in natal navamsa chart 
and Cancer in transit rasi chart are not different. They are one and the 
same. If Jupiter transiting in Cancer can influence the house and planets 
stationed in Cancer in rasi chart, he should be able to influence the house 
and planets stationed in Cancer in navamsa chart too! We can extend this 
logic to all the divisional charts. 

Rasi chart shows everything that exists at the physical level. Divisional 
charts show various areas of life. The interaction between the two decides 



284 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

how events in various areas of life materialize at the physical level. Natal 
chart shows the innate potential. Transit chart shows the temporary 
influences. The interaction between the two decides how temporary 
influences convert innate potential into actions and life events. 

So the most important interactions are those between 
(1) a natal divisional chart and the transit rasi chart, and, 
(2) the natal rasi chart and a transit divisional chart. 

Here (1) shows how innate potential in a particular area of life is 
influenced at a given time to result in action at the physical level. This helps 
us in coarse timing of events. We can fine-tune the timing of events with 
(2), which shows how the potential at the physical level is transformed into 
an event in a particular area of life. 
Example 105: Let us consider the natal navamsa chart of a male engineer 
and the transit rasi chart at the time of his wedding (see Chart 54). 
In natal navamsa, Pi contains the 7th house and its lord Jupiter is in Aq. 
When we look at navamsa, we should look at the 9th lord. The 9th lord in 
navamsa shows the dharma followed. In Hindu life, the marriage ceremony 
is an act of dharma. Here Venus shows dharma. So Venusian influence over 
the 7th house shows getting married. In the transit rasi chart of wedding, 
Venus occupies Aq, which is 7th lord Jupiter's natal navamsa position. 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 285 

Chart 54 

 

Jupiter is in own sign in Pi in transit, which is the 7th house in natal 
navamsa. Moon owns the 11th house in natal navamsa and he shows gains 
in the matters of dharma and marriage. He is in Aries in the transit Rasi 
chart and Aries contains upapada in the natal navamsa chart. This shows 



286 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

the fructification, at the physical level, of gains in dharma due to marriage. 
Lagna lord Mercury is in Cp in the natal navamsa, showing dharmik self. In 
transit rasi chart also, Mercury occupies the same house. 

The key points will be summarized again: 
(1) Jupiter is in Pi in transit rasi chart and aspects Vi. Lagna is in Vi and the 

7th house is in Pi in the natal navamsa chart. 
(2) Venus is the significator of marriage and the lord of the 9th house 

(dharma) in natal navamsa. He is in Aq in the transit rasi chart. The 7th 

lord Jupiter occupies Aq in the natal navamsa chart. 
(3) Mercury is the lord of lagna and occupies Cp, in the natal navamsa 

chart. He is in Cp in the transit rasi chart also. 
Example 106: Let us consider the natal D-7 chart of a gentleman and the 
transit rasi chart at the time of the birth of his daughter (see Chart 55). 

D-7 shows children and happiness from them. The 5th house shows 
children. It is Vi here. Jupiter, the significator of children, and exalted Mercury 
occupy it. It may be noticed that both Jupiter and Mercury are in Vi at the 
time of child-birth. So 5th lord in D-7 and significator of children activated 
the 5th house of D-7 in their rasi chart transit and that gave a child. 
Example 107: Let us consider the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. Natal D-
11 and transit rasi charts are given in Chart 56. Natal rasi chart and transit 
D-l 1 charts are given in Chart 57. 

D-11 or Rudramsa is the chart that shows death and destruction. 
Considering that the native had a violent death in a plane crash, D-11 is the 
apt chart to see his death. 

In rasi chart, the 3rd house from AL shows the place and nature of 
death. It must have the aspect of a cruel planet for a violent death. Here the 
3rd house from AL is in Cp, a watery sign. It is aspected by Rahu from Le 
and a violent death in water is possible.

Chart 55 

 

 



288 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 56 
 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 289 

Chart 57 

 

Now, we must analyze D-11 carefully for a violent death. Natal D-11 
has lagna in Ge and Rahu occupies it. That is consistent with a violent 
death. The 2nd house in Cn is strong with its lord Moon occupying it. Sun is 
the 3rd lord - which shows physical vitality - and he joins the house of 



290 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

death, 7th, with 7th lord Jupiter. Mercury owns lagna and he is in 12th. This 
D-11 chart has unfavorable features. Now let us look at the houses occupied 
in transit rasi chart, with respect to this D-11, by the planets of life - Mercury 
(1st lord), Sun (3rd lord) and Saturn (8th lord) - and the planets of death -
Jupiter (7th lord) and Moon (2nd lord) and Rahu (a malefic in lagna). 

Two planets of life, Mercury and Sun, are in Cn, afflicted by Rahu. Cn 
is the 2nd house and stands for death in the natal D-11. Planet of death 
Moon is in Le (a house of life from natal D-11 lagna) and Jupiter aspects 
him, as well as his own 7th house (Sg). Saturn is debilitated. On the whole, 
the houses and planets of life in D-11 are afflicted or weak in the transit rasi 
chart. 

Now let us look at the interaction between the natal rasi chart and the 
transit D-11 (Chart 57). In rasi chart, Le is lagna and Sun is lagna lord. Le 
represents the native, Cp represents his accidents, Sun represents the physical 
body and Aq (7th) and Saturn (7th lord) represent death. Jupiter (8th lord) 
represents longevity. 

The natal rasi chart shows the existence of the native at the physical 
level. The transit D-11 represents the momentary forces of destruction and 
let us study its interaction with the natal rasi chart. 

In transit D-11, Le is afflicted by Rahu and 12th lord Moon. Jupiter, who 
represents longevity is in the 12th house. Sun, who represents the physical 
body in the natal rasi chart, is in the 6th house of accidents in transit D-11 
with exalted Mars, significator of accidents. The 7th lord in natal rasi chart, 
Saturn, represents the end of the native's life and he is in Sc in transit D-11, 
the same sign that contains lagna lord in the natal rasi chart. So the killer of 
the natal rasi chart (Saturn) interacts with the physical body (Sun) in the 
chart showing momentary forces of destruction (transit D-11). 
Exercise 38: For a native born on 4th April 1970 at 5:50 pm (IST) at 
Machilipatnam, India (81e12, 16n15), an important event related to D-4 
happened on 16th August 1991. Try to guess it based on the interaction 
between natal D-4 and transit rasi chart. Then analyze the interaction 
between natal rasi chart and transit D-4 also. 
Exercise 39: The native of Exercise 38 had an important event related to 
D-24 on April 17, 1998. Try to guess it based on the interaction between 
the natal D-24 chart and the transit rasi chart. 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 291 

25.5 Transits and Ashtakavarga 
Though one of the purposes of ashtakavarga is to assess the strength of 

planets and houses in natal charts, its most important purpose is the 
interpretation of transits. Just as we look at the house occupied by a transit 
planet with respect to natal Moon and natal lagna, we can look at the houses 
occupied by a transit planet with respect to all the eight references used in 
ashtakavarga. 

If a planet is benefic in its transit rasi with respect to 5 or more natal 
references, out of eight, then it will produce good results. If a planet is 
benefic in its transit rasi with respect to 3 or less natal references, out of 
eight, then it will produce bad results. Of course, the exact nature of the 
good or bad results given by a planet depend on its natural significations and 
its significations in the natal chart. 

To see this, we look at the number of rekhas in the transit rasi in the 
transiting planet's BAV. If, for example, Saturn's BAV of the natal rasi 
chart has 5 rekhas in Ta, then that means that Saturn is benefic with respect 
to 5 out of 8 natal references in Ta. So he produces good results when he 
transits Taurus. The same logic can be extended to the divisional charts. If 
Jupiter has 8 rekhas in Ar in natal D-10 chart, then his transit in Aries in rasi 
chart invariably brings excellent results in career. The matters that benefit 
depend on Jupiter's placement and ownership in the natal D-10 chart. 
Basically, Jupiter's rasi transit in Aries activates the manifestation of Jovian 
energy at the physical level in Aries. If Jupiter has many rekhas in his D-10 
BAV, it shows that Jovian energy in Aries goes well with most sources of 
energy in D-10 and thus it can have a significant impact on a native's career. 

A planet with 6 or 7 rekhas in its transit rasi in its BAV invariably brings 
excellent results. A planet with 1 or 0 rekhas in its transit rasi in its BAV 
invariably brings very poor results. 
25.5.1 Samudaaya Ashtakavarga 

In addition to looking at the transit planet's natal BAV, we should also 
look at the natal SAV - Samudaaya Ashtakavarga. If, for example, SAV 
has 40 bindus in Pisces, then it means that Pisces is very strong in the chart, 
Planets transiting in Pisces, tend to give good results irrespective of their 
strength. Of course, if a planet with 6 rekhas in Pi in its own BAV and a 
planet with 2 rekhas in Pi in its own BAV are transiting Pi, the former planet 



292 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

will produce better results than the latter planet. Rekhas in the individual 
BAVs of planets also matter, but SAV will dominate over the BAVs if it has 
too many or too few rekhas. 

Planets transiting in rasis with more than 30 rekhas in SAV usually 
bring favorable results. Planets transiting in rasis with less than 25 rekhas in 
SAV usually bring unfavorable results. 

Chart 58 

 
Example 108: Let us consider the D-l0 chart of Sri A.B. Vajpayee, 
India's Prime Minister (see Chart 58). His D-10 ashtakavarga is given 
below: 

 

 Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Sun 5 3 6 2 3 4 7 6 3 3 2 4 
Moon 2 4 2 3 6 6 4 4 4 6 3 5 
Mars 3 4 4 3 4 2 2 5 3 4 1 4 
Merc 4 4 6 4 6 5 3 6 4 5 4 3 
Jupi 4 6 4 2 3 8 3 6 4 3 7 6 
Venu 2 4 6 4 3 5 3 5 5 6 5 4 
Satu 3 1 5 2 3 3 4 3 5 4 2 4 
SAV 23 26 33 20 28 33 26 35 28 31 24 30 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 293 

He became India's Prime Minister on March 19, 1998 (see Chart 59). 

Chart 59 

 

Sun, Mars, Mercury and Saturn are all in Pi and Pi has 30 rekhas in SAV. 
None of them is too weak in individual BAV. Venus is GL lord in natal D-10 
and he is an important planet for power and authority. In the transit chart, he 
is in Cp. Cp has 31 rekhas and Venus has 6 rekhas. Moon is in Sc with 35 
rekhas. Jupiter is in Aq. Though Aq is not strong in SAV, it is strong in 
Jupiter's BAV. It has 7 rekhas in Jupiter's natal D-10 BAV. Jupiter's strength 
is important, as he is the Vimsottari dasa lord. 
So 6 out of 7 planets are in rasis that are very strong in D-10 SAV. And the 
7th planet is extremely strong in its BAV. Vimsottari dasa lord and natal GL 
lord have 7 and 6 rekhas respectively. 
So, as per ashtakavarga, transits are very favorable to Sri Vajpayee's career 
on March 19, 1998. 
Exercise 40: Consider the D-10 chart of a gentleman and the transit rasi 
chart during a crucial week in his life, given in Chart 60. What are the 
prospects for his career at the time of the transit? Do you expect good 
results or setbacks?

25.5.2 Kakshyas and Prastaara Ashtakavarga 
Each rasi is divided into eight kakshyas of 3° 45' each. Kakshya literally 

means "orbit". When a planet is in Saturn's kakshya, its placement with 
respect to Saturn is the most important. When a planet is in Jupiter's kakshya. 
its placement with respect to Jupiter is the most important. The first kakshya 
in each rasi starts from 0° in that rasi and ends at 3° 45'. Saturn is the ruler 
of the first kakshya. The start and end points and the lords of all the eight 
kakshyas are given in Table 60.

22° 30' 26° 15' Moon 
26° 15' 30° Lagna 

Example 109: Let us say Mercury is at 16° in Cn, Jupiter is it 24° in Vi and 
Venus is at 4° in Sc. Because 16° is between 15° and 18° 45', Mercury is in 
the kakshya of Venus. Because 24° is between 22° 30' and 26° 15', Jupiter is 
in the kakshya of Moon. Because 4° is between 3° 45' and 7° 30', Venus is in 
the kakshya of Jupiter. 

In the above example, Venus is in the kakshya of Jupiter and hence the 
placement of Venus with respect to Jupiter is more important than his 
placement with respect to other planets. Suppose the BAV of Venus has 5 
rekhas in Sc. Then Venus is benefic in Sc with respect to 5 out of 8 references 
and that is favorable. However, when Venus is at 4° in Sc, he is in Jupiter's 
kakshya and what matters the most is whether Venus is benefic in Sc with 
respect to Jupiter or not. If Jupiter is not one of the 5 references from which 
Venus is benefic in Sc, then Venusian transit between 3° 45' and 7° 30' in Sc 
will not be favorable. 



Part. 3: Transit Analysis 295 

Chart 60 

 
To find out whether Venus is benefic with respect to Jupiter in Sc or 

not, we can look at the Prastaara Ashtakavarga (PAV) of Venus. If we find 
that Venus is benefic with respect to Jupiter in Sc, we say that the PAV of 
Venus has a rekha in the kakshya of Jupiter in Sc. Each rasi has eight 
kakshyas and a kakshya has a rekha in a planet's PAV if that planet is 
benefic in that rasi with respect to the kakshya lord. 

A popular method of delineating favorable and unfavorable days is to 
look at the number of planets that are in a kakshya with a rekha. If too 



296 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

many or too few planets are in a kakshya with a rekha, favorable or 
unfavorable results may be expected (respectively). However, one should 
not use this principle in vacuum. It should be used only in conjunction with 
dasas, Tajaka charts and other transit analysis techniques. This principle 
can only be used to fine-tune a prediction to a few days. 
Example 110: Let us consider Indira Gandhi's assassination. Her chart 
and Jhe transit chart at the time of her assassination is given in Chart 61. 

Sun is at 14 Li 24. Because 14° 24' is between 11° 15' and 15°, he is in 
his own kakshya. Sun's PAV does not have a rekha in Sun's kakshya in Li. 
Sun is benefic in Li only with respect to lagna, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and 
Saturn. So only the corresponding kakshyas in Li have a rekha in Sun's 
BAV. 

It can be seen that Sun is in Sun's kakshya, Moon in Sun's kakshya, 
Mars in Moon's kakshya, Mercury in lagna's kakshya, Jupiter in Venus's 
kakshya, Venus in Mercury's kakshya and Saturn in Moon's kakshya. Only 
Moon and Mercury are in kakshyas with rekhas. 

With 5 out of 7 planets transiting in kakshyas without rekhas, including 
Vimsottari dasa lord Saturn, it is not a favorable time for Mrs. Gandhi. 

Again it must be emphasized that this technique can only be used in 
conjunction with other techniques and readers should not rush to predictions 
just based on this principle. 
25.6   Timing with Sodhya Pindas 

Parasara taught some techniques of timing events based on sodhya 
pindas. We can take the number of rekhas in any house from a planet and 
multiply the count with the planet's sodhya pinda. We can get a nakshatra 
from that product by dividing it with 27, taking the remainder and counting 
nakshatras from Aswini. Benefics and malefics transiting in the nakshatra 
will give good or bad results (respectively) relating to the original house. 
Especially Saturn's transit is important. Saturn's transit in the nakshatra 
corresponding to a particular house makes the signified matters suffer. 
Jupiter's transit is beneficial. Some people also take the 10th or 19th nakshatra 
from the nakshtra found above. A nakshatra and the 10th and 19th nakshatras 
from it are owned by the same planet under Vimsottari dasa scheme and 
they go together. 

We can also find a rasi by dividing the product with 12 instead of 27 and 
counting rasis from Aries. Saturn's transit in the resultant rasi brings 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 297 

Chart 61 

 

misfortune relating to the original house. However, nakshatras are more 
important. 

When we find houses from Sun, we should look at matters related to 
soul, inherent nature, personality, will power and father. Houses from Moon 
snow mind, wisdom, peace, happiness and mother. Houses from Mars show 
siblings, land and strength. Houses from Mercury stress on business, 



298 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

commerce, profession, friends and good behavior. Houses from Jupiter 
show the nourishment of body, learning, children and wealth. Houses from 
Venus show marriage, comforts, luxuries, vehicles and sexual pleasures. 
Saturn shows longevity, livelihood, fears, sadness, dangers and sorrows. 

When we want to time events relating to a particular matter, we should 
first fix the relevant planet. Then we should fix the relevant house. We 
should then find the number of rekhas in that house from that planet in that 
planet's BAV. We should multiply it by the sodhya pinda of the planet (also 
called yoga pinda). By dividing the product with 27 or 12 and taking the 
remainder, we should find the associated nakshatra or rasi. Then we can 
time key events based on the transits in that nakshatra and rasi. 

For example, suppose we want to time the good and bad periods of a 
native's father. Father should be seen from Sun and the 9th house. We can 
take Sun's BAV and find the number of rekhas in the 9th house from Sun. 
Suppose Sun is in Aq. Suppose Sun's BAV contains 5 rekhas in Li (the 9th 

from Aq). Suppose Sun's sodhya pinda is 86. Multiplying 86 with 5, we get 
430. If we divide 430 by 27, the quotient is 15 and the remainder is 25. The 
25th constellation is Poorvabhadrapada. So Saturn's transit in 
Poorvabhadrapada is bad for father and Jupiter's transit in the same nakshatra 
is good. Now let us find the rasi. By dividing 430 by 12, we get a quotient of 
35 and a remainder of 10. So Saturn's transit in Cp (the 10th rasi of the 
zodiac) is bad for father and Jupiter's transit in Cp is good. 

Though Parasara indicated that we can take any house from any planet 
and gave a long list of matters to be seen from each planet, he gave a few 
specific examples. A list of the matters is given in Table 61. 

Table 61: Timing with Sodhya Pinda

Sun 9th Father 

Moon 4th Mother 
Mars 3rd Siblings 
Mercury 10th Profession 
Jupiter 5th Children

Saturn 8th Longevity 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 299 

Some examples will be given now. However, this approach does not 
give consistent results. Readers should realize that the topic of sodhya pindas 
is open to research. Most astrologers use these principles with only the rasi 
chart. If matters relating to father have to be seen from D-12, as taught by 
Parasara, should we use D-12 when timing events related to father? Should 
we use the sodhya pinda and rekha count from D-12? Should we take the 
9th from Sun in rasi chart or take it in D-12? All these are issues that need 
to be researched. Moreover, as we have learnt, there are some 
inconsistencies between Parasara and Varahamihira in the definition of 
ashtakavarga and this can alter the sodhya pindas of Moon and Venus. In 
addition, we have some controversies in the exact definitions of the reductions 
to be done to get Sodhita Ashtakavarga from Bhinna Ashtakavarga. That 
can again alter sodhya pindas. Timing of events with sodhya pindas is a 
very important topic, but what the readers learn here may not be the final 
word. It is hoped that readers will experiment with an open mind and share 
their findings with other astrologers. 
Example 111: Let us consider Princess Diana, who died in a fatal 
automobile crash when Saturn was in Revathi star (Pisces). Her rasi chart 
is given in Chart 62. 

Chart 62 

 
To see longevity, we should use the 8th house from Saturn and Saturn's 

BAV. The 8th house from Saturn is Le. 



300 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 
 

 Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg C Aq Pi
Saturn's BAV 3 4 6 3 0 2 2 5 4 3 2 5

Le has 0 rekhas in Saturn's BAV. Saturn's sodhya pinda is 203. The 
product is 0. By dividing it with 27, we get 0 which is equivalent to 27. So 
we get Revathi star. By dividing 0 with 12, we get 0 which is equivalent to 
12. So we get Pisces. 

When Saturn was transiting in Revathi star in Pisces, she passed away. 
Example 112: Let us look at the rasi chart of software tycoon Bill Gates 
(see Chart 24). Despite Jupiter's simultaneous transit, Saturn's transit in 
Krittika star brought some troubles. In a landmark ruling in June 2000, a US 
judge ruled that his company- software giant Microsoft Corporation - was 
a monopoly and ordered a breakup into two smaller companies. 
Moon's BAV is shown below: 

 

 Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg C Aq Pi
Moon's BAV 4 3 4 4 6 3 1 5 5 4 4 6

Moon is in Pisces and Pisces has 6 rekhas. Moon's sodhya pinda is 
122. The product of 122 and 6 is 732. By dividing 732 with 27, we get a 
quotient of 27 and a remainder of 3. The 3rd star is Krittika (26 Ar 40 - 10 
Ta 00). So Saturn's transit in Krittika star can attack the 1st house from 
Moon - the mental state and happiness. 

Saturn shows sorrows, suffering and fears. The 6th house shows 
litigation. The 6th from Saturn can be used for sorrows and setbacks in 
litigation. Saturn's BAV is shown below: 

 

 Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi 
Saturn's BAV 3 3 4 4 7 2 1 3 2 4 3 3 

Here the 6th house from Saturn is Pi and it has 3 rekhas in Saturn's 
BAV. Saturn's sodhya pinda is 145. The product of 145 and 3 is 435. By 
dividing 435 with 27, we get a quotient of 16 and a remainder of 3. That 
again shows Krittika star. So Saturn's transit in Krittika star can bring sadness 
and setbacks related to litigation. 

As a result, he suffered an unfavorable ruling from a US judge. 
25.7   Conclusion 

Transit positions of planets are the positions occupied by them at a 
given time. Natal positions of planets are the positions occupied by them at 
the time of one's birth. Natal positions stand for the innate potential of a 
nativity and the transit positions show the temporary influences - planetary 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 301 

pulls and pushes. If their interaction is studied, some insight can be gained 
on the kind of results that are experienced at a given time. It is suggested 
that the interaction between the natal divisional charts and the transit rasi 
chart helps in coarse timing of events and the interaction between the natal 
rasi chart and transit divisional charts helps in fine timing of events. Some 
techniques based on ashtakavarga, kakshyas and sodhya pindas are also 
given in this chapter. 

25.8   Answer to the Exercises 
Exercise 38: 

Natal D-4 chart and transit rasi chart are given in Chart 63. Lagna is in 
Sg in natal D-4. The 9th house of fortune in a foreign land is in Le and it 
contains Rahu, the significator of foreign things. So Le stands for life in a 
foreign land in this D-4. Four planets occupy it in the transit rasi chart, 
including Jupiter, Mercury and Mars. Jupiter owns lagna in natal D-4 and he 
shows the native from the point of view of residence and fortune. Mercury 
owns lagna in natal rasi chart and he shows the physical self of the native. 
Mars owns the 12th house in natal D-4 and he shows living in distant places. 
All these planets activate Le in their rasi chart transit. So foreign journey is 
a possibility. In addition, Rahu is in Sg in the transit rasi chart and Sg contains 
lagna in natal D-4. So foreign influence on residence is fortified. 

Natal rasi chart and transit D-4 chart are given in Chart 64. Lagna in Vi 
shows the nativity. Rahu in Vi in transit D-4 shows foreign influence on Vi 
in the matter of residence. Since Vi represents the nativity in natal lagna, 
this D-4 transit supports going abroad.

Chart 64 

 

The 7th lord in the natal rasi chart is Jupiter and he is in Le in D-4. Le is 
the 12th house in the natal rasi chart. This shows a long trip. Aries (8th 

house) and Mars (8th lord) show changes in the natal rasi chart. Taurus (9th 

house) shows flourishing in a foreign land. Aries contains two malefics and 
Mars occupies Taurus, in transit D-4. This shows the changes in residence 
and the temporary troubles of adjusting to a foreign land. Interaction between 
the natal rasi chart and transit divisional charts shows finer and momentary 
details. 



304 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Final Answer. The native left his motherland and landed in USA on that 
date. 
Exercise 39: 
See Chart 65. The rasi transits that stand out are: (1) benefics Jupiter and 
Venus in Aq with Ketu and (2) three malefics in Ar, with two of them being 
very strong. 
Ar has the 11th house in natal D-24 and shows gains. It also contains Guru 
pada (A9 - arudha pada of the 9th house). Its lord Mars and exalted Sun 
occupy it in the transit rasi chart and that can show gains in the area of life 
represented by D-24, i.e. knowledge and learning. With A9 in D-24 activated 
by rasi transits, some developments related to guru are also possible. 
Now look at Jupiter and Venus. They are in Aq in the transit rasi chart. 
What does Aq stand for in the natal D-24? It is the 9th house and it shows 
one's teacher. Transit of Jupiter and Venus in it can show coming under the 
influence of a guru. 
Final Answer. The native was accepted as a sishya (disciple) by a Jyotish 
guru on the given date. 
Exercise 40: 
Sun, Mercury and Saturn have 6, 6 and 5 rekhas (respectively) in Libra in 
their D-10 BAV's. So their Libra transit is good for D-10 related matters. 
SAV contains 36 rekhas in Libra and that adds to it. Jupiter is also strong 
with 6 rekhas in Sg in his D-10. A few planets are very well-placed. Saturn 
is exalted in natal D-10 and he is exalted in transit chart also. On the whole, 
transits look very good. 
Final Answer. This D-10 belongs to Rajiv Gandhi, assassinated former PM 
of India. The transit chart belongs to the time when he became the Prime 
Minister of India.

26. Transits: Miscellaneous Topics 

26.1 Introduction 
In the chapter "Transits and Natal References", we concentrated on 

correlating the natal chart and the transit chart using the rasis occupied by 
planets in both. There are some principles about rasi transits that we haven't 
yet covered. We will cover a couple of concepts in this chapter. 

Nakshatras are also an important division of the zodiac and they are as 
important as rasis. By looking at the interactions between the nakshatras 
occupied by planets in the natal and transit charts, we can make some 
predictions about the results given by them at the time of the transit. We will 
look at a few principles. 
26.2 Murthis (Forms/Idols) 

To judge the results given by a planet during its transit in a particular 
rasi, find exactly when the planet enters the rasi. Find the house occupied 
by transit Moon at that time with respect to his own (Moon's) natal position. 
Based on the house, we say that the planet is in a golden or silver or copper 
or iron form during its transit in the rasi. The list of houses and murthis is 
given in Table 62. 

Table 62: Murthis 
 

House Murthi Meaning Results 
1st, 6th, 11th Swarna Golden form Highly favorable 
2nd, 5th, 9th Rajata Silver form Favorable 
3rd, 7th, 10th Taamra Copper form Unfavorable 
4th, 8th, 12th Loha Iron form Highly unfavorable 

Let us take Mercury's transit in Gemini during May 26,2000 - Aug 3, 
2000. Mercury entered Gemini at 3:06 pm (IST) on May 26, 2000. At that 
time, Moon was at 10° 29' in Aquarius. We should find which house Aquarius 
is with respect to natal Moon and then refer to Table 62 to find out which 
murthi Mercury is for a particular person during May 26-Aug 3,2000. 

Suppose someone has natal Moon in Aquarius. Then Moon at the time 
of Mercury's rasi entry is in the 1st house from natal Moon. So Mercury is 
a swarna murthi (golden form) for that person during his Ge transit and will 
give full results. Suppose someone has natal Moon in Pisces (e.g. Bill Gates, 
whose chart was considered earlier). Aquarius is the 12th house from Pisces. 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 307 

So Mercury is a loha murthi (iron form) during his Ge transit. That is highly 
unfavorable. Even if it is a favorable transit otherwise, Mercury may not 
give his full results. If it is an unfavorable transit otherwise, then Mercury 
will make the native suffer much. 
26.3   Rasi Gochara Vedha 

We listed the good and bad houses for all planets to transit from natal 
Moon in a previous chapter. Even when a planet is transiting in a favorable 
house from natal Moon, it may be "obstructed" by another planet transiting 
in the vedha sthana (house of obstruction). In that case, the planet cannot 
give its good results. The vedha sthaanas of all good transits of all planets 
are listed in Table 63. 

Table 63: Vedha Sthaanas 
 

Transiting Auspicious houses from natal Moon

Mars 3(12), 6(9), 11(5) 
Mercury 2(5), 4(3), 6(9), 8(1), 10(8), 11(12)

Venus 1(8), 2(7), 3(1), 4(10), 5(9), 8(5), 9(11), 
 11(6), 12(3) 
Saturn 3(12), 6(9), 11(5) 

Let us take Bill Gates, who has natal Moon in Pisces. Natal lagna and 
arudha lagna lord Mercury transits in Gemini during June 2000. As Mercury 
transiting in the 4th house from natal Moon is auspicious, this transit should 
bring good results. We can find the vedha sthaana for the 4th house transit 
of Mercury from the above table. It is the 3rd house. If there are planets in 
Taurus, the 3rd house from Pisces, then they cause vedha (obstruction) on 
Mercury. There were several planets causing vedha on Mercury on June 8, 
2000, when the company of Mr. Gates received a legal setback. With vedha 
from many planets, Mercury cannot give his good results. Moreover, Mercury 
is a loha murthi as we discussed earlier. 

This is how one should use the above table. Only exceptions are the 
father and son pairs: 

(1) Sun and Saturn do not cause vedha on each other. 
(2) Moon and Mercury do not cause vedha on each other. 



308 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

It is important to consider vedhas and murthis to understand why a planet 
expected to produce brilliant results gives only marginal results sometimes. 
26.4      Taras (Stars) 

26.4.1 Basic Tara Classification 
We can count constellations from the constellation of natal Moon to the 

constellation occupied by a planet in transit. Suppose natal Moon is in Makha 
and transit Mars is in Swaati. Counting constellations from Makha, we get 
(1) Maksha, (2) Poorva Phalguni, (3) Uttara Phalguni, (4) Hasta, (5) Chitra 
and (6) Swaati. So Swaati is the 6th constellation from natal Moon's 
constellation. 

Different constellations from the constellation of natal Moon stand for 
different things, as shown in Table 64. If a planet is in a bad tara in its 
transit, it cannot give its full results. If dasa lord and antardasa lord as per 
Vimsottari dasa are in bad taras, bad results can be expected. 

Let us take an example. Bill Gates has natal Moon in Uttarabhadrapada 
constellation. His company received an adverse ruling from a judge who 
ordered a breakup of the company, on June 8, 2000. Saturn and Jupiter 
were transiting in Krittika, Sun, Venus and Mars were in Mrigasira. From 
Uttarabhadrapada, Krittika is the 5th star, i. e. pratyak tara (star of obstacles), 
and Mrigasira is the 7th star, i.e. naidhana tara (star of death). With 5 planets 
transiting in bad taras, tara bala (strength of stars) was weak. 

Table 64: Taras 
 

Constellation (from Name Meaning 
natal Moon's 
constellation) 

1st, 10th, 19th Janma Tara Birth (mixed) 
2nd, 11th, 20th Sampat Tara Wealth (good) 
3rd, 12th, 21st Vipat Tara Danger (bad) 
4th, 13th, 22nd Kshema Tara Well-being (good) 
5th, 14th, 23rd Pratyak Tara Obstacles (bad) 
6th, 15th, 24th Saadhana Tara Achievement (good) 
7th, 16th, 25th Naidhana/Vadha Tara Death (bad) 
8th, 17th, 26th Mitra Tara Friend (good) 
9th, 18th, 27th Parama Mitra Tara Best friend (good) 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 309 

Taras are also used in muhurtas. At the time of an auspicious effort or 
when a new project is launched, transit Moon should not be in a bad 
constellation with respect to the natal Moon's constellation. 
26.4.2 Special Nakshatras/Taras 

In addition to the above general classification, we have a few special 
nakshatras for each person: 
(1) The constellation occupied by natal Moon is called Janma nakshatra. 

Janma means "birth" and this nakshatra shows general well-being. 
(2) The 10th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Karma 

nakshatra. Karma means "profession" and this nakshatra shows 
profession and workplace. 

(3) The 18th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Saamudaayika 
nakshatra. Saamudaayika roughly means "related to a crowd" and 
this nakshatra shows group activities. 

(4) The 16th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Sanghaatika 
nakshatra. Sanghaatika roughly means "belonging to group" and this 
nakshatra shows group/social activities. 

(5) The 4th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Jaati nakshatra. 
Jaati roughly means "community" and this nakshatra shows one's 
community. To be more correct, one's jaati shows people who belong 

    to the same class, nature and profession. 
(6) The 7th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Naidhana 

nakshatra. Naidhana means "death" and this nakshatra shows death 
and suffering. 

(7) The 12th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Desa nakshatra. 
Desa means "country" and this nakshatra shows one's country. 

(8) The 13th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Abhisheka 
nakshatra. Abhisheka means "coronation" and this nakshatra shows 
power and authority. This is also called Raajya nakshatra (kingdom). 

(9) The 19th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Aadhaana 
nakshatra. Aadhaana means "epoch/conception" and this nakshatra 
shows well-being of family. 

(10) The 22th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Vainaasika/ 
Vinaasana nakshatra. Vainaasika means "destructive" and this 
nakshatra shows one's destruction. 

(11) The 25th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Maanasa 
nakshatra. Maanasa means "mind" and this nakshatra shows one's 
mental state. 



310 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Benefics or malefics situated in these constellations in their transit bring 
good or bad results related to the area covered by the nakshatra. However, 
it should be kept in mind that the results will be with respect to the native. 
For example, malefics transiting in desa nakshatra may not ruin one's country. 
After all, any country has almost the same number of people with desa 
nakshatra in each constellation. When many malefics are transiting in desa 
nakshatra, one may be driven away from one's country or start hating one's 
country. Similarly, many malefics transiting in jaati nakshatra may alienate 
one from one's community. Many benefics transiting in karma nakshatra 
may give success at workplace. This is how these special nakshatras should 
be used. Sometimes, using these nakshtras gives special insights that cannot 
be gained by looking at any divisional chart. 

As an example, let us take Bill Gates who has natal Moon in 
Uttarabhadrapada. His jaati nakshatra is the 4th from Uttarabhadrapada, 
i.e. Bharani. His karma nakshatra is the 10th from Uttarabhadrapada, i.e. 
Pushyami. When Saturn was transiting in Bharani, several people in the 
software community turned against Bill Gates and gave damaging testimonies 
in a lawsuit to determine whether his company was a monopoly employing 
unfair tactics against competitors. He was more or less alienated in the 
community of software entrepreneurs. At the same time, Rahu was transiting 
in Pushyami and that brought tension related to litigation at his workplace. 
Exercise 41: Consider a native born in Leo lagna. He has Moon also in 
Leo in Poorva Phalguni constellation. Let us say Jupiter is transiting in Sg in 
Poorvaashaadha constellation with Mars. Mars is a yogakaraka from natal 
lagna. Jupiter is transiting in his moolatrikona, in the 5th house from natal 
lagna and Moon. That's very favorable transit. Find out if transit Jupiter and 
transit Mars are in a special nakshatra. Based on it, try to guess the area in 
which the transit did good to the native. 
Exercise 42: For a native with lagna in Leo, natal Moon is in the 4th quarter 
of Dhanishtha. When the transit chart contains Saturn in Bharani, identify a 
possible result. 
Exercise 43: For a native with natal Moon in the 3rd quarter of 
Poorvabhadrapada and lagna in Virgo, transit of Mars in Aasresha 
constellation in Cancer brought material gains. Cancer is the 6th from natal 
Moon and 11th from natal lagna. Both are favorable transits and so it makes 
sense that this transit gave material gains. Now find out if Mars occupies a 
special constellation and, based on it, guess the nature of the gains.

26.5 Nakshatra-based Aspects 
Sun and Moon aspect the 14th and 15th constellations from them. Mars 

aspects the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 15th constellations from him. Mercury and 
Venus aspect the 1st and 15th constellations from them. Jupiter aspects the 
10th, 15th and 19<h constellations from him. Saturn aspects the 3rd, 5th, 15th and 
19th constellations from him. 

A natural benefic gives good results related to the constellations aspected 
by it and a natural malefic gives bad results related to the constellations 
aspected by it. 
Exercise 44: For the native of Exercise 42, transit Mars was in Swaati 
when transit Saturn was in Bharani. Identify the constellations aspected by 
Mars and see if any special constellations are included. If so, predict the 
possible result. 

26.6 Constellations and Body Parts 
When they are transiting in various constellations as counted from janma 

nakshatra, planets are said to dwell in different parts of one's body and 
correspondingly some standard results are attributed. These results are given 
in Table 65-Table 69. 

There are two different purposes for these tables: 
(1) We can find the standard results for planetary transits in different 

constellations with respect to the constellation of natal Moon. 
(2) If a native has a disease or problem in a particular body part, we may 

be able to use these tables and figure out the planet causing it. That can 
help us in deciding the right remedial measures. We can also take 
preventive measures before the transit.

Part 3: Transit Analysis 313

Table 69: Body Parts in the Transit of Saturn, Rahu and Ketu

If a planet dwells in the left hand in transit and some natural malefics 
aspect it or cause vedha on it, then the planet may give suffering related to 
the left hand. Some injuries to the left hand are possible then. 

Let us consider a native who has natal Moon in the 1st quarter of Visakha. 
He had some persistent pain in his chest in February 2000. Let us determine 
the planet responsible for it. 

One can find from Table 65 that Sun dwells in chest during his transit in 
the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th nakshatras from janma nakshatra. From Visakha, 
they are Uttaraashaadha, Siavana, Dhanishtha and Satabhisha. Sun transited 
in these stars during Jan 11-Mar 3, 2000. The chest troubles when Sun was 
dwelling in chest can be related to Sun. 

At the time Sun entered Capricorn in January 2000, Moon was in Ar 
and hence Sun is a taamra murthi (copper form) for people with natal Moon 
in Li. At the time Sun entered Aquarius in February 2000, Moon was in Ta 
and hence Sun is a loha murthi (iron form) for people with natal Moon in Li. 
Being a copper/iron form dwelling in the chest, Sun brought chest pains. 
26.7   Latta (Kick) 

Latta is a nakshatra-based planetary kick. Each planet has latta (kick) 
on a constellation based on its transit position. If a transit planet has latta on 
the constellation occupied by Moon (or lagna) in natal chart, then we may 
expect some unfavorable results related to the signification of the planet in 
natal chart. 



314 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Purolatta (forward kick): 
(1) Sun has latta on the 12th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward 

direction. If Sun is in Mrigasira, for example, he has latta on the 12th 

nakshatra from Mrigasira, i.e. Visakha. 
(2) Mars has latta on the 3rd nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward 

direction. If Mars is in Mrigasira, for example, he has latta on the 3rd 

nakshatra from Mrigasira, i.e. Punarvasu. 
(3) Jupiter has latta on the 6th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward 

direction. If Jupiter is in Krittika, for example, he has latta on the 6th 

nakshatra from Krittika, i.e. Pushyami. 
(4) Saturn has latta on the 8th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward 

direction. If Saturn is in Krittika, for example, he has latta on the 8th 

nakshatra from Krittika, i.e. Makha. 
Prishtha latta (backward kick): 
(5) Moon has latta on the 22nd nakshatra from him, reckoned in the backward 

direction. If Moon is in Anuradha, for example, he has latta on the 22nd 

nakshatra (backwards) from Anuradha, i.e. Dhanishtha. 
(6) Mercury has latta on the 7th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the 

backward direction. If Mercury is in Punarvasu, for example, he has 
latta on the 7th nakshatra (backwards) from Punarvasu, i.e. Aswini. 

(7) Venus has latta on the 5th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the backward 
direction. If Venus is in Mrigasira, for example, he has latta on the 5th 

nakshatra (backwards) from Mrigasira, i.e. Aswini. 
(8) Rahu has latta on the 9th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the backward 

direction. If Rahu is in Punarvasu, for example, he has latta on the 9th 

nakshatra (backwards) from Punarvasu, i.e. Uttarabhadrapada. 
If the 6th lord has latta on janma nakshatra (nakshatra occupied by natal 

Moon) or lagna nakshatra (nakshatra occupied by natal lagna) in his transit, 
then some troubles related to litigation or disease or enemies may be expected. 
If the 7th lord has latta on janma nakshatra or lagna nakshatra in his transit, 
then some troubles related to marriage or spouse or relations can be expected. 
If an important planet in the 10th house in natal chart has a latta on janma 
nakshatra or lagna nakshatra in transit, then some troubles in career may be 
expected. We usually see some loss related to the natal significations of a 
planet having latta on janma nakshatra or lagna nakshatra in transit. This is 
an important concept and readers should memorize the latta formulas. 
Example 113: Let us consider a native whose janma nakshatra is 
Poorvabhadrapada and lagna nakshatra is Hasta. Let us see if any bad 
result is possible, using lattas, on the evening of 5th December 1996. 



Pan 3: Transit Analysis 315 

Let us find if any planet has latta on Poorvabhadrapada or Hasta. 
Table 70: Latta Calculation for Example 113 

 

Planet Constellation Latta star Latta Latta 
occupied in count direction on 
transit 

Sun Jyeshtha 12th Forward Bharani 
Moon Hasta 22nd Backward Moola 
Mars Poorva Phalguni 3rd Forward Hasta 
Mercury Moola 7th Backward Hasta 
Jupiter Poorvaashaadha 6th Forward Poorvabhadr

apada 
Venus Visaakha 5th Backward Uttaraphalguni 
Saturn Uttarabhadrapada 8th Forward Aardra 
Rahu Hasta 9th Backward Mrigasira 

Natal lagna is in Virgo, as Hasta is in Virgo. There are two lattas on lagna 
nakshatra - Hasta. One is by 8th lord Mars and the other is by lagna lord 
Mercury. So bad results relating to 1st and 8th houses are possible. The 6th and 8th 
houses show accidents. 

However, latta on janma nakshatra is more important. Here Jupiter has latta 
on Poorvabhadrapada. Jupiter owns the 4th and 7th houses in the natal chart. So 
some misfortune related to vehicle or house or marital life is possible. 

The native had a vehicular accident on the evening of 5th December 1996, in 
which his car was totaled; i.e. it was so damaged that his insurance company 
found it cheaper to give a new car instead of repairing it. 

Exercise 45: Consider the chart of Bill Gates (see Chart 24). On 8th June 2000, 
his company received an unfavorable ruling from a US judge in a landmark anti-
trust lawsuit. Find if any planets had latta on janma nakshatra or lagna nakshatra 
at the time of the ruling. Find the common house related to those planets in the 
natal chart. 

26.8 Sarvatobhadra Chakra 
Definition: Sarvatah means "everywhere" or "entirely". Bhadra means 

"auspicious" or "well". Sarvatobhadra chakra is a chart that shows all-round 
well-being and all kinds of auspicious and inauspicious results. 



316 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Figure 3: Sarvatobhadra Chakra 

 
There are 9 X 9 = 81 squares in the chart. Middle 7 squares on the outer 

borders contains 7 nakshatras each. Abhijit (the last quarter of Uttarashadha) 
is included among the nakshatras. The innermost 5 squares contains 
weekdays and tithis (lunar days). The notation regarding tithis is: 
(1) The entry Nanda represents 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st and 26th tithis. 
(2) The entry Bhadra represents 2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd and 27th tithis. 
(3) The entry Jaya represents 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd and 28th tithis. 
(4) The entry Rikta represents 4th, 9th, 14th, 19th, 24th and 29th tithis. 
(5) The entry Poorna represents 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 30th tithis. 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 317 

Rasis are also included in the chart. Some consonants are listed in the squres 
just inside the border squares. All the squares lying on diagonals of the 
chart, except the central square of the chart, contain vowels. There are 16 
vowels and 20 consonants that are covered. We see that 16 (vowels) + 20 
(consonants) + 12 (rasis) + 28 (nakshtras) + 5 (tithis and weekdays) = 81. 
Vedha: When a planet occupies a nakshatra, it causes vedha (obstruction) on 
the contents of the squares along 3 lines. We can draw one vertical or 
horizontal line and two crossward lines starting at the nakshatra. Contents of 
the squares on the lines have vedha from the planet. 

Example 114: Let us say Saturn is in Punarvasu. We see that Punarvasu is 
on the eastern border. 

Drawing a horizontal line to the west from it, we see that the consonant h, 
rasi Cn, vowel au, tithis Bhadra (2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd and 27th), weekdays 
Monday and Wednesday, vowel am, rasi Sc, consonant y and constellation 
Moola are on this line. So Saturn in Punarvasu causes vedha on all these. 

Drawing a crossward line to the northwest from it, we see that the 
consonant k, rasis Ta and Ar, consonant d and constellation Poorva 
Bhadrapada are on this line. So Saturn in Punarvasu causes vedha on all 
these. 

Drawing a crossward line to the southwest from it, we see that the 
consonant d (alveolar), consonant m and constellation Uttara Phalguni are on 
this line. So Saturn in Punarvasu causes vedha on all these. 
Exercise 46: Find all the consonants, vowels, tithis, weekdays, rasis and 
constellations on which Venus in Makha has vedha. 
There are some special principles: 

(1) A planet in the first quarter of Krittika or the last quarter of Bharani has vedha 
on the vowel "a" which is in the northeastern corner. A similar thing applies 
to all the vowels in corners. 

(2) If an vowel has vedha, its similar vowel (e.g. a and aa, i and ee, u and uu) 
also has vedha from the same planet. 

(3) Some consonants are not covered in this chart. Planets in Ardra have vedha 
on g, chh and ng (nasal). Planets in Hasta have vedha on h, n (alveolar) and 
th (alveolar). Planets in Poorvashadha have vedha on dh (dental), ph and dh 
(alveolar). Planets in Uttara Bhadrapada have vedha on th (dental), jh and nch 
(nasal). 

(4) If a planet has vedha on one of the following pairs of consonants, it has vedha 
on the other one too: b & v; s & sh (palatal); kh & sh (alveolar); j & y; ng & 
tr. 
 



318 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Using Sarvatobhadra Chakra71: We should find the following in the natal 
chart: 
(1) the constellation occupied by Moon or any special tara 
(2) the rasi occupied by lagna or any house of interest 
(3) the first/prominent consonant and vowel in the native's name 
(4) the tithi of birth (janma tithi) or a special tithi 
(5) the weekday of birth (janma vaara) 

We should study the vedha caused on these by different planets in their 
transit. Vedha by benefics (Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus) is favorable 
and vedha by malefics (Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu) is unfavorable. 
If several transiting benefics have simultaneous vedha on several natal points 
listed above, then good results may be expected. Malefics, on the other 
hand, give bad results. 

In addition to considering janma nakshatra, we can consider special 
nakshatras related to the matter of interest. Suppose we want to find the 
transit results related to career. Then we can take karma nakshatra of natal 
chart and see the vedhas on it in transit chart. 

Similarly, we can take the tithi corresponding to the matter of interest. 
For example, we can take "karma tithi" (lunar day of profession) instead of 
janma tithi when finding transit results related to career. 

Readers should refer to the first chapter for the procedure of finding 
tithis. Karma tithi is a little different from normal tithi. To find karma tithi, 
we multiply the difference between Moon's longitude and Sun's longitude 
with 10 and reduce the product to a value between 0° and 360° (by adding or 
subtracting multiples of 360°). We divide it by 12 and add 1 to the quotient. 
That gives a number between 1 and 30 and that represents "karma tithi". 
Karma tithi changes 10 times as fast as normal tithi. Similarly "dhana tithi" 
(lunar day of wealth) changes twice as fast as normal tithi. We can find a 
tithi for several matters. The tithi relevant to the matter of interest should be 
used when finding vedha of transiting planets on tithis (Nanda, Bhadra, 
Jaya, Rikta and Poorna). 

Let us take an example. If the 10th house, karma nakshatra, karma tithi 
and janma vaara all have the vedha of a couple of transiting benefics, then 
some good developments may take place in the native's career. If they 
have the vedha of a couple of malefics (instead of benefics), then we can 
expect setbacks in the native's career. In this manner, we study the impact 
of transits on important tithis, janma vaara, important nakshatras and 

71 This author's experience in the use of Sarvatobhadra Chakra is very very limited. 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 319 

important houses in natal chart. If just one natal reference has vedha from 
just one planet, we cannot make any predictions. But, if 2-3 natal reference 
have vedha from a couple of benefic/malefic transit planets, then we can be 
more confident. However, a prediction should be made only if dasas and 
Tajaka charts also show an event. 
Example 115: Let us consider the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. The data 
of birth and death can be found in Example 107. 

Janma tithi is Sukla Ashtami (8th tithi) and it belongs to the Jaya group. 
Janma vaara is Thursday72. Janma nakshatra is Dhanishtha. Vainasika 
nakshatra (destruction) is in Anooradha. Naidhana nakshatra (constellation 
of death) is in Bharani. If all these natal reference points have vedha from 
a couple of natural malefics, then death is more likely on other days. Of 
course, one will not die whenever this happens, but this will increase the 
chances of death. 

In the transit chart, Saturn is in naidhana nakshatra Bharani. Mars is in 
Swati. Rahu is in Asresha. Ketu is in Sravanam. 

If we draw crossward lines from Ketu in Sravanam and Saturn in 
Bharani, we can see that they intersect in the square containing Jaya and 
Thursday. So janma tithi (Jaya) and janma vaara (Thursday) have vedha 
from Ketu and Saturn. Janma nakshatra Dhanishtha has vedha from Ketu 
in Sravanam and Rahu in Asresha. Vainaasika nakshatra Anooradha also 
comes under the vedha of Saturn in Bharani and Rahu in Asresha. The 
house of accidents Cp, which is the 3rd house from AL in natal chart, comes 
under vedha from Ketu in Sravanam and Mars in Swati. 

Considering that several key natal references are coming under the 
vedha of a couple of malefics, unfavorable results are possible. Considering 
the involvement of naidhana and vainaasika nakshatras, death is possible. 
Example 116: Let us consider Rajiv Gandhi's ascension to power in India 
on October 31, 1984. It was covered in Exercise 40. Rasi chart of Mr. 
Gandhi can be found in Chart 39. 

At the time of the event, Jupiter was in Poorvashadha, Venus was in 
Jyeshtha, Mercury was in Visakha and Moon was in Sravanam. Let us see 
if they have vedhas on any important natal references. Here are the vedhas: 
(1) Jupiter and Mercury both have vedha on Nanda and Sunday. Sunday is 

the weekday of birth. The tithi of power (5th) is Sukla Shashthi (Nanda 
group). 

72 As per the western calendar, Friday came at midnight and the native was born at 12:22 am. 
However, a new day starts at sunrise for Hindus. So it was still Thursday. 



320 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(2) Mercury and Moon both have vedha on Dhanishtha (abhisheka 
nakshatra - constellation of coronation). 

(3) Jupiter and Venus both have vedha on Sg, which is the 5th house of 
power in natal chart. 

(4) Mercury and Venus both have vedha on Libra, which contains GL in 
natal chart. GL is the seat of power. 
So janma vaara, an important tithi, an important nakshatra and two 

important rasis in natal chart have vedha from two benefic planets each. 
This is conducive to getting political power. 
Example 117: Let us continue with the same native. Rajiv Gandhi's party 
lost majority in the elections of November 22,1989. 

When he became India's Prime Minister in 1984, Jupiter was in 
Poorvashadha. Poorvashadha is karma nakshatra (constellation of 
profession). At the time of Mr. Gandhi's defeat in 1989, Saturn was in that 
constellation. 

Let us find vedhas by transit planets on the same natal references 
considered in the last example: 
(1) Nanda and Sunday have vedha from 3 malefics: Saturn in Poorvashadha, 

Rahu in Dhanishtha and Ketu in Asresha. 
(2) Dhanishtha is Abhisheka nakshatra (constellation of coronation). It is 

occupied by Rahu and Ketu has vedha on it. 
(3) The 5th house of power in the natal chart, Sg, has vedha from Mars and 

Saturn. 
For these reasons, transits were unfavorable from the point of view of 

political power. So Mr. Gandhi's party lost power. 
26.8 Conclusion 

Several important topics related to transits in nakshatras were covered 
in this chapter. One should carefully learn and practice all these classical 
nakshatra-based techniques. However, new students should not make 
predictions just based on these techniques. Any technique that divides people 
into 27 groups and gives the same result for everyone in the same group can 
be correct only to a limited extent. These methods should be used in 
conjunction with other chart-sensitive methods. 
26.9 Answers to the Exercises 
Exercise 41: 

Poorvaashaadha is the 10th constellation from Poorva Phalguni. So the 
favorable transit of Jupiter and Mars happens to be in the Karma nakshatra, 



Part 3: Transit Analysis 321 

which shows profession. So the good results to be experienced may be 
related to profession. 
Final Answer: The details belong to Rajiv Gandhi. He suddenly became 
India" s Prime Minister during the said transit. We gave his birthdata earlier. 
Exercise 42: 
Bharani is the 7th constellation from Dhanishtha, i.e. it is the naidhana 
nakshatra (death). Saturn is a malefic and the 7th lord - and hence a maraka 
- here. So this transit has the potential to bring death. Of course, not everyone 
with lagna in Leo and Moon in Dhanishtha dies then73, but death is a possibility 
during the transit. 
Final Answer: The details belong to John F. Kennedy, Jr. He died in a plane 
crash during the said transit. We gave his birthdata earlier. 
Exercise 43: 
Aasresha is the 12th constellation from Poorvabhaadrapada, i.e. Desa 
nakshatra. Being a debilitated malefic in desa nakshatra (country), Mars 
can drive him out of his country. That was indeed how Mars gave gains to 
the native of Chart 63 in the second week of November 1994. The native 
left his motherland India then.  
Exercise 44: 
Mars aspects the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 15th constellations from him. Mars in 
Swaati will aspect (1) Swaati, (2) Anooradha, (3) Uttaraashaadha, (4) 
Sravanam, and, (5) Bharani. Because natal Moon is in Dhanishtha, these 
are the 20th, 22nd, 26th, 27th and 7th constellations (respectively) from janma 
nakshatra. Out of these, 2 are special nakshatras. The 7th constellation is 
known as naidhana nakshatra and shows death. The 22nd nakshatra is known 
as vainaasika nakshatra and shows destruction. Mars aspects both. As 
seen in Exercise 42, maraka in the natal chart Saturn occupies naidhana 
nakshatra74. The predicted result is death.75

73 These transit principles based on nakshtra give good insight into future, but one 
cannot make predictions just based on them. 

74 In the natal chart, Mars occupies his Mrityu Bhaga (part of death). So his aspect over 
the two special constellations is also significant. 

75 It will be very hasty to predict someone's death just based on conjunctions and aspects 
on special nakshatras in transit. Out of the many people with the same nakshatra, only 
those people whose dasas and Tajaka charts also show death will die at the time of 
this death-inflicting transit. 



322 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Final Answer. As already mentioned, Mr. Kennedy passed away during 
this transit. 
Exercise 45: 
Rahu was in Punarvasu at that time. He had latta on the 9th from Punarvasu 
backwards, which is Uttarabhadrapada, i.e. janma nakshatra! So Rahu had 
latta on janma nakshatra. Mars was in Mrigasira at the time and he had 
latta on the 3rd from Mrigasira, which is Punarvasu, i.e. lagna nakshatra! 
Rahu occupies the 6th house in the natal chart and Mars owns it. So the 
setbacks given by their lattas on janma nakshatra and lagna nakshatra were 
related to the 6th house matters - litigation and enemies. 
Exercise 46: 
(1) Verical line in the northern direction has uu, d (alveolar), h, k, v, a, u and 

Bharani. 
(2) Crossward line in the northeastern direction has Asresha. 
(3) Crossward line in the northwestern direction has m, Le, Bhadra (2nd, 

7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd and 27th), Monday, Wednesday, Jaya (3rd, 8th, 13th 18th, 
23rd and 28th), Thursday, Cp, kh and Sravanam. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 

A sub-system of Indian astrology, popularly known as "Tajaka system", 
is extremely useful in making precise and pointed predictions. It considers 
planetary aspects and yogas different from those employed in other classical 
methods of Vedic astrology and it is closer to western astrology in terms of 
aspects and yogas. In fact, some scholars may validly question why Tajaka 
system is being covered in a book on Vedic astrology. There are no references 
to it in the works of Parasara, Jaimini and other maharshis. The oldest 
reference to these techniques to be found in the works of a respected 
authority on Vedic astrology is in 'Tajaka Neelakanthi", a work by 
Neelakantha who wrote a celebrated commentary on "Jaimini Sutras". His 
coverage of Tajaka system lends some authenticity to the system. One can 
only speculate whether Parasara talked about this system in parts that are 
possibly missing today. We will cover this system in this book, because 
some illustrious scholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and Dr. B.V. 
Raman, set the precedent by teaching this system. 

This system is based on solar return charts. When Sun returns every 
year to the position he occupied in the zodiac at the time of a person's birth, 
a new year is said to commence for the person and a chart drawn for that 
time is called "Tajaka annual chart" or "Tajaka varsha chakra". Analysis of 
this chart can give insights into what may be in store during the one year 
following the solar return. Results suggested in the annual chart can take 
place only if they are 'possible' based on natal chart also. However, annual 
chart often gives a finer insight into the year in question than natal chart. 

A few special dasa systems enable timing of events within the 365-day 
period of operation of an annual chart. 

Similar to the annual charts, "monthly solar return charts" (Tajaka masa 
chakras) can also be drawn and they are useful in analyzing a one-month 
period in depth. 

This part explains the casting and use of annual charts in giving precise 
predictions. 



27. Tajaka Chart Basics 

27.1    Casting Annual Charts 
Sun moves with respect to earth at the rate of 30° per month. He takes 

one year to complete one cycle through the zodiac. He returns to the position 
occupied by him at the time of one's birth after every one-year period. At 
the exact moment when Sun returns to the exact position he occupied at 
the time of a person's birth, a new year is said to commence in the life of 
that person. A chart can be cast for the commencement of the new year. 
This is called a Tajaka varsha chakra or a Tajaka annual chart76. The 
longitude and latitude of the birthplace must be used in casting this chart, 
irrespective of the place of living at the commencement of the new year. 
The commencement of a new year is called "varsha pravesh" by some 
people. Varsha means a year and pravesh means entry. 
Example 118: 
Let us take a native with this birthdata: 8th March 1967, 5:40 pm (IST), 73 E 
04, 26 N 18. Sun occupies 23° 50' 25" in Aq in his birthchart. Suppose we 
want to analyze the one-year period of March 2000-March 2001 using Tajaka 
annual chart. Then we should find the date and time when Sun enters 23° 
50' 25" in Aq in March 2000. We find that Sun enters this position at 4:41:21 
am on 8th March 2000. The native finishes 33 years and enters his 34th year at 
that time. 

We can erect a chart with the following data: 8th March 2000, 4:41:21 
am (IST), 73 E 04, 26 N 1877. That chart is called the native's Tajaka 
annual chart for 2000-2001. Rasi chart erected with this data is shown in 
Chart 66. Along with this rasi chart, we can draw all the divisional charts at 
this time. 

By analyzing this rasi chart and the associated divisional charts, we can 
find out the fortune of the native during the year. The matters shown by 
various divisional charts, houses, rasis, planets, arudha padas etc remain the 
same. To time events within this year, we have annual dasas. We will learn 
them in later chapters. 

76 Western astrologers also use similar charts and call them "solar return" 
charts. Some Indian astrologers call these "varshaphal" charts. Varshaphal 
means results for one year".  
77 Even if the native is living on the other side of the globe, we must still 
cast the annual chart for birthplace co-ordinates. So we are using the 
longitude and latitude of his birthplace here.

27.2 An Approximate Method 

The exact time of the commencement of new year is determined by 
finding the exact time when Sun enters the exact position occupied by him 
at the time of one's birth. However, this can be a laborious calculation to do 
manually. To make this task less challenging, some scholars devised 
approximate methods based on the number of days in an average solar 
year. A sidereal solar year has 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes and 12 seconds. 
Based on this, the amount of time to be added to the birthdata to find the 
varsha pravesh data is given in Table 71.

Procedure: 
(1) Find the birthday as per western calendar in the required year. 
(2) Find the years completed. Find the corresponding days, hours, minutes 

and seconds from Table 71. If the age is not in the list, express it as a 
sum of entries found in the table and add their values. For example, 
suppose someone finished 46 years. Then add the values given for 40 
years and 6 years. 

(3) Add the days found above to the weekday78 ofbirth and find the resulting 
weekday. Find the nearest date to the birthday found in (1) that falls on 
this weekday. A time equal to the birthtime on this date is taken as a 
reference. 

(4) Add the hours, minutes and seconds found in (2) to the reference date 
and time found in (3). The result is the date and time of the 
commencement of new year. 

(5) Find the planetary positions, lagna etc at this time for the longitude and 
latitude of the birthplace. 
Let us now revisit Example 118 and calculate varsha pravesh data using 

this approximate method. 
(1) Birthday is 8th March 1967. The 34th year starts in 2000. The birthday as 

per the western calendar is on 8th March 2000. 

78 Remember that the weekday in Hindu calendar changes at sunrise and not at 12:00 
midnight. 



328 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(2) Finished years are 33 = 30 + 3. Adding the entries of 30 years and 3 
years, we get 

 

 Days Mrs Min Sec
30  years: 2 16 34 54 (from Table 71) 
3    years: 3 18 27 30 (from Table 71) 
33  years (sum): 6 11 02 24 

(3) Birthday (8th March 1967) is a Wednesday. Adding 6 days to it, we get 
a Tuesday. We now have to find the Tuesday nearest to 8th March 
2000. It is 7th March 2000. The time of birth on 8th March 1967 is 5:40 
pm and we now take 5:40 pm on 7th March 2000 as the reference time. 

(4) We have to add 11 hours, 2 minutes and 24 seconds found in (2) to the 
reference time in (3). We get 4:42:24 am on 8th March 2000. 

(5) We find rasi chart and all divisional charts for the data: 8th March 2000, 
4:42:24 am (IST), 73 E 04, 26 N 18. 
Please note that the time found here is wrong only by 1 minute. In some 

examples, the error resulting from the approximation can be higher. However, 
this approximate method is very convenient and quick. 
NOTE: Errors due to ayanamsa and approximations in the calculation of 
Sun's longitude cause greater errors than this approximation. As long as 
one takes the correct nonlinear nature of ayanamsa change into account, 
there will not be any appreciable discrepancy in the varsha pravesh times 
found by people using different ayanamsas. But ignoring the nonlinear nature 
of ayanamsa results in considerable errors in varsha pravesh time. This is 
because lagna moves 360 times faster than Sun. Any small errors in Sun's 
longitude result in errors in lagna which are 360 times as large. 
Exercise 47: Find the varsha pravesh data for the 27th year of the native in 
Example 118 using (a) the approximate method and (b) the exact method. 

27.3  Casting Monthly Charts 
A year is divided into 12 months and a new chart can be cast at the 

commencement of every new month. This is called Tajaka maasa chakra 
or a Tajaka monthly chart. 

The commencement of a new month is called "maasa pravesh" by 
some people. 

A year is the period in which Sun moves by 360°. A month is the period 
in which Sun moves by 30°. 

Let us take the native of Example 118. He was born on 8th March 1967. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 329 

Sun was at 23° 50' 25" in Aq when he was born. On 8th March 2000, Sun 
enters 23° 50' 25" in Aq at 4:41:21 am (1ST) and anew year commences 
then. This is the 34th year in the life of the native. 

Along with the new year, a new month commences then. This is the 
first month of the year. This month ends and a new month commences after 
Sun moves by exactly 30°. Sun enters 23° 50' 25" in Pi on 7th April 2000 at 
10:38:06 am. The second month in the year commences then. We can cast 
rasi chart and divisional charts at that moment. Using those charts, we can 
predict events in the next one-month period. This month ends and the third 
month commences when Sun enters 23° 50' 25" in Ar. 

Thus, when Sun enters 23° 50' 25" in different rasis, we cast different 
monthly charts and use them for predicting the events in a one-month period. 
The thing to remember here is that "one month" is the time when Sun 
moves by exactly 30°. 

There isn't any good approximate method for casting monthly charts. 
Sun takes approximately the same time for moving by 360° and so we have 
an approximate method for annual charts. But the time Sun takes to move 
by 30° varies considerably from month to month. So there isn't any 
approximate method that gives decent results. It may be wise to exactly 
cast 12 monthly charts for the first year of the native and then find monthly 
charts in later years from them, using the approximate method given for 
annual charts. 

27.4   Casting Sixty-hour Charts 
A month is again divided into 12 shashti-horas. Each shashti-hora period 

consists of 60 hours, i.e. 2.5 days'. At the beginning of every shashti-hora, a 
Tajaka shashti-hora chakra79 (Tajaka sixty-hour chart) is cast. In the period 
corresponding to each Tajaka sixty-hour chart, Sun moves by 2°30'. 

In other words, we can cast a chart after every 2°30' motion of Sun and 
use that Tajaka sixty-hour chart to predict events in the 2.5-day period 
commencing then. There are exactly 12 such charts in a one-month period. 

For example, let us take the second month of the year 2000-2001 for 
the native of Example 118. The second month commences when Sun enters 
23° 50' 25" in Pi, i.e. on 7th April 2000 at 10:38:06 am. The first shashti-hora 
of the month also starts then. It ends and the second shashti-hora or 60-
hour period commences when Sun is advanced by 2°30', i.e. when Sun 

79 This is popularly known as just "Tajaka Hora Chakra". 



330 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

enters 26° 20' 25" in Pi. This happens at 11:40:51 pm (IST) on 9th April 
2000. If we cast a chart for that moment, we can make some predictions 
for the next 2.5 days. 

27.5 Conclusion 
In this chapter, we learnt what Tajaka annual and monthly charts are 

and how they are cast. When Sun re-enters every year the same longitude 
occupied by him at the time of one's birth, it signals the commencement of 
a new year in the native's life. We can cast a chart for that exact moment 
and predict events in the next one year based on that chart. We can also 
cast monthly charts and sixty-hour charts. 

These new years are based on the solar years and the commencement 
of new year is around one's birthday as per the modern western calendar. 
However, many Indians - especially south Indians - celebrate birthday as 
per the lunar calendar. In fact, most Hindu holidays are based on the lunar 
calendar. For example, birthdays of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna are 
celebrated based on the tithi and not based on the solar calendar. Lunar 
calendar is of great importance in Indian culture. Correspondingly, there are 
techniques based on the birthday as per lunar calendar. However, those 
techniques are beyond the scope of this book and we will restrict ourselves 
to solar birthday and Tajaka annual charts. 
27.6 Answers to Exercises 
Exercise 47: 
(a) Approximate method: 
(1) The approximate birthday of the 27th year is 8th March 1993. He 

completes 26 years then. 
(2) Adding the entries of 20 years and 6 years, we get 4 days 15 hr 58 min 

12 sec. 
(3) Adding 4 days to Wednesday (weekday of birth), we get Sunday. The 

nearest Sunday to 8th March 1993 is 7th March 1993. So we take 5:40 
pm on 7th March 1993 as the reference time. 

(4) Add 15 hr 58 min 12 sec to this reference time. We get 9:38:12 am on 
8th March 1993. 

(b) Exact method: 
Let us find the position of Sun at the above time. At 9:38:12 am (IST) 

on 8th March 1993, Sun is at 23° 50' 29" in Aq. Natal position is 23° 50' 25" 
in Aq. We have to subtract about 2 minutes of time to get Sun 4" behind. 
The correct varshapravesh data is - 9:36.18 am (IST) on 8th March 1993. 



28. Techniques of Tajaka Charts 

28.1 Muntha 
Muntha is a concept specific to Tajaka charts. Progress lagna in the 

natal chart at the rate of one rasi per year to get muntha in an annual chart. 
Suppose someone finishes 31 years and starts the 32nd year on a given date. 
Suppose we are casting the annual chart of the 32nd year. Suppose the natal 
chart has lagna in Sc. Then muntha in the annual chart will be the 32nd 

house from Sc, i.e. the 8th house from Sc (after expunging multiples of 12 
from 32). So muntha is in Ge. 

Muntha is very important in Tajaka charts. Muntha is as important a 
reference point in an annual chart as lagna. The reason may be obvious in 
the chapter on "Sudarsana Chakra Dasa". Some people find muntha in 
monthly charts by progressing natal iagna by 2°30' per month. This author 
takes a different stand and the readers may be able to appreciate this after 
reading the same chapter. 

Look at the planets in muntha. They tell us the nature of events in the 
year or month. For example, Jupiter in muntha may give good results, 
happiness from children and knowledge. Saturn in muntha may make one 
sluggish, unhealthy, frustrated and sorrowful. Of course, the strength of the 
planets influencing muntha also matters. For example, an afflicted and weak 
Jupiter in muntha may give loss of position, bad name and scandals. 

Position of muntha in various houses with respect to lagna in the annual 
chart also tells us the nature of events in a year. Situation of muntha in the 
9th, 10th and 11th houses is excellent. It gives prosperity, status and gains 
respectively. Situation of muntha in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th houses is also good. 
It gives health, wealth, success and fame respectively. Situation of 
muntha in the 6th, 8th and 12th houses is bad. It gives illness, troubles and 
expenditures respectively. Situation of muntha in the 4th house gives disputes 
and loss of position. Situation of muntha in the 7th house also gives troubles 
in marriage and many hardships. 
28.2 Aspects 

In Tajaka analysis, we consider the following aspects:80

80 These aspects are similar to the ones used in western astrology. Considering that graha 
and rasi aspects were mentioned by maharshis, the exact meaning and use of these 
special aspects needs to be further researched and correctly understood. The current 
understanding of scholars may be incomplete. Rishi prokta (words spoken by great 
sages) should form the basis of our knowledge, 



332 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(1) Trinal aspect: A planet has a strong benefic aspect on the 5th and 9th 

houses from it and on the planets in those houses. 
(2) Sextile aspect: A planet has a weak benefic aspect on the 3rd and 11th 

houses from it and on the planets in those houses. 
(3) Square aspect: A planet has a weak malefic aspect on the 4th and 10th 

houses from it and on the planets in those houses. 
(4) Conjunction: A planet has a strong malefic aspect on the planets in 

the same house occupied by it. 
(5) Opposition: A planet has a strong malefic aspect on the 7th house 

from it and on the planets in that house. 
(6) Semi-sextile aspect: A planet has a neutral aspect on the 2nd and 12th 

houses from it and on the planets in those houses. 
Deeptamsa is "the orb of an aspect". Deeptamsas of planets: Sun -

15°, Moon - 12°, Mars - 8°, Mercury - 7°, Jupiter - 9°, Venus - 7°, Saturn -
9°. If Venus is at 13° in Li, he will have a trinal aspect on Ge, but his aspect 
doesn't cover the entire rasi. Venusian aspect covers an angle of 7° from 
13° in Gemini mainly, though Venus may have a moderate aspectual influence 
on the entire rasi. So Venus mainly influences 6°-20° in Ge by aspect. 
Deeptamsa is the same for all kinds of aspects. 
28.3   Harsha Bala 

Harsha bala81 of seven planets is found by adding the strengths given 
by the following 4 sources of strength: 
(1) Sun in the 9th house, Moon in the 3rd house, Mars in the 6th house, 

Mercury in the 1st house, Jupiter in the 11th house, Venus in the 5th 

house and Saturn in the 12th house get 5 units. They get zero units in 
other houses. 

(2) A planet in exaltation or own sign gets 5 units (else zero units). 
(3) Feminine planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus and Saturn) get 5 units in the 

1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 9th houses. Masculine planets (Sun, Mars and 
Jupiter) get 5 units in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th, 11th and 12th houses. 

(4) If the new year starts in the daytime, masculine planets get 5 units 
each. If the new year starts in the night time, feminine planets get 5 
units each. 
A planet with 20 units of strength is exceedingly strong. A planet with 

15 units of strength is fully strong. A planet with 10 units of strength is of 

81 Harsha means "cheerful" and bala means "strength". This is the strength of 
cheerfulness. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 333 

average strength. A planet with 5 units of strength has only a little strength. 
A planet with zero units of strength has no strength at all. 
Example 119: Let us find Harsha bala of planets for the annual chart of 
Example 118. 
(1) Only Moon is in the prescribed house (the 3d house in Moon's case). 

He gets 5 units. 
(2) No planet is in exaltation or own sign. 
(3) Venus in 1st, Mercury in 2nd, Moon in 3rd are the feminine planets in 

prescribed houses. Jupiter in 4th is in the masculine planet in the prescibed 
house. 

(4) Because the new year started at 4:42 am, i.e. during the night, we give 
5 units each to the feminine planets - Moon, Mercury, Venus and Saturn. 
Adding all the sources, we get 15 for Moon. 10 for Mercury and Venus, 

5 for Jupiter and Saturn and zero for Sun and Mars. 
28.4   Pancha Vargeeya Bala 

Panchavargeeya82 bala is found using the following procedure: 
28.4.1 Kshetra Bala 

Kshetra bala shows the strength in rasi chart. A planet in own rasi gets 
30 units of Kshetra bala. A planet in a friend's rasi gets 15 units of Kshetra 
bala. A planet in an enemy's rasi gets 7.5 units of Kshetra bala. 
28.4.2 Uchcha Bala 

Uchcha bala shows how close a planet is from its exaltation point. A 
planet gets 20 units of uchcha bala if it is at its deep exaltation point (Sun: 
10° Ar, Moon: 3° Ta, Mars: 28° Cp, Mercury: 15° Vi, Jupiter: 5° Cn, Venus: 
27° Pi, Saturn: 20° Li). At 180° from its deep exaltation point, a planet is 
deeply debilitated and it gets 0 units of uchcha bala. 

We can find the longitude difference between a planet's position and its 
deep debilitation point and divide it by 180° to get the fraction that shows 
how far away it is from its debilitation point. By multiplying 20 units with this 
fraction, we get uchcha bala. 

For example, suppose Jupiter is at 8Vi30 (8°30' in Vi). So he is at 158°30' 
from the start of the zodiac. His debilitation point is 5° in Cp, i.e. 275°0'. 
The difference is 275°0' - 158°30' = 116°30'. Because this is less than 180°, 
we don't have to subtract it from 360°. 

82 Pancha means "five". Pancha vargeeya means "from the group of five". 



334 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Now 116°30'/180° = 0.6472. Multiply 20 with this fraction, we get 12.94. So 
Jupiter's uchcha bala is 12.94 (out of 20). 
28.4.3 Hadda Bala 

Each rasi is divided into several haddas and different haddas have 
different lords. Hadda is similar to D-30. Table 72 can be used for finding 
the hadda lords of planets. 

Hadda bala shows the strength in hadda. A planet in own hadda gets 15 
units of Hadda bala. A planet in a friend's hadda gets 7.5 units of Hadda 
bala. A planet in an enemy's hadda gets 3.75 units of Hadda bala. 
28.4.4 Drekkana Bala 

Drekkana bala shows the strength in drekkana chart (D-3). A planet in 
own rasi in D-3 gets 10 units of Drekkana bala. A planet in a friend's rasi in 
D-3 gets 5 units of Drekkana bala. A planet in an enemy's rasi in D-3 gets 
2.5 units of Drekkana bala.

25.4.5 Navamsa Bala 
Navamsa bala shows the strength in navamsa chart (D-9). A planet in 

own rasi in D-9 gets 5 units of Navamsa bala. A planet in a friend's rasi in 
D-9 gets 2.5 units of Navamsa bala. A planet in an enemy's rasi in D-9 gets 
1.25 units of Navamsa bala. 
28.4.6 Final Computation 

We find the sum of kshetra bala, uchcha bala, hadda bala, drekkana 
bala and navamsa bala and divide the sum by 4. The result is called "Pancha 
Vargeeya Bala". If it is below 5, the planet is weak. If it is between 5 and 
10, the planet has ordinary strength. If it is between 10 and 15, the planet is 
strong. If it is between 15 and 20, the planet is very strong. If it is above 20, 
the planet is extraordinarily strong. 
28.5 Dwaadasa Vargeeya Bala 

Consider the twelve divisional charts: D-l, D-2, D-3, D-4, D-5, D-6, D-
7, D-8, D-9, D-10, D-11,and, D-l 2. 

A planet is strong in a chart if it is in its exaltation rasi or its own rasi or 
a rasi owned by a friend. A planet is weak in a chart if it is in its debilitation 
rasi or a rasi owned by an enemy. Out of the 12 charts above, count the 
charts in which a planet is strong and count the charts in which a planet is 
weak. The difference gives Dwadasavargeeya83 bala. If a planet is strong 
in more charts, it is strong overall. If a planet is weak in more charts, it is 
weak overall. 

28.6 Lord of the Year 
Varsheswara or lord of the year is the most important planet during the 

year. His dasa brings important results. The following are the candidates: 
(1) Lord of the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the annual chart, based on 

whether the new year starts during the day or the night 

83 Dwaadasa means "twelve". Dwaadasavargeeya means "from the 12 groups". 



336 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

(2) Lord of natal lagna 
(3) Lord of Muntha 
(4) Lord of lagna in the annual chart 
(5) Triraasi lord of lagna in the annual chart (see Table 73) 

Table 73: Triraasi Lords 
 

Lagna Day Night 
Ar Sun Jupiter 
Ta Venus Moon 
Ge Saturn Mercury 
Cn Venus Mars 
Le Jupiter Sun 
Vi Moon Venus 
Li Mercury Saturn 
Sc Mars Venus 
Sg Saturn Saturn 
Cp Mars Mars 
Aq Jupiter Jupiter 
Pi Moon Moon 

If a candidate is strong as per panchavargeeya bala and has a benefic 
aspect on lagna, it becomes the lord of the year. 

After the five candidates are found, the candidates having a benefic 
aspect on lagna are short-listed. Out of those, the planet having the highest 
panchavargeeya bala becomes the lord of the year. If two candidates have 
similar panchavargeeya bala, the one becoming a candidate in more of the 
five categories listed above becomes the lord of the year. 

If none of the planet has a benefic aspect on lagna, even a malefic 
aspect may be accepted. If none of the planets has an aspect on lagna, we 
may take a candidate that is very strong as per panchavargeeya bala. 

If none of the candidates has a strong aspect on lagna and none of the 
candidates is very strong as per panchavargeeya bala, then we may take 
the first candidate (lord of the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the annual 
chart, based on whether the new year starts during the day or the night). 
Example 120: Let us consider the annual chart in Example 118. Let us 
find the candidates for the lord of the year: 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 337 

(1) The new year started at 4:41 am, i.e. night time. So we should take 
Moon and find the lord of the rasi occupied by him. Moon is in Pisces 
owned by Jupiter. So Jupiter gets the first candidacy. 

(2) Natal lagna is in Leo. So Sun gets the second candidacy. 
(3) Muntha is in Taurus. So Venus gets the third candidacy. 
(4) Lagna in the annual chart is in Capricorn. So Saturn gets the fourth 

candidacy. 
(5) Triraasi lord for lagna in Cp at night time is Mars, from Table 73. So 

Mars gets the fifth candidacy. 
The candidates are - Jupiter, Sun, Venus, Saturn and Mars. Of those, 

Venus occupies lagna and Jupiter and Saturn have a square aspect on lagna. 
All of them are malefic aspects. Sun has a semi-sextile aspect, which is 
neutral. Mars has a sextile aspect on Capricorn lagna from Pisces. He is 
also has the strongest panchavargeeya bala (13.7). So we conclude easily 
that Mars is the lord of the year. 
28.7 Lord of the Month 

We find the lord of the month in a monthly chart in the same manner. 
We have six candidates now: 
(1) Lord of the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the monthly chart, based 

on whether the new month starts during the day or the night 
(2) Lord of natal lagna 
(3) Lord of Muntha 
(4) Lord of lagna in the monthly chart 
(5) Triraasi lord of lagna in the monthly chart (see Table 73) 
(6) Lord of the year 

The rest of the rules are the same. 
28.8 Sahams 

28.8.1 Calculation 
Sahams are the significant points in the zodiac related to specific matters. 

For example, "raajya" means kingdom and "raajya saham" is a significant 
point in the zodiac related to obtaining kingdom. "Paradesa" means a foreign 
country and "paradesa saham" is a significant point in the zodiac related to 
going abroad. Each saham has a formula that looks like A - B + C. What 
this means is that we take the longitudes of A, B and C and find (A - B + 
C). This is equivalent to finding how far A is from B and then taking the 
same distance from C. However, if C is not between B and A (i.e. we start 



338 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

from B and go zodiacally till we meet A and we do not find C on the way), 
then we add 30° to the value evaluated above. 

For example, finding (Moon - Sun + Lagna) is equivalent to finding 
how far Moon is from Sun and taking the same distanced/row lagna. If we 
start from the longitude of Sun and go zodiacally till the longitude of Moon 
and do not find lagna on the way, then we have to add 30°. The list of 
important sahams is given in Table 74. For most sahams, the formula given 
as (A - B + C) is for daytime charts. For nighttime charts, it changes to (B 
- A + C). This will not be explicitly mentioned for each saham and a mention 
will be made only when there is a difference.

Example 121: Let us consider the annual chart of Example 118 and find 
artha saham (money), samartha saham (enterprise/ability) and vanik saham 
(commerce). 



340 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Let us use the formulas given in Table 74. Formula of artha saham is: 
2nd house - 2nd lord + Lagna. Because the chart is cast for the night time, 
we should reverse the formula. However, as the note in parantheses after 
the formula says, this formula should be used for both day & night. Lagna is 
at 10 Cp 50, i.e. 280°50'. The 2nd house is at 10 Aq 50, i.e. 310°50'. Lord of 
the 2nd house is Saturn and he is at 19 Ar 10, i.e. 19°10'. So artha saham = 
310°50'- 19°10' + 280°50' = 572°30'. We can add or subtract multiples of 
360° from a longitude to reduce it to the range 0° to 360°. By subtracting 
360°, we get 212°30'. This means that artha saham is at 212°30'. This means 
2°30' in Sc or simply 2 Sc 30. Now we have to check whether the C is 
between B and A in A - B + C. We have to check whether lagna (280°50') 
is between 2nd lord (19° 10') and 2nd house (310°50'). It is - if we start from 
19° 10' and go till 310°50', we do encounter 280°50' on the way. So we don't 
have to add 30°. 

Formula of samartha saham is: Mars - Lagna Lord + Lagna. Because 
this chart is cast for night time, we should make it Lagna Lord - Mars + 
Lagna. Lagna lord Saturn is at 19 Ar 10, i.e. 19° 10'. Mars is at 24 Pi 58, i.e. 
354°58'. Lagna is at 280°50'. So samartha saham = 19°10' - 354°58' + 
280°50' + 360°. We added 360° to make the result positive. We can always 
add and subtract multiples of 360° from any longitude. So samartha saham 
is 305°2'. If we start from 354°58' and go zodiacally till we reach 19°10' 
(when we reach the end of Pisces, we go to Aries), we do not encounter 
280°50'. So lagna is not between Mars and Lagna Lord. So we add 30°. 
Samartha saham is finally at 335°2', i.e. at 5°2' in Pi or simply 5 Pi 02. 

Formula of vanik saham is: Moon - Mercury + Lagna. Because this 
chart is cast for night time, we should make it Mercury - Moon + Lagna. 
Moon is at 15 Pi 14, i.e. 345°14'. Mercury is at 11 Aq 28, i.e. 311°28'. 
Lagna is at 280°50'. So samartha saham = 311 °28' - 345° 14' + 280°50'. So 
vanik saham is 247°4'. If we start from 345° 14' and go zodiacally till we 
reach 311°28' (when we reach the end of Pisces, we go to Aries), we cover 
a large arc of about 330°. On the way, we do encounter 280°50'. So lagna is 
between Moon and Mercury. So we don't have to add 30°. Vanik saham is 
at 247°4', i.e. at 7°4' in Sg or simply 7 Sg 04. 
28.8.2  Use of sahams 

If there are good yogas in an annual chart involving the lord of the rasi 
containing an important saham and lagna lord, then important events related 
to the matter of the saham may materialize during the year. 

We can also use sahams in natal charts. When Saturn or Rahu transits 
close to natal paradesa saham or jalapatana saham, for example, one may 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 341 

go abroad. When Jupiter occupies or aspects natal vivaha saham in transit, 
one may get married. Thus we can use sahams in natal charts also. NOTE: 
In western astrology, there are Arabian parts (e.g. part of fortune) which 
are similar to sahams. In fact, there are a lot of similarities between the 
techniques in Tajaka system and western astrology. 

Some people may suggest that Indians learnt Tajaka system from Arabs. 
This is possible. However, one must note that astrology as practiced in India 
is much superior in width and depth to astrology practiced in any other part 
of the world. Indian astrology is a big superset of which different astrological 
traditions of the world are but small subsets. One may speculate that Vedic 
astrology as taught by Parasara, Jaimini, Manu etc was very exhaustive in 
scope and experts in different branches of it traveled to different parts of 
the world in ancient times to establish the knowledge there. 



29. Tajaka Yogas 

29.1 Introduction 
Just as we have yogas in natal charts, we have special combinations 

with special results that are applicable to Tajaka annual/monthly charts. 
These are called Tajaka yogas. These yogas are applicable to Tajaka annual 
charts as well as prasna charts (horary charts). We will briefly go over their 
definitions in this chapter. 
29.2 Definitions 

29.2.1 Ishkavala Yoga 
If planets occupy only kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses) and 

panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses) and if apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th 
houses) are empty, then this yoga is present. This yoga gives wealth, 
happiness and good fortune. 
29.2.2 Induvara Yoga 

If planets occupy only apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses) and if 
kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses) and panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses) 
are empty, then this yoga is present. This yoga gives disappointments, worries 
and illnesses. 
29.2.3 Ithasala Yoga 

If two planets have an aspect and if the faster moving planet84 is less 
advanced in its rasi than the slower moving planet, then we have an ithasala 
yoga between the two. In western astrology, this is called an "applying 
aspect". 

Results: This is a good yoga and this shows fulfilment of the matters 
represented by the two planets in ithasala. Suppose we want to analyze 
prospects for a particular matter. Then ithasala involving lagna lord, lord of 
the related house, lord of the related saham or the naisargika karaka (natural 
significator) will show good results related to the matter. For example, ithasala 
between lagna lord and 7th lord (or the lord of vivaha saham or Venus) 
shows that the native may get married in the year. 

Example: Suppose Moon is at 14° in Le and Venus is at 19° in Li. They 
have a sextile aspect. Both the planets are within the deeptaamsa (orb) of 
the other. Moon's advancement in his rasi is 14° and Venus's advancement 

84 In the increasing order of speed, planets can be listed as: Saturn, Rahu/Ketu, Jupiter, 
Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and Moon. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 343 

in his rasi is 19°. Faster planet (Moon) is less advanced than the slower 
planet (Venus). So we have ithasala yoga. 

Types of Ithasala: There are 3 types of ithasala yoga. 
(i) Vartamaana ithasala yoga results when the planets aspect each other 

and both are within the deeptaamsa (orb) of the other planet. 
Vartamaana means present (current). In the above example, Venus is 
at 19° and his deeptaamsa extends from 12° to 26°. Moon is within his 
deeptaamsa. Venus is also within Moon's deeptaamsa. So we have 
vartamaana ithasala. 

(ii) Poorna ithasala yoga results when the planets aspect each other 
closely and their advancements in respective rasis are within 1° of 
each other. Poorna means complete. Poorna ithasala is the most 
powerful ithasala. It shows speedy fulfilment of the matter. In the 
above example, the difference between the advancements of Moon 
and Venus in respective rasis is 19°-14° = 50. This is more than 1°. So 
we don't have a poorna ithasala. Now let us say that Moon is at 18°25' 
in Le (instead of 14° in Le). Then also we have an ithasala because 
Moon is behind Venus. The difference between the advancements is 
only 0°35', i.e. less than 1°. So we have a poorna ithasala now. 

(iii) Bhavishya ithasala yoga is formed if vartamaana ithasala yoga is 
about to be formed when the faster moving planet moves by 1 ° or less. 
Bhavishya means future. Bhavishya ithasala shows fulfilment after 
some obstructions or delay. Suppose Moon is at 13°35' in Le and 
Venus is at 21°20' in Le. There is a sextile aspect. Moon's deeptaamsa 
is 12° and hence his sextile aspect on Li extends from 1°35' to 25°35' in 
Li (subtract and add 12°, Moon's deeptaamsa, from/to 13°35'). Venus 
is within Moon's deeptaamsa. However, Moon is just outside the 
deeptaamsa of Venus, as the deeptaamsa of Venus's sextile aspect on 
Le extends from 14°20' to 28°20' in Li (subtract and add 7°, Venus's 
deeptaamsa, from/to 21°20'). Moon is at 13°35' and this is outside 
Venus's deeptaamsa. So there is no vartamaana (present) ithasala. 
However, when Moon is the faster planet and he needs to move by 
just 0°45' (which is less than 1°) to come to 14°20'. Once he comes to 
14°20', he is within the deeptaamsa of Venus's aspect on Le and we 
have a vartamaana ithasala yoga. So we have a bhavishya (future) 
ithasala yoga when Moon is at 13°35' in Le. 

Special Notes: One should understand the meaning of these 
combinations and apply them intelligently. The main criterion of ithasala is 
that the faster moving planet should be behind. This means that the two 
planets will reach the same advancement in their rasis and have an exact 



344 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

aspect (sookshma drishti) very soon. If Moon is at 14° in Le and Venus is at 
19° in Li, Moon is going to reach 19° very soon and Moon and Venus are 
going to have an exact sextile aspect. So the energies of Moon and Venus 
are soon going to work in unison. 

That is the main idea behind ithasala. If the faster moving planet is 
retrograde, then the above is not going to happen and we no longer have 
ithasala. For example, suppose retrograde Mercury is at 18° in Ge and Mars 
is at 18° 10' in Li. One may be tempted to think that there is an extremely 
powerful trinal aspect and a poorna ithasala yoga because the difference in 
advancements is merely 0° 10'. However, that is not correct. Being retrograde, 
Mercury will go backward and Mars will go forward. They are not going to 
reach the same longitude anytime soon. Despite indications of success, one 
may be dogged with failure under this combination. 

On the other hand, if the slower planet is retrograde, there is no problem. 
It, in fact, shows a faster realization, as the two planets will reach the same 
advancement faster. Suppose Moon is at 18° in Ar and retrograde Mercury 
is at 24° in Ge. Now both the planets move towards the other planet and 
they are going to reach the same advancement soon. So there is an ithasala 
yoga. 

Suppose the faster moving planet is retrograde and it is more advanced 
in its rasi than the slower moving planet. In that case, one may be tempted 
to think that there is no ithasala yoga. However, both the planets move 
towards the other and so there is an ithasala yoga. However, a planet's 
speed reduces under retrogression and the difference in advancements has 
to be smaller. For example, suppose Mars is at 21° in Cp and retrograde 
Mercury is at 23° in Vi. They have a trinal aspect. One may be tempted to 
think that there is no ithasala here, because Mercury, who moves faster 
than Mars, is more advanced in his rasi. However, being retrograde, Mercury 
moves backward. Very soon, Mars and Mercury are going to have the 
same advancements in respective rasis (perhaps near 22°). They will have 
an exact aspect then. So we have an ithasala yoga. 

Thus one should adapt the rules in the case of retrogression. Even 
when there is no retrogression, some changes may have to be made. Suppose 
Mercury is at 18° in Vi and Mars is at 18°45' in Cp and neither is retrograde: 
Then one may be tempted to think that there is a poorna ithasala yoga in 
their trinal aspect. Now suppose that Mercury is about to become retrograde 
and he will become retrograde after reaching 18°05'. In that case, Mercury 
and Mars are not going to have an exact aspect anytime soon, because 
Mercury will start going backward after reaching 18°05'. So there is no 
ithasala. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 345 

Thus an erudite astrologer should make proper modifications to the 
rules when a planet is retrograde or about to become retrograde. 
29.2.4 Eesarpha Yoga 

Eesarpha yoga is the opposite of ithasala. If two planets have an aspect 
and the faster moving planet has a higher advancement in its rasi than the 
slower moving planet, then we have eesarpha yoga. 

Results: This is a bad yoga. This results in failures and disappointments. 
If lagna lord has eesarpha yoga with 5th lord or putra saham lord or Jupiter, 
some disappointments related to children are possible. If lagna lord has an 
eesarpha with 10th lord or 5th lord or raajya saham lord or Sun in the chart of a 
president or prime minister or king, loss of power is a possibility during the 
year. 

Example: Suppose Moon is at 23° in Le and Venus is at 19° in Li. They 
have a sextile aspect. Both the planets are within the deeptaamsa (orb) of 
the other. Moon's advancement in his rasi is 23° and Venus's advancement 
in his rasi is 19°. Faster planet (Moon) is more advanced than the slower 
planet (Venus). So we have eesarpha yoga. 

Special Notes: We made some comments under ithasala yoga about 
planets that are retrograde or about to become retrograde. If the faster 
moving planet is retrograde and less advanced in its rasi, then we have 
eesarpha yoga. If the faster moving planet in an aspect is retrograde and 
more advanced in its rasi, then we do not have eesarpha yoga. We have an 
ithasala yoga instead. 
29.2.5 Nakta Yoga 

Suppose two planets have an aspect, but there is no ithasala yoga or 
eesarpha yoga. Then, we say that there is Nakta yoga between the two 
planets, if a planet that moves faster than both the planets has an aspect 
with both and forms ithasala yoga with both. This shows fulfilment of the 
matters represented by the first 2 planets with the help of someone shows 
by the 3rd planet. 

Example: Suppose lagna is in Ta and Venus is at 13° in Ge. Suppose 7th 

lord Mars is in Sc (7th itself) at 15°. They have no aspect. Now suppose 
Moon is at 11° in Cn. He has a semi-sextile aspect with Venus and a trinal 
aspect with Mars. He has a lower advancement in his rasi (11°) than the 
other two planets and hence he has an ithasala yoga with the two planets, 
Thus, Venus and Mars have Nakta yoga between them. Because Venus is 
lagna lord in 2nd (family) and Mars is the 7th lord in 7th, this yoga shows 
getting married in the year. This may happen with the help of someone 
shown by Moon. As Moon owns the 3rd house, this may show the 



346 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

involvement of younger brother or sister. For example, the native may marry 
a friend of his younger sister with her help. 
29.2.6 Yamaya Yoga 

Suppose two planets have an aspect, but there is no ithasala yoga or 
eesarpha yoga. Then, we say that there is Yamaya yoga between the two 
planets, if a planet that moves slower than both the planets has an aspect 
with both and forms ithasala yoga with both. This shows fulfilment of the 
matters represented by the first 2 planets with the help of someone shows 
by the 3rd planet, after obstacles and delays. 

Example: Suppose lagna is in Ta and Venus is at 13° in Ge. Suppose 7th 

lord Mars is in Sc (7th itself) at 15°. They have no aspect. Now suppose 
Jupiter is at 16° in Cn. He has a semi-sextile aspect with Venus and a trinal 
aspect with Mars. He has a higher advancement in his rasi (16°) than the 
other two planets and hence he has an ithasala yoga with the two planets. 
Thus, Venus and Mars have Yamaya yoga between them. Because Venus 
is lagna lord in 2nd (family) and Mars is the 7th lord in 7th, this yoga shows 
getting married in the year. This may happen with the help of someone 
shown by Jupiter. As Jupiter owns the 11th house, this may show the 
involvement of elder siblings or friends. 
29.2.7 Manahoo Yoga 

Suppose two planets have an ithasala yoga. If Saturn or Mars is in 
conjunction with the faster moving planet and stays within the deeptaamsa 
of the latter, then Manahoo yoga results. This yoga cancels the ithasala 
yoga and gives failures, disappointments, quarrels, loss of wealth etc. 

Suppose Jupiter is at 21° in Pi and Moon is at 18° in Cn, then they have 
a sexti le aspect and an ithasala yoga, because Moon (18°) is behind Jupiter 
(21°). However, let us say that Saturn is at 19° in Cn. Then Saturn cancels 
the ithasala between Moon and Jupiter and gives bad results. 

If Mars or Saturn is one of the two planets in ithasala yoga, then we 
obviously need the other planet to give Manahoo yoga. 
Notes: Some people suggest that an aspect of Saturn or Mars within the 
deeptaamsa of the faster moving planet is sufficient to give Manahoo yoga. 
In the above example, Saturn need not be in Cn according to this. Saturn or 
Mars in 6°-30° (Moon's deeptaamsa) in Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Cp, Pi, Ar, Ta and 
Ge will have an aspect with Moon - faster moving planet in Moon-Jupiter 
ithasala - within Moon's deeptaamsa. So Manahoo yoga results. However, 
readers are advised to consider only conjunction. Some authors have 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 347 

suggested that both Mars and Saturn must be involved, but one of them is 
enough to spoil ithasala yoga and give Manahoo yoga. 
29.2.8 Kamboola Yoga 

Suppose two planets have an ithasala yoga. If Moon has an ithasala 
with one of the planets (or both), then we have Kamboola yoga. This yoga 
adds power to the ithasala yoga. The power added varies based on the 
strength of Moon and other planets. 

Suppose Mars is at 23° in Sc and Jupiter is at 26° in Pi. Then they have 
a trinal aspect and an ithasala yoga. Now, suppose Moon is at 22° in Le. He 
has an ithasala yoga with Mars. So we have Kamboola yoga and Mars-
Jupiter ithasala becomes more powerful because of it. 
29.2.9 Gairi-Kamboola Yoga 

If Moon is in the last degree of a rasi and he will form ithasala with one 
of the planets in an ithasala after moving to the next rasi, it is called Gairi-
Kamboola yoga. It is essentially Kamboola yoga in waiting. Moon must also 
form an ithasala with a strong planet for this yoga to be effective. Moreover, 
Moon should not be exalted or debilitated or occupy his own navamsa, 
drekkana or hadda. This yoga shows realization of the matter with help 
from others, after some delay. 

Suppose Mars is at 1° in Cp, Jupiter is at 2° in Pi and Venus is at 3° in Li. 
Mars and Jupiter have a sextile aspect and ithasala yoga. Suppose Moon is 
at 29° 10' in Vi. Moon is in the last degree of Vi. Moon is in Mercury's 
navamsa (Vi), Venus's drekkana (Ta) and Saturn's hadda. Moon has no 
ithasala with Mars or Jupiter, but he will have ithasala with Mars as soon as 
he moves to Li. He also has ithasala with Venus, who is very strong. So we 
have Gairi-Kamboola yoga. 
29.2.10 Khallasara Yoga 

If lagna lord is in the rasi between Moon and another planet X without 
ithasala with either planet, then Khallasara yoga results. This yoga destroys 
the signification of X. 

Suppose lagna is in Vi, Moon is at 1° in Ar, lagna lord Mercury is at 15° 
in Ta and Jupiter is at 29° in Ge, then Khallasara yoga is formed. Lagna lord 
Mercury is between Moon and Jupiter and there is no ithasala with Moon or 
Jupiter. The significations of Jupiter are destroyed and there may be some 
disappointments related to mother, education, house, vehicles or marriage. 
29.2.11 Radda Yoga 

If an ithasala yoga involves a planet in debilitation or retrogression or 



348 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

combustion or otherwise weak, it turns into Radda yoga. This yoga negates 
ithasala and gives bad results. 

About planets in retrogression, one should remember the comments 
made under ithasala yoga. If retrograde Mercury is at 5° in Vi and Mars is 
at 7° in Sc, there is no ithasala. Whether one calls it Eesarpha or Radda 
yoga depends on one's interpretation, but the results are going to be bad in 
either case. 

Suppose lagna is in Ar, Saturn is at 20° in Ar and Mars is at 15° in Sg. 
Then they have an ithasala yoga. However, Saturn is debilitated. So ithasala 
turns into radda and bad results are indicated. Because Saturn owns the 
10th and 11th houses, they can be related to career and material gains. 
29.2.12 Duhphali-Kutta Yoga 

If (a) the faster planet in an ithasala is exalted or occupies own rasi or 
has a good panchavargeeya bala and (b) the slower planet is not exalted, 
not in own rasi and weak in panchavargeeya bala, then it goes by a special 
name - Duhphali-Kutta yoga. This yoga shows realization of ambitions and 
dreams. 

Suppose Saturn is at 20° in Li with a good panchavargeeya bala and 
Mars is at 18° in Ge with a low panchavargeeya bala, then they have an 
ithasala yoga. Because Saturn, the slower planet, is exalted and strong and 
Mars, the faster planet, is weak, this becomes Duhphali-Kutta yoga. 
29.2.13 Duttota Yoga 

If two planets in an ithasala are weak (debilitated or occupying inimical 
rasis, having a low panchavargeeya bala) and one of them has an ithasala 
yoga with a strong planet (exalted or occupying own rasi, having a high 
panchavargeeya bala), then we have Duttota yoga. 

This yoga gives good results. 
Suppose lagna is in Ar, Saturn is at 20° in Ar and Mars is at 19° in Li. 

Then they have an ithasala yoga. However, Saturn is debilitated. So ithasala 
turns into radda and bad results are indicated. Now, suppose Venus is at 18° 
in Pi. Saturn has a semi-sextile aspect and an ithasala yoga with exalted 
Venus. So the final result is Duttota yoga and good results are promised. 
Because Saturn owns the 10th and 11th houses, they can be related to career 
and material gains. 
29.2.14 Thambira Yoga 

If a planet is in the last degree of a rasi and it forms ithasala yoga after 
moving to the next rasi with a slower moving planet, it is called Thambira 
yoga. This shows realization of hopes after delay and hard work. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 349 

Suppose lagna is in Ar, Mars is at 2° in Le and Venus is at 29° 10' in Ta. 
Venus has no ithasala with Mars. However, when Venus moves to Ge, he 
will have an ithasala with Mars. So Venus forms Thambira yoga with Mars. 
This shows good events related to family and marital life after some hard 
work. 
29.2.15 Kutta Yoga 

If a planet occupying lagna is aspected by a planet in occupying own or 
exaltation rasi in a kendra or a panaphara, then this yoga is formed. The 
desires related to the matters signified by the planet in lagna are fulfilled.85

Suppose lagna is in Ta, Sun is at 21° in Ta and Mercury is at 16° in Vi. 
Mercury is exalted in a panaphara and aspects Sun in lagna. So Sun gives 
Kutta yoga and the 4th house matters receive a boost in the year. 
29.2.16 Durupha Yoga 

Ithasala given by two planets in dusthanas (6th, 8th and 12th house) in 
combustion or retrogression or debilitation turns into Durupha yoga. The 
planets are powerless to give any good results. 

Suppose lagna is in Ar. Suppose Mars is at 15° in Cn and Saturn is at 17° 
in Ar. Because both Mars and Saturn are debilitated, their ithasala turns into 
Durupha yoga. Mars and Saturn cannot give good results related to career 
and gains. 
29.3 Conclusion 

One should remember the definitions of all the yogas and consider all of 
them. There is some overlap between some yogas here. An ithasala may 
be converted to another yoga if an additional combination is present and it 
may again turn into another yoga under yet another combination. So it is 
possible to overlook one planet and conclude the presence of a wrong yoga. 

85 This yoga was interpreted differently by scholars. 



30. Annual Dasas 

30.1  Introduction 

We have studied different dasa systems that enable us to time events in 
a person's life. In the previous few chapters, we have seen how Tajaka 
annual charts show the fortune in a one-year period. The next question is -
how do we time events shown in a Tajaka annual chart? For example, an 
annual chart may show that the native will get married in the year. The 
question is - when in the year will (s)he get married? 

All the dasas covered earlier are valid for natal charts and their 
paramayush is of the order of 100 years. On the other hand, an annual 
chart applies only for a period of one year. So we need dasas that are 
compressed to a one-year period. We will learn 3 dasas in this chapter: (1) 
Patyayini dasa86 mentioned by Tajaka writers, (2) Mudda dasa or Varsha 
Vimsottari dasa, and, (3) Varsha Narayana dasa. 

In Vimsottari dasa and Narayana dasa, paramayush of 120 years is 
compressed to one year. One may try finding compressed Vimsottari dasa 
based on Moon's constellation in the annual chart, but the best results are 
obtained by progressing Moon's constellation in the natal chart at the rate of 
one constellation per year and using it to initiate dasas. Similarly, one may 
try finding compressed Narayana dasa based on lagna in the annual chart, 
but the best results are obtained by progressing lagna in the natal chart at 
the rate of one sign per year and using it as lagna for the purpose of Narayana 
dasa87. 
Example 122: Let us consider a lady born on 1st June 1972 at 4:16 am 
(1ST) at 81 E 12, 16 N 15. She got married on 24th July 1993. Let us time 
this event from 1993-94 annual chart using all the 3 dasas. 

Varshapravesh data: 1st June 1993, 1:30:04 pm (IST), 81 E 12, 16 N 
15. Rasi and navamsa charts of this data are given in Chart 67. 

86 Dr. B. V. Raman simply called this "Varsha dasa" (annual dasa). 
87 This is a result of the author's own researches. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 351 

Chart 67 

 
Marriage in this year: Vivaha saham is at 2°22' in Sg. Lagna has 7th 

lord and vivaha saham lord Jupiter in it. Lagna lord Mercury is in own sign 
and has ithasala with Jupiter. In navamsa, 7th lord Mercury is well-placed. 
Lagna lord Jupiter joins Venus in the 2nd house of family. All these factors 
brought marriage in the year. We will time it using different dasas now. 
30.3    Patyayini Dasa 

This dasa is based on the longitudes of lagna and all planets and it is 
specifically meant for Tajaka charts. 



352 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Procedure: 
(1) Consider lagna and the seven planets. Find their advancement from the 

beginning of the respective signs occupied by them. Arrange them in 
the ascending order. These are called "Krisamsas" of planets. 

(2) Leave the krisamsa of the first planet (the one with the lowest value). 
From krisamsas of all other planets, subtract the krisamsas of the 
previous planets. In other words, subtract the krisamsa that is just below 
the current planet's krisamsa. These values are called "Patyamsas". 

(3) Dasas of lagna and the seven planet are in the order found in (1). Their 
dasas are in the ratio of their patyamsas. Dasa of a planet (in days) is 
given by the formula: 

365.2425 x (its patyamsa / sum of all patyamsas88) 
(4) To find antardasas, we use the same ratios and order used in dasas, just 

as in Vimsottari dasa. First antardasa is the same as dasa. Then we go 
in the order. 
For the annual chart in Example 122, we can find the longitudes of 

planets and lagna in Chart 67. We can arrange them in the ascending order 
and find the ratios as shown in Table 75. 

We see that the first 25 days (June 1-26, 1993) is Venus dasa. Next 48 
days (June 26-Aug 13, 1993) is Mercury dasa. And so on. 

The first antardasa in Venus dasa belongs to Venus himself. Its length is 
0.0684 x 24.98 days =1.7 days. Next antardasa belongs to Mercury and the 
length is 0.1319 x 24.98 = 3.3 days. Next antardasa belongs to Moon and 
the length is 0.0014 x 24.98 = 0.03 days (i.e. less than an hour). Next 
antardasa belongs to Saturn and the length is 0.0705 x 24.98 = 1.8 days. We 
can find all the antardasas in all the dasas in this manner. 

Table 75: Patyayini Dasa Calculation 
 

 Planet Krisamsa Patyamsa Fraction Days 
Venus 1°38' 1°38' 1° 38723° 53' = 0.0684 24.98 
Mercury 4° 47' 3° 9' 3° 9'/23° 53'  = 0.1319 48.17 
Moon 4° 49' 0°2' 0° 2723° 53'  = 0.0014 0.51 
Saturn 6° 30' 1°41' 1° 41723° 53' = 0.0705 25.74 
Lagna 7° 14' 0°44' 0° 44723° 53' = 0.0307 11.21 
Jupiter 10° 59' 3° 45' 3° 45723° 53' = 0.1570 57.35 
Sun 17° 5' 6° 6' 6° 6723° 53'   = 0.2554 93.29 
Mars 23°53' 6° 48' 6° 48723° 53' = 0.2847 103.99 

88 It may be noted that the sum of all patyamsas is nothing but the largest krisamsa. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 353 

Timing of marriage: 
Mercury dasa ran during June 26-Aug 13, 1993. This was the dasa that 

was running when she got married on 24th July 1993. Why did Mercury give 
marriage? 
(1) Mercury is lagna lord. 
(2) He is very strong as per panchavargeeya bala. 
(3) He is varsheswara (lord of the year). 
(4) He aspects vivaha saham within 3°. 
(5) In navamsa, which is the right chart for marriage, he is the 7th lord. He 

is strong in a trine. Lagna and 7th lords in navamsa can certainly give 
marriage. 

30.4 Mudda Dasa (Varsha Vimsottari Dasa) 
Dasa length 

This is essentially Vimsottari dasa with 120 years89 compressed to a 
solar year. If we take a solar year to be of 360 days, with each day 
corresponding to the time period in which Sun moves by exactly 1°, we get 
the dasa of days of a planet by multiplying normal dasa years by 3. For 
example, Sun dasa is normally for 6 years. By compressing 120 years to 
360 solar days, we find Sun's Varsha Vimsottari dasa to be 6 x 3 = 18 days. 
Durations of all dasas are given in Table 76 (in solar days). 

Table 76: Varsha Vimsottari Dasa Days 
 

Planet Sun Moon Mars Rahu Jupiter Saturn Mercury Ketu Venus 
Days 18 30 21 54 48 57 51 21 60 
Dasa order 

To initiate dasas, we should progress Moon's natal constellation at the 
rate of one constellation per year and use the resulting constellation. Instead 
of progressing the constellation, we can also do the following: 

Consider (1) Sun, (2) Moon, (3) Mars, (4) Rahu, (5) Jupiter, (6) Saturn, 
(7) Mercury, (8) Ketu and (9) Venus. 

Take the number corresponding to the lord of Moon's natal constellation 
(i.e. the lord of the first Vimsottari dasa in natal chart). Add the number of 

89 Sum of the 2 cycles of Narayana dasa for natal charts is 12 x 12 = 144 years. 
However, only the first 120 years of this is valid, as the paramayush of human beings 
is 120 years. 



354 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

completed years to this number. Divide the number by 9 and take the 
remainder. See the planet corresponding to that number. First dasa belongs 
to that planet. After that, dasas will follow the normal order. Remainder of 
0 is equivalent to 9 and hence shows Venus. 

In Example 122, natal Moon is in Uttaraashaadha constellation. So the 
first dasa belongs to Sun. The number corresponding to Sun is 1. Number of 
completed years is 1993-1972=21. Adding 1 and 21, we get 22. Dividing it 
by 9, we get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 4. That shows Rahu. 
Dasa balance 

For finding the dasa balance, the fraction of the natal Moon's constellation 
yet to be traversed is taken. 

In Example 122, natal Moon is at 29 Sg 28. About 0.79 of the constellation 
is yet to be traversed by natal Moon. So the balance in Rahu's Varsha 
Vimsottari dasa of 1994-94 is 0.79 x 54 solar days = 42.66 solar days. So 
June 1-July 14, 1993 is Rahu dasa. Jupiter dasa runs for 48 days then. 
Timing of marriage 

Jupiter is 7th lord and vivaha saham lord in rasi chart. He is in lagna. In 
navamsa, he is lagna lord and occupies the 2nd house of family with Venus. 

It may, however, be noted that Mercury is a better candidate for giving 
marriage, for the reasons mentioned earlier. Patyayini dasa shows the event 
better than Mudda dasa. 

30.5   Varsha Narayana Dasa 
Dasa durations 

This is essentially Narayana dasa compressed from 120 years2 to 360 
solar days. If a rasi's dasa is of n years, it becomes 3 x n solar days after 
compression, i.e. a period in which Sun moves by (3 x n)°. 
Dasa order 

We find the dasa order in Narayana dasa of rasi chart and Narayana 
dasa of divisional charts just as in natal charts. The only difference is that 
we should progress natal lagna and use it, instead of lagna in the annual 
chart. 

Just as we progress Moon by one constellation per year when finding 
Varsha Vimsottari dasa, we progress lagna by one rasi per year when finding 
Varsha Narayana dasa. In other words, we take muntha as lagna when 
finding Varsha Narayana dasa. This is the link between the natal chart and 
the Tajaka chart. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 355 

Let us take Example 122 and find Varsha Narayana dasa of D-9. Natal 
lagna is in Aries. Because the native started the 22nd year in 1993, we find 
the 22nd house, i.e. the 10th house (after removing 12), from Ar and get 
muntha in Cp. 

We now find Varsha Narayana dasa assuming that lagna in rasi chart is 
in Cp. To find Narayana dasa of D-9, we need the 9th lord in rasi chart. Vi 
is the 9th from Cp and Mercury owns it. He is in Sc in navamsa and Sc is 
stronger than Ta. So we start dasas from Sc. Normally the dasa order 
should have been Sc, Ge, Cp, Le, Pi, Li etc. But Saturn is in Sc and the 
"Saturn exception" applies. So dasas go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar etc. 

Sc, Sg, Cp and Aq dasas are of 7, 4, 2 and 3 years respectively. After 
compressing to one year, they are of 21, 12, 6 and 9 solar days respectively. 
This covers 48 solar days and these dasas run from June 1-July 20, 1993. 
Pisces dasa of 33 days started then and it brought marriage. 

Why Pisces dasa? Well, it contains lagna in D-9 and has subhaargala 
from lagna lord Jupiter and Venus. Navamsa lagna's dasa as per Varsha 
Narayana dasa of navamsa is an ideal candidate for bringing marriage. 
Exercise 48: A native born on 4th April 1970 at 5:50 pm (IST) at 81 E 12, 
16 N 15 got married on 1st August 1993. Verify that navamsa lagna's dasa 
as per Varsha Narayana dasa of navamsa was running at the time of 
marriage. Verify that the running dasa and antardasa as per Patyayini dasa 
and Mudda dasa - at the time of wedding - belonged to lagna/7th lord in 
rasi/navamsa. 

Usually Patyayini dasa gives better results than Mudda dasa. Varsha 
Narayana dasa is, however, the best dasa for Tajaka annual charts. So we 
will see more examples of Varsha Narayana dasa.  

Example 123: The native of Exercise 48 went from India to US for 
his masters degree in engineering, on 15th August 1991. He went on a 
fellowship from a University in US. Let us time his foreign trip using Varsha 
Narayana dasa of D-4. 
Varshapravesh data: 5th April 1991, 3:05:33 am (IST), 81 E 12, 16N 15 In 
rasi chart, lagna has Saturn and Rahu. Both the planets show living away 
from the place of birth. Jupiter owns 12th - living away from homeland - and 
he is exalted in 7th - a long trip. In D-4 (see Chart 68), 9th and 12th lord 
Mercury is in 7th showing a long trip to a foreign land. Mars owns 7th (long 
trips) and he is in 9th. Sun owns paradesa saham and jalapatana saham and 
he is in 12th - foreign lands - in D-4. For all these reasons, the native went 
abroad during the year. 



356 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 68 

 
Though rasi chart has lagna in Cp, muntha or annual progressed 

ascendant is in Ge. We should use Ge as lagna for Varsha Narayana dasa. 
The 4th house from Ge is Vi and Mercury owns it. He is in Ar in D-4. Ar 
with two planets is stronger than Li with one planet. Dasas go as Ar, Ta, Ge 
Cn etc. 

Virgo dasa was running during August 10-26, 1991. The native went 
abroad on 15th/16th August 1991, during Virgo dasa, Gemini antardasa as 
per Varsha Narayana dasa of D-4. Virgo is the 12th house containing the 
lord of padesa saham and jalapatana saham. Gemini is the 9th house 
containing 7th lord. Lord of both Virgo and Gemini is Mercury and he is in 
the 7th house. 
Example 124: The native of Exercise 48 stood First in Intermediate 
(Secondary School) examinations in the AP state of India on 28th May 1987 
and he was selected for Indian Institute of Technology (India's top engineering 
school) on 1st June 1987. Let us time this academic success using Varsha 
Narayana dasa of D-24. 

Varsha pravesh data: 5th April 1987,2:15:41 am (IST), 81 E 12, 16N 15 
Vidya saham lord Mars is in the 5th house in rasi chart. He is in own 

sign in D-24, which shows education (see Chart 69). He is in the 3rd



Part4:TajakaAnalysis 357 

house from AL in D-24, showing material success (in education, as this is in 
D-24). 

Chart 69 

 

Muntha is in Aq in rasi chart. Taking Aq as lagna, 12th house is Cp. Its 
lord is Saturn. He is in Ar in D-24 and Ar is stronger than Li. So Varsha 
Narayana dasa of D-24 goes as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn etc. Cn dasa runs during 
May 26-June 17, 1987. This- dasa brought academic success. Why? 
(1) Cn contains lagna lord and shows prosperity to the matters signified by 

the chart, i.e. education. 
(2) It is the 11th from AL and shows gains in status (of course, only in the 

field of education). 
(3) Its lord Moon is in the 5th house from it. 
(4) The 5th house from it has a very strong Mars, who is in own sign. 

Moreover, Mars owns vidya saham and occupies 5th in rasi chart. 
Example 125: The native of Exercise 48 had a son on 21st August 1998. 
Let us time this using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-7. 
Varsha pravesh data: 4th April 1998, 9:59:49 pm (IST), 81 E 12, 16 N 15 



358 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 70 

 

In rasi chart, lagna is in Sc and putra saham is in Ar. Lord Mars is in 5th 

house. D-7 shows children. In D-7, Jupiter owns 5th and he aspects 5th from 
11th (see Chart 70). This resulted in a son in the year. 

Muntha is in Cp in rasi chart. The 7th house is in Cn. Moon owns it. 
Moon is in Cp in D-7 and Cp is stronger than Cn. So Narayana dasa of D-
7 starts from Cp and goes as Cp, Sg, Sc, Li etc. 

Ge dasa of 24 solar days started just before the birth of son. Why did 
Ge give a child in its D-7 Varsha Narayana dasa? 
(1) Ge is the 11th house in D-7, showing happiness related to children. 
(2) Ge has Jupiter, the significator of children. 
(3) Ge has Jupiter, the 5th lord who aspects 5th. 
(4) The 3rd house is the 11th from 5th and shows childbirth. Its exalted lord 

Venus aspects Ge. 
(5) Mars owns putra saham and he aspects Ge. 
(6) Putra pada (arudha pada of 5th) aspects Ge from Vi. 

Gemini is a clear candidate simply because it is 11th and 5th lord Jupiter 
occupies it. 
Exercise 49: Given that the native of Exercise 48 bought a car in 1995-96, 
try to time it using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-16. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 359 

30.5 Conclusion 
In this chapter, we learnt three dasa systems that are applicable to 

Tajaka annual charts. Patyayini dasa is applicable to Tajaka monthly charts 
also. For annual charts, Varsha Narayana dasa and Patyayini dasa give the 
best results. If a result seems likely in an annual chart, we can find the 
exact month or week of the event using these dasas.

Chart 71 

 
Look at D-16 of the annual chart. The 4th from lagna is not strong. If 

the native bought a vehicle, it must be due to the strength of the 4th from 
Venus. Exalted Jupiter is in the 4th from Venus. Jupiter owns 3rd and shows 
expenditure on 4th, i.e. expenditure on account of happiness from vehicle. 
He is exalted in the 4th from Venus showing a good vehicle. Muntha is in Li 
and Cp is the 4th. Saturas owns it and occupies Vi in D-16. Pi is stronger 
than Vi. So dasas go as Pi, Cn, Sc, Sg, Ar, Le etc. 

Cancer dasa in the second cycle ran during Jan 16-Feb 9, 1996. The 
native bought a car in this dasa. 



31. Sudarsana Chakra Dasa 

31.1  Introduction 
Parasara said that Sudarsana Chakra dasa was taught by Brahma -the 

Creator - Himself and that it is a great tool for predicting daily, monthly and 
annual fortune. Because the calculations necessary for Sudarsana Chakra 
dasa interpretation are an integral part of casting Tajaka annual, monthly 
and sixty-hour charts, this dasa is being covered in the part on "Tajaka 
Analysis" rather than the part on "Dasa Analysis". However, it should be 
borne in mind that this is a dasa applicable to natal charts. This is just a natal 
dasa like Vimsottari dasa, Narayana dasa and Kalachakra dasa. 

Chart 72 

 

31.2  Sudarsana Chakra 
In each chart, there are 3 important reference points: (1) lagna, (2) 

Moon, and, (3) Sun. Lagna represents the physical body. Moon represents 
the mind. Sun represents the soul. The three together represent one's self. 
We should consider houses from all the three reference points when judging 
a chart. For example, we need to look at the 10th house from lagna, Moon 



Pan 4: Tajaka Analysis 361 

and Sun to see career. Though we generally give importance to lagna, all 
the three references are important. 

To symbolically represent this, we can draw Sudarsana Chakra (SC) as 
taught by Parasara. We should draw 3 concentric circles. We should write 
down the bhava chakra with respect to lagna, Moon and Sun in the inner, 
middle and outer charts. To illustrate this, let us take the rasi chart given in 
Chart 72. Sudarsana Chakra for this chart is given in Figure 4. 

The 10th house from lagna is in Sg and it has Ketu. The 10th house from 
Moon is Sc and it is empty. The 10th house from Sun is Aries and it is empty. 
We should analyze all the 3 factors together to draw conclusions. 

31.3   Dasa Computation 
Dasas of the 12 houses run in cycles throughout a native's life. Each 

dasa is for one year. For example, dasa of the 1st house runs in the 1st year 
of one's life. Dasa of the 2nd house runs in the 2nd year of one's life. After 
12 years, dasa of the 1st house will return in the 13th year. Dasa of the 2nd 

house will return in the 14th year. After every 12 years, the same dasas 
keep coming. 

One year stands for a solar year here. A new dasa starts after every 
one year. The exact date and time when a new SC dasa starts can be found 
by casting Tajaka annual chart. Look at the number of years completed. 
Adding one to it, you get the year that starts. Divide it by 12 and find the 
remainder (if the remainder is zero, make it 12). This remainder gives the 
house whose dasa runs in the year. 

For example, let us take a native who finishes 44 years and starts the 
45th year of his life on a particular date. Because the remainder when 45 is 
divided by 12 is 9, SC dasa of the 9th house runs in the 45th year. 

When we say dasa of the 9th house here, we mean the 9th house from 
lagna, Moon and Sun. If lagna is in Pi, Moon is in Aq and Sun is in Cn, then 
the 9th house is in Sc, Li and Pi. 

However, analyzing with 3 signs becomes difficult. So one may 
conveniently choose the strongest reference out of lagna, Moon and Sun 
and take dasas from it. This is only an approximation, but it simplifies 
analysis. 



362 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Figure 4: Sudarsana Chakra

Antardasas 
Each dasa is divided into 12 antardasas. Take the dasa sign as lagna 

and give the 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc houses from it to antardasas. 
If Pi is natal lagna, dasa in the 45th year belongs to the 9th house, i.e. Sc. 

Antardasas in this dasa go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc. 
We can use Tajaka monthly charts to find the date and time when an 

antardasa starts. 
Similarly, we can find pratyantardasas from antardasas and use Tajaka 

sixty-hour charts to find the date and time when a pratyantardasa starts. 
In short, Tajaka annual, monthly and sixty-hour charts are nothing but 

the entry charts of dasas, antardasas and pratyantardasas as per Sudarsana 
Chakra dasa. Muntha in Tajaka annual charts is nothing but the dasa sign as 
per Sudarsana Chakra dasa, but always reckoned from lagna. If we redefine 
muntha to be the progressed from the strongest of lagna, Moon and Sun 
(instead of always from lagna), it exactly becomes the SC dasa sign. 

We can find Sudarsana Chakra dasa for divisional charts also. We take 
the strongest of lagna, Moon and Sun and then start SC dasa from there. It 
moves at the rate of one house per year. Examples will make this clear. 



Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 363 

31.4 Dasa Interpretation 
To interpret a dasa (or antardasa or pratyantardasa), we have to take 

the dasa sign (or antardasa sign or pratyantardasa sign) as lagna and analyze 
the planetary positions with respect to it. What planetary positions do we 
mean - natal or transit? 

Some people may prefer to analyze the natal positions, but that would 
suggest that one gets the same results after every 12 years. That is not 
logical. 

Parasara clearly advised that we have to analyze the planetary positions 
at the commencement of a dasa (or antardasa or pratyantardasa) with 
respect to the dasa sign (or antardasa sign or pratyantardasa sign). This is 
where Tajaka charts fit in. 

If benefics are in quadrants, trines and 8th from dasa sign, favorable 
results can be expected. Benefics in houses other than the 6th and 12th 

houses produce good results for the houses they occupy. Malefics in the 3rd, 
6th and 11th houses bring good results. Malefics in other houses spoil the 
results of the houses they occupy. In particular, Rahu destroys the house he 
occupies. 
Example 126: Let us revisit Example 124. In the natal chart, lagna and 
Moon are in Ge in D-24. In 1987-88, the native ran the 18th year of his life. 
So SC dasa of the 6th house was running. The 6th house from Ge is Sc. So 
Scorpio dasa was running as per Sudarsana Chakra dasa of D-24. We 
should look at planetary positions w.r.t. Sc at the time this dasa started, i.e. 
in Tajaka annual chart of the year (see Chart 69). 

Benefics Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are in 5th, 8th and 9th respectively 
and all of them are good placements. Malefics Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are 
in 6th, 11th and 11th respectively and all of them are good placements. 
Moreover, dasa sign Sc houses a powerful raja yoga involving the 1st, 9th 

and 10th lords from it. 
For all these reasons, this year was excellent for matters shown in D-24. 

Though Sudarsana Chakra dasa can be found for all divisional charts, 
pay special attention to rasi chart. Here is an example.  

Example 127: Indira Gandhi's natal rasi chart and Tajaka annual 
chart of 1976-77 are given in Chart 73. During that year, Indira Gandhi's 
party lost the Parliamentary Elections and she was removed from the post 
of India's Prime Minister. 

Because the finished years are 1976-1917 = 59, we should add 1 and 
divide 60 by 12. Remainder is 12 and Sudarsana Chakra dasa during the 



364 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

year belongs to the 12th house. Compared to lagna and Moon, Sun with 
Budha-Aaditya yoga is stronger. Let us take the 12th from Sun. It is Libra. 

Libra's SC dasa runs during the year and we should look at the planetary 
positions from Libra in the Tajaka annual chart (or dasa commencement 
chart). Benefic Venus is in 3rd giving failures. Rahu afflicts the 1st house. 
Mars, Sun and Mercury are not well-placed in the 2nd house. Saturn afflicts 
the 10th house showing troubles in career.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis 365 

Because of bad placement of planets (especially Saturn and Rahu), 
Sudarsana Chakra does not promise a good year. No wonder Mrs. Gandhi 
fell from power. 
Example 128: Let us consider the lady of Chart 74. She got married in 
January 1999. Let us analyze her Sudarsana Chakra dasa of navamsa for 
1998-99. 

She was born in 1973 and she started her 26th year in July 1998. If we 
divide 26 by 12, we get a remainder of 2. So SC dasa in 1998-99 belongs to 
the 2nd house. In natal navamsa, lagna is in Cn and it is stronger than Moon 
and Sun. The 2nd house from Cn is Le. So Le dasa was running in 1998-99. 
Is it a good dasa? 

Three benefics are in quadrants and 3 malefics are in 3rd/11th. Though 
Mars is in 9th, he is strong being in own house. Most planets are favorably 
placed and, more importantly, lagna and 7th are strong with Jupiter and 
Venus in them (respectively). So this was a favorable year for matters 
shown by D-9. No wonder she got married. 
31.5   Conclusion 

Parasara called Sudarsana Chakra dasa a very important dasa. It, 
however, needs to be understood better. 

Sudarsana Chakra dasa is interpreted based on the planetary positions 
at the commencement of a dasa or an antardasa or a pratyantardasa. Those 
planetary positions can be found from Tajaka annual or monthly or sixty-
hour charts. In addition, muntha defined in Tajaka texts is nothing but 
Sudarsana Chakra dasa rasi reckoned from lagna. So there may be some 
missing links between Sudarsana Chakra dasa and Tajaka analysis. 

Sudarsana chakra dasa is good at showing favorable and unfavorable 
periods in a general sense.

Part 5: Special Topics 

Some speical topics will be covered in this part. 
When one uses Vedic astrology at its fullest glory, it is very systematic 

and leads to very precise predictions. However, we need a very accurate 
birthtime. In real life, however, we often get erroneous data. Coping with 
birthtime errors is a very important topic. 

In an effort to promote rational thinking in the astrological community, a 
chapter on rational thinking is included. 

What is the use of diagnosing one's disease, if the diease cannot be 
remedied? Similarly, what is the use of making intelligent guesses about 
future, if we cannot do something about undesirable events that are likely to 
happen? The basics of remedial measures are introduced in the chapter on 
remedial measures. 

Making predictions about groups of people, like nations, is much more 
complicated than making predictions about individuals. Some basic techniques 
are introduced in the chapter on mundane astrology. 

Muhurta or electional astrology is an important branch of astrology. It 
lets us choose an auspicious time for starting new ventures. A small chapter 
is dedicated to it. 

Vedic astrology is not a mundane subject like mathematics and subject. 
For its believers, it is a divine subject. Vedic astrologers are required to be 
spiritually aware and observe some ethics. These are addressed in a small 
chapter. 

All these topics are covered for the sake of completeness. Justice is not 
done to any topic and readers should do further reading on these interesting 
topics. 



32. Impact of Birthtime Error 

32.1  Introduction 
There are twins in this world who are born 1-2 minutes apart, but live 

significantly different lives. There may be some similarities between closely 
born twins, but there can be significant differences too.90 So this proves 
that divisional charts and special lagnas, which change very fast, have a 
great bearing on a native's fortune. If one's birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes, 
lagna and special lagnas in some divisional charts change and so the results 
change. This is how we can explain the differences between twins. 

Now the question is — if changes in lagna and special lagnas in divisional 
charts explain the different fortunes of twins, what about people who don't 
have a twin? Well, the same thing applies to them. If we analyze the chart 
cast with a birthtime that is wrong by 2 minutes, we are no longer examining 
the chart of the native - we are simply looking at the chart of his hypothetical 
twin! The results predicted need not be true. 

Lagna in D-l changes rasi once in 2 hours. Some people make 
predictions only using D-1, but that is unscientific and against the teachings 
of maharshis. Due to divine powers and God-given intuition, one can be 
successful in one's predictions only using D-1, but that is clearly unscientific. 
We should see different areas of life in different divisional charts, as taught 
by Maharshi Parasara. When we do that, we need an accurate birthtime. If 
one's birthtime is between 9:02 am and 9:08 am, can we make accurate 
predictions using an average of 9:05 am? No! Many people are born within 
the small span of 6 minutes (between 9:02 and 9:08) and they can be 
significantly different from each other (e.g. twins). Applying precise 
techniques is pointless when we only have an approximate time. So let us 
conclude that we must first make sure that we are working with an 
accurate birthtime. Readers should remember that our analysis could be 
only as accurate as our data! 

We are often told by clients that their birthtime is very accurate. 
However, it is this author's experience that birthtimes reported by people 
90 In order to explain the differences between twins, some astrologers take the lagna of 

the second twin in the 3rd house (younger brother) from the first twin. If Aquarius is 
rising at the birth of both, they take Aries (3rd from Aquarius) as the lagna of the 
younger twin. This is, however, illogical, irrational and against the teachings of 
maharshis. One who understands what lagna means and what the rasi chart shows 
will reject such theories. 



370 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

are seldom accurate. There can be various reasons behind a birthtime error: 
(1) using an unadjusted clock/wristwatch showing a slightly incorrect time, 
(2) forgetting to note the birthtime exactly after birth and noting down it a 
little later with some manual correction applied to compensate for the lapse, 
(3) wrong memory of mother or father when giving the correctly noted 
birthtime to an astrologer, (4) using the wrong definition of'birth'. 

Birthtime rectification is the process of correcting the reported 
birthtime before proceeding to make predictions based on the birthtime. 
There are some formulas in literature for birthtime rectification, but these 
assume that human births happen in certain quanta. For example, an approach 
may assume that nobody is born during a period of 3 minutes and people 
can be born in a period of half a minute then. Then again, nobody is born for 
3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a minute following it. 
Like this, time is divided into certain quanta in which people can be born. 
Then we find the nearest "human birth can happen now" quantum from the 
reported birthtime and use it as the rectified (corrected) birthtime. 

Out of these methods, some of the reasonable methods are the ones 
based on (a) Tattva siddhaanta, (b) Pranapada lagna in navamsa, and, (c) 
Kunda. The first method beyond the scope of this book and the other two 
fail the acid test of twins. If we were to apply those methods to the charts 
of twins born 2 minutes apart, the rectified birthtimes of the two twins 
would be either the same or too far apart. 

In essence, most of the birthtime rectification techniques described in 
literature do not work. The only correct way to rectify a birthtime is to find 
a time in the neighborhood of the reported birthtime so that we can explain 
the nature, credentials, attitude and aptitude of the native and the known 
events from the native's past. This is a laborious process, but there is no 
other way. 

Suppose we are told that one was born between 9:02 and 9:08 am and 
suppose we are looking at his chart. Because we don't know the exact 
birthtime, we can look at a range. If we do that, we are potentially looking at 
thousands of people born during that time. Our native could be anyone 
among thousands of people born in that range. But all those thousands of 
people have significant differences. We want to identify our native among 
those thousands of people and the only way is to look at the known past. 
That's the only thing that distinguishes him from others born closely. 

So we should look at 9:02, 9:03, 9:04 etc and see which one explains 
the known past better. The rectified birthtime is the birthtime with which 
the known life events of the native make sense. 



Part 5: Special Topics 371 

32.2 Robustness of Computations 
When we try different birthtimes, all the computations change. If we 

know how various computations are altered based on small changes in the 
birthtime, we can approach the problem of birthtime rectification intelligently. 
We will discuss the approximate impact of birthtime change on various 
computations. 
32.2.1 Divisional Charts 
Planets 

Positions of planets in rasi chart and divisional charts change very slowly. 
For example, Sun stays in one rasi for 30 days. He changes rasi in D-10 
once in 30/10=3 days. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 30/24=1.25 
days. The speed of Mercury, Venus and Mars is comparable to Sun's. Jupiter 
and Saturn are even slower. Moon is faster than all these planets. He stays 
in one rasi for 2.5 days or 60 hours. He changes rasi in D-10 once in 60/ 
10=6 hours. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 60/24=2.5 hours. 

If the uncertainty in birthtime is of the order of 5 minutes or 10 minutes, 
one may think that there is no problem with these planets as they stay in the 
same rasi in all divisional charts for a lot longer time than 5-10 minutes. 
However, if a planet is at a border and changes rasi in a divisional chart 
during those 5 minutes, we have to take that into consideration. Suppose 
Moon is at 23Sc59. That places him in the 8th dasamsa of Sc, i.e. Aq. 
Suppose lagna in D-10 is Cn. So D-10 has lagna lord in 8th. This makes the 
D-10 chart weak. On the other hand, if Moon is at 24Sc00 or above, he will 
be in the 9th dasamsa of Sc, i.e. Pi. This puts lagna lord in 9th in D-10 and 
the chart is strengthened. Because Moon moves by one quarter of a nakshatra 
(or 200 arc-min) in 6 hours (or 360 min), he takes 360/200=1.8 min to move 
by 1 arc-min. For Moon to go from 23Sc59 to 24Sc00, it only takes about 2 
minutes.91 If we cannot rule out an error of 2 minutes, we should consider 
Moon in both Aq and Pi and see which one explains the native's career 
better. 

Thus, we should pay attention if any planet is at a rasi border in the 
divisional chart of interest. If so, we must consider both the positions and 
see which one makes better sense based on known past. 

91 We are assuming here that our computation of Moon's longitude is very accurate. 
There are some unresolved controversies like (1) ayanamsa and (2) geocentric 
positions vs topocentric positions. Due to these controversies, we cannot be confident 
of our calculations. It is prudent to consider both the rasis in borderline situations. 



372 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Lagna 
Lagna changes rasi in divisional charts much faster than planets. So it is 

the most important consideration in birthtime rectification. 
Lagna moves by one rasi (30°) in 2 hours or 120 min. To move by 1°. 

lagna takes about 4 min. 
Lesson: Lagna moves by 1° in 4 min. Lagna moves by 10' in 2/3 min (or 40 
seconds). Lagna moves by 1' in 4 sec. Lagna moves by 10" in 2/3 sec. 

We can see that lagna changes rasi in D-10 in 12 min. It changes rasi in 
D-24 in 5 min. 
Example 129: Suppose we are told that someone was born at 9:05 am. 
Suppose lagna is at 4Sg39. Suppose we have events related to D-10 (career), 
D-12 (parents) and D-24 (education). Lagna at 4Sg39 puts lagna in these 3 
charts in Cp, Cp and Sc (respectively). Suppose the birthtime is reasonably 
accurate and the maximum error is 5 minutes (i.e. birthtime can be 9:00-
9:10). Let us find the possible lagnas in the 3 charts. 

An error of 5 min changes lagna by about 5/4= 1.25° or 1°15'. So, instead 
of being 4Sg39, it can be as low as 3Sg24 or as high as 5Sg54. So we should 
consider all lagnas between 3Sg24 and 5Sg54. In D-10, lagna changes rasi 
at multiples of 3°. So the whole range we have for lagna results in the same 
D-10 lagna (Cp). In D-12, lagna changes rasi at multiples of 2°30'. So we 
have a transition at 5°. So there are two possibilities for lagna - one in 
3Sg24-5Sg00 and the other in 5Sg00-5Sg54. So lagna in D-12 can be Cp or 
Aq. Lagna in D-24 changes rasi at multiples of 1°15'. It changes rasi at 
3°45' and 5°00'. So we have 3 possibilities for lagna-(1) 3Sg24-3Sg45: Li, 
(2) 3Sg45-5Sg00: Sc, (3) 5Sg00-5Sg54: Sg. 

Using these sets of lagnas, we should analyze the charts and see which 
one makes sense. Suppose Sg lagna in D-24 and Aq lagna in D-12 explain 
known events. But suppose we cannot explain his career. Suppose Aq lagna 
instead of Cp lagna explains his career well. Then what do we do? 

To get the next rasi as D-10 lagna (Aq instead of Cp), we should cross 
the next D-10 border, which is 6Sg00. So the lagna should become 6Sg00 
(or higher) instead of 4Sg39. So we have to add 1°21' or higher to lagna. 
Lagna moves by 1°21' or 81' in 81x4 sec = 324 sec = 5 min 24 sec. 

This means that the birthtime should be 9:10:24 instead of 9:05. Though 
we are told that the error in birthtime cannot be more than 5 minutes, it has 
to be more than 5 minutes in this case to explain known facts. 

Please note that these calculations are made on the assumption that 
lagna moves uniformly. That is not the case in reality. So the actual rectified 
birthtime may be a little off. We can do approximate calculations first and 



Part 5: Special Topics 373 

then see if it has to be corrected further. For example, we may get lagna at 
9:10:24 to be 5Sg59 instead ofthe expected value of 6Sg00. Then we have 
to add a few more seconds and see if we cross 6Sg00. 

One may see from this example that an astrologer should know the 
details of the computation of divisional charts and be familiar with the 
longitudes at which lagna changes rasi in various divisional charts. That 
familiarity is a necessity for quick birthtime rectification. 
Special Lagnas 

Hora lagna moves twice as fast as lagna. Ghati lagna moves 5 times as 
fast as lagna. 
Lesson: 
HL moves by 1° in 2 min. HL moves by 10' in 1/3 min (or 20 seconds). HL 
moves by 1' in 2 sec. HL moves by 10" in 1/3 sec. 
GL moves by 1° in 4/5 min (or 48 seconds). GL moves by 10' in 4.8 seconds. 
GL moves by 1' in 0.48 sec (less than half a second). 
Exercise 50: Suppose someone is born at 9:05 am and has GL at 20Le37. 
This puts GL in D-10 in Aq. Suppose we expect the D-10 GL in Ar to 
explain the native's periods of power and authority. What should the correct 
birthtime be? 

32.2.2 Dasas 
Rasi dasas based on rasi chart change only if lagna changes rasi or a 

planet changes rasi. Because lagna changes rasi once in 2 hours, we do not 
have to deal with inaccuracies in rasi dasas in most cases. 

Narayana dasa of divisional charts does not change in a small period of 
time, unless a planet changes rasi in the divisional chart of interest. 

Sence, the dasa start dates in nakshatra, dasas change with small 
changes in birthtime. Let us say the complete duration (and not just the 
remainder at birth) of the dasa running at birth is n years. Let us say the 
birthtime is wrong by m minutes. Moon stays in the nakshatra for about 
24x60 minutes (24 hours) and the error in the fraction of Moon's constellation 
that is yet to be traversed is m/(24x60). The error in the number of days of 
dasa left is n x 360 x m/(24x60) = (n x m)/4. If we add m minutes to the 
birthtime, we should subtract (n x m)/4 days from dasa dates and vice 
versa. 

If 7 years of Venus dasa remains at birth, then n = 20 and the 
approximate error in dasa dates is 20m/4 = 5m days, where m is the birthtime 
error in minutes. If the birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes, dasa dates are 
wrong by 10 days. 



374 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

If the birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes and 3 years of Moon dasa were 
remaining at birth, then n = 10 and m = 2 and the error in dasa dates is 10x2/ 
4 = 5 days. 

In Kalachakra dasa, the error is more. If n years is the paramayush of 
the sequence corresponding to the navamsa of natal Moon and m minutes is 
the error in birthtime, the error in the dates of dasa is (n x m) days. If we 
add m minutes to the birthtime, we should subtract (n x m) days from dasa 
dates and vice versa. 

For example, if the paramayush is 100 years and the birthtime error is 2 
minutes, then the error in dates is 200 days. It is almost 7 months! For this 
reason, it is futile to use pratyantardasas in Kalachakra dasa unless one is 
absolutely confident of the birthtime. 
32.2.3 Tajaka Charts 

If the change in lagna in the natal chart due to a birthtime change is x, 
then the lagna in the Tajaka annual and monthly charts will also change by 
approximately x. However, we have to keep in mind that the list of divisional 
charts in which lagna is near rasi borders may change. 

For example, let us say that natal lagna is at 23Sc30 and lagna in a 
Tajaka annual chart for 1980-81 is at 15Cn05. Let us say that the birthtime 
can have an error of upto 3 minutes (either way - plus or minus). Let us say 
that we are interested in the career of the native and especially in an event 
in career that took place in 1980-81. In natal D-10, lagna (23Sc30) is in the 
middle of the 8th dasamsa in Sc. Unless the birthtime changes by more than 6 
minutes in either direction, lagna in D-10 will not change. However, lagna in 
1980-81 Tajaka annual chart is close to a dasamsa border. If lagna is just 
below 15° in Cn, lagna in D-10 will be in the 5th from Pi. i.e. Cn itself. If 
lagna is just above 15° in Cn, lagna in D-10 will be in the 6th from Pi, i.e. Le. 
With the given birthtime, we get 15Cn05 and so lagna in D-10 in the Tajaka 
chart is in Le. But it could be Cn if the native's birth took place half a minute 
before the reported birthtime. 

Thus, sometimes we cannot detect a birthtime error just by looking at 
the natal chart and dasas. Looking at the divisional charts of Tajaka annual 
charts can help in some cases. 

The assumption here is that one casts Tajaka charts very accurately. 
This is not true with those who use the approximate method taught in this 
boo or those who find the exact solar return but use an approximate formula 
for Sun's motion or use a linear formula for ayanamsa. 

The actual ayanamsa used matters only to a small extent, in the sense 
that it has the same impact on the longitude of lagna and the rasis occupied 
by lagna in various divisional charts, as it has in the natal chart. On the other 



Part 5: Special Topics 375 

hand, using an approximate linear formula for ayanamsa brings minor 
discrepancy in Sun"s longitude which is multiplied by 360 in the longitude of 
lagna. This results in a serious error. Though we do not know exactly when 
Nirayana zodiac coincided with the Sayana zodiac, we do know the exact 
nonlinear formula of the precession. So one hoping to use Tajaka charts in 
birthtime rectification must use the correct nonlinear formula of the 
ayanamsa of one's choice. Unfortunately, many people use linear 
approximations. They are not good enough for Tajaka charts. 
32.3 A Practical Approach 

It is a good idea to first determine the correct D-9 lagna or D-10 lagna 
and then go to the other divisional charts. We should first determine that the 
birthtime is between 9:05 and 9:15. Then we can determine that it is between 
9:07 and 9:11. Then we can use a more precise criterion and narrow down 
further. Thus we narrow down further and further with each criterion. 

If one's marriage has already taken place, we can use D-9 to see it and 
fix D-9 lagna. If not, we can see one's general sense of duty, one's basic 
skills and one's interaction with others and fix D-9 lagna based on them. 
Then we can go to a higher divisional chart. However, in reality, sometimes 
it may become necessary to come back to D-9. For example, suppose 
someone can have lagna in D-9 in Li or Sc. Suppose we think that Li is also 
a good candidate but Sc is better. Then the candidates for D-24 lagna that 
we get with this choice may not make sense. It may make sense to place 
lagna in D-24 in another rasi and that may require lagna in D-9 to be in Li. 
In that case, we can revisit D-9 and change the lagna. 

Trying to first do a broad rectification with D-9 and D-10 and then 
doing a fine rectification with high divisional charts like D-20 and Kalachakra 
dasa will provide a systematic approach to the problem, but we should be 
willing to come back to the first step if we are stuck in the second step. 

After a couple of examples, this approach may become clearer. 
32.4 Practical Examples 

Example 130: Let us consider a gentleman whose birthdata is reported 
as: 30th November 1966, 10:36 am (IST), 77 E 47, 11 N 19. His D-4 and D-
9 are shown in Chart 75 and his D-10 and D-24 are shown in Chart 76. 

Lagna with the reported birthtime is at 13Cpl6. Let us approach the 
problem of rectification in a pyramid-like approach. First let us verify D-4 
lagna. The native left his motherland and went to USA in Jupiter dasa. In 
D-4, Jupiter owns 9th (flourishing abroad) and 12th (staying away from 
motherland) and he occupies the 7th house (long journeys). Rahu is the 
primary significator of foreign residence and he joins Jupiter. For these 



376 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

reasons, Jupiter dasa can certainly take him abroad. So lagna in D-4 is most 
probably correct. 

D-4 lagna changes rasi at multiples of 7.5°. The lagna we used above 
(13Cp 16) is between 7.5° and 15° in Cp. So we conclude that lagna is between 
7Cp30 and l5Cp00. 

Next, let us look at navamsa. In navamsa, lagna changes rasi at multiples 
of 3°20'. Here is changes at 13Cp20. The given lagna (13Cpl6) is just 
below it. We see from Chart 75 that navamsa lagna is in Ar. However, with 
a very small error, it can be Ta also. Let us consider both. 

If we take navamsa lagna in Ar, the native should be dynamic (Ar), 
spiritual and possibly short-tempered (Ketu). With Venus and Moon in trines, 
he should be skilled at singing or other arts. But he isn't. With Mercury in 
the 2nd house, he should be a skiled speaker. However, he isn't really a 
skillful speaker. 

If we take navamsa lagna in Ta, the native should be a hard-working 
and sincere (Ta) intellectual (Mercury). He should be mild-mannered, liked 
by most people and learned in many subjects (Mercury). This description 
fits the native better. So probably lagna is above 13Cp20. 

Chart 75 

 



Part 5: Special Topics 377 

Chart 76 

 
We have narrowed to the range 13Cp20-15Cp00, based on lagna in D-

4 and D-9. Now let us consider D-10, the chart of career. The native is a 
dynamic software engineer. In D-10, AL shows one's status in career and 
how people perceive one. Here AL is in Virgo and its lord Mercury aspects 
it. So he is perceived in his career as an intelligent person (Virgo and 
Mercury). The 10th house from AL has Mercury and Mars and it can explain 
a career in software. 

So probably lagna in D-10 is correct. This confirms that lagna is between 
12Cp00 and 15Cp00. But we have no further narrowing down because of 



378 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

D-10. We still have 13Cp20-15Cp00 as the rectified window. 
Now let us go to a higher level divisional chart and take D-24, the chart 

of education and learning. The native studied computer science at a good 
engineering college in India during his Jupiter dasa. With lagna in Ta, the 4th 

house of education is in Le. Sun owns it. Rahu, Ketu, Venus and Mars 
aspect it. With this, education in medicine or management is likely. Education 
in computer science is unlikely. Moreover, education in Jupiter dasa is 
unlikely. 

If we take the birthtime above 13Cp45, lagna in D-24 changes from Ta 
to Ge. Then the 4th house is in Vi, aspected by Mercury, Moon and Jupiter. 
Mercury and Virgo can give education in computer science. Jupiter is in 
own house. He aspects the 4th house and joins 4th lord Mercury. So his dasa 
can give education. A4 is in Ge and Sun occupies it. So he may study at a 
popular college of engineering or science. 

To get lagna in D-24 in Ge instead of Ta, lagna needs to be above 
13Cp45. So the final rectified birthtime window after looking at the four 
divisional charts is 13Cp45-15Cp00. To narrow down further, we need to 
look at D-40, D-45 and D-60. We can also use Kalachakra dasa. 

With a birthtime of 10:36 am, we have lagna at 13Cpl6 and Kalachakra 
dasa of Ta runs from 1987 to 2003. The native got married at the end of 
1996. Ta dasa makes sense because navamsa lagna is in Ta. We should 
look at antardasa now. Pi antardasa starts in May 1995, Ar antardasa in 
April 1997 and Ta antardasa in Aug 1998. 

Because the rectified birthtime has to be between 13Cp45 and 15Cp00, 
let us first try 13Cp45. We need to add half a degree to lagna. So we need 
to add 2 minutes to birthtime and make it 10:38 am. The paramayush is 86 
years and if we add 2 minutes to the birthtime, we should subtract 82x2 = 
164 days from dasa dates. This brings the start date of Ar antardasa to Oct 
1996 and Ta antardasa to Feb 1998. However, marriage is unlikely in Pi and 
Ar antardasas. With Ta being lagna and Ge being the 7th house from Venus. 
marriage is most likely in Ta and Ge antardasas. So the start date of Ta 
antardasa must be moved from Feb 1998 to the end of 1996. We need to 
subtract about 400 days from the dasa dates. This requires further addition 
of 400/86=4.7' minutes to the birthtime. This will add another degree to 
lagna and lagna will be just below 15°. The rectified birthtime is around 
10:42:30. The error in the reported birthtime can be due to errors in the 
clock used. 

Of course, if we use the rectified birthdata and verify a few more 
events in the life of the native, we can be more confident that the rectification 
is correct. 



Part 5: Special Topics 379 

Example 131: Suppose an astrologer friend of ours approaches us with 
the rasi chart of a gentleman, shown in Chart 77. Because the birth happened 
in 1939, we cannot rule out huge errors. The error need not be just 2 or 3 
minutes. An error of even 10 minutes is possible. 

Chart 77 

 

Let us say that the only thing our friend knows about this gentleman is 
that he thinks that 1978-79 was the golden period of life in terms of his 
finances and that he has been experiencing financial tightness since 1996-
97. We have to rectify the chart just based on this information. 

Which dasa should we use for financial matters? It is Sudasa. Let us 
find Sudasa. 

Moon is at 13°13'25" in Leo. He is in Makha constellation, which runs 
from 0°to 13°20' in Le. His advancement in nakshatra is (13°13'25")/ (13°20') 
= (793.4167')/(800') = 0.99177. The same fraction of the entire zodiac is 
0.99177x360 = 357.0375° = 357° 2' 15". Adding this to lagna, we get Sree 
Lagna. Lagna is at 17°35'50" in Pi. So we get Sree Lagna at 14°38'5" in Pi. 
Sudasa starts from Pi. Because Sree Lagna is in an even rasi, Sudasa goes 
backward. We reckon quadrants, panapharas and apoklimas backwards 
and get Pi, Sg, Vi, Ge, Aq, Sc, Le, Ta, Cp, Li, Cn and Ar. Dasa periods are 
as in Narayana dasa. However, there is an exception for the first dasa. 
Because Jupiter is in Pi, Pi dasa is for 12 years. However, only a fraction of 
this is left at birth, based on the fraction of the rasi yet to be traversed by 



380 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Sree Lagna. This fraction is(30o-14°38'5")/30° = 0.51218. So the remainder 
of Pi dasa at birth is 0.51218x12 years = 6 years 1 month 23 days. 

We get dasas as 
Pi(6.15yrs): Sep 12, 1939-Oct 03, 1945 
Sg(03 years): Oct 03, 1945-Oct 03, 1948 
Vi (01 years): Oct 03, 1948-Oct 03, 1949 
Ge (02 years): Oct 03, 1949 - Oct 03, 1951 
Aq (09 years): Oct 03, 1951 - Oct 03, 1960 
Sc (05 years): Oct 03, 1960-Oct 03, 1965 
Le (12 years): Oct 03, 1965-Oct 03, 1977 
Ta(03 years): Oct 03, 1977-Oct 03, 1980 
Cp (08 years): Oct 03, 1980-Oct 03, 1988 
Li (10 years): Oct 03, 1988-Oct 03, 1998 
Cn (11 years): Oct 03, 1998 - Oct 03, 2009 

Why did the native start feeling financial tightness in 1996-97? Libra 
dasa was running then. Though Libra has Rahu in it, it is nevertheless the 
11th house from AL. Sudasa of the 11th house from AL is usually favorable. 

However, we see that Cn dasa started in 1998. Cn is the 8th house from 
AL. The 8th house from AL stands for fall of status and material setbacks. 
It can certainly show financial tightness in Sudasa. Though two good 
upagrahas (Artha Prahara and Yamaghantaka - similar to Mercury and 
Jupiter in effects) are present in it, Cn contains two highly malefic upagrahas 
also - Indrachapa and Upaketu. 

If the native has been experiencing financial tightness since Cn dasa 
started, it makes good sense. So probably Cn dasa should start in mid-1996 
instead of Oct 1998. What is the required change in birth time for this 
change in Sudasa dates? 
Exercise 51: We calculated the formulas for the approximate change in 
Vimsottari dasa and Kalachakra dasa dates if birthtime changes by m 
minutes. Do the same thing for Sudasa. 

Complete the exercise before reading further. Based on the formula at 
the end of the exercise, dates of dasas in Sudasa move back by 6x12xm 
days if we add m minutes to the birthtime. We want it to move by 2 years or 
720 days. So m should be 720/(6x12), i.e. 10. We should add 10 minutes to 
the birthtime and make it 7:40 pm. However, after calculating Sudasa for a 
birthtime of 7:40 pm, we realize that the dates of dasas have moved by 



Part 5: Special Topics 381 

almost 2.5 years instead of 2 years92. To get dasa start dates 2 years earlier, 
we just need to make the birthtime 7:38 pm. 

With this new time, Cn dasa started in mid-1996. With Cn being the 8th 

house from AL, its dasa gave financial tightness. 
Example 132: Suppose the rasi chart in Chart 78 is given to us as the chart 
of Microsoft company's Bill Gates. Suppose we have verified several 
divisional charts and they seem fine. Suppose we want to micro-rectify it. 

The technique to be used for birthtime rectification varies from chart to 
chart. If one's D-10 lagna is close to a rasi border, we should use a technique 
that is sensitive to D-10 lagna and see which alternative makes better sense. 
If GL is close to a rasi border, we should use a technique that depends 
critically on GL and see which alternative makes better sense. 

Here one can note that Sree Lagna (SL) is on a rasi border. With the 
birthtime of 9:15 pm, SL is at 28Arl5. If a few minutes are added to the 
birthtime, SL will be in Ta. We should use a technique that is sensitive to the 
rasi occupied by SL and see whether SL in Ar or Ta makes better sense. 

Of course, Sudasa depends on SL and we should compute Sudasa. 
Chart 78 

 
92 The error in our approximations is due to assuming that lagna and Moon move at a 

certain uniform rate. The rate at which they move is not really linear/uniform. So the 
formulas given here should only be used for reference. One should finally compute 
charts and dasas for the rectified time and verify the rectification. 



382 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

If SL is in Ar, Sudasa starts from Ar and goes as Ar, Cn, Li, Cp, Ta, Le, 
Sc etc. If SL is in Ta, Sudasa starts from Ta. Normally it will go as Ta, Aq, 
Sc, Le, Ar, Cp, Li etc, but Ketu's presence in Ta reverses the direction. So 
Sudasa goes as Ta, Le, Sc, Aq, Ge, Vi, Sg etc. 

In the first case, one can see that Scorpio dasa runs from 1990 to 2000. 
In the second case, Virgo dasa runs during 1988-2000. Bill Gates was 
financially very successful and he became the world's richest man in late 
1990's. Which dasa explains his financial success better? 

Scorpio is the 3rd house from AL and upachayas from AL bring 
improvements in one's status. However, Scorpio has no aspect on HL. 
Moreover, it is afflicted by Rahu. So Scorpio dasa is not that great. 

On the other hand, Virgo dasa can bring excellent results. It contains 
AL and its exalted lord. It is aspected by bhaagya pada (A9, arudha pada of 
the 9th house) and occupied by the exalted lord of bhaagya pada. The 9th 

house shows one's fortune. One may be fortunate to have a good guru and 
one may be fortunate to have a good leader. But the world's perceptions of 
one's fortune are driven by the recognition one gets and formal distinctions 
like being named in Forbes list of richest men. These are what drive the 
world's perceptions about one's fortune. A9 shows them the best. If Sudasa 
of a rasi containing the exalted lord of A9 and aspected by A9 runs, it can 
very much bring material fortune of the highest kind. Moreover, Vi aspects 
HL in Sg. For all these reasons, SL in Ta explains the native's known past 
better. So we should add a few minutes to the birthtime. 

Chart 79 

 



Part 5: Special Topics 383 

Example 133: Let us consider a lady whose D-10 is shown in Chart 
79. She is a good singer and sang in some radio and television programs in 
India, but her career was cut down when she got married to an Indian 
engineer in USA and went to USA with him. In 1998, she started a music 
school in USA and started teaching Carnatic (south Indian classical) music. 

In her D-10, Mars in the 10th house shows own ventures and enterprise. 
The 10th lord Sun joins Venus in the 5th house and shows fame as a singer. 
Sun-Venus combination can show music. Venus stands for creative activities. 
Sun and Moon stand for music. Sun stands for rhythm and Moon stands for 
melody. So a career in music is possible. As per Vimsottari dasa, Sun dasa 
started in 1998. This may be why her career was restarted in 1998. Let us 
check her Kalachakra dasa. 

Kalachakra dasa of Aquarius started in October 1999. It may be noted 
that Aquarius contains Venus and 10th lord Sun. So Kalachakra dasa must 
have started just before she started her music institute. To get the Kalachakra 
dasas a little earlier, we need to add a little to the birthtime. So we should 
add a few minutes to the birthtime and make sure that Kalachakra dasa of 
Aquarius starts just before her career is restarted. 

We have so far looked at 4 examples. In the first example, we had to 
look at several divisional charts to rectify the birthtime. In the second example, 
we rectified the birthtime based on a dasa. We did it because the past 
events given to us relate to an area of life (finances), for which there is an 
appropriate dasa. In the 3rd chart also, we used the same dasa, but for a 
different reason. We did it because a key parameter was on a rasi border. 
In the 4th example, we used Kalachakra dasa. Being a sensitive dasa, 
Kalachakra dasa is usually very useful in carrying out a fine birthtime 
rectification. 

One should choose the approach on a chart-by-chart basis. The 
information provided by a client about past events should decide the techniques 
to be used. Birthtime rectification is an area in which one can become good 
only after considerable practice. There are no hard and fast rules. 
32.5 Conclusion 

There are two kinds of birthtime rectification - macro-rectification and 
micro-rectification. Macro-rectification is the case when you have two or 
more totally different birthdata from different sources and want to find out 
which is correct. For example, there are different versions of Sri A.B. 
Vajpayee's birthdata. If we want to find out which is correct, we have to 
look at various divisional charts and life events and see which one works 
better. 

Micro-rectification is the one that we will need the most in practical 



384 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

consultations. The birthdata reported by clients usually has a little error and 
we have to rectify the birthtime. 

Some people use some formula based techniques for birthtime 
rectification and assume that human births happen only in certain quanta of 
tirne. Most of those techniques do not work. The only correct way to rectify 
a birthtime is to correct it in such a way that one's nature and past life 
events are well explained. An astrologer should have an idea of the change 
introduced in various computations if the birthtime changes a little. Using 
lagna in D-9, D-10 etc, we can broadly rectify the birthtime. Then we can 
rectify it with a finer precision by going to higher divisional charts like D-20 
and D-24 and using Kalachakra dasa. A couple of examples were provided 
in this book. Readers should understand the examples thoroughly and practice 
these techniques with as many charts as they can. The adage that practice 
makes one perfect is particularly true in this area. Readers should remember 
that correct birthtime rectification lays a solid foundation for the entire chart 
analysis - without correct birthtime rectification, all other fine techniques 
we learnt in this book are useless. 
32.6   Answers to Exercises 
Exercise 50: 

GL in D-10 goes to the next rasi at multiples of 3°. Here it goes from Aq 
to Pi when GL crosses 21°. It goes from Pi to Ar when GL crosses 24°. So 
GL has to be at or above 24Le00. So the amount we have to add is 24°0' -
20° 37'= 3° 21'= 201'. 

GL moves by 201' in 201 x 0.48 sec = 96.48 sec = 1 min 6.48 sec. So 
we should roughly add 1 min 7 sec and the birthtime should be 9:06:07 am or 
above. 

There is an upper limit also. If it becomes too high, GL in D-10 will 
move from Ar to Ta. But we decided that GL in D-10 in Ar makes the best 
sense. So we cannot add another 3° to GL. GL moves by 3° in 3 x 4/5 = 12/ 
5 min = 2 min 24 sec. Adding this to 9:06:07, we get 9:08:31. So the birthtime 
should be between 9:06:07 am and 9:08:31 am for GL in D-10 to be in Ar. 

If we create several inequations like the above using lagna and special 
lagnas in various divisional charts, we can narrow down to the correct 
birthtime. 
Exercise 51: 

Lagna moves by 30° if the birthtime changes by 120 minutes. If the 
birthtime changes by m minutes, lagna changes by (m/120)x30 = (m/4)°. 
Moon moves by 3°20' (one quarter of a nakshatra) in 6 hours or 360 minutes. 
So, if the birthtime changes by m minutes, Moon's longitude changes by (ml 



Part 5: Special Topics 385 

360)x(3°20'). So the fraction of the nakshatra occupied by Moon that is 
already traversed by Moon, changes by (m/360)x(3°20')/(13°20')=m/(360x4). 
When we find this as a fraction of the zodiac, the change is 360°xm/(360X4) 
= (m/4)°. The error in Sree Lagna is the sum of the error in lagna and the 
error in this fraction of zodiac. So Sree Lagna changes by (m/ 4)° + (m/4)° = 
(m/2)°. 
Lesson: Sree Lagna moves twice as fast as lagna. Hora lagna and Sree 
lagna, which move twice as fast as lagna, show the matters related to the 
2nd house, i.e. money (HL is useful in death also). Ghati lagna, which moves 
5 times as fast as lagna, shows the matters related to the 5th house, i.e. 
fame, power and authority. 
If Sree Lagna increases by (m/2)°, then (30° - Sree Lagna) decreases by 
(m/2)°. The fraction (30° - Sree Lagna)/30° decreases by (m/60). If the 
complete length of the first dasa is n years, then the remainder of the first 
dasa at birth decreases by nx(m/60) years = (6 x n x m) days. If the 
remainder of the first dasa at birth decreases by these many days, all dasas 
come these many days earlier. 
Formula: If the complete Narayana dasa length of the first dasa in Sudasa 
is n years and the birthtime changes by m minutes, all the dasa and antardasa 
dates change by approximately (6 x n x m) days. If the birthtime is 
earlier, dasas will come later and vice versa. 
CAUTION: When we consider a change in birthtime by m minutes, it is possible 
that Moon changes nakshatra during the time. The above calculations still 
hold. When Moon is at the end of a nakshatra, the amount added to lagna to 
get Sree Lagna is just below 360°. When Moon moves to the next nakshatra, 
it changes to 0°. Though we have a big change in numbers, it is a continuous 
change and 360° = 0°. So we need not worry and we can use the above 
formula. However, if Sree Lagna changes rasi during the m minutes, Sudasa 
calculation changes completely and the above formula is no longer valid. 
For example, if Sree Lagna is at 29° in Ar and we consider adding 4 min to 
the birthtime, it changes Sree Lagna by (4/2)° and it goes to 1° in Ta. The 
whole dasa sequence changes now and we cannot use the above formula. 



33. Rational Thinking 

33.1 Introduction 
Astrology lovers insist that it is a science. But any conscientious person 

familiar with the modern definition of "science" will agree that it is not a 
science. It may have been a science a few thousand years back, but it is no 
longer a science. A lot of astrological knowledge of Vedic times became 
corrupt in the last few hundred years, because of the degeneration of Indian 
culture precipitated by foreign invasions. The correct knowledge of the 
science of Vedic astrology is broken into parts and hidden in small corners 
of India. There are a lot of traditional families in India, which guard some 
special astrological techniques as "family secrets". The knowledge that is 
explicitly taught in most books - including this book - is either incomplete or 
simply incorrect. Gathering the correct knowledge from the remote corners 
of India and consolidating it is a daunting task. 

It makes no sense to start from scratch and develop this subject 
completely. The best approach is to understand the teachings of sages 
correctly and then experiment to confirm our understanding. However, it is 
easier said than done. Astrologers don't agree even on the basics - such as 
the zodiac to be used and the ayanamsa. There are just too many things that 
are ambiguous and not completely clarified in classics. To complicate things 
further, some modern savants are making their own ill-considered departures 
from the teachings of sages and foolishly popularizing them. That only adds 
to the corruption of this knowledge. 

The bottom line is — things are in a mess and astrology is far from 
being a science. However, readers need not despair. It is this author's 
prediction that astrology research will flourish in the coming century and a 
lot of long-standing issues will be resolved conclusively. 

Understanding and accepting that a problem exists is the first step in 
fixing it. This author's intention is to make the readers aware of the problems. 
While we certainly want to keep the sanctity of the subject of astrology 
intact and not unduly worry about having it accepted as a science, it can 
only do good to apply the paradigms of modern science and approach 
astrology with a rational outlook. 
33.2 Irrational Explanations 

Because of the corruption that is rampant in astrological knowledge, 
people often use wrong principles to explain an event and fail in presenting 
straight-forward and sound logic. They beat around the bush to explain an 
event sometimes. 



Part 5: Special Topics 387 

Example 134: We may hear people making a typing mistake and 
saying,"Mercury is retrograde. That is why people are making mistakes 
these days". Pray, do these mistakes happen only when Mercury is 
retrograde? Or, do they happen with a considerably higher frequency when 
Mercury is retrograde? Mercury's retrogression may last a couple of weeks 
and do the mistakes happen exactly during those two weeks? 

If not, how can we correlate Mercury's retrogression and the typing 
mistakes? Probably the mistakes happen all the time, but they are more 
frequent during a few days. But the reason has to be a sookshma dasa or a 
praana dasa or a Bhrigu transit during that time, rather than Mercury's 
retrogression. 

We should look at the nature of the event and the time period of its 
effectiveness and look for an astrological factor with almost the same period 
of effectiveness. One may make typing mistakes everyday, but a particular 
day may be worse than usual. In that case, the period of effectiveness of 
the event (viz making too many typing mistakes) is that day. A month-long 
retrogression or a year-long transit cannot be its reason. If we correlate it 
with an astrological factor with the same period of effectiveness (e.g. a 
sookshma dasa of Narayana dasa or Mercury's D-27 transit in a sign occupied 
in natal rasi chart by Rahu), it is plausible. But if we attribute the event to 
retrograde Mercury or debilitated Jupiter, it is not logical. 

Example 135: Someone may have a very bad time at his office on a 
particular afternoon. He may say,"oh, it's because I am running the Vimsottari 
dasa of the 8th lord in D-10." 

It is true that the 8th lord in D-10 can give the results experienced, but 
that doesn't mean his dasa was responsible for an isolated event in an 
afternoon. If one has similar experiences frequently, during the entire period 
of a dasa, then we can blame that dasa. After all, a dasa shows the overall 
mood in a long period of time. 

However, if that is not the case and the experience is an isolated incident, 
then it is irrational to explain it using a dasa. Some other astrological factor 
with a smaller period of effect may have caused the event. For example, 
Moon may be transiting in D-10 in a rasi occupied by Saturn and Rahu in 
natal rasi chart. Moon, Sun and lagna lord in D-10 may be transiting in 
kakshyas without a rekha. The latter may show a bad period of a few days 
and the former factor with a period of effectiveness of about 6 hours may 
have triggered the event. 

We will find the correct factor behind an event only if we search for it 
without compromising. A true researcher never compromises. Of course, 
there may be many astrological factors contributing to the manufacturing of 



388 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

an event and we may not be able to find all of them because we don't know 
all the possible techniques. Nevertheless, we should try to find the right 
factor within the limits of our knowledge. Accepting a wrong factor as the 
reason for an event is illogical. Attributing an isolated incident in a day to a 
dasa that runs for 10 years is irrational. 

Some astrologers may make a correct prediction based on illogical 
thinking, due to luck (or spiritual strength). We should not be blinded by the 
success of a prediction. Success of a prediction does not prove the validity 
of the methods used. We may try to enhance our predictive success through 
good spiritual practices, but we should also try to identify the right factors 
behind various events and consolidate the scientific aspects of Vedic 
astrology. The scientific and spiritual aspects of astrology should go together 
and strengthen each other. 
33.3   Known Past vs Future 

Some authors present some principles in their books and present many 
examples that show the efficacy of the principles. 

However, one finds many times that these principles are too vague to 
be useful in practice. They are good enough to explain known past, but not 
good enough to predict future. 

An extreme example will make this clearer. Suppose someone presents 
us with a principle: "Someone born with lagna in an airy sign gets married 
when Venus transits in an own sign or a friendly sign or a watery sign or a 
trine from natal 7th house". It may make sense to us, because Venus is the 
significator of marriage and being in an own sign or a friendly sign or a 
watery sign makes this watery planet strong. Also, Venus transiting in a 
trine from natal 7th house may seem favorable for marriage to occur. 

We may test this principle against as many examples as we want and 
we will find it to be satisfied in 100% cases. Does that mean that this is an 
excellent principle? 

No! This is not a meaningful or useful principle at all. Why? The list 
given covers the entire zodiac. Ta and Li are own signs of Venus. Ge, Vi, 
Cp and Aq are friendly signs. Cn, Sc and Pi are watery signs. Ar, Le and Sg 
are trines from the 7th house for any person with lagna in an airy sign. If you 
count the signs, you will find that all the twelve signs are covered! So the 
principle indirectly means, "someone born in an airy sign gets married when 
Venus transits in one of the 12 signs". Of course, Venus transits one of the 
12 signs always and this is a trivially correct statement. So it will be satisfied 
in the case of all people with lagna in an airy sign. 



Part 5: Special Topics 389 

But, can we use it to make any predictions? If we get the chart of 
someone with lagna in an airy sign, can we predict using this principle when 
he will get married? No! 

This is the problem with vague astrological principles. True, this is an 
extreme example, but didn't "Venus in own or friendly or watery sign or a 
trine from the 7th house" make some sense to us? However, it turned out to 
be too general (or vague) to help us in making a precise prediction. 

Constructors like the above are commonly found in astrological literature. 
We talk about the 7th lord giving marriage or a planet aspecting or occupying 
7th or 7th lord. Or a planet having an argala on 7th or 7th lord. If it is still not 
enough, we can add the nakshatra lord of 7th lord or his dispositor or someone 
else. As we add conditions, we finally cover all the planets. We can always 
explain the known past this way. Of course, if we have a standard procedure 
for finding the strongest candidate among all those planets and if his dasa 
always gives the results, then it is logical. But, if there are 6 candidates and 
we explain an event by simply showing the candidacy of the planet involved, 
it is irrational. We are in trouble when making predictions about future in 
that approach - which of the umpteen candidates will give the result? 

The root cause of the problem is that we often use the wrong tool to 
analyze a matter. Sages explained hundreds of dasa systems and yet we 
use only a handful. When we use the correct technique, probably the strongest 
candidate gives the result. When we use a wrong technique, we are forced 
to give a vague justification. 

For example, we saw in Example 58 that Mercury (8th lord in 7th) and 
Rahu (malefic in 2nd) were the strongest killer planets. By taking a variation 
of Vimsottari dasa that starts from the 8th star from Moon's star, we found 
that the native passed away in Rahu's antardasa in Mercury's dasa. 
However, one relying on standard Vimsottari dasa always will find that 
Venus dasa is running and he will explain the event based on the situation of 
Venus in the 7th house. But, if we take yogakaraka Venus to be a maraka 
because he is in the 7th house, we can take 6 planets (occupants and lords 
of 2nd and 7th) as marakas. With 6 planets out of 9 qualifying as marakas, 
how can we predict when the native passes away? On the other hand, by 
using the most appropriate dasa, we see that the event was given by the 
strongest candidates. 

Because of the corruption in astrological knowledge, many contemporary 
astrologers don't use the most appropriate techniques always. Due to this, 
they have to deal with a lot of vagueness and they rely on spiritual strength 



390 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

for correct predictions. When explaining the past, a vague principle is fine. 
But predicting the future becomes difficult. One needs luck or spiritual 
strength. 

93 
33.4   Probability Analysis 

The point made above can be expressed mathematically. Let us say 
that event A denotes the occurrence (satisfying) of an astrological 
combination. Let us say that event B denotes the occurrence of an event. 
Let us say that we want to correlate and link A with B. For example, event 
A can be "Venus transits in a trine from the 7th house" and event B can be 
"the native gets married". 

Now the conditional probability P(A|B) denotes the probability (or 
chance) that A occurs, given that B occurred, i.e. the chance that the 
combination is satisfied given that one gets married. 

And P(B|A) denotes the probability (or chance) that B occurs, given 
that A occurred, i.e. the chance that one gets married given the combination 
is satisfied. 

The two are different. When making predictions in real life, we are 
concerned with P(B|A). However, when explaining a known event in a 
book, we are concerned with P(A|B). If A is a large composite of many 
small conditions joined by "or" (e.g. Venus trnasits in a trine from the 7th 

house or Jupiter aspects UL in transit or dasa of UL lord runs or dasa of 7th 

lord runs), we maximize P(A|B). In other words, A is satisfied in most 
charts when B (marriage) occurs. So we think that A is an excellent principle 
with a good correlation with event B. However, making A very large makes 
P(B|A) very low and we can't predict B just because A occurred. 

So we should stop unduly worrying about P(A|B) and we should worry 
more about P(B|A). High P(A|B) helps us in giving nice examples in books. 
It doesn't help us in predictions. We should not make our principles vague 
combinations of many components (e.g. if combinations x or y or z or w or 
v or u is satisfied, then event B occurs). We should always identify the 
strongest candidate to give an event. If an event is given by one of the six or 
seven weak candidates, we should reject the logic and search for an 
alternative technique in which the event is given by the best candidate. Only 
with an uncompromising rational approach and dedicated research into the 
teachings of great sages can we ever appreciate the subject of astrology in 
its fullest glory. 

93 Some knowledge of the probability theory will be assumed in this discussion. Readers 
can refer to standard high school/college mathematics textbooks. 



Part 5: Special Topics 391 

33.5    Statistical Research 
When we come across an astrological principle, we can evaluate its 

worth using statistical research. We can take as many examples as we can 
and find out in what percentage of examples the principle is satisfied. 
Sometimes the result attributed to an astrological combination may be vague 
and subjective. But sometimes, we have clearly defined events as results 
and we can use statistical research in such cases. 

Example 136: Suppose we want to evaluate the principle: "one gets 
married when the dasa and the antardasa as per Navamsa Narayana dasa 
belong to one of the four - lagna, upapada, 3rd from upapada and 8th from 
upapada". It is clearly defined. We can take 200 charts of married people 
and find the dasa and the antardasa running at the time of marriage. We can 
find the number of charts in which both dasa and antardasa belong to the 4 
signs mentioned. Suppose the number of such charts is 90. So the success 
rate of the principle is 90x100/200 = 45%. 

This means that the predictions made just using this principle will not 
have 100% success. However, the question is — is 45% good enough for 
this principle or not? 

Assuming that there is really no correlation between getting married 
and this combination, we can find the expected success rate. If the real 
success rate is considerably higher, it means that there is a correlation. It 
will become clearer after we make some calculations. 

Suppose there is no correlation between the above combination and 
getting married. Then let us find the probability of the dasa and the antardasa 
being one of the four signs on a random date. We have 4 signs. To maximize 
this probability (i.e. go to the worst case), let us say that lagna is not in the 
same sign as UL or the 3rd/8th from UL. So we have 4 signs out of 12. The 
probability that the dasa on any day belongs to these 4 signs is 4/12=1/3. 
Similarly, the probability that the antardasa on any day belongs to these 4 
signs is 4/12=1/3. These two events are independent and the probability that 
the dasa and the antardasa on any day belong to these 4 signs is (l/3)x(l/3) 
= 1/9. Expressed as a percentage, this is 11%. 

What this means is — if we find the dasa and the antardasa on any day, 
both belong to lagna or the 1st, 3rd or 8th from UL in only 11% cases on 
average. However, if the dasa and the antardasa on the day of marriage 
belong to these 4 signs in 45% cases, it is 4 times the expected success rate. 
That clearly shows that there is a link between the combination and marriage. 
This shows a statistically significant correlation. 

Analysis as above does not directly help us in making predictions, but it 
helps us in validating atleast a part of astrology as a probabilistic science. 



392 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Astrology researchers who have the resources and skills should intelligently 
formulate well-defined principles, test them statistically and find the success 
rate and compare it with the expected success rate as above. Instead of 
lamenting the rejection of astrology by the scientific community, we should 
engage in this exercise and convince ourselves first. 

This author is confident that exercises like this will establish parts of 
Vedic astrology as a science in the coming decades. Such statistical studies 
were conducted by some scientists and western astrologers in the past, but 
those people did not use the right factors. They did not have a proper grounding 
in serious Vedic astrology. Divisions, houses, arudhas, argalas, multiple dasas 
etc will enable us to conduct more meaningful and fruitive statistical research. 
Fuzzy logic theory will also be helpful. 
Exercise 52: Suppose we evaluate the principle: "Chara dasa of a rasi 
occupied or aspected by the 3rd house or a rasi occupied or aspected by the 
3rd lord or a rasi occupied or aspected by BK results in the birth of a brother". 
Suppose it is correct in 75% charts we examine. Evaluate the worth of this 
principle. 
[HINT: If events A, B and C are independent, P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) 
+ P(C) - P(A).P(B) - P(B).P(C) - P(C).P(A) + P(A).P(B).P(C)] 

33.6 Why Astrology Works 
While we discuss rational thinking, we may as well address this most 

asked question: "Why does astrology work? How can planets have an impact 
on us? Isn't it irrational to think they do?" 

Unfortunately we don't know exactly why planets influence us. We 
may not find that out in near future. Nevertheless, the subject of astrology 
becomes valid and justified if we prove some correlations statistically. Even 
if we cannot explain why planets influence us, we can still study the 
correlations between planetary motion and events in our lives. While it will 
be nice to be able to answer the fundamental question raised above, it is not 
necessary for astrology to be accepted as a statistical science. Some 
pseudorational people argue that astrology cannot be a science as long as 
we cannot explain why planets influence us. But that is not logical. 

Sometimes we cannot explain new observations on the basis of old 
models and we have to come up with new theories and postulates. We may 
not be able to explain the influence of planets on us on the basis of the 
scientific model of the universe we have today. But that does not trivialize 
the statistical study of the correlations between planetary combinations and 
events in the lives of individuals. 



Part 5: Special Topics 393 

33.7 Conclusion 
Many astrologers lament the fact astrology is not accepted as a science. 

But they do not realize that a lot needs to be done before astrology is accepted 
as a science. A few common problems are discussed in this chapter. It is 
this author's hope that atleast some readers are motivated to evaluate astrology 
using the tools given by modern science. Spirituality, respect for Sages and 
scientific temper can co-exist. 
33.8 Answers to Eexrcises 
Exercise 52: 

Let event A be: "dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3rd house". Let 
event B be: "dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3rd lord". Let event C be: 
"dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by BK". A rasi is aspected by 3 rasis (by 
rasi aspect). So P(A), P(B) and P(C) are all equal to 4/12=1/3 here. 

So the combined probability is (1/3)+(l/3)+(l/3)-(l/9)-(l/9)-(l/9)+(l/ 
27) = 19/27 or 70%. Though 75% is higher than 70%, it is not considerably 
higher. So there isn't any statistically significant correlation. 

[Basically, combinations that are satisfied in 70% cases on average are 
poor candidates for our studies. Even if the combination is satisfied in 90% 
of the cases when the event occurred, we cannot correlate the combination 
with the event with confidence. On the other hand, if a combination is satisfied 
only in 5% cases on average, we can suggest a good correlation even if the 
combination is satisfied in 25% cases when the event occurred. Because 
25 is 5 times 5, there is a strong correlation between the combination and 
the event in that case.] 



34. Remedial Measures 

34.1  Introduction 

After stressing the importance of rational thinking in astrological analysis, 
let us come to an important topic that has no rational explanation. Those 
who have no belief in Vedic remedies may skip this chapter. 

An expert astrologer may be able to predict bad times and setbacks 
successfully. But what good is it for, if something cannot be done to avert 
the setbacks and bad times? A doctor not only identifies the disease one is 
suffering from, but prescribes drugs to cure it. Can we do the same thing in 
astrology? 

In this chapter, we will take a look at remedial measures. Remedial 
measures are the measures that are taken to remedy the unfortunate 
situations that a native is going through or is expected to go through. 

The pattern to be followed by one's life is decided at the time of one's 
birth by the of planetary position then, which is in turn decided by the karma 
(actions) accumulated in past lives. However, it only decides the basic 
'pattern' and not all the minute details. Though the basic pattern cannot be 
easily altered, the exact details can be altered by exercising free will. For 
example, one may be destined to have a vehicular accident on a particular 
day, but it can be a minor accident or a major one. Actions taken by one's 
free will have a role, along with the accumulated actions (karma) of past 
lives, in deciding the exact details. Remedial measures are the measures 
we take in order to manipulate the exact details to be relatively favorable to 
us. 
34.1.1 Commonsense Remedies 

When we anticipate good happenings, we can afford to take a few 
risks. On the other hand, we can take extra precautions when we anticipate 
bad happenings. If an accident is possible in a period, we can drive very 
carefully or even avoid travel if possible. If quarrels with authorities are 
possible in a period, one can be extra careful and consciously try to restrain 
oneself. 

In this manner, we can take commonsense precautions to avert, or to 
reduce the impact of, the bad events anticipated. 
34.1.2 Pacifying Planets 

In Hinduism, we can remedy a bad result by the pacification of planets. 
There are 4 ways to make planets happy: 



Part 5: Special Topics 395 

(1) Wearing a gemstone: This works only for planets that are favorable in 
one's horoscope. We can wear the gemstones of such planets to protect 
us. 

(2) Good deeds: By committing good deeds, we can pacify planets. 
(3) Planetary Propitiation: By reciting the mantras and stotras of planets, 

we can pacify them. Mantra is a combination of sounds with a special 
powerto produce beneficial spiritual waves within us. Stotras are hymns 
in praise of planets. 

(4) Propitiation of Deities: By propitiating various deities, we can pacify 
various planets. 

34.2 Gemstones 
One can wear the gemstones of favorable planets to get the blessings 

of those planets and tide over troubles. Look at the functional benefics in 
one's rasi chart and prescribe their gemstones. If a planet's dasa is running 
or if a planet is taking part in a favorable yoga, we may choose that planet. 
Wearing the gemstone of a planet speeds up the fructification of the good 
results promised in a chart by that planet. 

If one wants good results in a particular area of life, we may strengthen 
favorable planets in the relevant divisional chart. For example, suppose 
someone wants improvement in career. We can prescribe the gemstone of 
ayogakaraka in D-10 then. If a functional benefic is badly placed or weak, 
its gemstone can still be used. For example, if one has lagna in Cp, Venus is 
a yogakaraka. Suppose Venus is in the 8th house (Le). Then he may not 
give good results in his dasa despite being a yogakaraka. In such a case, 
wearing diamond (gemstone of Venus) makes Venus powerful enough to 
give good results. On the other hand, gemstones of functional malefics in a 
chart should be avoided as far as possible. In addition, the gemstones of 
marakas should be avoided when one is running maraka dasas. A list of the 
gemstones and metals of various planets are given in Table 77. A ring made 
of the suggested metal with the suggested gemstone can be used for 
strengthening the planet. 

Table 77: Gemstones of planets 
 

Planet Gemstone Metal 
Sun Ruby Gold 
Moon White pearl Gold 
Mars Red coral Copper 
Mercury Emerald Silver/Platinum 



396 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 
 

Planet Gemstone Metal 
Jupiter Yellow sapphire Gold 
Venus Diamond Silver/Plantinum 
Saturn Blue sapphire Iron (or silver) 
Rahu Hessonite (gomedh) Silver 
Ketu Cat's eye Silver 

The ring must be worn for the first time on the weekday of the planet. 
The planetary strength should be good at that time. The planet ruling the 
gemstone should be strong at that time. 

We can combine two gemstones and wear them, if the corresponding 
planets are friends and functional benefics. This is particularly recommended 
when the two planets form a yoga. Suppose someone has lagna in Virgo. If 
10th lord Mercury and 9th lord Venus are together, they form dharma-
karmadhipati yoga. A ring consisting of emerald and diamond may be advised. 
Similarly, if Sun and Moon conjoin in the chart of a person with Aries lagna, 
they form a raja yoga and a ring with ruby and pearl may be recommended. 

Traditionally, astrologers assign the index finger to Jupiter, middle finger 
to Saturn, ring finger to Sun and little finger to Mercury. Traditionally, 
gemstones of Mercury and Venus are worn on the little finger; gemstone of 
Saturn is worn on the middle finger and so on. However, some astrologers 
suggest that the ring finger, middle finger, little finger and index finger show 
the four purushaarthas - dharma, artha, kama and moksha (respectively). 
They suggest wearing a ring on the finger representing the purushaartha of 
interest. One desiring marriage may wear the ring of his 7th lord on the little 
finger. One desiring good results in career may wear the ring of a yogakaraka 
in his D-10 on the middle finger and so on. Index finger represents moksha 
and it is usually left ringless. 
34.3    Good Deeds 

One can pacify planets by good deeds. Good deeds of this life can 
compensate for the sins of past lives. One can commit a good deed in an 
area ruled by a planet to please it. Some examples are listed below: 

To please Sun, one may go to a temple or donate money to a temple or 
help in the administration of a temple. To please Moon, one may donate 
money to a music institute or help a fair lady. To please Mars, one may 
engage in physical exercise or donate money to a school gym. To please 
Mercury, one may donate money to an organization of scholars or get 
blessings from a scholar. To please Jupiter, one may respect and donate 
money to a learned Brahmin or a priest. Or one may donate cows to a 



Part 5: Special Topics 397 

priest. To please Venus, one may read poetry or help a poet. To please 
Saturn, one may perform some physical labor or help some people who live 
on manual labor. To please Rahu, one may donate some money to a research 
organization or go on a pilgrimage. To please Ketu, one may do meditation. 

One can also give away (as charily) the grains ruled by different planets, 
to propitiate them. Sun rules wheat, Moon rules rice, Mars rules toor daal (a 
dark yellow lentil), Mercury rules moong daal (smaller yellow lentils of a 
lighter shade - they have a dark green skin), Jupiter rules chick peas, Venus 
rules a whitish grain, Saturn rules sesame seeds and Rahu rules black gram 
daal (white lentils with a black skin). For example, one can please Jupiter by 
giving away a big bowl of chick peas on a Thursday morning. 

Fasting is also a popular remedial measure. By punishing ourselves by 
denying the basic necessity of food, we reduce other punishments. Fasting 
on the weekday ruled by upapada lord in rasi chart, for example, mitigates 
troubles in one's marriage. Fasting on the weekday ruled by rajyapada lord 
may mitigate troubles in career. 
34.4   Propitiation of Planets 

We can propitiate planets by reciting mantras and stotras. Mantra is a 
combination of sounds with a special power to produce beneficial spiritual 
waves within us. 

A mantra should be recited with an accurate pronunciation and intonation. 
Some mantras do not have any intonation, but the pronunciation of sounds 
must be perfect. Some saattwik mantras are self-correcting, in the sense 
that one reading it will eventually be forced to learn the correct pronunciation 
and intonation. Some other mantras can produce negative effects with 
improper recitation. So one should be careful with mantras. 

These days, people misuse the term "mantra" and refer to many stotras 
as mantras. Stotras are hymns in praise of planets and God. There is no 
correct intonation to read a stotra and devotion is important when reciting a 
stotra. Recitation of a stotra gives results very slowly. Interested readers 
can read the 108 names of various planets everyday. As lagna is the most 
important house in a chart and lagna lord shows the vitality of the chart, one 
may worship the planet owning lagna in the divisional chart representing the 
area of life that one wants to improve. For example, if one wants spiritual 
progress, lagna lord in D-20 should be worshipped. If one wants pleasures 
and comforts, lagna lord in D-16 should be worshipped. 

There are different mantras for propitiating planets. In addition, there 
are kavachas, stotras and 108 names of all planets. 

One popular mantra of each planet is listed below. One should read the 
stanza given first a few times and then repeat the basic mantra thousands 



398 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

of times. The recommended repitition count is also listed. The weekday 
ruled by a planet is ideal for repeating its mantra. 
NOTE: The stanzas and mantras are being given only in Devanagari script 
used'by Sanskrit and Hindi languages. Those who cannot read this script 
should consult a competent astrologer or a Hindu priest to learn these stanzas 
and mantras. This may cause an inconvenience to non-Indian readers of 
this book, but the purpose is to discourage mis-pronunciation. Giving an 
approximate transliteration in the Roman script can only encourage mistakes.

There are many other mantras and one can refer to other books for the 

details. When reading a stotra, devotion is of utmost importance. When 
reading a mantra, devotion as well as the correct pronunciation are important. 

34.5   Propitiation of Deities 
Instead of propitiating planets directly, we can propitiate the ruling deities. 

Propitiating the deity corresponding to lagna lord in a particular divisional 
chart brings excellent results in the area of life shown by divisional chart. 
Propitiation of the deity corresponding to the strongest planet occupying or 
owning or aspecting the 12th house from AK in D-9 takes one's soul closer 
to liberation. 



400 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Table 78: Planets and deities 
 

Planet Deity 

Sun Shiva, Rama 

Moon Gauri, Lalita, Saraswati, Krishna 
Mars Hanuman, Rudra, Kartikeya 

(Subrahmanya), Narasimha 
Mercury Vishnu, Narayana, Buddha 
Jupiter Hayagreeva, Vishnu, Parameswara, 

Dattatreya, Any guru 
Venus Lakshmi, Parvati 
Saturn Vishnu, Brahma 
Rahu Durga, Narasimha 
Ketu Ganesa 

A list of commonly suggested deities for each planet is given in Table 
78. "Prasna marga" gives some additional deities. Elders also intuitively 
prescribe deities based on the particular planetary combination in a chart. 
For example, Mercury and Saturn usually denote a Vaishnava deity. Sun 
denotes a Shaiva deity. Moon and Venus denote a goddess. Mars denotes a 
fiery form. Rahu denotes an aggressive deity. Based on the planetary 
combinations in a chart, we can choose the right deity. 

For example, let us say we need to please Rahu in a chart. Let us say 
Mars and Rahu are in Ge, with Saturn and Mercury aspecting them. Rahu 
can denote Durga, but Saturnine and Mercurian influence suggests a 
Vaishnava deity. Martian influence on Rahu shows an angry deity. So "Ugra 
Narasimha", an angry form of Vishnu, may be worshipped to please Rahu. 
Rahu in Cancer may denote Durga in another chart. In another example, 
Mars may be in a fiery rasi in all vargas and Mercury may join him and it 
may show "Jwala Narasimha". Mars with Rahu (serpent) may show 
Subrahmanya (Kartikeya) in another chart. Mars with Saturnine influence 
may show Hanuman, as Saturn shows a Vaishnava deity and he has humility 
and the spirit of a servant. 

The guidelines given in books are merely guidelines. The exact application 
depends on an astrologer's knowledge of mythology and classics and 
familiarity with the natures of various deities. By propitiating a deity who 
closely represents the spirit of a planet in a particular chart, one can please 
the planet more effectively.

34.6   Conclusion 
This book is only an introductory textbook of integrated Vedic astrology. 

While an effort is made to cover a variety of topics, no topic has been 
covered exhaustively. The coverage of the topics in the current part ("Special 
Topics") is particularly brief. The purpose of this part is just to make the 
readers familiar with some practical aspects of Vedic astrology. Readers 
should refer to other books for more details on these topics. Readers may 
take advantage of Vedic Remedies in Astrolog by Pt. Sanjay Rath. 



35. Mundane Astrology 

35.1 Introduction 
In this book, we have so far concentrated on predicting the fortune of 

individual human beings based on their birthcharts. We sometimes have to 
predict the collective fortune of large groups of people. An example is the 
fortune of a nation. To predict the fortune of a nation, we can use the 
birthchart of the leader of the nation, the swearing-in chart of the leader and 
the birthchart of the nation, if available. When these are not available, we 
can use lunar and solar new year charts and new month charts. Solar charts 
are good at showing some matters and lunar charts are good at showing 
some other matters. There are also some techniques based on transits. We 
can map different nations to different rasis and constellations and take transits 
with respect to those rasis and constellations. This approach needs a lot of 
further research and it is beyond the scope of this textbook. 

Study of the collective fortune of groups of people using planetary charts 
is called "mundane astrology" and birthcharts of nations, swearing-in charts, 
lunar charts, solar charts and other charts used in mundane astrology are 
known as "mundane charts". 
35.2 Re-interpreted Significations 

In mundane charts, we can still use arudha padas, divisional charts etc, 
but we have to reinterpret the significations of various charts, houses and 
arudha padas judiciously. For example, D-9 may show relations with other 
nations and the role played in international polity. D-30 may show internal 
disturbances and violence. D-11 may show wars and terrorist activities. D-
8 may show unexpected and sudden external troubles like natural calamities. 
D-10 may show political activity. D-24 may show universities, science, 
technology, arts, research and activities of intelligentsia. Arudha lagna may 
show how a nation is perceived in the world. A3 may shows its weapons. 
A6 may shows its enemies. A7 may show its allies. Significations of various 
houses are given below: 
First house: General state of affairs in the nation, public health, cabinet. 
Second house: State revenue, wealth, imports, commerce, allies, 
aristocracy. 



Part 5: Special Topics 403 

Third house: Telecommunications, transportation, journalism, media. 
Fourth house: Educational institutions, students, real estate, general feeling of 
well-being, trade, agriculture. 
Fifth house: Children, new births, crime, parks, mentality of leaders. 
Sixth house: State loans, debt, diseases, armed forces, territorial attacks. 
Seventh house: Health of women, immorality, infant mortality, war, relations with 
other nations. 
Eighth house: Death rate, state treasury, unexpected troubles, instability. 
Ninth house: Temples, righteousness, judiciary, fortune. 
Tenth house: The ruler, politics, parliament, foreign trade, exports, revolution and 
political instability. 
Eleventh house: Gains from other nations, gains in trade, friendship. 
Twelfth house: Secret enemies, plots, secret crime, hospitals, wars, losses. 

35.3 Using Birthcharts 

When a new leader takes command of a nation, it signals a new beginning 
for the nation and hence the chart cast for the moment of swearing-in is 
important. However, the beginning of a new order is more important than 
the beginning of a new command. When a nation re-organizes itself based 
on new philosophies and thought, it signals the beginning of a new order. 
Chart cast for the beginning of a new order is more important than a swearing-
in chart. 

For example, the nation of India existed for more than 5,000 years. 
However, it took a new identity when it won independence on 15th August 
1947. The independence chart of India shows the beginning of a new order 
in India. Though several princely states joined India after her independence, 
there was no major change in the identity of India. When India formed its 
constitution and declared itself a Sovereign Replublic on 26th January 1950, 
its identity was only consolidated and not changed. So the independence 
chart (15th August 1947, midnight, Delhi) is the birthchart of India and it is 
the most important one for predicting India's fortune. 



404 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

We can use Vimsottari dasa as well as Narayana dasa with a nation's 
birthchart. An example of the interpretation of Narayana dasa for a nation 
was given in Example 69. Another technique prominently used with the 
birthcharts of nations is Tajaka. We can cast Tajaka annual charts to predict 
the fortune of a nation in a year and use it with Sudarsana Chakra dasa94. 

Example 137: Let us consider India's independence chart and Tajaka 
annual chart of 1997-98 (see Chart 80). India surprised the international 
community by conducting a series of nuclear tests in May 1998. Let us look 
at D-24 (the chart of technology and research) and find Tajaka annual chart 
and Sudarsana Chakra dasa. 

In natal D-24, lagna in Cp is stronger than Moon and Sun. In 1997, India 
finished 50 years and started the 51st year. We get 3 by subtracting multiples 
of 12 from 51. So Sudarsana Chakra dasa of the 3rd house runs in the year. 
Sc dasa belongs to Pi95. We should cast the annual chart when the 51st year 
starts and judge the chart w.r.t. Pi. 

The most prominent placement is that Sun, Rahu and Ketu are in the 3rd 

house from Pi. This makes the 3rd house very strong and activities related to 
aggressive wepon development make sense. Situation of exalted Mars in 
the 11th house with two other planets is also favorable for technical growth. 
However, the presence of debilitated Venus in the 7th house from Pi may 
have resulted in bad relations with other nations in technical matters. After 
the nuclear tests, a lot of curbs were imposed by the western world on 
Indian institutions of science and technology. 

35.4    Lunar charts 
When Sun and Moon have an exact conjunction in every sign, it starts a 

new lunar month. When Sun and Moon conjoin in Pisces, it starts a new 
lunar year. We can cast a chart at the exact moment of Sun-Moon conjunction 
at the capital of a country and use it to predict the fortune of the nation in 
the upcoming month or year. We can use rasi chart as well as divisional 
charts. For timing events, we can compress Vimsottari dasa from 120 years 

94 Sudarsana Chakra dasa and Tajaka annual charts are treated this book as two closely 
linked topics. When we say that Tajaka annual charts should be used, we 
automatically mean that Sudarsana Chakra dasa should be used. 

95 We can also say that muntha is in Pi in D-24.

to a lunar month or a lunar year. To compress Vimsottari dasa, follow this 
procedure: 
(1) Find the constellation occupied by Moon and find its lord. His dasa 

comes first. 
(2) If we are compressing from 120 years to 360 days (approximately a 

lunar year), each year is compressed to 3 days. So Sun dasa becomes 



406 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

18 days, Moon dasa becomes 30 days and so on. If we are compressing 
from 120 years to 30 days (approximately a lunar month), 1 year becomes 
0.25 days. So Sun dasa becomes 1.5 days, Moon dasa becomes 2.5 
days and so on. 

(3) We do not take the fraction of the constellation traversed by Moon and 
decide the remainder in first dasa based on that. We get better results 
by letting the complete duration of the first dasa come together. If Moon 
is in Sun's constellation in a lunar new year chart, Sun dasa runs for the 
first 18 days. 

(4) Go through the nine dasas in the same order as in Vimsottari dasa 
computed for natal charts. The only difference is that the dasas are 
compressed as mentioned above. 
We can see the general well-being of a nation, restlessness of people, 

revolutions, trade, wealth, mood of the nation, weather, natural calamiities 
etc in lunar charts. 

Example 138: Let us take the 1992-93 lunar new year chart of India 
(see Chart 81). In early December 1992, India was shaken by communal 
clashes in the aftermath of the demolition of Babri Mosque in Ayodhya96. 

Sun and Moon had a conjunction at 19 Pi 57 on 3rd April 1992 at 10:32 
am (IST). We cast a chart at New Delhi at that time and call that India's 
lunar new year chart for 1992-93. 

We can see that the lagna-7th axis has Ketu and Rahu. Rahu's aspect 
on lagna can affect the general well-being of the nation and create turbulence. 
This can happen in Rahu dasa. It may be noted that Mercury dasa runs first 
in this chart and Rahu dasa runs in early December. With Rahu owning the 
9th house, it had to do with religious places. 

In addition to rasi chart, we can look at D-30. It shows the subconscious 
forces playing a role in a native's actions and his sins. In the case of a 
nation, it can show internal turbulences, violence, riots etc. In D-30 (see 
Chart 81), Mars, Rahu and Ketu afflict the 9th lord Jupiter in the 9th house. 
Again, this supports communal violence in Rahu's periods. 

96 Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Rama. According to a group of Indian scholars, 
Babri mosque was originally a temple of Lord Rama in the sacred city and Muslim 
invader Babar converted it to a mosque a few cenniries ago. A political party wanted 
a Rama temple there. Though the mosque was unused for a long time, its demolition 
was unacceptable to Muslim leaders. Against court orders, activists of that party 
demolished the mosque in early December 1992 and it led to communal violence in 
different parts of India.

Chart 81 

 
35.5 Solar charts 

When Sun enters a rasi, it starts a new solar month. We can cast a 
chart for that moment and analyze the fortune of a nation during the solar 
month. In particular, charts cast when Sun enters the movable signs (Ar, 
Cn, Li and Cp) are important and they are used by some astrologers to 
predict a nation's fortune during a 3-month period. 

We can cast the solar new year chart when Sun enters Aries, the first 
sign of the zodiac. This solar new year is celebrated in some parts of India. 
A chart cast at a nation's capital when Sun enters Aries can be used for 
predicting the nation's fortune for one year. 



408 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

However, some astrologers prefer to use the chart when Sun enters Cp 
for predicting the fortune for a year. They consider the solar ingress into 
Capricorn97 to be the most important solar chart in Kali Yuga. 

Solar charts are good at showing political activity, wars, vitality of a 
nation, international relations, commerce etc. Narayana dasa and other rasi 
dasas can be compressed to one year (as in Tajaka charts) and used with 
solar charts. They give better results than Vimsottari dasa in the case of 
solar charts. 

Example 139: Let us consider Sun's Capricorn ingress chart of 1998, 
erected at India's capital. India conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. Let 
us consider D-24 (see Chart 82). 

Chart 82 

 
D-24 shows activities related to learning, science and technology. Scorpio 

is the 8th rasi in the natural zodiac and it shows hidden things. The 3rd house 
in D-24 shows weapons and aggressive technology. Rahu and Ketu in the 
3rd house in Scorpio in D-24 of the solar new year chart suggest hidden 
activities related to aggressive weapon development technology. Lagna lord 
Mercury is in the 6th house and he shows enmity and poor relations with 
other nations in the matters of knowledge. This along with the debilitation of 
Venus can explain India's isolation in the scientific world following the nuclear 
tests. 

97 This is celebrated in south India as "Makara Sankraanthi" or "Makara Sankramanam" 
or "Pongal". 



Part 5: Special Topics 409 

35.6 Swearing-in Charts 
We can cast a chart when a new leader (the chief of the executive 

wing of government) is sworn-in in a nation. That chart also has an impact 
on the nature of results experienced by the nation during the leader's tenure. 
We can find Narayana dasa of rasi chart and divisional charts of the swearing-
in ceremony. We have to compress Narayana dasa from 120 years to the 
expected maximum length of the tenure. 

Example 140: Let us take Indian Prime Minister Sri A.B. Vajpayee's 
swearing-in ceremony of March 19, 1998, Let us study D-9 and look at the 
relations with other nations (Chart 83). 

Chart 83 

 
An Indian Prime Minister's tenure can be a maximum of 5 years. If we 

compress 120 years of Narayana dasa to 5 years = 60 months, i. e. compress 
each year to half a month, we get dasas as given below: 

Aq (06 years): Mar 1998 - Jun 1998 
Cn (10 years): Jun 1998 -   Nov 1998 
Sg (02 years): Nov 1998 - Dec 1998 
Ta (01 years): Dec 1998 - Jan 1999 
Li   (08 years): Jan 1999 -    May 1999 
Pi   (01 years): May 1999 - May 1999 
Le (12 years): May 1999 - Nov 1999 



410 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

With Cn being the 6th house, its dasa brought bad relations with other 
nations. India was isolated in the international community after the nuclear 
tests. Li is the 9th house and it shows good diplomacy and excellent relations 
in navamsa. Its lord Venus is in a trine. So Libra dasa saw Vajpayee promoting 
peace with a nation shown by Libra - Pakistan - and the Lahore bus trip 
materialized in Li dasa. 

About Le dasa, the following was written by this author in a magazine 
article98: 

"Leo dasa of six months will run from May 19, 1999. Leo has 
unobstructed argalas from two diplomatic planets - Moon and 
Venus. Leo is the 7th house and it contains Sun and Rahu. Rahu's 
presence may indicate unpleasant confrontation with some 
countries, but Sun is very strong in own house. This means that 
India's voice may be heard with attention and India's point of 
view may be respected in international fora during this period. 
The international community may respect the bold stand taken 
by Vajpayee government regarding various thorny issues that 
may plague the world during the next few months. 
As per Narayana dasa of Rudramsa (D-11), six-month Scorpio 
dasa started on Mar 19, 1999. Lagna in D-11 here is in Aries 
and Scorpio (8th house) contains Mars and Ketu (see chart 6). 
This could bring fresh troubles from terrorism." 
India was dismayed to find foreign mercenaries, Pakistani soldiers and 

terrorists on some mountains on the Indian side of LoC99 and surprised 
Pakistan on May 25,1999 by boldly launching air strikes. Later India launched 
a ground offensive also. India's stand received excellent support and respect 
from the international community. After an emergency visit to US on a US 
holiday, an embarrassed Pakistani Prime Minister "requested" the intruders 
to withdraw into Pakistan and India ended the offensive triumphantly. 
35.7   Conclusion 

When we have the birthdata of a nation, we can use its birthchart. By 
the birth of a nation, we mean the start of a new order and the recognition 
of a new national identity. We can cast charts at a nation's capital when a 
new solar or lunar year or month starts and use them to predict the fortune 
of a nation during the year or month.

months in publishing.

Part 5: Special Topics 411 
Lunar new year charts are free from errors due to ayanamsa. However, 

solar new year charts are prone to heavy errors if ayanamsa is erroneous. 
If ayanamsa has an error of 1 arc-minute, this results in an error of 360 arc-
minutes (i.e. 6°!) in lagna of the solar new year chart. This is because lagna 
moves 360 times as fast as Sun. In the time Sun takes to move by an angle 
of?, lagna moves by an angle of (360x?). So the divisional charts of solar 
new year charts will not give consistent results until our ayanamsa is exact. 
It is not wise to assume that the ayanamsa one uses is perfect and free 
from any error. 

One last word — The purpose of this small chapter is only to introduce 
mundane astrology to readers. Interested readers may refer to the writings 
on mundane astrology by great authors such as Varahamihira and 
Dr.B.V.Raman. This chapter should only be a starting point. 



36. Muhurta or Electional Astrology 

36.1 Introduction 
When a person is born, the planetary position at that time decides how 

his/her life progresses. Similarly, when a new task is freshly started, the 
planetary position at that time decides how the task progresses. For example, 
the planetary position at the time one joins in a new job decides how one's 
new job goes. The planetary position at the time one starts a new company 
decides the fortune of the company. The planetary position at the time of a 
wedding decides how the marriage goes. 

For this reason, believers choose an auspicious time when starting new 
ventures. The time when a new task is undertaken is called "muhurta". 
One can select a good muhurta for a variety of tasks - getting married, 
joining a new job, swearing-in ceremonies (in the case of political leaders), 
starting a new company, starting a kid's formal education, giving cooked 
rice to a baby for the first time, buying a vehicle, buying a house, 
housewarming, babyshowers etc. The list is endless. In India, old people 
choose a good muhurta even for getting a haircut or for cutting nails. 

The topic of muhurta has a lot of controversies. Different guidelines 
are given in different classics and different conventions are in vogue in 
different regions of India. Out of the modern books on muhurta in English 
language, the one by Dr. B.V. Raman is very good. 

36.2 Definition of Muhurta 
Asrologers set nice muhurtas for the tasks of their clients, but they 

don't always verify that their clients know exactly what to do at the time of 
the muhurta. For example, if we set an auspicious muhurta for someone to 
join in a new job, what should he do at the time? Should he sign the job offer 
letter? Or, should he sign the employment contract (if applicable)? Or, should 
he sit in front of his computer and power it on? Or, should he read a document 
describing the work he has to do? What exactly should one do at the time of 
the muhurta set for joining in a new job? 

What is the definition of the time of marriage? What is the definition of 
the time of joining in a new job? What is the definition of entering a new 
house? All these questions are not clearly answered in classics and we 
have to draw conclusions intelligently. 



Part 5: Special Topics 413 
Accepting a job offer is like conception. Starting the work is akin to a 

baby coming out of mother's womb and starting to breathe on its own. 
Depending on what one does in a job, we can decide what "starting the 
work" means. It is not enough to sign some papers, but one has to start 
some work at the time of a muhurta. In the case of a marriage, the purpose 
of marriage is living together. Mangal sutra worn by a lady symbolizes it in 
Hindu culture. So the time when the bridegroom ties the knot is the most 
appropriate. In the case of a Christian marriage, the time when the bride 
and the bridegroom are pronounced a man and a wife after saying "I do" 
may be the most appropriate time. In the case of entering a new house 
(housewarming), the correct time of entering the house is when one starts 
"living" in the house. One may not start living in a house at the exact moment 
one enters a house with some suitcases. In the Hindu way of life, only a 
house where cooking is done is a place of living. So, traditionally, people 
warm milk on a stove at the time of muhurta. If milk is warmed for making 
sweet rice for offering Gods as a prasaad, that symbolizes the starting of 
life in the house. We have to decide intelligently on a case by case basis. 
36.3   Basics of Muhurta 

Tithi, yoga, karana, weekday and nakshatra form the 5 limbs of 
"panchaanga"100. When deciding a muhurta, we try to choose a good tithi, 
weekday, yoga, karana, nakshatra and lagna. For each task, there are certain 
tithis, weekdays, nakshatras and lagnas that are preferred. The nakshatra 
occupied by Moon at the time of a muhurta should be a good tara with 
respect to janma nakshatra. In addition, lord of the running hora (hour) 
should be a favorable planet in the natal chart, especially with respect to the 
house to which the activity belongs. For example, hora at the time of wedding 
should belong to a favorable planet in the natal chart with respect to the 7th 

house and upapada. Hora at the time of moving to a new house should 
belong to a favorable planet in the natal chart with respect to the 4th house 
and A4. If a planet owns the 8th house from the 4th house and occupies a 
badhaka sthana from A4, then it may be disastrous to move into a new 
house in his hora. Hora is a very important quantum of time. 

100 Panchaanga means an almanac that lists auspicious and inauspicious times. It literally 
means "one with five limbs".

A list of the common guidelines is given in Table 79. These are merely 
guidelines and not final recommendations. The recommendation in the case 
of a wedding muhurta, for example, is to keep the 7th house empty. However, 
expert astrologers flout these norms often, with considerable success. 

The basic point in keeping the 7th house empty in a wedding muhurta is 
to avoid afflictions there. On the other hand, if the 7th house is occupied by 
benefics giving great yogas, how can that cause problems in marriage? 
Planetary strength is more important than strictly following these thumbrules. 
36.4   Planetary Strength 

Though a lot of thumbrules are given in literature, an intelligent astrologer 
gives more importance to the strength of planets in the muhurta chart than 
those thumbrules. Not only should the rasi chart be strong, but also the 
concerned divisional chart should be strong. For example, for joining a new 
job, lagna, 6th house and 10th house should be strong in rasi and D-10 charts. 
When starting a child's education, 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th should be strong in rasi and 
D-24 charts. When buying a new vehicle, 1st and 4th houses (and A4) should 
be strong in rasi and D-16 charts. When entering a new house, the 1st and 
4th from lagna and Venus in D-4 should be strong. When buying some real 
estate, the 1st and 4th from lagna and Mars in D-4 should be strong. 



416 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

We can use Vimsottari dasa to time the progress of a task started at a 
muhurta. If we know the maximum time period for which the task started at 
a muhurta can last, we can compress Vimsottari dasa to that period. Details 
of the computation can be found in topic 35.4 in the chapter on "Mundane 
Astrology". If the task started at a muhurta has no fixed time period of 
effect, we can take Vimsottari dasa of 120 years. 

In addition to planetary strength, we should ensure that the first dasa as 
per Vimsottari dasa belongs to a favorable planet in the chart. The effect of 
a muhurta lasts only for a few months or a couple of years and the strength 
of one's natal chart is more important in the long-run. So the first dasa as 
per Vimsottari dasa is important. For example, we may select a muhurta 
with excellent rasi and D-10 charts for joining in a new job and yet bad 
results may be experienced if the first dasa belongs to the 8th lord in D-10. 
Example 141: Let us consider the muhurta chart used by Sri A.B. Vajpayee 
for swearing-in as India's Prime Minister in May 1996 (see Chart 84). 

Chart 84 

 



Part 5: Special Topics 417 

In rasi chart, lagna lord Sun is in 10th and 10th lord Venus is in 11th. The 5th 
house is important for power and it contains its lord Jupiter. The 9th house 
of fortune is also very strong. On the whole, the chart is strong. 
Unfavorable sakuna karana was running at the time. Chaturdasi tithi (14th 

lunar day) is usually not considered auspicious, but its ruler Venus owns the 
10th house here and it is acceptable. Overall, rasi chart is acceptable. 

However, D-30 is weak. D-30 shows past and present evils and the 
punishment. To see an early death, it is an apt chart. Venus owns the 2nd 

and 7th houses in D-30 here. He is a strong maraka (killer). He afflicts 
lagna. Lagna lord of rasi chart (Sun) is in the 2nd house in D-30. Because of 
these, there was a premature end. The fact that Venus dasa was running at 
muhurta - Moon was in a Venusian constellation - did not help either. Sri 
Vajpayee remained in power only for 13 days. However, the strength of rasi 
chart ensured his return within a couple of years. 
Example 142: Sri Vajpayee returned to power in March 1998. Let us 
consider the swearing-in muhurta used this time (see Chart 85). 

Chart 85 

 

Lagna lord is in 9th with Uttamaamsa. Saturn owns 9th and 10th and he is 
in 11th with Uttamaamsa. The chart is basically strong. However, 3rd lord 
Moon is debilitated in 7th and that is not conducive to a long life. Situation of 
Gulika within 1° from lagna is also undesirable. 



418 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Because of the drawbacks, Sri Vajpayee lost the vote of confidence in 
April 1999. However, the opposition parties could not offer an alternative 
and Vajpayee remained as the caretaker Prime Minister. The position of his 
party improved in the October 1999 elections and he continued as PM. Let 
us time the setbacks of April 1999 using Vimsottari dasa compressed to 5 
years. We can see that the 8th constellation Satabhisha falls in Aq and it is 
stronger than Moon's constellation, as Jupiter and Ketu occupy it. For matters 
related to longevity, we can use Vimsottari dasa started from the 8th 
constellation as it is stronger. Using this dasa, Ketu antardasa in Jupiter 
dasa ran during April 3-17,1999. Venus antardasa ran for the next 40 days. 
With Jupiter owning the 8th house, Jupiter dasa was full of troubles. Ketu is 
the co-lord of the 7th house and he afflicts 8th lord. This resulted in the fall of 
the government. However, the next antardasa belonged to lagna lord Venus, 
who is the lord of Sanjivani mantra101. So Sri Vajpayee wasn't replaced by 
another leader and he remained as the caretaker PM. 

Example 143: Let us consider the muhurta at which this author started 
writing this book (see Chart 86). Tithi is Saptami - an auspicious tithi. Yoga 
is Vriddhi yoga (growth). Karana is Vanija. 

In rasi chart, lagna lord Moon occupies lagna in Paarijaataamsa. Lagna 
and Moon are in a constellation of Mercury, significator of writing. The 11th 

house of gains has Venus in own sign in Gopuraamsa. The 10th house of 
karma (action) has exalted 2nd lord Sun and 3 rd lord Mercury. The 2nd house 
is important for astrological knowledge and the 3rd house shows writing. 
Both Sun and Mercury are in Paarijaataamsa. Lord of 10th house (Mars) is 
a yogakaraka here and he is in Gopuraamsa in the 2nd house. This parivartana 
(exchange of houses) between the 2nd and 10th lords is favorable for karma 
related to astrology. Jupiter is the significator of astrology and he has a 
close aspect on lagna and Moon. He aspects the 3rd house of writing also. 

However, Jupiter is debilitated. For an activity related to astrology, 
Jupiter's debilitation is not good. The 3rd house of writing has Rahu in it. 
Saturn owns the 8th house and he aspects the 3rd house. Saturn's aspect on 
the house of interest is not good. Aspect of the 8th lord is not good either. 
Rahu in 3rd also shows obstacles in writing. Then, why did this author choose 
this muhurta? 
(1) Lagna, 2nd, 5th, 10th and 11th are strong. The 3 rd lord has a good placement, 

though 3rd is afflicted. 
(2) Jupiter's aspect is always good in astrological activities. If Jupiter is 

weak, it can denote initial setbacks. But Jupiter's close aspect on lagna 
and lagna lord can only be beneficial in the long run. 

101 This mantra can bring a dead person to life. 



Part 5: Special Topics 419 

Chart 86 

 
(3) Hora of Jupiter runs at the time of muhurta. Jupiter occupies the 2nd 

house of speech in this author's natal chart. In his natal D-24, Jupiter 
occupies Pi (10th house) and shows saattwik activities in society related 
to fine knowledge. A3 is in Pi in natal D-10 and Jupiter owns it. From 
A3 in D-24, he is the 2nd and 5th lord and occupies the 5th house (in own 
rasi). So Jupiter's hora is very favorable for starting astrological writing. 

(4) More importantly, the Navamsa chart is strong. 
If one's aim in writing a textbook on Vedic astrology is to contribute to 

a renaissance in Vedic astrology and to serve astrology researchers, then 
Navamsa is more important than Rasi. Navamsa is the chart that shows 



420 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

how one follows one's dharma (duty). So the strength of Navamsa is very 
important. 

In navamsa (see Chart 86), lagna is in Pisces, a saattwik sign owned by 
Jupiter. Jupiter aspects lagna from 7th. Navamsa lagna is in the 9th from 
Rasi lagna. Exalted 3rd lord Venus is in lagna and he owns the 11th house in 
Rasi chart. This is favorable to fulfilling one's dharma related to writing. 
Mercury occupies the 3rd house in Navamsa and he owns the 3rd house in 
Rasi. This again shows using good communication skills in fulfilling dharma. 
Mars is strong in the 9th house in own sign. The 9th house must be strong in 
Navamsa for a dharmik activity. Sun is in 10th in both Rasi and Navamsa 
and that shows some recognition. Ketu is in the 5th house in Navamsa. This 
combination, if present in a natal Navamsa, makes one good at mathematics 
as per Jaimini Maharshi. Here, this combination makes an analytical approach 
possible. 

In the Rasi chart, Aries is an important rasi as it contains 2nd lord Sun 
and 3rd lord Mercury. Saturn, who owns the 8th house in this chart, was 
transiting in Aries during 1998-2000. During this transit, progress was not 
made. After Jupiter entered Aries, this author became determined to restart 
the project. In April 2000, Sun entered Aries, his muhurta position, and the 
project was restarted with newfound vigor. Due to the presence of Mercury, 
Jupiter and Venus in Aries, May 2000 was a very productive period. After 
3 years of contemplation and slow (no) progress, almost 40% of this book 
was written in April-May 2000. After Saturn left Aries, the other 60% of 
this book was finished. 

As this example illustrates, we can use transits with muhurtas. Rasi is 
the chart of physical manifestation; navamsa is the chart of dharma and 
inner self; and, dasamsa is the chart of achievements in society. So transits 
with respect to Rasi chart are important in figuring out when the book is 
finished. Transits with respect to Navamsa chart are important in figuring 
out when and whether the book serves its intended purpose. Transits with 
respect to Dasamsa chart are important in figuring out how the book is 
received and when and whether it becomes popular. Thus we can adapt the 
meanings of divisional charts to muhurtas. 
36.5    Conclusion 

For standard principles related to muhurtas, readers can refer to other 
books. In this book, the importance of analyzing planetary positions as in 
natal charts is emphasized, as many books leave out this important aspect. 
One should analyze the rasi and relevant divisional charts of a muhurta just 
as in the case of natal charts. 



37. Ethical Behavior of a Jyotishi 

Jyotisha is the Sanskrit name of Vedic astrology. One who practices 
Jyotisha is called a Jyotishi. Vedas are the sacred scriptures of Hinduism. 
Veda simply means "Knowledge". Jyotisha is called a "Vedaanga" (a limb 
of Vedas). In particular, Jyotisha is called the eye of Vedas. It is the science 
of light and the eye of knowledge. 

To its believers, Vedic astrology is not just another subject like 
mathematics and physics. It is considered a sacred subject. It gives its 
knower a special power to see the past, the present and the future. Such 
fine knowledge cannot reach an irresponsible person. So Maharshis have 
set some guidelines for the ethical behavior of Jyotishis. This author hopes 
that the readers of this book abide by those guidelines. 

One should give this knowledge to worthy, honest and god-fearing 
students who have great respect for their teacher and who speak truth 
always. In Indian culture, one's relationship with a giver of knowledge is 
that of a servant with one's master. Just as a servant obeys each command 
of his master, a student obeys each command of his teacher. A wealthy 
man may give his servant only some money, but a teacher gives his students 
knowledge and knowledge is considered to be the most valuable asset in 
Indian culture. So teachers are treated with utmost respect. This may be 
tough to understand and appreciate, for readers from western cultures where 
knowledge is a commodity with a limited value. 

Maharshis advised that one benefits by teaching Jyotisha to god-fearing 
students who treat their teacher with utmost respect and speak truth. On 
the other hand, one becomes sad everyday by teaching Jyotisha to atheists, 
liars and deceitful people. 

In Kali Yuga, it may be difficult to find ideal students for this subject. 
Nevertheless, one should not teach this subject to unwilling people and 
unbelievers. This knowledge should be given only to the worthy students. 

Jyotishis should also maintain dignity when offering astrological 
consultations. They should approach astrological consultations with the spirit 
of service. They possess special knowledge of a sacred subject and they 
should help those who need guidance. Jyotishis should be spiritually oriented 
and they should realize that their knowledge is priceless. Instead of running 
after material possessions, they should be happy with their knowledge and 
help people in need without expecting anything in return. 

Accumulating wealth and material possessions gives only temporary 
happiness. It may make one happy for 10 years or 50 years or 100 years. 



422 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

But when one dies and takes birth again, one loses all that. All these material 
possessions cannot be carried with one. A greedy person will only struggle 
in the infinite cycle of life, death and rebirth. Things can get only worse for 
a greedy person with each new life. 

Just as one who does not exercise accumulates a lot of body fat which 
is a liability, a greedy person accumulates a lot of sin which becomes a 
liability in the cycle of life, death and rebirth. On the other hand, an austere 
person who punishes himself by denying comforts burns away the sins of 
past lives, just as one who troubles his body with regular exercise burns the 
body fat. So a wise person doesn't run after material possessions and tries 
to be austere. 

An austere Jybtishi who serves humanity with his/her divine knowledge 
of Jyotisha burns away past sins and gets closer and closer to liberation 
from the cycle of life, death and rebirth. 

One should always be positive when making predictions. Negative 
predictions should be made with a restrained tone. A Jyotishi may gently 
caution the clients about an impending danger and suggest remedial measures 
and precautions, but he should not scare the clients. Negative predictions 
should be made only when some preventive action is suggested. Negative 
predictions made just for fame or the sensation value bring unhappiness to 
the Jyotishi. Jyotishis should try to bring spiritual awareness in their clients 
and try to promote righteousness. Jyotisha should never be a business. It 
should be a spiritual service. 

With deep respect for my gurus and maharshis, I shared my limited 
knowledge with the readers. May the readers of this book use the privileged 
knowledge of the divine subject of Jyotisha in the spirit of compassionate 
and selfless service and work for the uplifting of humanity! 



Part 6: Real-life Examples 

The "exercises" one encounters in real life can be considerably more 
complicated than the tailor-made exercises given in this book. The exercises 
given in this book familiarize the reader with various techniques, but making 
real-life predictions requires more than that. 

To illustrate the process of making predictions, some real-life situations 
that this author faced in his experience will be given. The process of 
synthesizing a prediction will be illustrated in as much detail as possible. 
These examples are meant for giving some guidance and inspiration to those 
who are new to the process of making predictions. 
Real-life Example 1: 

Birthdata of a lady is given in Chart 87. Her parents consulted the 
author in early 1997 and wanted to know exactly when she would get 
married. 

For marriage, we should see rasi and navamsa charts (see Chart 87). 
Vimsottari dasa of Jupiter started in mid-1996. Can Jupiter give marriage? 
Well, he must. Because this dasa started at an age of 23, it will run till an 
age of 39. So Jupiter must give marriage. Being lagna lord in 11th, he can 
give all-round progress. Moreover, he aspects the 7th house Virgo and 7th 

lord Mercury here. So he can give marriage. 
Who is the 7th lord? In rasi, 7th lord is Mercury. In D-9, 7th is in Cp and its 

lord Saturn aspects it from Sc. So Saturn antardasa can give marriage. 
When is it? It starts in the second half of 1998. But her parents already 
started looking for a match and Saturn antardasa is too late. Can Jupiter 
antardasa itself give marriage? It is not very likely. 

Where will Jupiter be in late 1998? He will be transiting in Aq. Can 
Jupiter's Aq transit give marriage? It doesn't look too interesting. Pi transit 
is a better candidate. As Pi is natal lagna, Jupiter's Pi transit can bring all-
round progress. From Pi, Jupiter will aspect Vi, the 7th house. He will also 
aspect Cn. Note that Cn contains 7th lord Mercury in rasi chart. In D-9, it 
contains lagna & Mercury. So Jupiter's Pisces dasa in 1999 can bring 
marriage. 

The pratyantardasa running then is Mercury's (Jan-May 1999). With 
Mercury owning the 7th house in rasi and occupying lagna in D-9, his PD 
can give marriage. He is also DK. 

To be sure, check Sudarsana Chakra dasa. On her birthday in 1998, she 
finishes 1998 -1973 = 25 years and starts the 26th year. Subtracting multiples 



424 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

of 12 from 26, we get 2. So dasa of the 2nd house runs. In navamsa, it is 
Leo. At the time of the start of this dasa (i.e. Tajaka annual chart of 1998-
99), Jupiter occupies Leo and Venus occupies Aquarius (see Chart 74). 
That is favorable. So marriage can take place in the year (1998-99). 

Chart 87 

 
In Tajaka annual chart, lagna lord and 2nd lord have an exchange. The 

2nd house shows family. Vivaha saham is in Sc. Mars owns it. Mars is also 
rnuntha lord. He has a very close ithasala with Venus, the natural significator 
of marriage and upapada lord. In navamsa, Mars is very strong in his 



Part 6: Real-life Examples 425 

moolatrikona Aries. He is in the 2nd from lagna and 9th from muntha. Patyayini 
dasa of Venus runs during Dec 98 and Jan 99. Patyayini dasa of Mars runs 
during Feb-Mar 99. 

In 1999, the lunar month of Maagha ends in mid-February. It brings the 
season of marriages in India, because it is thought to be an auspicious month 
for marriages. So probably marriage will take place in that month. 

So the final prediction given was - "she may get married in the first half 
of February 1999". Because upapada is in Li in rasi chart, she was advised 
to pray to goddess Lakshmi everyday and especially on Fridays. 

She got married at the end of Jan 1999 and went to USA with her 
husband in early Feb 1999. 
Real-life Example 2: 

A noted Vedic astrologer of the west was expecting a child in November 
1999. At the end of October 1999, he mentioned on an internet-based forum 
for Vedic astrology discussions102 that his child would be born in a few-
weeks. He did not mention how many children he already had or what the 
due date for this new child was. 

Later he expressed a desire on the forum to learn the computation of 
Narayana dasa for divisional charts. This author wanted to illustrate the 
computation using the gentleman's D-7, as he was expecting a child. His 
birthdata and natal D-7 are given in Chart 88. 

Lagna in rasi chart is in Sc. The 7th house is in Ta. Its lord is Venus. He 
is in Ge in D-7 and Ge is stronger than Sg. So dasas start from Ge. Because 
Ge is a dual sign, we use the trinal progression of Vishnu. Because the 9th 

from Ge (i.e. Aq) is an even-footed sign, we go backward. So dasas go as 
Ge, Aq, Li, Vi, Ta, Cp, Sg, Le, Ar, Pi, Sc and Cn. It can be seen that Le dasa 
runs during 1988-2000. 

It can be seen that exalted Jupiter is stronger than lagna in D-7 and he 
can be used as a reference. The 1st, 2nd and 5th lords from him are Moon, 
Sun and Mars and they are all conjoined in Leo. So Leo is a very important 
sign in this D-7. Its dasa can give children.

426 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 88 

 

Let us find antardasas. Because Le is stronger, antardasas start from 
its lord Sun. He is in Le, an odd sign. So antardasas go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc. 
During 1999-2000, the 12th antardasa of Cn runs. It contains exalted Jupiter 
and it can give a child. 

Pratyantardasas in Cn dasa start from Moon and again they go as Le, 
Vi, Li, Sc etc. March 13-April 13 is the first pratyantardasa. October 15-
November 15 is the 8th pratyantardasa of Pisces. From November 15, Aries 
pratyantardasa runs. Which is more likely to give a child? 

Pisces is the 11th house and contains the 5th lord Mercury. Mercury is 
also PK. He is in a trine from exalted Jupiter. So Pisces pratyantardasa is 
more likely to give a child. 

Before it can be mentioned in public, it can be quickly cross-checked 
using the Tajaka annual chart of 1999-2000 (see Chart 89). 



Part 6: Real-life Examples 427 

Chart 89 

 

In this chart, putra saham is in Cancer. Its lord Moon is in the 5th house 
of children. He has a very close half-degree ithasala with lagna lord Mercury. 
He also has an ithasala with Jupiter, natural significator of children. In D-7, 
the 5th house is occupied by Mercury and Jupiter. Moon owns lagna and 
occupies 3rd (11th from 5th, showing the gain of a child). 

All these factors suggest a child in the dasa of Moon, who emerges as 
an important planet in rasi and D-7. However, Moon's dasa comes during 



428 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

June-July. Lagna's Patyayini dasa runs during Oct 29-Nov 23 and Sun's 
dasa cornes after it. This gentleman said on Oct 29 that he was expecting a 
child in a few weeks. So it has to be either lagna's dasa or Sun's dasa. 
Compared to Sun dasa, lagna's dasa is a better candidate. Usually lagna's 
dasa brings important results. Antardasa is likely to be Moon's. Moon's 
antardasa runs on Nov 14-15. This agrees with the indication from D-7 
Narayana dasa, viz child-birth before Nov 15. 

After this analysis, an e-mail was sent to the forum giving the computation 
of the gentleman's D-7 Narayana dasa. It was mentioned that he might get 
a child before November 15. 

The gentleman clarified later that the date given by doctors was 
November 23. He said that it was the third child and the ultra-sound scan 
predicted a daughter. The 3rd child is shown by the 9th lord in D-7. Debilitated 
Mercury is the 9th lord from lagna in D-7 (counted in reverse). Debilitated 
planets show a daughter. Mercury also shows a daughter. We can now be 
more confident about child-birth in the pratyantardasa of Pisces as per D-7 
Narayana dasa, because Pisces represents the third child in this D-7. So no 
changes were made based on the additional information. 

The gentleman informed this author by personal e-mail later that he 
was blessed with a daughter on November 14. 

Real-life Example 3: 
Consider the native whose D-10 is given in Chart 90. He came to this 

author in May 1998 and asked if there was a change of job for him. This 
author checked his D-10 Narayana dasa. It may be noted that Cp dasa of 
10 years runs during 1989-1999. Antardasa running in March 1998-January 
1999 is that of Aries. It is the 8th house from A10 (which can show the 
workplace) and its lord is in the 12th from A10. So a change of job or 
turbulence at workplace is possible. 

Because Ar contains AL and it is a trine from lagna, its antardasa is 
likely to be good for career and status. However, its lord Mars is with Rahu 
in the 8th house from the dasa rasi Cp. So this indicates pressures and 
undesirable developments too. This seems to suggest worries at the current 
job and then move to a new job with higher status. 

This can be cross-checked with D-10 of Tajaka annual chart of 1998-
99 (see Chart 91). AL in D-10 contains its lord Rahu and the other lord 



Part 6: Real-life Examples 429 

Chart 90 

 

Saturn is in the 5th house from it. These factors suggest good status in 
career in the year. However, Venus owns the 7th from lagna (dealings with 
others) and the 9th from AL (fortune) and he is debilitated. This does suggest 
some setbacks. Moreover, Saturn and Sun aspect each other in D-10. This 
shows trouble from authorities. 

Let us check Tajaka monthly charts (Chart 92). In Tajaka monthly chart 
of May 26-June 26, 1998, lagna lord in D-10 is Venus and he is in the 12th 

house with exalted Sun, again supporting trouble from authorities. Moon 
and Mercury are with Ketu and Rahu respectively and it does not suggest a 
happy mental and emotional state, as far as work is concerned. However, in 
D-10 of the next month's chart, lagna lord Jupiter is in 10th in moolatrikona. 
Despite other weaknesses, this brings strength to D-10. In rasi chart also, 
10th lord Mercury is in own rasi Ge (7th house) with 9th lord Sun and this 
shows good developments in career. 

Based on all these factors, it was predicted that the native's relationship 
with his managers could deteriorate, he could be frustrated in June, he could 
be forced out of his job and he would join a better job in July. 



430 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 91 

 

It happened as predicted. At the time of the original prediction, this 
author looked at Narayana dasa only upto antardasas. After he knew that 
the prediction came true, he checked pratyantardasas (PD) in retrospect. 
Scorpio's PD was running in June. Because of the presence of 8th lord and 
debilitated Moon, its PD brought pressures and frustration. The conjunction 
of 8th and 12th lords can give a Viparita Raja Yoga, but that can be effective 
only when the planets are in a dusthana in weakness or in a quadrant/trine 
in strength. Here Moon is debilitated and they are in a quadrant. 

After the frustration in Sc dasa given by debilitated Moon, next PD of 
Sg during July brought success. He joined a better job. Because Sun is 
lagna lord and the lord of 5th from AL and because he occupies a trine from 
AL, this PD can be good for professional status. Because of his rasi aspect 
on Pi (GL), Sun can give a promotion also. Moreover, Sun is the planet of 
authority. So Sg antardasa gave a new job with a higher status. 

The native came to this author again in May 1999. He was planning to 
buy a house in USA and wondered if his career would be stable or if it 
would be a mistake to buy a house. 

Le dasa runs during 1999-2007. Because Le is lagna and the 5th from 
AL, its dasa has to be good. Antardasa of Sg was running till Sept 1999 and 



Part 6: Real-life Examples 431 

Chart 92 

 

it would be excellent for reasons already mentioned. So the native was told 
that there was nothing to worry about and he might in fact have a promotion 
in the next few months. That came true and his position improved at his 
new company. 

Before we close this example, readers may note one thing. Lagna is in Pi, 
GL is in Sg and HL is in Ta in his natal rasi chart. So Venus owns HL, 



432 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

occupies GL and aspects lagna (by rasi aspect). For these reasons, Venus 
is a yogada (giver of yoga). His dasa must be excellent from the point of 
view of power as well as money. In rasi chart, Venus owns the 8th house 
and he occupies lagna with Rahu in D-4. These factors can suggest that his 
yoga will be in a foreign land. Vimsottari dasa of Venus started in April 1997 
(using 360-day savana years) and the native left India and went to USA in 
April/May 1997. Venus dasa is likely to continue to be good for his career 
and finances. 
Real-life Example 4: 

On an internet-based Vedic astrology discussion forum, a noted Vedic 
astrologer of west gave the birthdata of her friend's son, who was nominated 
for an academy award (Oscar). The awards were to be announced at a 
function in Los Angeles on the night of March 26, 2000. The lady wanted 
to know if her friend's son would get an award or not. 

For someone in the entertainment business, an Oscar nomination itself 
is a major achievement. We cannot look at the dasas one is running and 
conclude whether one will win the award or not. Because of the nomination, 
one will get a lot of good publicity. If one doesn't get the award, one may be 
unhappy on that night and the next couple of days. We cannot say that one 
will not get the award because a bad pratyantardasa is running or that one 
will get the award because a good pratyantardasa is running. We need to go 
much deeper and look at the 1-2 days surrounding the award. We need to 
understand the native's mood on the morning of March 27. That alone can 
say whether the native won the award on March 26 or not. Irrespective of 
whether one wins the award or not, a few weeks before March 26 and a 
few months after March 26 are bound to be excellent in the native's career. 
The mood on March 27 is the clinching factor. 

Rasi and D-10 of Tajaka monthly chart of March 14-April 14,2000 are 
given in Chart 93. Saturn's Patyayini dasa runs during March 26-April 3. 
Saturn is the 6th and 7th lord in D-10 and he shows rivals (6th) and contacts 
(7th) in the entertainment business. His exaltation may show meeting some 
important people. However, exaltation of 6th lord is not favorable. Moreover 
Saturn is debilitated in 6th in rasi chart. That can show disappointments. So 
meeting with important people, getting disappointed and making important 
contacts may be the results given by Saturn. However, we should focus on 
the 60-hour period for a better idea. 

Rasi and D-10 of Tajaka sixty-hour chart of March 26-28, 2000 are 
given in Chart 94. This chart covers the period that starts in the afternoon of 
March 26 and lasts 2.5 days. In rasi chart, lagna has Rahu in it. Lagna lord 
is debilitated in 5th, the house of emotions. The strength of the 10th house 



Part 6: Real-life Examples 433 

Chart 93 

 

shows a good development in career (attending the Oscar night), but the 
weakness of lagna lord shows a disappointment. In D-10, lagna lord is in 8th 

and 8th lord is in lagna. 
So it was predicted on the forum that the native was unlikely to win the 

award. Later, the lady who gave this chart informed the forum that her 
friend's son did not win the academy award. 



434 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 94 

 

Real-life Example 5: 
When working on the birthtime rectification of a lady whose navamsa 

chart is given in Chart 95, this author wanted to guess when her marriage 
took place. He first looked at Vimsottari dasa. Mercury dasa runs during 
1983-1999. Because Mercury is the 7th lord in 7th in navamsa, his dasa can 
give marriage. Because Mars owns the 2nd house and upapada and joins 
lagna lord, his antardasa can give marriage. Jupiter's antardasa can also 
give marriage. 



Part 6: Real-life Examples 435 

Chart 95 

 
We can cross-check with Kalachakra dasa. Sg dasa runs from 1988-

1998. For an Indian girl, this is the normal age of getting married. So 
irrespective of planets, this must be the dasa of marriage. In any case, 
Venus occupies Sg here and it can give marriage. Antardasa can belong to 
the 7th house Virgo containg Mercury. It can also be Gemini owned and 
aspected by the 7th lord. Gemini is the 7th house from Venus and from dasa 
rasi. Gemini antardasa runs from Sept 1991 to Aug 1992. 

Next, this author checked the Tajaka annual chart of 1991-92 (see Chart 
96). Vivaha saham is at 22Ge54, i.e. in the 7th house. Venus is the significator 
of marriage and he is at 21 Gel 1. The situation of Venus in the 7th house 
very close to vivaha saham very strongly indicates marriage in the year, 
perhaps in the Patyayini dasa of Venus. 

Mercury is the 7th lord and vivaha saham lord. He is at 13Ar37. Lagna 
lord Jupiter is at 13Cn52. There is a square aspect between the two planets. 
Because Mercury is behind Jupiter by one quarter of a degree, there is a 
very "poorna (complete) ithasala" between them. This also makes marriage 
extremely likely in the year. 



436 Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach 

Chart 96 

 
In navamsa, Venus owns the 7th house and occupies lagna. Mercury, 

lord of 7th in rasi chart, occupies a trine in navamsa and joins navamsa lagna 
lord. (NOTE: If the 7th lord in rasi chart is well-placed in navamsa, it is good. 
The 7th lord in rasi shows the partner in physical life and navamsa shows 
inner self and dharma.) 

Venus dasa as per annual Patyayini dasa runs from 9th Nov 1991 to 7th 

Feb 1992. Venus-Mercury antardasa runs during February 5-7, 1992. So 
this author asked the lady, "did you get married in the first week of February 
1992?" The lady was not a great believer in astrology and she was amazed. 
She said yes. 



Part 6: Real-life Examples 437 

At that time, this author did not compute compressed Narayana dasa, 
but readers can verify that compressed D-9 Narayana dasa of Cn runs 
during Feb 5-20, 1992. Her marriage took place then and Cn contains upapada 
in navamsa (see Chart 96). 

One Last Word 
The purpose of these examples is not to brag about some correct predictions. 
Every astrologer makes hundreds or thousands of correct predictions and 
possibly hundreds of wrong predictions too. I also made many correct 
predictions and many wrong predictions. The purpose of the above examples 
is to illustrate the process of making predictions and to give guidance to 
those who are new to the process of making predictions. 
I earnestly hope that readers pursue this divine subject in the right spirit, 
master it, serve their clients sincerely and contribute to a renaissance in 
Jyotish. 
I again humbly request elders and scholars to correct my mistakes. May I 
be forgiven for my mistakes and excesses. 
I bow with gratitude before Lord Jagannatha for making me write this book. 
May He continue to stand in the path of my eyes!
