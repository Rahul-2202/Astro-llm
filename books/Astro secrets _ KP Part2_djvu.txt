Let us first confirm Planet | Star-Lord | Sub-Lord 
the accuracy of the chart 


Sun Ketu Moon 
with the help of some Moon Venus Mars 
evens relating to ine Mars Rahu Jupiter 
native's parents. The native's 
mother's Janma-nakshtra Mercury Venus | Jupiter 
is Sravana, Moon's star in Jupiter Rahu Rahu 
Saturn's sign is Gapricorn. Venus Mercury | Rahu 
Mother is represented by Satum Ketu Jupiter 
the 4th house. The 4th Rahu Jupiter | Satum 
cusp of the chart is Kethu Venus | Saturn 


* ASTRO SECRETS * 1 


in the sub of Saturn who is in association with the Moon explaining 
mother's Janmanakshitra. [he native'’s father's Janmanakshira is 
Visakha, Jupiter's star in Venus's sign Libra. Father is repiesented by 
the 9th house. In the charl the 9th cusp is co-ruled by Jupiter, 
Mercury and Venus as the sign lord, star lord and sub lord 
respectively. The sublord Venus herself would indicate father's 
Janmanakshira. Venus is in the sub of Rahu whe represents Jupiter 
in Libra by constellation position and aspect. Jupiter's star in Libra 
(Visakha) is thus explained. 

The native's father is doing business. The 10th trom the 9th house, 
viz the 6th house represents his profession. The 6th cusp ts in the sub 
of Jupiter who is in 3 (the 7th from 9 representing business for father} 
in Libra the 7th sign of the natural Zodiac which represents business. 

The native's mother is a teacher. Her profession is indicated by 
the 10th house from 4, viz. the lagnabhava. | he cusp of the lagna is in 
the sub of Venus who is in the constellation of Mercury who owns 
mother's Sih house representing the teacher and occupies Sagittarius 
the 9th sign of the natural Zodiac representing the Teacher again. 
The accuracy of the subs of house-cusps which is the real accuracy 
of the chart is thus vouched for. 

Now let us see the salient astrological rules regarding education. 
The 4th house represents scholastic and collegiate education in 
general and the 9th, higher education, research etc. The 2nd house 
(Vaksthana} is also regarded as a Vidyasthaba. The 10th house 
represents not only profession but all action and achievement 
including effort and achievement in the field of learning. The 11th 
house represents all acquisition including acquisition of learning, 
fulfilment of ambitions etc. As such houses 2, 4, 9, 10 and 11 afford 
clue to education and are houses favourable for education. The 3rd 
house shows mental inclination, mental concentration, courage, 
confidence etc. The sublord of the 3rd cusp gives indications 
regarding these. The 6th house being an upachayasthana represents 
success in examinations; competitions etc. Planets in 
upachayasthanas (3, 6, 10 and 11), especially natural malefics 
are said to promote success and prosperity. It may, however, be 
noted that Mercury the Vidyakaraka in 6 is detrimental to education 
(also nisht thuroktih). of the 3rd house we shall see later. 


* KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI * 


Among planets Sun (Dhanwantari) indicates Medicine, 
Chemisiry etc. Mercury Mathematics, Engineering, Astrology etc. 
Jupiter Philosophy, Law etc. Venus Chemistry, Saturn Geology, 
Uranus Research, Mars surgery, Machines etc. and so on. 

scorpio the 8th sign of the natural Zodiac (the sign of healers 
and Doctors) and Virgo (the hospital sign of the natural zodiac} are 
connected with Medicine. Airy signs give good taste for Mathematics, 
Accounts etc. Capricorn the earthy sign owned by Saturn represents 
Geology. Cancer the 4th sign of the natural 7odiac (the exaltation 
sign of Jupiter the Teacher) is said to represent teachers, Sagittarius 
the 9th sign owned by Jupiter, teachers, Lawyers, Philosophers etc. 
Libra the 7th sign business and so on. 

Corresponding to the signs of the natural zodiac, the 4th house 
In a nativity represents teachers, the 7th businessman, the 8th 
Doctors, the 9th teachers, lawyers etc. and $0 on. 

Profession is judged in traditional Astrology from the Navamsa 
occupied by the lord of 10. The 10th lord occupying a Navamsa 
owned by Mercury (Gemini or Virgo} is said to denote a profession 
connected with Mathematics, writing or the like (sowmyamse 
lipiganitadi} and so on. Adapting this principle to Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati, the sublord (Nakshatra nayamsachipa} of the cusp of 10, 
its nature, disposition and connections determine the profession of 
the native. The sublord of the 10th cusp being or being related to Sun 
or Mars and being connected with the 8th house and either Scorpio or 
Virgo shows Doctor's profession and so on. The 10th house affords 
clue to ones education though it is not always that ones profession is 
connected with ones educational qualification. [he astrological rules 
regarding education and profession have been dealth with in great 
detail in the relevant chapters in K.P. Reader Ill, Predictive Astrology. 

The 3rd house denotes mental inclinations, preferences, 
specialisation, mental concentration memory etc. The sub of the 3rd 
cusp being owned by the malefic saturn or being afflicted by it shows 
forgetfullness, lack of confidence and similar obstacles. Jupiter and 
Mercuy give concentration good memory and aptitude for studies. 
The nature of tbe planet owning the sub on the cusp of 3 and its 
disposition and connection determine the subjects in which the native 
would specialise. 


* ASTRO SECRETS * 


We have seen that houses 4 and 9 represent education mainly 
and the upachayasthana 6 denotes success in examinations, 
competitions ctc. Houses in 12 (Vyaya) to these viz. 3,8 and 5 are, 
therefore, detrimental to education. Education suffers or comes to an 
end in the conjoined periods of the significators of 3, 5 and B. 

Whether one would recetve education at all and, tf so, in what 
measure is to be judged from the sublords of the cusps of 4, 9and 11. 
lf the sublord of the 4th cusp is in the constellation of an auspicious 
significator of 4, 9 or 11 and is in some manner connected with 
Mercury the Vidyakaraka, the native will definitely receive good 
education. The sublord of the cusp of 11 occupying the constellation 
of a significator of 4 or 9 confirms this. A significator of a house, no 
doubt, invokes the matters represented by the house. But the way 
house results are invoked depends on the nature of the planet. Maletic 
Saturn the restricting planet in 4 limits education. If the sublord of the 
4th cusp is in the constellation of Saturn in 4 native would, no doubt, 
receive education but not in good measure. Unless Satum is under 
strong auspicious connections. The sublord of the cusp of 7 in the 
constellation of Saturn in 7, no doubt, promises marriage. It will, 
however, delay marriage unless there are strong indications to the 
contrary. The 8th house is the Dhanasthana of the partner in pariner- 
ship business and is, therefore, important in partner ship business. 
The sublord of the cusp of 10 in the constellation of a planet in 8 is 
said to indicate partnership business. However, if the planet in 8 is 
malefic Satum, poor retums from partnership business would be the 
result. We have had occasion to refer to a chart exemplifying this in 
the arlicle ‘Jupiter in 10 and professional career’ earlier. The sublord 
of the cusp of 2 (Dhanasthana} is in the constellation of Saturn the 
restricting planet and Vyayakaraka is 2 in the horoscope of Mahatma 
Gandhi showing how he was destined to give up wealth and live the 
simple life of a Sanyasin. 

Satum in 4 does not necessarily imply poor education. Accord- 
ing to the general principles of Krishnamurti Padhdhati, if the sublord 
of the 4th cusp promises good education and if Saturn in 4 is in the 
constellation of an auspicious planet connected with, 4, 9 or 11 and 
the sub of a signilicator of 4, 9 or 11, Saturn will give unaffected 
education in its period or sub periods. This principle applies to all 
planets. The sublord of the Sih cusp throws light on higher studies and 
research. 


4 * KRISHNAMURT] PADHDHATI * 


Now let us examine the charl under discussion. The native lacks 
mental concentration and memory and is a chatlerbox. The 3rd house, 
as we have seen represents mental inclination, mental concentration, 
memory etc. The sublord of the 3rd cusp is Venus who is in evil 
sesquiquadrate aspect (133°19°) with Saturn. The nodes are 
squaring Venus. Venus in the constellation of Mercury in 6 is also not 
auspicious. (Mercury, though 3' behind the cusp of 6, is in the same 
constellation and sub as the 6th cusp, and may, therefore, be 
regarded as occupying 6}. Venus the sublord of the cusp of 3, the 
house of mental concentration and memory is thus heavily afflicted. 
Moon the constellation lord of the cusp of 3 and the representative of 
the mind (mathi}is in association with Saturn who owns the evil 8 and 
the sub on the cusp of 12 (the house of defect}, thus afflicted, 
showing unwise thinking. Mercury the lord of 3 is in 6, an evil house 
for it, as we have seen. Afflicted 3rd house (especially the sublord of 
the 3rd cusp} explain the native's low mental concentration, poor 
memory, etc. 


The cusp of 2 (the house of speech) is in the sub of maletic 
Rahu in & afflicted by Mars a significator of 8, (Mars is in the constel- 
lation of Rahu in 8). Ketu the malefic is occupying 2 (Vaksthana) 
opposed by Mars. Ketu in 2 is said to indicate unwise speech 
(adhamoktiyutah} The affliction to the house of speech (2) account 
for loose speech. 

The 4th cusp is in the sub of Satum who is in sesquiquadrate 
aspect with Venus the lord of 4. Venus is squared by the nodes. 
Saturn is in sesquiquadrate aspect (133°41') with Ketu as well. Both 
the 4th lord and the sublord of the 4th cusp are thus afilicted. Saturn 
ine sublord of the 4th cusp in Yis in the constellation of Ketu in 2 
Malefics in Vaksthana are detrimental to education. Ketu in 2 is said 
to deny education (Vidyarthaheenah). Ketu in addition, is under the 
powerful aspect of Mars a strong significator of evil 8. The Vaksthana 
is thus thoroughly spoiled. Ketu by lone occupation of the sign Leo 
represents Sun in inauspicious 5 fairly strongly. Ketu is in the constel- 
lation of Venus in 5. Saturn the sublord of the 4th cusp in the constel- 
lation of Ketu thus signifies an afflicted 2 and the inauspicious 
5 dencting cbstacles in education. Saturn aspecting 4, Ketu's 
constellation lord Venus owning 4 and 171 and Mercury the Vidyakaraka 
being connected with both Saturn and Ketu by angular aspect 
however, indicate some education. 


* ASTRO SECRETS * a 


The sublords of the cusps of 2, 9, 10 and 11 also confirm inad- 
equate education. The cusp of 2 is in the sub of Rahu in 8 who is in 
the constellation of Jupiter in the inauspicious 3. Jupiter is a significator 
of 8 also by occupation cf the constellation of Rahu in 8. The cusp of 
9 is in the sub of Venus in the inauspicious 5 in the constellation of 
Mercury the afflicted Vidyakaraka. The 10th cusp is in the sub of 
Saturn and the 11th in the sub of Sun both occupying the constella- 
tion of Ketu in 2 thus signifying and afflicted 2. The native is now 
running Venus Dasa. Venus as the lord of 4 and 11 aspecting 11 has 
given the native education, though her constellation lord Mercury is 
not altogether auspicious by ownership or house position. Sun's Dasa 
is to follow from 716-1-1983. Sun owns 2 and is in 5in the constellation 
of the malefic Ketu in 2 and the sub of Moon in 9 conjunct Saturn. 
sun's Dasa does not augur well for education. Sun's constellation lord 
Ketu being a feeble significator of 4 and 11 by occupation of the 
constellation of Venus and sun's sublord Moon being posited in 9 
(“aspecting 4), Sun will give education for sometime in his Dasa. 
saturn the afflicted sublord of the 4th cusp (both Saturn and Sun are 
in the constellation of Ketu in 2) may be expected to co-operate with 
sun in malefic influence and disturb the education of the native in its 
Bhukti in Sun's Dasa (22.11.1985 to 4.11.986). Let us progress the 
planets by 16 days to denote the results of the native's 17th year 
commencing on 19.72.1985. It could be seen that natal Saturn the 
sublord of the 4th cusp (the indicator of education) and Bhuktinatha 
would be receiving strong adverse aspects from progressed planets. 
Progressed Mercury at 7°32" in Capricorn would be applying closely 
to the square of natal Saturn from the constellation of Sun in 5 the 
Dasanatha. Progressed Mcon at 6°14' in scorpio would be applying 
te the Quincunx of Saturn from Saturn's own constellation. Progressed 
Sun (the Dasanatha) at 20°27’) in Sagittarius would be applying closely 
to the conjunction of natal Mercury the lord of 3 and 42 and a significator 
of 5. Progressed Mars at 21°32' in Aquarius (Mars is a strong 
significator of 8 in the nativity} would be applying closely to the 
conjunction of natal Rahu in 8 who is a strong significator of 3. 
Disturbance in the education of the native is portended during the 
year commencing on 19.12.1985. 


Long Live Krishnamutti Padhdhati.

6 * KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI * 


(SUB LORD} 


At the very outset, | draw your attention to what sri K.S.K 
Says:- 


Study the behaviour of planet and then the Role of the Sub. 
Now you must study the other way round to understand the Sub 
.e., Sub lord 


Therefore of what he said - instead 


We will study the Behaviour of Sub and then the Role of the 
Planet. 


God is omnipresent (meaning present every where) 
Gud is omnipotent (meaning ail powertull}. 


similarly the Sub lord, Sub as we call it in KP is both 
omnipresent and omnipotent. 


Man proposes but God disposes. Same is the case with our 
hero Sub. That is for example Stellar level Yes and at Sub level 
the result may be Yes or No. 


Sublord is not a planet. And this Sub lord is also not a Star. 


sublord is one of the 9 unequal Subdivisions of a Star, culled 
out as per the 120 years of the Vimshothari Dasa system. 


otar is akin to a Dasa and Sub ts akin to a bukItNi. 


These Sub Lords under KP are the permanent structures of 
the 360° Zodiac, similar to the Fish Plates on the Railway track. 


Of the 12 cusps of the Zodiac, starting from the 1" House, to 
the last of thet2th House, each House has a cusp on a Sign - 
Star - Sub. 


That is each cusp has a Sub, called as Cuspal Sub Lord. 


similarly every planet as it moves from Star to Star, they move 
along these 9 subdivisions of a Star - called as Planet Sub. 


The Sub Lords are like a chisel. In the making of a Statue, 
beautiful as itis, itis the chisel in the hands of the crafisman, that 
shapes the Statue in proportion. At last the beauty of the Statue, 
rests with the same chisel, when the eyes of the Statue is opened. 
A little of wrong handling of the chisel will spoil the very beauty of 

‘the Statue. 


In the same way, as said for chisel, these Subs in their 
formation at birth or in Horary, is so sharp, that they are able to 
tell decisively of a matter. They have no wavering or ambiguity to 
say of a matter. Yes means Yes and No means No. 


These Sub Lords at times are double-edged razors. One 
has to be very careful during analysis. Read "Unity Amongst 
Brothers” - by Sri. S.M.S.Nathan. Example: Page 192 - i96of IV 
Reader - it is self-explanatory which is reproduced. 


These Sub Lords are absolutely independent. They are not 
dictated by ane thing or the other. 


The Sub lord is a phenomenon in the Zodiac as revealed to 
us by Guruji Sri. K.S.K. KP based on constellation theory fas 
given birth to this Sub Phenomenon - 249 Subs. 


Inthe same coin - the Sign - Star - Sub of the Nirayana Zodiac 
also has the Dasa / Bukthi system of the same 129 years 
Vimshothari Dasa System is a unique phenomenon. 
(phenomenon = Face wonder, remarkable, apparent object}. That 
is In a Sign, Star is akin to Dasa and Sub is akin to Bukthi. 


Of the two remarkable wonders, one is the Sub Lord and the 
other is Dasa / Bukthi Lords. These Dasa / Bukthi Lords have no 
Independent authority to act on their own. They are under the 
command / under the dictates of these Sub Lords. If the Sub 


8 "ASTRO SIRI tS , 


Lord permit a matter to take place, then alone the matter - event 
can take place. Otherwise not. That is these Dasa /Bukthi periods 
will be like passing clouds. Sub Lords and Dasa / Bukthi Lords 
conduct themselves like a master and servant. 


When the Cuspal Sub Lord on a positive note the Native 
experiences the windfall. When the Cuspal Sublord if on a 
negative note, the Native experiences the pit falls. 


The Boy and Girl entering the Wedlock under the legal 
bondage as Husband and Wite are the two wheels of an axis. It 
is here you will understand the true meaning of the word 
phenomenon, relevant to the word Sub as Cuspal Sub Lord. In 
the selection of a life partner, the 7" cusp of the Native (Boy/Girl) 
will guide you to tell the Lagna cusp of the life partner, the would 
be husband or wife. 


Please refer to article on Matching of Horoscope by Late sri 
Sivapatham, - which is reproduced. It is sell-explanatory. 


The Cuspal Sublords are so strong, that nothing on earth 
can go against it. Whether they give the green signal or deny of 
matters is a thing stamped at the very birth on the Native. This 
stamping. whether good or bad is what we call Fate and Destiny. 
Therefore the Cuspal Sub Lord has only one thing to say. And 
that is Yes or No of a matter under analysis. 


Next, the planet Sublords. Planet Sublords are also decisive, 
when planets as House signiflicators operate in a conjoined team, 
these planets are accepted or rejected by the Sublords to offer a 
result. 


Here please note the sharp contrast between the Cuspal 
sublerd and planet Sub Lord. 


CGuspal Sub Lord say Yes or No of a matter of particular 
Bhava. For example 


Marriage means - ¢" Bhava - 7" Cusp Sub Lord. 


* REPS AMIR DPD Poked boaare - 


Child birth means - 5* Bhava - 5" Cusp Sub Lord. 

To go abroad means - 12” Bhava - 12° Cusp Sub Lord. 
Profession means 10" Bhava - 10" Cusp Sub Lord and so on. 
There ends the matter. 


Where as the planet Sub Lord - tells, the planet even though 
it may be a House significator, ii may enact or not an event. That 
is Planet as Dasa / Bukthi Lords on a Star and Sub, this Sub 
Lords is favourable - go ahead - and if unfavourable - halt is the 
result. Some times this Halt will mean a grinding halt. Therefore 
the Planets Sub according to their favourable - unfavourable 
Status, gives you a choice and enough choice to select another 
Planet which is on a favourable Sub that can execute an event, 
on the timing of events. The Planet Sub enables you to have a 
litie liberty on the choice of Planets who are House significiators 
cum Planet significators, to enact an event. To enact an event the 
subs will have to be favourable that is fruit full. 


Of the significators, you say a Planet is oné amongst the 
fruitful signiticators. What made this Planet a fruitful significator. 
It is the Sub that made this Planet a fruitful significator. So to say, 
on the timing of events the Sub is not at the mercy of the Planet. 
It is the Planet that is under the mercy of the Sub. 


Do you feel giddy? Have | brain washed you? All right. What 
is explained above - | repeat in one single line. - Planet Sub tells 
the very Strength of the Planet - either Weak or Strong. 


To sum up the above readings - we have to understand - 1. 
That a Cuspal Sub Lord is the Supremo of a Bhava to give or not 
of the matter related to that Bhava only. 


You have to accept il as if is - you have no choice. Again to 
repeat - that Cuspal Sublords says only onething - and that is 
Yes or No. There ends the matter. 


10 + ASTRO SHCREIS © 


2. Whereas the Planet Sub says - 

Mr.Planet - what do you want? What can I do for you ? In 
reply Mr. Planet says - 1 am one of the significators of Houses 2- 
7-11 at the stellar level. | have to proceed further. Qur Hero Sub 
says | am holding the portfolios 1 -6 10-12 and hence you cannct 
proceed further. Hence our Mr.Planet on a wrong footing - ona 
wrong Sub is afall out and drop out from the House signifcators. 


Naturally you will have to study the strength of another Planet 
- a significator, who is on the right Sub - that Sub which has the 
power to move this Planet to operate an event. That is favourable 
Sub. By now it should be clear that you can choose a Planet 
amongst the significatos who are on the favourable Sub. 


Now we shall proceed further. 


About this Planet Sub Lord we have to understand one thing 
very clearly at the very outset. That is say a Mesha Lagna - a 
Planet is in the Star of Venus - meaning that Planet is under the 
sway of Venus. It will give a result of Venus, where if is stationed 
and the Houses owned by Venus, which are Hishaba and hula 
- that is Houses 2 and 7. 


Of what is said above it is not that easy to understand as you 
think of it. The Planet in the Star of Venus if it is also in the Sub of 
Venus, then only it can give the results of Houses Rishaba and 
Thula - that is 2-7. When that Planet, ff itis not on Venus Sub, but 
some other Sub, accordingly the results will vary. This var.ation 
is what we have to understand as favourable or unfavourable. 
This you will understand as you read in the KP Readers under 
the title " The Role of Sub". 


The Role of Sub is to clearly define whether a Planet can 
offer favourable result or unfavourable result, favourable result 
or adverse result, good result or bad result, positive or negative 
result. 


Whether it votes for or against. 


KRGHN4MUR TE PabHoatre = 411 


Therefore the Sub also, the same of the Star (Venus Star - 
Venus Sub} to offer its House result - good or bad - is one thing. 


Then its own Sub or some other Sub to offer a favourable or 
unfavourable result is yet another thing. 


Example: 
Venus Star 1" period Venus Sub Math's Teacher. 
A student 2nd period Sun Sub Chemistry Teacher. 
3° period Moon Sub Botany teacher 
and so on. 


similar to a student attending class period one afler the other 
for different lessons, the student is the same, but the teachers 
change. Like wise a Planet on its move over a Star is passing 
through one of the 9 Subs. According to birth time it is noted. 
That is a Planet in a Star and in a Sub. Now this has to be applied 
for reading a result. Again we will take the same Mesha Lagna - 
reading of result will be from two angles. One is the Star level 
and other is the Sub level. 


First we will take up the Star levet:- 


Mesha Lagna - a Planet is in the Star of Venus, Venus is the 
star Lord. Venus is in the 4” - that is Cancer. Now the said Planet 
under the sway of Venus will first offer the result of the 4° House 
where Venus is stationed and the Houses owned by Venus which 
are 2 and 7, that is Rishaba and Thula. So every thing comes 
very simple. Here as a student you are the Archemedies. In }oyv 
Archemedies ran on the streets shouting Urekha - Urekha - |! 
have found -! have found. (Archemedies found the purity of Gold 
in terms of specific gravity}. 


But Sri. K.S.K has put a hurdle before you for the hurdle 
race. That is at the Star level itself, first you have to study the 
Behaviour of Planets in a Star, without which no results v!| come 
proper. Then the same Planet in a Sub has to be studied without 
which no result will come proper. 


12 Arti Stent as - 


Here your full attention is required. 


A Planet at the Star level. This Planet is taking part in the 
relay race with a torch flame. After running same distance, the 
Planet hands over the torch to one Mr. Sub. That Mr.Sub from 
where he is stationed, continues the relay race. That Mr.Sub 
should have the stamina to run. That is strong or weak. That is 
favourable or unfavourable. 


Now we will come back to behaviour of Planets. A Planet is 
in a Star. How this Planet behaves? A Planet is in a Sub. what Is 
the Role of this Sub? 


BE ALERT: 


When a Planet is in a Star, Sri. K.S.K says study the behaviour 
of Planet. 


When a Planet is in a Sub, Sri. K.S.K tells us, study the Role 
of this Sub. why? Because Mr.Sub acts independently. This Mr. 
Sub is neither a Star nor a Planet. This Sub - the area of the Sub 
is called as Sub Lord - is occupying a House - some where - in 
the charl. From there he starts the relay race - meaning this Sub 
Lord from where he is stationed - from there only he starls the 
relay race as a Planet - now Sub Lord as a Planet, also will have 
to behave or act. When the Sub acts he is the King Maker - that is 
favourable or unfavourable. 


Therefore a Planet in a Star behaves or acts in a particular 
direction. And the same Planet in a Sub - that Sub Lord does not 
behave or act - but straight away it takes the Role of a judge - a 
King Maker. 


Dear students, you have come a Longway. Unless you are 
able to understand the spirit behind the Star and Sub you cannot 
master KP. 


Now how dowe understand? Sri. K.S.K says study the 
behaviour of Planet and the Role of Sub. Now what you should 


RTH AME RTE Paptibiali 13 


do is - study the behaviour of Sub and the Role of Planet. By this 
study you will have a litthe more clear thinking. 


All said above are well explained by Sri K.M.Subramaniam 
in his series of articles "Sub Lord speaks". 


Let us make a rapid reading on behaviour of Planets. 


1. <A Planet is strong or weak according to the Sign deposit. 
That Planet in a favourable Sub or unfavouable Subs 


Whether the Planet is conjoined with or aspected by any 
other Planet. 


4. The Rahu/Kethu their relevance 


Behaviour of Planet and the Role of Sub - is further explained. 
All said inthe above para, are no doubttaken care of as a matter 
of routine in our analysis. But we have to look to the specifics of 
that Planet. Take the same Mesha Lagna. The Native is of 
Marriageable age. Venus Dasa / Venus Bukthi is on. 


7” Sub Lord is Mr.X. 


Mr.X is in the Star of Venus Lord of 2 and 7. That is Mr.X, the 
sub Lord of 7, signifies the Houses 2 and 7. The signal for 
marriage was given at the very birth. We now say that the Sublord 
Mr.X is under the sway of Venus. That is X, the 7" Sub Lord who 
is Supremo is under compulsion to offer the results of Houses 2 
and 7. To tell it in a different way this Sub Lord X , the Supreme 
behaves like a bonded Labourer, to work not only for Venus, as 
to where he is, say 5", but also has to work for the Houses 2? and 
7 of the Venus, to give the marriage. 


Everything is going well for Mr.X regarding marriage. Mr.x 
the Sub Lord is in the Star and Sub of Venus. Venus is in the Star 
of Mercury in the 5", Mercury is Lord of 3 and 6. By the behaviour 
the Planet, marriage will take place. By the Role of Sub-Divorce 
or separation is waiting for its period. As a joke we maysay 10.15 
A.m. Marriage10.16 a.m. Honey Moon. 10.17 A.M. Divorce. 


14 - ASTRO Sicnsas - 


In the I¥ Reader page 195, para 4 Sri K.S.K. has explained 
Marriage comes because of the Lord of the constellation. 
Separation comes due to the Sub occupied by the Planet. This 
is the specific. The specific Role of the Sub Whether you lie it or 
not. 


All our analysis starts from the Cuspal Sub Lord for a matter, 
that ends as an event with the help of Planet significators who 
are to be fruitful singnificators. Here Sub - the Role it has to piay- 
what Role is of the Sub? We have the question but no answer. 
Because, Nothing is the Role of Sub, unless it is subjected under 
the Golden Rule in KP What is the golden rule? "Take the Planet 
with is posited in the Sub of a singnificator whose constellation 
is not tenanted". 


The chart with you, you wanted to know whether marriage is 
promised or marriage is not promised; Boy and Girl, the love 
birds are waiting to hear from you. On your analysis you are 
dead tired. 


Sri K.S.K. says Astra alerts astrologer. So try little astra. You 
must be fresh now after Astra. | will also help you. Let us take a 
second look at the chart. 


When the Cuspal Sub Lord, the supremo, who stops to 
conquer at any cost, does not give the green signal and also 
does not show the Red signal - then how are we to proceed in 
our analysis. Stalwarts in the footsteps of Sri. K.S.K and from his 
Readers have shown the way - the beaten track. 


For the green signal - imagine it, as the outer signal (Raiways) 
- example marriage. 


7" Sub Lord X. X is in the Star of Planet that should signify 2 
or 7 or 11 and no connection at all to 6-12. 


This is tha direct or primary approach. 


Now the 7" Sublord has not signified 2 or 7 or 11 or Gor 12. 


= RRISHNAMiRCL PalbHORATI « 15 


Under such circumstances - we should watch the Second 
tnner signal (Railways) - very near to the platform end. 


7" Sub Lord is X%. MX is in a Star. 


That Star - that is Stariord in whose constellation it is, should 
Signify 2 or 7 or 11. Marriage is promised. 


Here too 1-6-10-12 means Marriage is denied. 


Love birds in front of you must have thanked you and took 
leave of. 


We are studying the Role of Sub, continuously, from different 
angles and different aspects. 


From so far what you have read, we will sum up this Sub - 
Cuspal Sub Lord is the most powerful to say Yes or No. 
Cuspal Sub Lord is the Supremo - our Hero. 


@11:71 Sub Lord as a Supremo he stoops to conquer, be it 
good or otherwise. 


Cuspal Sublord as Supremo to what extent he stoops. 


Cuspal Sub Lord as Supremo stoops to the extent that he 
conducts himself as a bonded labourer. 


AgainCuspal Sub Lord - as a bonded labourer he stoops. 
Cuspal Sub Lord - as he stoops - he conquers. 


Cuspal Sub Lord - as he conquers - he becomes 
powerul as a Supremo. 


Now what said above is explained by an example chart from 
KP & Astrology - June 1994 issue - Page 1 and 2 under the 
caption Cuspal Sub Lord speaks - by Sri.K.M.Subramaniam. 


The Horoscope is in the square shape. For an easy 
understanding |! have made it in the linear shape, vertically.

BEHAVIOUR OF PLANET 


Now the 7" Sub Lord Mercury as a planet from 3° on its 
Relay Race ran upto Venus Sub in Moon Star. Now the Relay 
Race for 7" Sub Lord Mercury as a planet, by behaving as dictated 
by Mocn is over after handing over the torch to Sub Lord Venus 
ins 


Now Venus starts the Relay Race - now the Role of Sub. 


Role Of Sub: 


oub Lord Venus is not a planet and it is not a Star. Sub Lord 
Venus is in the 5". From here - that is from 5", Sublord Venus 
becomes the planet. Now Venus as a planet is "On Your Mark - 
get ready -Said Go". 


18 » AStRee Seve fs 


Venus is in the Star of Jupiter in the All. The Sublord Venus 
in its Relay Race ran upto the All, where Jupiter is, to end the 
Relay Race, the final 4" stage. 


Now you will understand that the Sub-the Role dof Sub - the 
oub planet the Supremo - has also to stoop and act like a bonded 
labourer - to conquer as Supremo to tell the final say Yes or No. 


Now again | am explaining by an example chart from the IV 
Reader - page- 192 onwards analysed by our Guruji Sri KSK. 
For KP students, beginners this analysis by Sri KSK, superficially 
it will seem to be easy, bul if is somewhat intricate. Pages 92 to 
196 are reproduced, for reference. The same chart is prepared 
and presented with 1 to 12 Cuspal position and Planets positions. 
Now [ draw you altention to page 193 to 2 item in which it is 
Stated "that Mars in the Sub of Rahu give Ultimate Separation". 


Now we will analyse the same chart as explained by Sri KSK 
and also as a KP student. 


1. 7* Sub Lord is Saturn. Saturn is in the Star of Venus in 
the 2nd. Venus owns the 1s’ - only one House. Therefore Saturn 
at Star level signifies Houses 2 and 1. Here 1* House signification 
will negate the 2nq House matters. 


oatum is in rapt conjunction with Jupiter in the 12°. Jupiter 
is Lord 8,9,12. 


Saturn is in the Sub of Jupiter signifying 12,8.9. Both Saturn 
and Jupiter in the Star of Venus - means both Saturn and Jupiter 
are controlled by Venus to give the results of Houses 2 and 1 al 
Star level, 


Both Saturn and Jupiter in the star of Venus - means both 
saturn and Jupiter are in the Sub of Jupiter to give the same 
results of Houses 2 and 1. Therefore 7* Sublord saturn has said 
Yes for marriage with a negative indication by 1s' House. 


KRING AMLRTL PauHOpeact = 19 


In page 14 para §, Sri KSK says : - 
"Mars in its anthara gives courage", and in page 193 he has 


already told that - "Mars in the Sub of Rahu gives ultimate 
separation". 


Now we will apply the Relay Race: 


Mars is in the Star of Mercury - that is Mercury controls Mars 
at his Star level to offer the results of Houses 3,2,6 and Mars by 
himself in the 4th as Lord of 7". 


Therefore Mars the runner has to run to Houses 3,2,6 through 
his own temporary House of 4" and permanent House of 7™. 
Mars in the Relay Race is holding the torch and has covered the 
Houses 3-2-64-7. His run in the Relay Race is over. Now Mars 
hands over the torch to the Sub Lord Rahu. Now Rahu has to 
start the Relay Race according to his Star position. 


Now Rahu the Sub Lord - the Supremo starts the Helay Race. 
Rahu at Star level signifies Houses 2 and 4 - this Rahu should 
give the marriage on account of the 2 event though delayed on 
account of the 4™ indication. 


But Rahu - the Sub Lord of Mars - the Supremo helps Mars 
for separation and device. 


Where, what went wrong’? Rahu who is now on the Relay 
Race does not bother about Houses 2,3,4 for its run, as he was 
weak for the reasons Planets are there in Houses 2,3 and 4 even 
though he can act as agent for all of them. 


Now Rahu asserted his strong position occupying the 5" 
House but also stationed in the 6 sign. Rahu is on the 6" Cusp. 
Even if he is not on the 6” Cusp it is more than enough he be in 
6" sign. 


Please note: V Cusp Sub is Rahu 
VI Cusp Sub is Rahu. Xll Cusp Sub is Rahu. 


ZU) “ASTRO SLERLIS = 


Jupiter Lord of 8,9,12 is aspecting Rahu, by 5" aspect, and 
also by 150 western aspect - Quincunx - which is slightly bad - 


Jupiter as Lord of 12" there is no question of slightly bad. 
? 


Mars-Rahu-western aspect is 65 - nothing to depend on. 
Now we know as a planet, Rahu is all powerful and as Sub Lord 
that is as Supremo, because of all said above he is Lord of 6" 
itself. As Lord of 6" he runs for the 6" House, in the Relay Race 
for Mars, independently. Lord of 6" means he acts for Mercury, 
by running for Mars. 


Page 28, Ill Reader (Practical) reproduced for better 
understanding. 


According to Krishnamuni Padhdhati, one is to judge one’s 
finance and fortune as follows:- 


[a] Planets posited in the constellation of the occupants in the 
houses 2,6,10 or 11 are the strongest to give wealth to a 
person. These planets may be debilitated or may be in 
enemy's one's status will improve in their periods and 
sub periods, if they are in the sub of the significators of 
2or6or 11. 


[b] Ihe planets tenanted in the above said houses and 
occupying the sub of the significators of 2,6 or 17. 
These planets should not be afflicted by the lord of the 
constellation in which they are. They indicate increase in 
income and savings. 


[c] The planets in the constellation of the lords of the 
houses 2 or 6 or 10 or 11 and is in the Sub of the significators 
2,6 or 11. 


[d] The lords of these houses in the Sub of the significators 
of 2,6 ort, 


[le] Those which are conjoined with the significators or 
aspected by them. 


*KRISIINAMURTI PADHDHATI® 2| 


Planets contribute to one's riches:- 


[1] Provided the sub occupied by them are governed by 
the Significators of 2 or 6 or 17. 


[2] Provided they are not adversely aspected. 


li the sub lord is evil, one loses or one is unable to make 
money during the conjoined period of the planet and the sub- 
lord. The planet adversely aspecting robs away the benelticial 
result during their conjoined periods. 


Further, majority of planets either posited in the constellation 
of lord of 8 or 12 or in their subs in other constellations, threaten 
lass and poverty. They also indicate issue of cheques to repay 
loan or give away the share of profit. 


a planet owns 8 and 11,or 12 or 11 houses, then one can 
expect beneficial results during its period, in the sub pericd of 
other benefics being Significators of 2,6 and 14; in the sub period 
of evil planets one will lose. The ownership of an evil house and 
that of a favourable one by the same planet does not cancel one 
another and it becomes neutral, but actually one will gain during 
its period, in the sub period of benefics and one will incur loss 
during other sub periods. Ultimately the profit and loss may be 
adjusted and the balance sheet may show NIL,. Yet there should 
be both the entries in the ledger; pleasure and profit as well as 
pain and loss. 


What is said by Sri KSK is explained by Sri PV.K Punnaswara 
Rao -as below. 


Always houses 1.2.3,.6,10,11 promise good results. Planets 
must be judged by considering the constellation occupied by 
them. Houses 6.8.12. are evil and are referred to as Dusthanas. 
The Sublerd getting the lordship of 6 or 8 or 12 tends to give 
adverse results while the lordship of 1,2,3,6,10 and 11 gives 
favourable results. The nature of the result may be viewed by the 
person whether as favourable or untavourable to him depending 


oD * ASTRO Ste kis « 


on the Sub-Lord if he is a benefic or a malefic. Whether a planet 
is a benefic or a malefic to the native may be viewed if the planet 
is advantageous or disadvantageous to him when dealing with 
the particular house. Hence no planets is wholly a benefic or a 
maletic. . 


(a) lf the Star Lord is favourable and the SubLord also is 
favourable, the matter indicated by the star Lord will be 
enjoyed in full by the native. 


(b) Ifthe Star Lord indicates beneficial results and the SubLord 
shows adverse results, then the Star Lord also will be evil 
and adverse results will prevail. 


(c} =‘ If the Star Lord denotes evil results and the Sub Lord denctes 
beneficial results, the native may find temporarily a little 
relief from the adverse results. 


(d} Ifthe Star Lord offers adverse results and the SubLord also 
is unfavourable, the native suflers wholly from the adverse 
results. 


In accordance with these principles, during the conjoined 
period of Dasa, Bhukti and Anthara, whenever the conjcined 
period of Dasa, Bhukti and Anthara periods or the Luminaries 
i.e. Sun and Moon or the Ascendant transit the three sensitive 
positions, the events will take place according to the nature of 
the Star - Lord and Sub - Lord.

K.P. & ASTROLOGY (JULY 1990) 


FRUITFULL SIGNIFICATORS 


Readers, 


In this magazine, some arlicles are so selected that all the 
nine Planets happen to be the significators of any question. When 
such occasion arises, how to select the fruitful significators and 
reject the barren ones is also explained. 


lf all the nine Planets happen to be the significators for any 
matter or even the majority of them, it is necessary to follow the 
following two principles, so that one can eliminate scientifically 
such of those which will not produce the result and reduct the 
number of Planets to three or four so that one can expect the 
result during the conjoined period and Sub period of the three or 
four fruitful Planets. 


Method 1: 


Supposing a person wants to know the time of marriage 
and also he wants to find out the significators which will give the 
marriage in their conjoined period, then, count down in which 
Sub each Planet is posited. lithe Sub Lord is a strong significator 
of this question, then, you select that Planet. But if the Sub Lord 
is one of the weak significators (for example, a Planet is not at all 
connected with Houses 2,7 and 11, except that one of the 
significators aspect it, then it is a weak Planet. It is not exaltation 
or debilitation which one is to ascertain the strength for this 
purpose). But one is to find out whether it is a strong significator 
or a weak significator in the order in which we make the selection 
of the significators, according to KP. 


Methad II: 


The other way by which you have to eliminate would be taking 
the Ruling Planets. Ruling Planets have the final say in the matter. 


24 ° Asire SEOREIS = 


Even here, you have to select such of those Planets which are 
deposited insucha Sub which contribute to the matter concerned. 
Again we have to reject such a Planet which happens to be both 
the significator of the Houses 2,7 and 11,and also the significator 
of the Houses 12 to 2 or7 or 11,i.e., 1 or 6 or 10. In this method 
in a few cases it does not give the marriage; and in a few cases 
it brings about separation after marriage. Therefore, if such a 
significator period is running, the next period alone will give the 
marriage. Therefore, this particular method of selection of fruitful 
Significators is always necessary. 


Normally whenever consultants come in large numbers, i is 
a difficult problem for the astrologer to approach methodically 
and make a selection. Where students scientifically and 
systematically analyse using K.P. they can be sure of success 
and success alone. Otherwise there will be a few failures.

As explained above for the Moon and Mars, you can 
Understand other Planet significations. Please remember what 
Sri, K.S.K said - study each Planet and find out what they signify 
(atthe Role of Sub level } to offer good results or to offer harmful 
results. 


Before | proceed further to explain, please note:- 


a) Rahu in X will act as agent for the XI Cusp - (Ven - Jup - Sun) 
(reference Il Reader , page 323, para 5) similarly Rahu will 
also act as agent for the X Cusp - (Ven-Mars-Mer) 


b) Jupiter and Moon are on the XI Cusp with 1° & 2° conjunction 
respectively. 


c} sri. KS.K in page 28 has said 2-6-11 that is 10” signification 
should net come, as 10 negates the 11”. 


d} = Inthis charl you do not have 2-6-11, but you have a number . 
of 10.11, 6 signification. 107 signification is not at all welcome. 


e) Then how to evaluate. 


i) Rahu is not alone in Thula. Still Rahu will throw his weight 
for the conjoined Planets. 


ii} We have already seen Jup and Moon are on the 11" Cusp. 
ii} Sun is approaching Rahu with a 3° orb 
iv} Yen and Sun are in 2° conjunction 


v} Fortuna is in the Lagna Bhava in the Star of Sub and in 
the Sub of Rahu 


*eRe HS ASURTL Pappa = +7 


vi) Lagna Lord Jup and Lagna Sub Lord also Jup is or 
the 11" Cusp 


f) Our object is to see that 10m signification is not 
operational. How? 


Sun is in the Star of Rahu and in the Sub of Sun 
Venus is in the Star of Rahu and in the Sub of Ven. Sat is in the 
otar of Rahu and in the Sub of Sat Rahu is in the Star and Sub of 
Jup Jup is in the Sub of Ven. 


From the above said you will find in majority of the Planet 
significators, 10m signification stands reduced. 


To conclude | am explaining with Moon. With Block & arrow 
mark indication the Role of Sub is already explained. That is 


Moon is in the Star of Jup signifies 11,1 Star wise. 


Moon is the source - Moon Lord of 11(11 x8) source. 
8 is in the 


Moon is in the Sub of Venus 10-11-6 Sub level. 
signifies This ig not enough 


What Venus signities?

So in terms of Stellar strength the matter is VIII & VI Le.,

lt was Rahu Bukthi from December '76 to September 79, 
Rahu has the matters of V & VII. Should have had in love matters 
and a beginning, in that line of life. 


Jupiter Bukthi came from September 79 to February ‘82 
Jupiter in the Star of Rahu in V tells love affairs and Jupiter in the 
oub of Moon duly signifying VI & Vli< fully did not materialise 
into wedlock, as VI is detriment and spoiled it as Moon is owner

in VIl owing VI and no planet in Vl. So regarding marital matters. 


Mercury being in the Sub of Venus signifying XII against a 
barren period for love attair. Nothing will come up. 


From June 8? to July 88, is Kethu Bukthi. Kethu is inthe star 
of Mcon and so signifies VI & VII. Being in the Sub of Mercury, 
again signifies VIl & VI. It is a barren one for love matters. 


July 88 to July 91 is the Bukthi of Venus. Venus is in V inthe 
star of Jupiter in XII, and being in the Sub of Moon duly signifying 
VI & VIl so secret love matters had come up and continued in 
oun Bukthi. 


sun Bukthi is from July 91 to June 92. The student will note 
that Sun is in Hl and no planet in Sun star and so fully signifies III 
& Vil. Sun is in the Sub of Jupiter planet in the star of Rahu in V. 
The love attair was successfully continuing in this Bukthi, as Sub 
signifies V very well. 


All went well in the love matters and Moon Bukthi came in 
June 9? to Dec.93. 


Moon is in its own star in Vil & owns VI detrimental for marital 
matter. And Moon is in the Sub of Rahu in V & signifies Ill. 


During December '93 the matter came to the ears of the 
parents, when Mars Bukthi started and so trouble started. 


Why? 
Mars is in the star of Venus in V & so the matter, love attair. 


Mars is inthe Sub of Moon placed in its own star in VIl owning 
Vl and no plangetin Vi. Vl worked out in full and the trouble had 
the beginning, with the girl changing her mind and the boy faced 
frustration. 


*KRREHNAWEURY! PapHbHATL 41 


So the students may note that in the matter of love attairs, if 
the planet is controlled by the Sub Lord signifying VI or IV or Xl 
the matter will fall through, and further, VII cusp Sub Lord is 
Mercury and it signifies VI & Vil through star and three Sub Lord 
Venus signifies Xll & so his Vilth does not promise marital life.

these Houses are to be judged and then only one has to declare

The Dasa period at the time of marriage was Saturn Dasa 
Venus Bhukti Sun Anthra: divorce was sanctioned during Saturn 
Dasa Sun Bhukti Jupiter Anthra on 27-11-67. Appeal is given on 
13-8-68 during Saturn Dasa Moon Bhukti Mars Anthra. 


For marriage, judge Houses 2, 7, and 11. Venus and Moon 
are in 2:none in 7, kethu is in 11. Mercury, Mars and Saturn rule 
the 2" 7* and 11* Houses. Jupiter and Saturn are in the 
constellation of Venus; Rahu is the constellation of Moon. No 
Planet is in Mars star, Sun Is in the constellation of Saturn, Lord 
of 1+. Mars and kethu are in the star of Mercury. 


34 - ASTRO SECRETS - 


1. Sun in the star of Saturn can unite and can separate: 
because, Saturn is Lord of 11 and occupant of 12; 11” is for 
union: 12" for separation. 


2. Moon is in the constellation of Rahu afid Sub of Mars. 
Rahu is to give the results of the House 2, 3, 5 and 6. It also 
shows union and separation. 


3. Mars inthe Sub of Rahu gives ultimate separation. 


4. Mercury indicates separation as il is in the star of occupant 
and owner of 12 and Sub of Rahu. 


5. Jupiter in the star of Venus (union) and Sub of Jupiter in 
12 shows legal separation. 


6. Venus in 2 in the constellation of Rahu and Sub of Rahu 
gives both. 


7. Saturn in Venus star (union) Sub of Rahu, ultimate 
separation as Rahu is to denote 6h House matter also. 


8. Rahu in Moon star Venus Sub shows united married life. 


9. Kethu in Mercury star Venus Sub unites. Thus what each 
Planet can contribute is to be studied. 


The day of marriage, was Saturday: Moon in Saturn Sign. 
Lagna in Saturn Sign, Sun star. Sun was in its own star: Saturn 
was inthe Sign of Lord of 14 and star of Lord of 7. Jupiter was in 
Venus star in Sign of Lord of 7. Venus owns only Lagna and not 
6: so also, Mars owns only 7" and not 12°. 


(There is no Mars dosha in this chart because it is in a 
movable Sign, it is debilitated; conjoined with Mercury. Yet look 
at the fate. Thus taking the position of Mars and offering 
predictions which appear more like a course is not correct. But 
take the Planets situated in the star or Sub of Mars in 1,2, 4, 7, 8 
or 12. Then, the Planet tenanted in such a Mars star will offer 
undersirable and disagreeable results.)

judicial separation. Sun again offers the evil result through 
Government Department Jupiter in 12 has given. 


Appeal is filed on 13-8-68. Saturn Dasa Moon Bhukti Mars

anohter court is also approached. According to Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati, Planets deposited in the constellation of Mercury, or 
occupying Mercury Sign, gemini or conjoined with or aspected 
by Mercury will give, provided tts Sub-Lord is connected with 
dual Sign or Mercury Sign or Star. 


Mars in its anthra gives courage: makes one take further 
step: fight and so on. 


What will be the result’? 


Note the Sub-Lord of the dasanatha. If it denotes once for all 
separation, then, according to the various bhuktis in that Dasa, there 
will be alternative results good and bad, depending on the Sublord 
in which, the Lord of the bhukti is deposited. If bhuktis are ruled by 
A Band C and they are deposited in beneficial Subs (Lord of the 
Sub contributing to the benefit of the Native's desire) then, in the 
Dasa of a Planet which Is significator of both advantageous and 
disadvantageous Houses, then during the bhuktis of A, B and © the 
results will be favourable. Ifthe Sub Lords of the position occupied 
by the Bhukti Lords DE. F are unfavourable, during their Bhuktis, 
one has to expect unto ward and undesirable results. 


lf a particular House is unoccupied and the constellations of 
the owner of th House is also un occupied, then those Planets 
deposited in the Sub of that Planet, will offer the resluts. 


lf a particular result is indicated by a Planet, then those which 
are deposited in its constellations are connected with the matters 
signified by that Bhava. 


ab * ASTRO SECRETS 


Here, Saturn is tn Venus star. Venus is in 2, Hence Saturn is 
connected with memebers of the family. It dees not mean only 
increase the members by marriage or birth of children. But it 
must also show the decrease. Increase and decrease depend 
on the bhuktis and anthras in Saturn Dasa, one can get married. 
He may get separated or either of them may pass away. Hence 
dasanatha has to offer both results as he will be the significator 
of both. 


some may get married, in a bhukti and in the same bhukti 
one may get diverced. Here, both dasanatha and bhuktinadha 
will be the significaters of marriage and also divorce. Some may 
get married in the same Dasa, bhukti and anthra and live 
separately form the same anthra; then all these three Planets are 
the significators of marriage and also divorce. Marriage comes 
because of th Lord of the constellation. Separation comes due 
to the Sub occupied by the Planet. 


One may get married in A Dasa. B is for divorce. B bhukti 
can operate during A Dasa. Separation will not come. It will end 
in misunderstanding as the Dasa Lord is the most powerful 
cammander. No bhukti Lord can offer a result it Dasa Lord does 
not permit. If Dasa Lord is not a significator of the result whicn 
bhkti Lord is to give, Dasa Lord, the final authority will not give 
the ultimate result. Planets form a cabinet. The prime minister is 
the dasanatha. The bukthinadhas are cabinet ministers. The 
anthranadhas are deputy ministers. 


Therefore note the 3 Planets which will rule conjointly and 
these must be connected with 6 and 12 Houses. 


Jupiter, Lord of 12 is in 12: Mercury is deposited in Jupiter 
star. Hence Mercury, Jupiter in 12 are for separation. Saturn, 
represents 11* and 12". 


oun is in Saturn star, Sub of Jupiter. Hence Sun must bring 
about separation. 


KRISHNAMURTE Paphtouatl « 37 


Rahu has to represent Mercury as it is in Mercury's Sign. 
Rahu in Moon constellation and Venus Sub, according to its stellar 
position, brings union. But, it has the portfolio of Mercury also; 
hence it will cause separation. Moon in Rahu star in Mercury 
sign will bring about separation. The Sub-Lord Mars has no 
connection with 2? or 7 or 11; nor with 6 or 12. Hence, Mars is 
unconnected. In that case, the bhuktinandha gives the results 
during Jupiter Sub period in Moon bhukti. The order will be issued 
on 1-2-69. The divorce will stand. 


As per transit, 


a. sun will be in Saturn Sign, Moon star and conjcoin MG 
e., 10° Cusp. 


b. Moon will be in Saturn star Moon Sign. 


c. Time of judgement Moon star Saturn Sub ie., Lagna 
on that day will be at 14° Taurus. 


d. According to western system of prediction Lord of 7 Mars 
(Nirayana} squares its original position and opposes both 
Jupiter and Saturn.

f. Jupiter in Mercury Sign Moon star. 


Venus in Jupiter Sign Satum star.

Thus it can be seen that all Planets vote for final divorce 
from 1-2-69.

SELECTION OF PARTNER 
THROUGH 
KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 


LATE SRI A. SIVAPATHAM, SRILANKA 


In considering prospective marriage partners, horoscopes 
are matched on the traditional ten “poruthams”. These porutharms 
refer to temperamental and sexual compatibility, longevity, an- 
progeny among others. Then the assessment of future happiness 
and well being 's well above 50% traditional astrologers 
pronounce that «:.e parties could be wedded. Even though in 
some case 1 CO percent agreement had been vouchec for, there 
are Umnteen cases, ot marital failures as evindenced by constant 
bickering, early demise of the partner, legs; sagperaicn and 
divorce and lack of pregnancy should evoke serious doubts as 
to the utility of considering poruthams. 


Mother nature in her inimitable way destines one for another 
for better or for worse. This destiny in astrological parlance is 
praptham. Porutham not withstanding, the matching of 
horoscopes could be done only on the basis of parptham as 
elucidated in Krishnamurti Pachdhathi. 


The horoscope of an eminent legal officer came to my 
attention. Various astrologers had predicted different periods of 
marriage. Even several months after the predicted periods, the 
officer remains a bachelor. Some even doubted whether he would 
ever get married. A proper application of the principle as explained 
in KR will throw light on the marital prospects and marriage 
partner of this officer. His horoscope is as follows.

saturn aspects Venus - Lord of 7* and Mercury - Lord of 
11°. The trine aspect of Saturn falls on the cusps of the 7* and 
the V. There is triné aspect between saturn and Moon. Hence 
saturn may delay but will not deny marriage to the Native. 


Let us see whether the Native will ever get married according 
to Krishnamurti Padhdhati. 


NOTE: The Sublord of the 7* Cusp. 


lf the Sub Lord is the significator of 2 or 7 or 11, Houses 
marriage, then the marriage is promised. 


The 7* Cusp is co-ruled by Venus, Moon and Venus as Sign 
Lord, Star Lord and Sub Lord respectively. The Sub Lord Venus 
is the significator of the 7" and 11". So marriage is promised. 


AQ) = astra SECREIS . 


The next question that should gain our attention is "When 
will it materialise?" 


Note the significators of Houses 2,7 and 11. 


oecond House is vacant, Lord of the House is Jupiter. No 
Planet is in the constellation of Jupiter. 


seventh House is occupied by Sun. Only mars is deposited 
in the constellation of Sun. Seventh House is ruled by Venus. 
Jupiter is deposited in the constellation of Venus which is 
conjoined with Mercury. 


Eleventh House is vacant. It is ruled by Mercury. No Planet is 
situated in the constellation of Mercury which is conjoined with 
Venus. 


Saturn aspects Venus and Mercury, Lords of 7“ and +1", 
respectively. Therefore Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and 
saturn are significators. Kethu is posited in the Sign of Sun. Hence 
reject Sun and select kethu. Similarly select Rahu instead of 
saturn as Rahu is posited in the Sign of Saturn. 


oo Rahu, kethu, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter are Fruitful 
significators of marriage. 


Now the Native runs Jupiter Dasa, Rahu Bukthi from 75-1 - 
1972 to 9-6-74. So his marriage may take place in Jupiter Dasa, 
Rahu Bukthi, Mars anthra, Mercury or Venus sukshuma. But 
Jupiter Dasa. Rahu Bukthi, Mars anthra runs from 19-4-74 to 9-6- 
74 According to transit, the marriage will take place in the last 
week of May 74 in Venus scokshma., 


Let us consider some points about his partner. The Sublord 
of the 7* Cusp Venus -being conjoined with Mercury dual Planet, 
shows that he may have many partners or several marriages. 


_ This is a tricky point. 


KRISHNAMURTL PapHbDHaAtL » Al 


Further contemplation revealed that these two Planets are 
not situated in the sign or constellation or Sub of dual Planet. 
Instead, they aré on the constellation of Saturn which aspected 
them adversely. Hence Saturn rules out many marriages. 


Now | focussed my attention on the prospective partner. It 
Was predicted earlier that the marriage should take place in Venus 
sookshma. Hence Mercury or Venus (as both are conjoined) 
should be one of the ruling Planets of the partner at birth. Further 
| will not be surprised if she happens to be one of the twins. Ifthe 
oublord of her ascendant is either Venus or Mercury, she is mostly 
one ofthe twins. 


How could | confirm this point? 


Months passed by with almost all the horoscopes received 
being rejected till 1 came across the "Gne" which could be that of 
his future bride. The Native too showed interest on this "One" 
due to his fate. 


In matching a horoscope one must first determine the correct 
ascendant of the partner from the Native's chart before checking 
up any poruthams. Note the Lord of the sing where the 7* Cusp 
falls, the Lord of the he constellation in which the Cusp is posited 
and the Lord of the sub where the Cusp is deposited. Then you 
are having three Planets. That is the Lord of the Sign, Lord of the 
constellation and the Lord of the Sub. this combination gives 
correct clues to determine the exact of the partner. 


The above three Planets are not the only consideration in 
determining the ascsendant of the partner. If one of the above 
three Planets is conjoined with another Planet, then this Planet 
too will have to be considered. 


lfa node happens to be one of the above three Planets then 
Planets in its Sub; Planet conjoined with it,aspecting it and the 
Lord of the Sign where it is posited have of be taken into account. 
Now we will decide the ascendant of his partner in life. The Cusp 


42 « ARTRO SECRETS 


falls in Venus Sign Moon star Venus Sub. Venus is conjoined 


with Mercury. So Venus Mercury and Moon should co-rule the 
ascendant of the parner. 


But as Saturn and Moon are in the same stars' and Sub, 
Saturn has to be taken into

Next find out her period of marriage. 


Rahu, Jupiter, Moon, Saturn, Mercury and kethu are: Fruitful 
significators of Houses 2,7, and 11. \ 


Presently she is running Jupiter Dasa Mars Bukthr. Mars is 
not a significator. So this period will not give marriage. Next period 
is Rahu Bukthi. lt run from 25.474 to 19.976. Jupiter and Rahu 
are beneficial significators on this subject. Hence in Jupiter Dasa 


* KRISHNAMURTE PAtHibrlate = AS 


Rahu Bukthi Rahu anthra she will marry. This anthra period runs 
from 25.474 to 4.674 and Jupiter sookshma will run from 14.574 
to 1.674. 


Consideration of Moon is considered. Therefore Mercury, 
Venus, Moon/Saturn (Rahu too as it is the agent of Saturn) will 
co-rule the ascendant of the partner. 


Now when you examine the horoscope of the “one” given 
below who | venture to state is destined to be his partner; you 
will note the ascendant falls in Mercury Sign Moon star Venus 
sub Rahu Sub Sub (instead of Saturn Sub Sub as Rahu is the 
agent for Saturn) i.e., 21.14°26" kanya. 


Now check up reversely to know whether this person in the 
legal circle will be her parnter in life. Note the 7* Cusp in the 
chart of this lady. 


It falls in Jupiter Sign Mercury star Venus Sub. Venus is 
conjoined with Moon Mercury is inthe Sub of Rahu. Further Rahu 
is the agent of Mars as it is inthe Sign of Mars. So Venus, Moon, 
Rahu, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter should decide the position of 
the ascendant of her partner. 


Therefore it will not be surprising if this gentleman becomes 
her partner as his ascendant falls in Mars Sign Mr ~ irystar Moon 
sub Rahu Sub Sub. | have found during the course o: . :search 
that in many cases some of the ruling Planets of one partner at 
birth will be the significators of marriage for the other at the time 
marriage and vice-versa. 


This lady wilt have her marriage in Jupiter dasa Rahu bhukthi 
Rahu anthra. In her chart Rahu gives the result of Mars. Saturn, 
Jupiter, Sun and Mercury while in the male chart Saturn, Mars 
and Mercury are the ruling Planets. Now the marriage for the 
male will take place in Jupiter Dasa Rahu Bukthi Mars anthra 


Lf _ ASTRO SECRETS * 


Venus scokshma. Rahu gives the result of Jupiter, Saturn ind 
Moon (Saturn and Moon are inthe constellation of same Lord of 
and in the same Sub while the above are found among the ruling 
Planets at bith in her chart. Hence it is evident that the Lords of 
the conjoined periods of marriage are directly or indirectly found 
among her ruling Planets at birth and vice-versa. 


Earlier from the chart of this gentleman. t have discussed 
about his partner. Investigations vevelaed that this lady is one of 
the twins as discussed earlier. As the Sub Lord of the ascendant 
is Venus, she should be the younger of the twins and the Sub 
Lord or the ascendant of the elder of the twins should be Mercury. 


This has been confirmed. 


Even though the information given to me about the interval 
between the births of the twins was 10 minutes the rectified 
horoscopes according to KP showed an interval difference of 6 
minutes 55 seconds. 


From the male charttoo, | have made the interesting finding 
that the interval between the births of the twins is 6 minutes 55 
seconds due to the longitudinal difference between the Planets 
Venus and Mercury, which are the Sub Lords of the ascendants 
of the twins. As the destiny shows certain interrelations between 
the horescopes of this male and that of the younger of the twins, 
infer that he will definitely get married to the younger of the twins 
during the period mentioned by me above. 


(The marriage between the above two, took place on 25.5. 74).

stellar astrology is scientific. Every Bhava cuspal subBlord what 
it signifies, that signifying qualities are stored in those Bhavas. This is 


the fundamental and basic sacred rule of Stellar Astrology. 

Bhava Sublord, how it is connected with other Bhava is a 
very important thing to make note of. For example if the Ill cuspal 
sublord by its strong signification to Ill Bhava, birth of a younger 
brother is derived at. The same said Ill bhava if chara, for chara 
the 11° House becomes badhakashthana — when this 11" if 
emerged as Lagna Rasi. If the cuspal sublords are found to be 
the same planet, difference of opinion will be there between the 
native and the younger brother. They have to live separately. 


The meaning of what said in the above para is, a planet 
should not be Bhava Sublord for several bhavas, as they will 
prove to be harmful. 


An example chart is given: as above. 


- KRISHNAMUATI Pablibiall = A? 


3 cusp sublord is Rahu (Chara rasi). 
1" cusp sublord is Rahu. 
For 3° - 4 is 11*- which is badhakasthana. 


As HRahu is a strong significtor of 3'* - younger brother was 
born. In due course, Dasa/Bukthi periods the brothers had 
difference of opinion and they are now living separately. 


V bhava sublord is Saturn (Udhaya Rasi) 


X| bhava which is 7* to V is a badhakasthahana (ubhaya 
rasi) whose sublord is also Saturn. 


The Native and the elder brother stands divided. To earn 
profits, the Native joined hands with elder brother of his wife (11° 
house - friends or very close relatives) in a business, and had a 
heavy financial loss. VIl Sub lord is also Sat - which please note. 


A bhava sublord and its badhakasthana to Bhava sublord - 
if they are the same planet or closely connected to badnhakasthana 
bhava sublord - that Bhava matters are very much affected. This 
is the meaning | wish to convey. 


Please Read Further : IV Reader - Page 145 


Sri KSK says - One important factor which readers should 
note is that if a planet happens to be the significator of any of the 
houses, 2,7 and 11 and it itself happens to be the strong single 
Significator of the sixth house, it will not give the marriage even 
though it is a significator of 2 or 7 or t1 as the sixth house is 
separation from wife, if already married. When such is the case, 
how can it givé marriage. 


What is meant by Sublord - The Primary approach. 


When Planets are nine, what is this Sublord set up in KP 
What is this confusion. The traditional method Astrologers 
become confused. Therefore it is our duty to explain. 


AR «ASTRO SECRETS 


We pass through a street. In front of the houses we see the 
name Boards Gopal, Sundaram, Raman and So on. That is those 
house belong to Gopal, Sundaram and Raman? which goes 
without saying. In the same manner sublords means a place 
allotted to the Sublord. 


In a family Sundaram is the first Son : the family constructs 
some houses and the houses are in the Sundaram compound. 
Then each houses belong to one of the brothers. In the Sundaram 
compound, the first house is allotted to Sundaram. The next 
house will go to the immediate next brother. Like wise the rest ot 
houses. In all it is Sundaram compound. 


In some oth2: family some on else is the first son. Another 
compound and in it the first son gets the first house. Second 
son gets th second house and so on, the allotrrents are made. 


This is another, this is Krishna - this is Babu - means houses 
allotted to them. Now cenie to the Planet Aswini is one 
compound. In it 9 Houses are constructed. First house belongs 
to Kethu, next house to Venus and the next house to Sun. 
Therefore compound is Kethu compound i.e. Kethu Star. Houses 
means Sublords or Lord of the Sublord. Do you understand 
now’? Now the Star is taken as Dasa and the Sublord is taken as 
bukthi. 


Let us take it as a person born in Venus Dasa - Saturn bukthi. 
Moon who informs Dasa is in the Venus compound andin Saturn 
house (not Makara/Kumba}, that is we should understand it as, 
the person born in Venus Star and Saturn Sub. Is it only for Moon 
? No - other Planets in the similar manner will be in some 
compound and in some house. We will look into this owt of 
Sheer interest. In case there is no interest iet us find whether 
there is a benefit.

For karkata Lagna Mercury belongs to 3 and 12” house and is 
posited in 8" (In Kumbha). This Mercury house (sublord) is 
occupied by Mars. For this jathaka, though Mars belongs to 
improving houses, this Mars entered the Rahu compound, and 
sat in the house of Mercury a malefic. What to do? He is there

secrets. 


Ifthe same set up be as tt is and be a Simha Lagna, Mercury 
is Lord of 2 & 11, Mars in the Mercury Sub will shower material 
benefits. Planets are on the move continuously. What is important 
is in which Star and Sub they are posited. According to Lagna 
they give a changed result. You need not at all take into account 
the State (Averstha) and Placement Position (Sthana). Moving 
and posited at the same place and at the same timings. they are 
able to offer good and bad results.

SUB -LORDS WHO DIVERTS THE DASA LORDS } 


LATE SRI. KUDANTHAI NATHAN. 


When ever may be the type of Astrological Magazines, 
readers evince interest on their respective Rasi Gochara Palas. 
Most of the readers do not read the articles and on this ! use to 
feel very much sorry for them. It used to be my desire that readers 
should evince interest to read the articles just to know what theses 
articles say about. 


Readers the moment they see the Bhava/Gruha Sputa. They 
feel allergic. Still further this K.P system and its sublords are a 
further confusion to them. After all what is in this K.P system 
should they not show a small intrest? 


Our Ceylone friend Mr. V.A. Sivapadnam, by this K.P System 
Will boldly tell well in advance that a particular card alone can be 
picked at a given moment of time. 


Mr. N.Mohan Rangam, our Madras friend will tell in advance 
about the date & timings of return of the missing person. 
Kalancheri Brothers Seshadri Vedhachalam will foretell what child 
Will be born on what date. Thus those who study K.P system will 
foretell of events to occur on particular dates. Should not all of 
you know about this K.P which holds many surprises. So far no 
one has developed or found such a type of Astrology. 


Inthis chart Moon, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn & Mercury 6 planets 
having connection to different Bhavas, in particular has strong 
signification to 8" Bhava Sub - Lord is Sun. Sun is in the star of 
Rahu, who is in the 3°.Bhava and therefore he is strong significator 
of the Gn Bhava.

Therefore Planets Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn and 
Mercury when attacking the 8" House, the Sub - Lord Sun holding 
his powers fo the 3° Bhava only, diverts the 6 planet's powers 
tolally. 3° House tells one's easy paltern of life. During some 
moments, ditliculties might have been experienced, and still sitting 
under the fan and by contact over phone earnings are made in 
hundreds daily. 


The 8" Bhava indicates, in our life, big disappointments, Jail, 
punishments, accidents. But if the Sub-Lord gets strong 
signification for any one Houses of 1,2,3,6,10. “a person need 
not at all worry about, whatever may be the Dasa is on or to 
come. The Sub-Lord gets the power to divert the results of the 
Dasa Lord. And therefore a Planet of its independent powers 
over Bhava results can not effect it independently. That particular 
Bhava Cusp Sublord having power to ettect results for a particular 
Bhava alone has to be implemented by the Dasa Lord. 


® KRISHNAMURIL PADHDHA'I « 53 


We will now look at another example - in this chart. Mars 
Lord of 5 and 10 in 6 has Bhava signiticator for 4,5,6,8and 17. 
Respectively the sublords Rahu for 2 & 8 Venus for 3a, Jupiter 
48.11. Sun 3° and Venus 3 House significations are operating. 
Mars has the Bhava signification for Houses 4,5,6,8,11. But the 
oublord has signification for 2,3,4,8 & 41 Houses. Therefore the 
Bhava signification to 5" and 6" Houses by Mars is lost ie., 
Mars loses the Bhava signification over 5" and 6" Houses. And 
therefore Mars is permitted to offer the results of 2,3,4 & 11 
Houses only. 


Planetory positions and Dasa/Bukthi will be similar in many 
birth chart. In the charts of twins it will be 100% similar even then 
in the gap of afew seconds, itis the Bhava Sub-Lords that decides 
the i'fe span events. This is what we have to realise. The secret of 
KP system lies in the Bhava sputa. To say this period is Suba 
Dasa or Asuba Dasa or such & such Bhava Lord Dasa, is all an 
eye-wash. No Planet is Malefic and no Planet is Benetic. 


Benetic or Malefic, we should understand that if a Bhava 
Sublord gets the Bhava signification of Houses 1,2,3,610,11 they 
will give only good results. 


Once while talking to Mithuna our Trichy friend, he raised a 
doubt. That was - in KP system 11” Bhava indicates fulfilment of 
one's desires (House of ambition}. But the same 11" House is 
taken as Badhakasthan for Sara lagna persons. How to reconcile. 
This char is a Sara Lagna one. 


some of our relatives, attend the marriage function in our 
House. As our guests, it is certain one day they will take leave of 
us. Some leave bidding good-bye. And some leave without 
informing us as a matter of courtesy. Thus with a smile | informed 
him that those who leave without informing us belongs to the 
category of Saralagna persons. Mr. Midhuna probably did not 
understand what I told, requested me to elaborate a little further.

11° Bhava fulfills the desires of any particular Lagna. For 
Sara Lagna the fulfilment is of the in-wards be’ onging to .nre (soul) 
Athma. This Athma desires to leave the physical body without 
informing. Whereas in the case of Sthira & Ubaya Lagna 11* 
Bhava fulfilment of the desires of the physical body is had by 
threatening. 


In this particular chart 11" Bhava Sublord is Jupiter. Note 
how it is positioned. Jupiter is in the 10°. Therefore 
Bhadakasthana loses its strength. That is 107 is Vraya 12" to 
11*. This position gives a long life to the Native. Therefore KP 
system is the Master key to open the door and reveal the secrets 
of Man's life. 


Pranams to Guruji KSK.

ASCENDANT LAGNA 


Ascendant / Lagna 


For a given birth time - date and place of birth your are 
preparing a horoscope, of course under the Placidus system 
and also using the KSK Ayanamsa. Now the horoscope prepared 
iS as per KA where in the Sublords- whether cuspal or planet 
oub lords it is the Sub lords alone that speaks. When that is so, 
the horoscope has to be 100% correct otherwise your predictions 
will also be otherwise, that is it will go wrong. 


Therefore when the birth time is given it is the duty of any 
astrologer to verify the data given to him in a 3 phase manner. 
such as: 


1. Verification of the birth time given 
2. Correction of the birth time given. 
3. Then to fix the correct position of Lagna. 


The three objectives are explained by Guruji Sri K.S.K In the 
VI Reader from pages 134 to 142. 


You as a KP students know well, Guruji was a space shuttle 
with a speed for 3 minutes to the Zodiac & back. That is no - 
stop and point to point. We are not in his wavelength. 


Next, his intelligent students belong to the category of super 
fast Trains. They also will not be of much help to us to learn 
about the correct Lagna position, in a slow and steadly manner. 


Then what shall we do? We shall travel by passenger trains. 
Why? Because Passenger I rains stop at all stations and super 
fast trains stop at all signals. 


In arriving at the correct position of Lagna, for Guruji it was 
almost a hat-trick, because he was Supra-Conscious with RP as 
the tool. 


* RRISHNAMUR PaDHDHAaT! + 57 


We students also have the RP? But as beginners we are 
groping in the dark at Sub - conscious level. That is we are ina 
sleeping mood. Naturally we are Unable to take stock of the RP 
Therefore we should make all efforts to shake off this slumber 
and come to the conscious world of RP, to know the Real truth of 
RP. Then you are guided from one truth to the next truth, that is 
God helps you in a mysterious way. 


To arrive at the correct Lagna position, we as students our 
1 First thinking should be at hypothetical level. 
(Hypothesis = Supposition made as basis for reasoning). 


At this hypothetical as a beginner you are in a dilemma to 
select the correct sign from the RP you have made at the 
commencement of preparing the horoscope and the FP at birth 
of the native for the given time. 


Here the only remedy available is to go by birth time 
verification. 


2. Second thinking or the next steps is to be at the theoretical 
level. 


(Theoretical = concerned with knowledge but not with its 
practical application). A} One set of Theory as told by Sri K.S.K is 
reproduced from V Reader page vill - read. 


Another reasons is really the most appealing. If one takes 
the pre-natal epoch, it will be seen that the Moon's position at 
the time ofthe birth in the chart is exactly the ascendant (Lagna) 
at the time of the spoch in 50% of the cases. So, at the time of 
epoch, a particular part of the Zodiac rose in the East. After 
roughly $9 months when the Moon transits in that position birth 
takes place. Similarly that particular part of the Zodiac, which 
rose at the time of the birth called the ascendant or Lagna was 
exacily {he same position of the Moon atthe time of the epoch of 
the child. Thus, Hindu sages compare the relative positive position 


Sah * ASTRO STCRETS = 


of the ascendant (Lagna) at the time of the epoch is the Moor's 
position in the birth chart. As the child grows from the time of .he 
epoch, it would be really more appropriate and correct to take 
that into consideration. This may convince everyone. 


b) Another set of theory, again as told by Sri K.S.K is that an 
event is anything that will happen or likely to happen and it is a 
continuous process explaing the vedantic "Karma theory". The 
ruling Planets at the time of judgement (present) will be the same, 
that was at the time of sproutting of the seed (9 months before) 
but translocated. 


Here we are touching the 100% correct level which Guruji 
want you to arrive af. 


The above ts supported by an article from M.G.G.Nayar. the 
entire article is reproduced. Please note para 6 which reads as 
below: 


3. The practical application level. 


"We have seen that, if a chart is accurate the Sublord of the 
Cusp of the Lagna will be connected with the Janma-nakshatra 
of the native. Venus owns the Sub Lord the Cusp of the Lagna of 
the nativity. She is in the constellation of Saturn and the Sub of 
Jupiter. Both Saturn and Jupiter are aspecting the Moon. Venus 
is in trine aspect (116 58’) with the Moon. (Venus and Moon are 
in association in scorpio Navamsa). Venus the sublored of the 
Cusp of the Lagna is thus well connected with Saturn and the 
Moon. The native's janmanakshata is pushyam (Saturn's Star in 
Moon's sign). 


4. Our third thinking or the next step is to be at the academic 
level. (Academy place of study - learning, or place of special 
training). 


5. Our fourth thinking, which is the final step is to be again at 
the practical level to arrive and fix the correct Lagna position 
meaning, you have arrived at the correct sign-Star Sub of the 


KAISHNAMLUAT] PapHouari « Ho 


Ascendant/Lagna. Have you? Some time Yes and at some times 
No. 


At the practical level , the Sub has to be true in all respects 
upto the Sub-Sub level. This means you are correcting the Lagna 
Sub atthe Zodiac level and not on the watch level from which the 
birth time was noted, verified and corrected. You have to surpass 
or supercede the so called Sub which you think the you have 
atrived at correctly. The available guide lines are listed below: 


1. The first guide line is you should look to the meridian 
colei itself, that is the 10 th Cusp, which does not change or 
move fast. The 10 th Cusp will give enough room to bring the 
Lagna Sub very correctly, which Lagna Sub will be the very Star 
of the native at birth. Why sould we depend on the 10th Cusp. 
Because in changing or correcting the Lagna Sub, if you are not 
alert, a few of the other cusps subs will also change and such 
subs may not be the other cusps subs will also change and such 
subs may not be correct. If you take the help of MC it means you 
have prepared the chart strictly in accordance to Placidus system. 
Link the profesion, when the native started his livelinood that is 
job or business or farming and so on the change he might have 
had according to Dasa bukthi. 


Birth Time Correction 


Correction : By late Sri. M.PShanmugham during delivery 
time, the birth time is no doubt noted, but the correctness of the 
time of birth of the child, becomes doubtful as the delivery time 
is full of anxious moments due to several reasons. If it is a 
casesserean birth a Doctor who is busy in removing the child, 
how can we expect him or his staff to tell the time, when the baby 
is placed on earth? And no one is allowed inside the operation 
theatre. 


Therefore it becomes the duty of the astrologer to correct 
the given birth time if necessary 


60 . ASTRO SACRETS * 


Here is an example chart. 
The birth time given is 10.30 p.m. night 


Correct birth time theory is, Lagna Sub Lord in whose 
constellation it is deposited, should indicate the Moon Sign cr 
the birth Star of the native. In both the cases it is a correct one. 


siill to be very correct Lagna Sub Lord should tell the birth 
star of the native. If Rahu or Kethu happens to be the agent o: 
that Star Lord, then Lagna Sub Lord in whose constellation it is , 
that Star Lord should be connected to Rahu/Kethu. 


In this example chart, the birth time given is 10.30 p.m. No 
correction is required. Lagna Sub Lord is saturn. saturn does 
not tell the birth Star or the Moon sign. Then how do we say the 
birth time is correct. 


Saturn is in the Star Kethu. Kethu is in Meena. Mocn is in 
Jupiter Star. Kethu represents Jupiter. Therefore Lagna Sub Lord 
Saturn being in the Star of Kethu, Kethu connects both the Moon 
sign as well as the birth Star. Hence birth time given 10.30 p.m. is 
correct. 


Taking it for granted 10.30 p.m. birth time is not correct, we 
have to bring the Lagna Sub Lord as Jupiter, making the birth 
time as 10.15 p.m. So that Lagna Sublord Jupiter and in Jupiter 
sign Moon is there. Therefore 10.15 p.m. is also correct. 


But Jupiter is in the Star of Mrigasira, Kethu is ar.ent for 
Jupiter. This Mrigasira - Star Lord is in no way tells Moo isign or 
birth Star. 


Therfore 10.15 p.m. as birth time will not be correct.

( LAGNA DETERMINATION } 


(LATE SRI. N.KRISHNAMURTHY) 


A person near Thiruthani 13°15N,. Geographic Lattitude 79°40" 
E 13.09 51 N Geocentric Lattitude met me on 11.10.1978 during 
noon 12.30. He said he was born on 20.5.1949, Friday night 
between 10 p.m. and 11 .p.m.and he was unable to know whether 
his Lagna is Makara or Dhanus. He also had a fair knowledge in 
KF and for this reason he wanted to be with me and learn how a 
correct Lagna is determined. | therefore decided to solve his 
problem immediately. 


Noon 12.30 p.m. - Wednesday - 11.10.1978 
Ruling Planets are Day Lord - Mercury. 
Day Lord - Mercury 


Rahu is in Kanya of Mercury. Therefore Rahu is stronger than 
Mercury. 


Moon is transiting in Sravana Star in Makara Rasi. Lagna is 
raising in Dhanus - Poorvashada Star, Jupiter is a RR Meena, 
the House of Jupiter, is occupied by Kethu, therefore Kethu is 
stronger than Jupiter. 


lf you consider 10 p.m. as birth time, Lagna will be rising in 
Dhanus, 25-6-36. That is Jupiter sign - Venus Star - Mercury 
Sub — Rahu Sub - Sub. 


lf you consider 11 p.m. as birth time, Lagna will be rising in 
Makara 10-06-18. That is saturn sign - moon Star - Moon Sub - 
Mars Sub - Sub. 


Lagna raising at 10.p.m. on Jupiter - Venus - Mercury Rahu 
tallies with RP Jupiter - Venus - Mercury Rahu Rahu agent ter 
Mercury. This seems to be satisfactory. Lagna raising at +1 p.m. 
level | on Saturn - Moon - Moon - Mars. Mars is not found in the 


6+ . ASTRO SEOREIS = 


RPs - the tally will not be there. Inspite of it, at the time of analysis 
Moon was in Sravana in Makara. Therefore it is possible for the 
Lagna to be in Makara - Sravana Star. And as the RP Lagna was 
in Jupiter -Venus, itis equally possible for the Lagna at birth to 
be in Dhanus. This person is employed in Revenue Department. 
From this view point his birth Lagna may fall in Dhanus. 


In the RPs Jupiter and Venus are stronger thansaturnand 
Moon. To get rid of this tricky situation a Horary Number was 
asked. The constultant opened a book and informed the number 
as 14.No.11 means - Mesha Rasi - Venus Star - Sun Sub. There 
is no Venus Star - in Makara Rasi. Hence Lagna to be Dhanus 
was determined. Further we must make one more thing a little 
clear 


His Star at birth is Sathabisha. Star Lord is Rahu. Rahu is not 
directly placed in RR Mercury is Day Lord. Therefore Rahu was 
taken in, as an agent of Mercury. Birth Moon in Kumbha in Rahu 
Star. Therefore Saturn, Rahu, Mercury the three shouldbe 
eliminated from RPs. The remaining left is Jupiter Kethu -Venus 
and Moon the 4 Planets only. Kethu is Agent for Jupiter. 


It is now clear without a doubt, that birth Lagna is Dhanus. 
Such findings aré minutes in KP 


side by side another doubt will araise. Jupiter being in the 
RR and Kethu being agent for Jupiter. One has to give importance 
to moola Star of. Kethu. As Kethu has no ownership of any sign 
- this doubt is a natural one. To clear this doubt - No.11 was 
already had. No.11 has the Mars - Venus - Sun set up. That is tt 
indicates Venus Star. Therefore please be clear Lagna, will not 
fall in Moola Star. In case Lagna to fall in Moola Star this person 
could have met me only on a Thursday in a Moola Star. 


The Lagna Rasi and Star has now been determined. Further 
oub Lord and the Sub Sub Lord is to be arrived at without which 
the minute Lagna position and the birth time there of cannot be 
confirmed. The agent for Jupiter is Kethu who is the chief activist. 


* KRISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI « 65 


Though, Mcola - Kethu Star is in Dhanus, we have te Lagna in 
Venus and jupter in the order of the strength. Moon is weak in 
RR Saturn is still further a weak one in the RR But we have 
eliminated Saturn from the list of RPs. Therefore Moon will be 
Sub Sub Lord and Venus will be Sub Sub Lord. Accordingly the 
Lagna position in Dhanus will be 26°-9'-13". 


According to year and month - the Ayanamsa is 23-3-10. 
Therefore according to Sayana, Lagna will be raising in Makara 
on 19°-12°-23" as perthe day of birth and the latitude. According 
to this rising Lagna, the Sidereal time is 13 Hours 44 minutes 39 
seconds. 


From this, as the Date of Birth, the given sidereal time from 
5.30 p.m. which is 9-21-14 Is to be deducted. When deducted 4- 
23-25 is the sidereal interval. This sidereal time should now be 
converted to local mean time. At the rate of 9-8-296 seconds - 
43 seconds are to be deducted. Then the LMT is 4-22-42. Then 
add the difference between LMT and IST which is 11 Mts. 20 
Seconds and after adding it will be 4 hours 33 minutes 02 
seconds, which hours 30 minutes, when you arrive al 10 hours 4 
minutes 2 seconds, which is correct and minute birth time of the 
native. 


Importance of correct Birth Time: Sri M.GJaya seelan. 
Dharmapuri. 


When a prediction is to be made from a Natal Chart, the 
Astrologer must first check up whether the birth time given is a 
correct one. When the given birth time is correct then only a 
correct birth chart can be made. On a correct birth chart the 
readings made and the results will come correct. 


lf the given birth time is wrong, the planetary positions will 
not be correct, which leads to predictions that go wrong. 
Therefore it is natural that consultant will not have faith in astrology 
and in the astrologer. 


oo * ASTRO SECRETS 


In one and the same Lagna, when twins are born, we find 
their life Schedule is nor similar. In the traditional method, 
predictions are made, that are applicable to both of the twins. 
When we observe the varied life amongst the twins, through our 
research mind, truths are revealed. 


In our traditional method, when a horoscope is made, 
planetary positions are noted down according to Nakshathra 
Pada. This Nakshathra pada of the Planets do not tell us the 
correct picture of our analysis. Because the Planets are not 
recorded in Deg-Min-Seconds of the Zodiac. Vvhen that is so the 
predictions will be of approximate levels only. From this 
approximate levels, when readings are made we terribly miss 
the important Role played by 


Nakashathra adhipathi - Star Lord 
Bukthi Natha - Sub Lord 
Anthara Natha - Sub - Sub Lord 


As explained above, of the approximate level, which arises 
on account of the Nakshathra Pada, and which Is useful only to 
cover the Navamsa chart, no other pupose is served. Here what 
happens is, with all the efforts made to prepare a birth chart, we 
ourselves have ignored to find out which planet is moving in 
which contellation. 


Planets during their orbits, moving in a sign - in a Star ina 
Sub and in a Sub Sub that is Rasi - Nakshathra - bukthi Anthara 
Natha - are correctly recorded and then a reading made, then 
there will be no chance for a change in the predicted results, and 
no disappointments to the astrologers, as well as to the 
consultant. 


What is explained above is narrated by an example. Jupiter 
as a planet is transiting in Dhanus. Jupiler is the owner of Dhanus. 
Therefore Jupiter is transiting in his own House Dhanus. Let us 
say Lagna is also Dhanus. Therefore Lagna Lord is Jupiter. Now 
it is our routine thinking that Jupiter having ownership of Dhanus 


« KARISHNAMURT] PabHDMATL ¢ GF 


and stationed in Dhanus and also a strong benefic will offer all 
the good results as Lagna Lord. This is how we make a general 
conclusion. Agreed. 


In this example chart Jupiter transiting in Dhanus Rasi let us 
say it is on 16-53-20. That is Jupiter moving on Poorvashada 
otar, the Lord of which is Venus. Therefore the Star Lord of the 
transiting Jupiter is Venus. Therefore the Star Lord of the transiting 
Jupiter is Venus. Every Star has the command area of 13°.20° 
under it and this area of 13°.20' is ruled by 9 Planets. One of 
these 9 Planets that rule this 13°.20° area over which a planet is 
transiting, decides the bukthi - the Sub - of the said transiting 
planet - that is Sub period - bukthi period, Sub Lord all said in 
several ways io mean one and the same thing.

Now, why allow this confusion made by the author, Sir Jaya

Planet x is in the star of Y.

star Y has 9 bukthi lords -- Bukthy Y (Sub)

Bukthy CG (Sub) 
Bukihy D (Sub} 


on * ASTRO ATCRITS « 


Bukthy E (Sub) 
Bukthy F (Sub) 
Bukthy G (Sub) 


* 


In KP we say Planet X is under the sway of Y The author 
says Planet Y holds the Planet X under its control. Similarly the 
subs of Planet Y holds the Planet X under its control. Therefore 
every Sub of Planet Y has the Planet X under its control and 
there by forms the Bukthi of Planet X. 


The author speaks - continues 


Therefore the 9 Bukthi lords - the 9 Sub Lords who rule the 
total period and these 9 bukthi lords who keep the transiting 
Planet X under its control, by themselves in the Vimshothari Dasa 
order froms the bukthi Lords / Bukthi periods of the transiting 
Planet X. 


All explained above will help you to understand when we 
talk about Singificators. 


Author continues :- 


s explanied above in the example chart Planet Jupiter moving 
in dhaus on 16-43-20-Jupiter is in the Star of Venus Pooravashada 
- that is under the Star Lord Venus - in the Sub of Moon and in 
the Sub Sub of Mercury. Hence for Jupiter Venus is the Star Lord. 


Moon is the Sub Lard. 
And Mercury is the Sub Sub Lord. 


Again therefore, when Venus Moon Mercury were conjointly 
ruling the area 16-53-20 in Dhanus, in that are we find Jupiter 
transiting. 


That is a Planet X will first offer the results of its Star Lord, 
Star Lord and Sub Sub Lord. 


| KRESHNAMURT! Panuosadi + 69 


secondly it (Planet X)} will offer the result of the House it 
occupies. 


Thirdly it (Planet X) will offer the results of the House or 
Houses it owns. 


This will be the next turning point and another stepping sotre 
in KP 


So much so Jupiter of this example chart, even though he 
had the maximum strength by occupation and ownership of 
Dhanus he (Jupiler) is compelled to offer the results of 6-11 from 
Lagna - which resulls are fo be offered by Venus, then the 8 
House result of the Moon 7-10 Houses of Mercury in the first 
instance. In the second instance and third instance this Jupiter 
will offer the result of the first House for the reason it has occupied 
and the fourth House as this Jupiter has the ownership right. 


As per this example chart Jupiter as and when it has to offer 
the results of 6-8 you can easily realise how it will be. Further the 
Star Lord and or Sub Lord of Planet, if any are hidden in 6-8-12. 
the results will not be favourable. 


Again therefore Jupiter of this example chart even though it 
had the strength by occupation - that is positional strength - the 
resluts it has to offer will be unfavourable. 


Before we proceed further, | want you students to make note 
of the planet Jupiter, and how it behaves that is the behaviour of 
the planet Jupiter alone has been dealt with we have not touched 
the Sub and its Role, htat is Role of the Sub, which is the final say 
as favourable or unfavourable. 


The author continues.... 


Results, planetary set ups etc., all are based from Lagna. 
Therefore to fix the correct Lagna position, the correct birth time 
has to be worked - out properly. This is very very important. Few 
of the consultant, knowingly or unknowingly do not tell the correct 


Th " ASTRO s0CCROTS 


birth time. Or they say, they were born at a particular time and 
they are not aware of the correctness. They request the Astrologer 
to set right. Therefore 1 am giving an example to determine the 
correct birth time. 


Verification and determination of birth time 
Example - date of birth 7.9.1932 
Time of birth : 6.30 a.m. roughly. 


The above Date and Time of birth was taken up for analysis 
on 18.9.90 at 12.45 Noon - 11.39 N 78-12 E 


Ruling Planets- 

Day Lord - h:niter (thurday) 

Moon star Lord - Kethu (Moola) 

Moon sign Lord - Jupiter (Dhanus) 
Lagna Sign Lord - Jupiter (Dhanus). 
Lagna Star Lord - Venus (Poorva Shada) 


Therefore ruling planet at the time of commencing the 
analysis are Venus, Kethu, Jupiter. 


RP at analysis time will be the RP at birth time. The native was 
born in the month of Sravana which will be roughly from August 
14™ September 14 of the corresponding English dates - roughly. 


The birth was 6.30 a.m. roughly. Therefore Lagna rising will 
be in simha only. As explained above when the RPs Venus, Kethu, 
Jupiter are ruling conjointly as track area, at a particular time, at 
that time only Lagna must have been Kethu bukthi/Sub, Jupiter 
Anthara/Sub-Sub, the Lagna cught to have been rising. In simha 
Rasi on 25-53-20 over Venus star the Kethu bukthi / Sub 
commences. In Kethu bukthi - Jupiter anthara /SUb Sub area is 
from 26-19-47 to 26-26-00. Therefore Lagna ought to have been 
rising during this interval period only. 


KRISHNAMURTI Papipuati « 71 


To repeat the same thing again - 


In simha Rasi - Venus star on 25-53-30 Kethu Sub begins 0- 
26-27 - that is 26-19-47 to 26-26-00. Jupiter Sub Sub falls, during 
this antharadhithay/Sub Sub interval time of Jupiter Sub Sub only 
Lagna must have been rising. 


The table of Houses is in sayana spata. Therefore add KSK 
ayanams 22.54.58 to the rising Lagna 26.19.47 in simha. Now 
you get sayana Lagna spata 19-14-45 in kanya Rasi. 


As per tables of Houses - the sidereal time. 


Sidereal time Lagna rising 
5-20 19.58-00 Kanya Rasi 
5-16 18.58-00 Kanya Rasi is arrived at. 


Therefore Lagna takes 4 minutes to cross 1.00.00. Therefore 
the Lagna sputa rising on 19.14.14 in Kanya, the Siderial times 
must be worked out. 


For 18.58.00 Kanya Rasi sid. Tme 5.16 
In Kanya Rasi from 18,58.00te 19.14.45the intervel is 0.76.45 


Therefore 1 or 60 minutes is transitted by Lagna in 4 minutes, 
Therefore 0.16.45 is transitted by Lagna in 0 Hr- 1 Mt. 7 seconds. 


Therefore 18.58 in Kanya, the sid. Time being 5.16 


For 19.14.45 in Kanya the sid. Time will be 5.16.00 


+ 0.01.07

The native who gave his approximate birth time is a leading 
lawyer and also a family friend. He stated that as he did not know 
his birth time, his mother in the world of manes was called through 
spirit medium - a lady - and his mother replied through that lady 
and said the birth time was 6.30 a.m. He furhter wanted to Know

the matter. | threw my lot on god and arrived a the birth time

Conclusion:- 


The above article is in Tamil has been translated and 
reproduced. This article was brought to my attention by Sri 
N.Sundareson, K.P Student. In this article the author has dealt 
with verification and determination of birth time, as a matter of 
routine. 


Going through this article, KP student can understand that 
the author is at ease as he explains about the behaviour of Planets, 
but he has strained you for what? Not without a purpose. The 
purpose is - that you can think of planet wise Dasa - bukthi 
Similar to the one you make the Udu Maha Dasa at birth.

LATE SRI KUDANTHAS NATHAN * 


In KP if the birth time differes even by aminute, several Bhava 
cusps will change. Ifthe Sublord chage, everything will undergo 
a total change. Several details of a horoscope are studied only 
through these Sub lords and not from the Planets as found in the 
horoscope. The Planets offer results only through Sub lords and 
these planes do not have any freedom to offer any result of their 
own. This observation is the most vital point that We have to 
understand very clearly without a doubt. 


For example let us say - Rahu is the significator of the 10° 
Bhava. Rahu Das is also on. Let Jupiter be the significator of 6" 
and Mercury be/significator of 1 1". We also will have the workings 
that job opportunities will be during Rahu Dasa, Jupiter bukthi. 
Mercury Anthara. Will there be a job waiting for’ 


How to proceed? Carefully study this 10" Cusp - Sub Lord. 
Let us say it is Saturn. If he said Saturn is in 12” and also gets the 
power to operate Houses 5, 8, 9, 12then the native will not serve 
in a job - even for a 24 hours period. He will not get a job. Even 
if he gets a job, he will lose it. Every day or time he will undertake 
a job, only to kick it of. This will be his life time experience 


The frame and axis of the 10° House is very much * polled. 
Of what use to know which dasa is on. This birth char if it has 
Rahu as the 10'" Sub - sure of a job - yes confirmed. N > hurdles 
in the job. Because this Rahu has the power to operate the 10". 
Therefore while erecting a birth chart, chances are more for 
mistakes, when this 10" Cusp ts to rise in cancer on 3° or 4°. 
Hence when we ovect a birth chart we must see to it. that every 
Bhava Cusp Sub is arrived at properly by correcting the given 
birth time. 


« KRISHNAMURTI PARHUEHATI « 73 


Few of the consultants do not wish the birth time correction. 
We have to pily them, because many in general do not know, 
whal is the meaning of birth time. In short | am explaining the 
same. As long as the child is in the womb of the mother, child is 
not an independent being. Till birth the lungs are in a folded 
condition, like a shrunk ballon. Immediately after birth, the 
unbilical chaord is cut and even before the breathing air enters 
the lungs, the diaphram starts pulsating. The baby born makes 
its first cry. The time of this first cry of the child is the birth time. 
How many have recorded this time correctly. At the nursing 
homes even on a two munutes difference, of the child births one 
is male and the other is female. When that is so of what use it will 
be to depend on the traditional apporach of Gender timing - that 
is three kaia and purusha kala. 


It is here, KP helps us in an easy way to find out the correct 
birth time. 


When you start erecting a birth chart, first you should make 
out the ruling Planets - which are day Lord, Moon, Rasi Lord, 
Moon star Lord, Lagna Rasi Lord, and Lagna Star Lord - these 
five persons, that is the five ruling Planets should be inserted in 
to the birth time Lagna rising. Such an inserted Lagna rising - at 
what time it rises - that time is the birth time and not the birth 
time given to the astrologer by the consulting public, which please 
note. 


Example : birth details 

20/21/8/1976 - 3.40 a.m. (Night) Madras. 

Chart erected on 6.8.1981 Thursday 1.30 p.m. Madras. 
Day Lord - Jupiter (Thursday) 

Moon Rasi Lord - Venus (Thula) 

star Lord - Mars (Chithrai) 

Lagna Rasi Lord - Mars (Vrischika) 

star Lord Jupiter (Vishaka) 


76 TANSTRO SECRETS 


On an average thinking, approximately Moon has to be toe 
Lagna Lord. But Moon is not in the RR nothing to worry. Mercury 
is also not in the RP Therefore Lagna is not Mithuna. The birth 
star of the child is mrigasira. As on today Moon is still moving in 
chithra. Therefore we can take Moon as Lagna Lord. The ruling 
Planets are Rahu, Jupiter/Mars, Venus only. Accordingly we can 
set Jupiter as Lagna star Lord, Mars as Sublord, and Venus as 
sub Sub Lord - which will form on 1.08 rising in cancer. The 
rising time for this 1.08 in cancer will be the birlh time of the child 
- that is at madras - late night 20/21.8.1976) - 3.37 a.m. will be 
the birth time. Now there is a 3 minutes difference. Will not this 3 
minutes change several cuspal Sub lords.

/ADVANCED STELLAR ASTROLOGY AND h 
THE 9" CUSP SUBLORD J 


{LATE SRI KUDANTHAI NATHAN) 


Sun, Jupiter and Venus - the three Planets are mainly 
responsible for the birth of human Beings. It is an established 
scientific fact that Sun while miying in the star or Sub of the other 
two Planets Jupiter and Venus, the birth rate has been found to 
be on the increase. Sun, Jupiter and Venus - almost the three 
Planets as they move in each others star or Sub, during such 
days the birth rate has been found to be on the increase. 


sun is Athma Karaka - Chief significator of soul. 
Jupiter is puthrakaraka - chief significator of child birth. 
Venus is kamakaraka - chief significator of Sex pleasure 


i have observed that in the star or Sub of the 9m Sub Lord, Sun or 
Jupiter or Venus has been found transiting at the time of birth. Threfore 
if you find the 9" Sub Lord under the said circumstances, please 
understand, that the horoscope set is a correct one to the minute. Let 
us take an example - of a birth on 28.1.1964 at 14.00 Hrs. (Noon) 


Planet Star Lord Sub Lard 
oun Moon Jupiter 
Jupiter Mercury Venus 
Venus Jupiter Jupiter 


We will now array the Planets that can arrive as 9" Sub Lord 
they are Moon, Mercury - Jupiter - Venus. 


Rahu is in mithuna and Kethu is in Dhanus. Hence Rahu or Kethu 
can emerge as 9” Sub Lord. Incase they do not, then Sun, Jupiter or 
Venus - one amongst the three can emerge as 9" Sub Lord. 


On our above working, which are the Planets stand excluded? 
They are Mars and Saturn. Here onw thing we have to keep in 
our mind. li this Mars and Saturn if found in the star or Sub of 


Th = ASTRO SECRETS 


sun or Jupiter or Venus, we have to include them also, for the 
reason, they are linked similar to. the twice which also has the 
sweet smell because cf the flower. There is no other alternative. 


Let us loo to the Mars, Saturn position as on 28.1.1S.us: 


Star Lord Sub Lord 


Mercury 
Mercury 


in this Jupiter is transiting in the Mercury star - revathy. As 
such Mars and satrun become eligible to be the 9° Sub Lord. 
When all the 9 Planets are found eligible to be the 9" Sub Lord, 
then the KP student must have nothing but confusion. It if here 
the ruling Planets give us the helping hand. All the 9 Planets will 
not appear in the RP. You can confirm the Lagna star Lord or the 
Moon star Lord as the 9" Sub Lord. At the time when this birth 
chart was erected, Moon was in RBadhra (Jupiter star) and the 
| agna was in the Hastha (Moon star}. Therefore, either Moon or 
jelter sets as 9" Sub Lord, then this birlh chart is a correct one. 


| Mars 
1 Saturn 


As for this horoscope the 9" Cusp falls in Sravana Star. As 
such, the 9" Sub can be fixed on the Moon star in the Moon Sub. 
If Jupiter is to be fixed as 9" Sub Lord, then you need another 20 
minutes for the sift. Hence Moon if set as 9° Sub Lord, the given 
birth time 2.00 p.m. will have to be corrected as 2.06 p.m. 


Ruling Planets are to Be made use of only when you have 
confusion in fixing the 9" Sub Lord. Otherwise you must give 
your full attention towards Lagna Sub Lord only. 


Even though this 9" Bava affair drags you in a big circle, one 
should understand that this 9" Cusp will help to a great extent 
about one's character, parentage, status, contorts and so on. 


If Jupiter is connected to this 9° Cusp Sub Lord the native 
will-have noble qualities. ff Venus is connected the native will be 
a pleasant personality. lf Mars, Saturn are connected the native 
will be rude, dull and so on.

1. You have prepared the birth chart very correctly. 


2. The Lagna Cusp Sub Lord in the birth chart of the Native, 
should tell the birth star of the Native correctly, in one way or the 
other. Such a Lagna Sub Lord that reveals, the birth star of the 
Native, and the birth chart prepared accordingly to that time is 
the true and correct birth time. 


3. The consulting public at times may tell a rough time. On 
such occasions when you correct the birth time, that birth time 
should be within the time given, by the public. 


4. Inthis birth chart the Lagna Sub Lord is Jupiter. The birth 
star of the Native is also Jupiter (Punarvasu)}. 


5. His birth Lagna star Lord is Venus {PPlaguni}. Lagna Sub 
Lord Jupiter is in the star of Venus. 


Therefore the birth time, as verified is true and correct to the

star - then Sub - the Sub Sub - then Sub Sub Sub Sub 
Dasa Bukthi Anthara sSookshama 


d) The birth Lagna Sub in which Sub it is - that Sub will be in 
Star - Sub - Sub Sub - Sub Sub Sub - here we must take the Sub 
- Sub Sub Sub - which should tell the birth Star. 


A birth has several stages like first cry, placed on earth 
(boopadhana) Siras Udhayam, Normal delivery, Caessarean and 
so on. Under such circumstances you cannot stick fo one method 
of thinking alone. 


As the birth Lagna Sub Lord has interconnection to the four 
levels as explained above, this Lagna Sub if it is in any manner 
touches the birth Star, that time is the correct birth time. You may 
have to work up to Sookshama level at times. 


In this birth chart, birth Lagna Sub Lord is Jupiter. His birth 
olar is Vishaka. Therefore the Lagna Sub Lord Is confirmed. ° 


Star -  Vishaka 
Rasi -  Thula 


« KRISHNAMURT! PapHDUATI « Bl 


As explained above the birth Lagna Sub Lord tells very clearly 
the birth Star. 


Next - Jupiter is in Mars Star - Mercury Sub in 1.37 Thula that is 
Jupiter is stationed in the same Thula Rasi. Planet Jupiter is in Mercury, 
Mercury Is in Vrischika - in 22.40 in Jyeshta Star - that is his own Star. 


Planet Jupiter in Mars Star. Mars is in cancer in 6.06 in 
Mercury Sub. 


Therefore birth Lagna Sub Lord Jupiter - tells the very birth 
star Jupiter. Jupiter is also stationed in Thula. Therefore Jupiter 
touches both Rasi and the birth Star. 


Next Jupiter is in Mars Star - Mer Sub. 
Jupiter's Sub is also Mercury. 


Mercury Is in his own Star - and Moon Sub - and Jupiter Sub 
Sub Sub (Sookshama) - thereby touching the Jupiter. 


Therefore all the 3 levels - that is - Lagna Sub Lord. 


Lagna Sub Lord in a constellation (Lord) or its Sublord are 
subjected to Mercury. 


Mercury is in Jupiter Sookshama. 
This is how we must proceed for birth time verification.

(THE TRIGONS } 
The Trigons —(Triplicity Of Signs}: 


Any Birth chart Traditional or KP Nirayana Bhava Chart the 
12 Bhavas are set in a Trigonal manner. Trigon means Trikona 
Basis. Trigons are as illustrated be!ow: - 


1-5-9 
2-6-10 
3-7-11 
4-B-12, 


Inthis Trigonal set up, several secrets are stored both to the 
advantage or disadvantage of the native. We can also probe our 
poorva punya of our previous birth from the present chart that is 
5" House. Similarly from the 9m House - which we call 
Baghysthana we will be able to know the luck factor and or the 
providential Help on which we can depend upon. Like wise 
several secrets are stored in this Trigonal set up. On this Trigonal 
set up only, the very Nadi Jyothisha emerged since the remote 
past. 


For easy understanding, the Trigonal set up is illustrated by 
a pictorial diagram. The illustration block has 3 rounds. 


10" House of the 1* round in the present picture is the 2na 
House of the previous birth and 6" House of the coming birth. 


That is 10" of last birth is the 6" House of this birth. 


olmilarly 


1* House of the 1* round in the present pictures is the 5" 
House of the previous birth and

1* ROUND 


PRESENT 
BIRTH 


2™" round Previous Birth 
3" round Future Birth 


9°" House of the coming birth - That is 9” of last birth is 5 
House of this birth. 


Advanced steller Astrology is the Nadi Astrology as pr 
pounded by our Guruji late Sri KSK, has incorporated the Trigon: 
set up where in he has applied his findings for queries |ike- 


1. Will politics suit me? 


=" KRISHNAMUATI PabapHali « F 


2. Can f become a Minister and so on, where in he has 
roped inthe 5" and 9" Houses. 


If you wish to suggest a remedy (parinara},the 1-5-9 houses 
should be strong. If they are weak any amount of parihara will 
not work. 


From this Trigonal set up of the horoscope, one can study 
the nature of a native from 1 -5-9Houses in the basis of "Athmanam 
puthreshu'-that is 


1* -ig the native himself 
5" -The House of children of the Native 
9" - the House of the Father of the Native. 


When a correct reading to know the nature of the Native is 
not clear, the 9" and 5ht will also help to reveal the in built nature 
of the Native. 


Keeping in mind, all said above , we can prepare a correct birth 
chart. Givena little clue by the consulting public, like date of marriage, 
date of certain minor or major accidents, disease and so on. 


Two articles from late Mr. Kudanthai Nathan are presented 
to further enlighten you-KP students.. 


If you look at the Trigonal set up of the natural Zodiac of the 
Kala Purisha- each of the Trigon at 120° Distance , is there to tell 
you several things .For example if you have Mesha -Simha and 
Dhanus as 10°” House in each of them you will invariably find an 
army man, a doctor ,a Barber, or beautician, a cook .a machinery 
man. lf you have Rishaba -Kanya -Makara-you will have all sorts 
of consumer goods originating from Agriculture and fs allied 
commodities. 


lf you have Mithuna - [hula - and Kumbha as 10” House 
you will find Trade and commerce in its full and the people, low 
and high working under it, through communication, 
advertisement , publicity and so on. 


Hes * ASTRO SLURLTS 


lf you have Karkata -Vrichika and Meena as 10" House you 
will have people working as sailors, or shopping , off-shore oil 
and natural gas ,fishners, Breweries, Boils ,port trust, Marine 
products, clearing and so on. 


All said above is for example and are very general . 


Careful study of the Trigonal houses, will help us to delineate 
results in a cogent manner, along with the sign, the planets there 
in, aspect , conjunctions and so on. From the study and the result 
there from may be favourable or otherwise. 


Foreasy understanding, | am going a little out of the way to 
explain about this Tr:gon, That is -say- 1-5-9 means the Native 
his children, His father - they come round and round -that is the 
present - The future and the past. 


We Hindus when we per form certain rituals monthly or yearly 
to our departed ancestors who are in the worlds of means 
(Pithrulokha ) and offer food to then through rice and gingelly 
with a little water. 


We first call our father and mother -Vasu Loka. Then the 
Grand farther and Grand mother - Rudra Loka then the Great 
Grand father and Great Grand Mother -Adhitya Loka" 


Other than Hindus, the entire world remembers their 
ancestors on a particular day and call it as All Souls Day. Your 
Grand father was the son of your great Grand father. 


Your father was the son of your grand father and you are the 
son of your father. This order will not apply to Mother's side. 


Your great grand mother was mother-in-law to your grand 
mother, 


Your grand mother was mother-in-law to your mother. And 
you are the son of your mother. 


+ KRISHNAMURTI Panitpiiart » 9 


Your paternal side corners the 1-5-9, but the maternal side, 
sides with their husbands as 1-7- that is husband and wife. That 
is paternal side is open secret(Nadi) but the maternal side is a 
closed secret(Nadi).if you wish to know some thing about Nadi 
reading, | suggest, you can be benefited trom Brighu Nadi, said 
fo be genuine, available at Hoshiarpur, Punjab. You can prepare 
your birth chart strictly according te KR and make the readings 
for the present, future, and past and compare it with Brighu Nadi, 
Most of your predictions will tally. This is only for kind information. 


Born to a father and mothe: - you are 50-50.That is your 
birth chart is on a 50-50 basis arranged in a Trigonal set up for 
good or bad. In this Trigonal set up have certain splits. That is for 
professions 2-6-10 are the Trigons .Butfor marriage you have to 
study 2-7-11 Houses and Houses 2-5-11 for child birth, 3-9-12 


For abroad and so on, all of these like Trigons having their 
MUSICAL,CHAIR, ROUND and round. 


To further enrich your Knowledge on these Trigons, KP 
students are requested to go through the book "A te 7 Horoscope 
Maker and Delineator “by LLEWKKYN GEORGE -Which reading 
will throw light on Trigons and the same reading are the modern 
version that you find in our Gurujis Advanced Stellar Astrology 
through 249 subs along with RPs, which are the present day 
Nadi Readings. 


The Trigons -the triplicity of signs - they are inter linked for 
good or bad. 

e.g. say 4-8-12. 4th is the Grave yard of the planets. 

Here you are keeping your wealth hidden. 

8" is the mystery house for good or bad. 

Through this you get unearned income. 

12” is the House of Vraya and also investment. 

1*is Life - Lightswitch ON

12” is Life - light switch off 

12" is go abroad- Life in new surroundings.

10" is name and fame - through a profession. 


6" is day to day service. With out service you cannot have

2nd iS Dhana (income) 
when every thing is spoiled on 2-6-10,Late Sri 


M.PShahmugham says - a Sincere and honest work -10th will 
never let you down - for 2 square meals. 


Now let us take 3-7-11 Trigons. How best we can make use 
of this 3-7-11. 


For business Mithuna - Dhanus -Kanya -Méeéna are the 
opposite — Houses which are badhaka sthanas. 


According to 10° Cusp signification one is destined for 
business. Business means - the 7" House connection must come 
- bul this 7" House is a badhakasthana. Iherefore one will have 
to be very cautious - depend only onthe 10” - and do independent 
business only. Never go in for a partnership business. Now 
applying this 3-7-11 one can take up International Trade. Here 
the 7" is not Harmful. 


3-9-12 is abroad - 12" is what is required. 


From 12" this 7” is the 6" 4 plus point. Moreover 7™ is the 
international area and not the National scene relevant to business 
at global level. Now 3-7-11 means - 


3m House - communication and commission agency. 
7* House - International Trade 
11" House - Your Profit. 


This 3-7-11 should be studied along with 3-9-12 and 2-6-7-10. 


=" KRISTINARMIRTT PADTIDITATT « 91 


Now let us see this 4-8-12 Trigon. We all know that the 8" of 
the present birth is the House of mystery, sudden and so on. Not 
only that. It is the store House where in the unaccounted sins of 
the previous birth are kept. This 8* House of the present birth is 
the 12” of the previous birth. In the previous birth oné commits 
murder, or rape and escapes law and escapes imprisonment 
also through Law, such of those persons are booked in the 
present birth, either by imprisonment or accidents or murder, 
Suicide and so on. 


When one dies - the physical body is either cremated or 
buried. After that what happens we do not know. But our scriptures 
Say - 


a) The present physical body - known as sthoola sareera 
- Gross body - is burnt - nothing more than that. 


b) Then the inner body known as Sookshama sareera - 
the subtle body is made to stay at the world of manes 
(Pithru Loka} for reward or punishment for some time. 


c) Then the still inner body known as causal body - 
Karana sareera - takes birth immediately to play the 
Role of cause and effect. There will be no limit for 
example like - 


Goat - food to the Tiger. 
Goat in the hands of the Butcher i.¢., to be killed 
Imprisonment - and so on. 


Now on the above, | take you to VI the reader page 313 
regarding imprisonment. Imprisonment implies separation from 
family restrictions to tree movements, confinement with in four 
walls leaving one's own permanent place of residence and life in 
new environment. 


separation fram family is shown by afflicted 2na House and 
the 8 House. Restrictions to free movements, confinements with 


oT + &oTAHtr SKOHRRK ERK 4 


in four walls and life in an altogether different place is shown by 
the 12" House. The 4" House shown one's own place of 
residence. Therefore 3° House (being 127to 4n) shows leaving 
the present place of residence. 


Therefore the Houses to be judged for imprisonment are 
2,3,8 and 12. 


VI Reader page 258 regarding will | commit murder’? 


Note the Sub-Lord of your ascendant. The Lord of the Sign 
star and Sub of the 7" Cusp will be the ruling Planets of the person 
whom you want to murder (one should note that one may go to 
murder one person but by misfake one may murder another). 
50 it is important to note the ruling Planet of the oppenent. The 
sign where the 7" Cusp has fallen is to be noted. Note whether 
this seventh Sign is a movable one or fixed one or a common 
one. Judge the Bhadhakasthana, Marakasthana and find out the 
significators. If the Sub- Lord of your ascendant is deposited in 
the constellation of a Planet which is the significator of his 
Bhadhakasthana or Marakasthana and also the significator of 
your second House then you will commit murder. Please note 
the last two lines of the 1° para - “and also the significator of your 
second House then you will commit murder’. Your 2°° is the 8” 
of the opponent - be ita goat or person. The above two example 
will come under the cause and effect category. 


What is this 4'" - you are hiding some thing. 


What is this 8" - Destiny keeps some thing hidden tor you 
like accidents, murder and so on = that is mystery, misery and 
sudden. 


Wha. is this 12"- 1 fo 11 is taken away from you and your 
are totally isolated. 


In the same way this 4-8-42, in business you stand to lose if 
5-8-12 operales. 


-ERISHNAMURTI PaDHDHATI ® a3 


For some thing good, again this 8" is the store House as the 
mystery House for wind fall. You Know about adoption, 4-8-12 
again. 


On the Trigons, articles of late Kudanthai Nathan are eye 
openers. They are lucid and clear. Observe his bold declaration 
in his article “Certain microscopic minutes in KP " - para 9 - 
"Planets are not prepared to protect the Native. 


Also please note from the article on - "4-8-12 Houses and 
Accidents" - that accidents will take place during the Dasa/Bukthi 
/ Antara periods of the Sublords of the 4-8-12 Houses. Such Dasa 
/ Bukthi / Anthara periods if connected to 2-7-11, or 2-7-9 or 2-7, 
you know well the Native reaches the Heavenly Abode, and the 
news of grief reaching in brief to all. 


4-8-12 Houses and Accidents: (by Late Kudanthai Nathan). 


in an Astrochart Houses 1-5-9, 2-6-10 , 3-7-11, and 4-8-12 
are set in Trigon and are known as Trigonal Houses (Thrikona 
Basis). It is my deep rooted opinion that the Bhava Sublord has 
the pivotal Hole in an Astrochart. it is only for this reason | say 
that a birth chart should never be erected in a slip shod manner, 
but erected, making meticulous correction of the birth time given, 
and confirm the Lagna Bhava Sputa arrived at. | have been 
stressing this point time and again. Once the Lagna Bhava Sputa 
is worked out correctly, the other Bhava Cuspal points are 
automatically set in order. 


From cradle to grave, a person during his life time, comes 
across accidents on several occasions, on a few accidents he 
escapes and during some accidents he does not escapes. 


Natives who escapes from accidents ! have observed in their 
Natal charts the below said set up. 


Natal charts, the below said set-up- 


94 » ASTRO SECRELS » 


Sublords of 1-5-9 Houses, amongst them in their respective 
Houses, have the stars of each other. 


In this example chart - 

| House (Rishaba} 14°.22' - Venus - Moon - Jupiter 
V House (Kanya) §8°.01' -mer - Sunt -Venus 
IX House (Makara) 7°.01' -sat  -Sun- -Keith 


Sublords relevant to 1-5-9 House are Jup-Venus-Kethu. In 
Jupiter's House Kethu has its star Moola. Venus has its star 
Poorvashada. In Venus House (Thula) Jupiter has its star Vishaka. 
This is more than enough. Over and above this as Kethu 
represents Mars (Kethu is Mesha), in Mars House Venus has is 
Star Bharani and in the other House of Mars Jupiter has its star 
Vishaka 4” Padha. 


How then this Native meets with accidents? 

I¥ House (Simha) 6°.01' Sun - Kethu - Rahu 

VIIl House (Dhanus) 11°.01'Jup - Kethu - Saturn 
XIl House (Mesha} 12°.07' Mars - Kethu - Mer . 


Sublords relevant to 4-8-12 Houses are Rahu-Saturn-Mercury. 
In the House of Saturn Rahu has its star Sathabisha. In the House 
of Mercury Rahu has its star Arudhra. Therefore accidents are 
certain. He has his own scootar - is i not enough? In case he 
does not posses a scooter, some other scooter - rider will dash 
on him. 


Is it sufficient enough only to have a 4-8-12 set up as said 
above? 


No . the accidents will occur only during the Dasa - Bukthi 
periods of the 4-8-12 Sublords. You will observe this 4-8-12 set 
up in several horoscopes. KP students should not get confused. 


* KRISHNAMURTI Panuptiati « 5 


We can even predict the day (date) and time of accidents in 
a pinpointed manner - how? 

Generally in a horoscope - 

saturn Dasa - Rahu Bukthi -Mercury Anthara 

oaturn Dasa - MER Bukthi -Rahu Anthara 

MER Dasa - Sat Bukthi -Rahu Anthara 

MER Dasa - Rahu Bukthi -Saturn Anthara 

The Lagna sputa -when accidents occur 

Kumbha -12°.33".20" 

Mithuna-10°26.40" 


On the sensitive points of the Zodiac, when the above said 
Kumbha and Mithuna Lagna arises, accidents will take place.

the stars of Rahu or Saturn or Mercury - accidents will occur. 


CERTAIN MICROSCOPIC MINUTES IN* 
KP(BY KUDANTHAINATHAN) 


In an Astrochart Houses 1-5-9,2-6-10,3-7-11 and 4-8- 
12Houses are set as Trigons(Thrikona Rasis). Of this Houses 
help us to minutley calculate the Lagna and other Houses. The 
Sublords of the 4-8-12Houses indicate dangers/accidents etc. 
Of a Native in his birth chart. 


Accidents are of many types ,ranging from stumbling and 
falling down to road accidents through vehicles. These accidents 
are master-mined by the 4-8-12 Houses Sub Lords. According to 
the set up of the 4-8-12 Houses Death or amputation takes place. 


Generally if the Sublords of the 4-8-12 Houses happens to 
be Venus -Saturn -Venus, we can say that this Native will have no 
accidents at all during his life time in any manner, because they 
do not have their stars in each others Houses. To put it the other 
way if if is Saturn -Venus -Jupiter it means that accidents are in 
the wailing for this Native, because in Thula the Venus House" 
Jupiter has ifs star- Vashatak, in Dhanus-Jupiter House, Venus 
has its star Poorvashada, and in Meena Jupiter's House Saturn 
has its star Uthirabadhra. For such a type of Nalive as per his 
birth chart we can calculate the sensitive point of the Lagna 
Degree and foretell the decisively by day/date and time. 


In Thula the House of Venus, Jupiter star(Vishaka) Saturn 
Sub falls 21° 46'40". When Lagna moves on this sensitive point 
of the Zodiac accident will take place. 


In the same manner in Dhanus, the House of Jupiter, Venus 
star -Saturn Sub falls 21°53'.20", and when Lagna moves on this 
sensitive point accidents will take place. « 


| KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI * Of 


Again in Meena the House of Jupiter, Saturn stars Venus 
Sub falling in’ 7°.46.40%s the sensitive point to cause accident . 
Therefore all people to what so ever Rasi or Lagna they belong 
to, when these three sensitive points of the Zodiac operates as 
Lagna they should very careful ‘cautions. 


For example this Native happens to travel by vehicles, he should 
take care to find out, Whether T hula, Dhanus, Meena Lagna periods 
will be operating till the end of his travel. Does the above said caution 
always needed. No Not at all. ttis (cautionjneeded only when Jup- 
Ven-Saturn, operates as Dasa/Bukthi Lords. Otherwise not needed 
. we must also verify whether Jup-Venus- Satucn while Operating as 
Dasa-Bukthi-Anthara Lords, and atleast oné amongest them in 
anyway connected to Maraka/Bhadakasthana. 


For example if the Sublords of 1-5-9Houses have amongst 
themselves their stars in each other Houses, under any 
circumstances Un natural/Untimely/premature deaths will not occur. 


Hthe Subiords of 1-5-9House happen to be MER-Jup -Sun 
one cannot have unnatural death. In the House of Mercury 
(Mithuna)Jupiter has his star PVasu and in Meena the House of 
Jupiter Mercury has his star Revathy. In Dhanus the House of 
Jupiter Sun has his star Uthirashada. 


in case the set up of Bhava Sublords is Saturn-Mercury - 
oaturn (1-5-9) ,amongst then do not have stars in each others 
House. Therefore it means that the Planets are not prepared to 


With the help of events , a natives Lagna position can be 
corrected and the method adopted to correct the Lagna position 
needs a little explaining is very essential. When we sharpen a 
pencil with a razor blade we may most unexpectedly have a cul 
on our finger, with a few blood drops. Nole down this time 
immediately with out delay, and workout the Lagna !ord-Lagna 
Star Lord and Lagna Sub Lord. These three Lords are the 4-8-12 
Sub lords in your birth chart. Now check up with your birth charts, 
whether the accident time Lagna Lord, Lagna star lord and Lagna 
sub Lords are the - Sub Lords of the 4-8-12 Houses in your birth 


OF * ARTRO SECRETS « 


chart. In case it is not so found, the move/shift these Bhavas little 
by little/step by step to get/fit the accident time Lagna Lord-star 
Lord and Sub Lord till you arrive atthem as Sub lords of the 4-8- 
12 Houses in your birth chart. While so doing Lagna and other 
Bhava cusps automatically gets corrected. 


Our intention is not to have one's finger is not have one's 
finger to have/get a cut, for the sake of erecting a correct birth 
chart. Our aim to explain as said above is that, when an 
unexpected minor accident occur, the time of that accident lends 
a big helping hand to have a corrected birth chart. That is all. 


As much as I could gather my life's experience if the set up 
of the Sublords of the 4-8-12 Houses as listed below. One will 
never have even small scratch in his life time. They are as below:- 


Venus-satum -Venus 
Venus -Mercury- Venus 
Moon -5un -Moon 
Moon-Mars-Moon 
Sat-Mercury-Saturn 


Many horoscopes did not have such set up of Sublords of 
4-8-12 Houses. But one will have a minor or major accidents, 
which is certain. 


lf the Sublords of the Houses 1-5-9 Houses, wash their hands 
these accidents will ultimately lead to death. 


That is Sublords of 15-9 Houses, should have their stars in 
each other's house. 


sublords of 4-8-12 Houses should not have their stars in 
each other's Houses. Readers should well understand this point. 


There is a little fun in this. Natives whose horoscopes does 
not indicate accidents 


of any manner, have no buildings or vehicle of their 
possession. 


Rose flower blooms only on its own thorny plant.

IMPROVING HOUSES & NON- IMPROVING HOUSES 
in the IInd Reader - page 133 - para2 - Guruji Sri KSK 


One can study correctly any Sign, if he first learns the 
opposite Sign". 


lf we develop. our study of the above guide lines, it will help 
us very much on the predictive side of the Astroscience. This is a 
challenge to you as well as an opportunity given to you to come 
up in KR a little Faster. 


In KP of the12 Houses of a Bhava chakra, Houses 
1.2,3,6,19.11 are Known as Improving houses and houses 
4.5,7,8,12 are Known as Non-Ilmproving Houses. 


That is houses i,2,3,6,10,11 are Improving houses to the 
native. Lords of houses 1,2,3,6,10,11 offer desirable results in 
competition, litigation, election etc. 


The houses which are the improving houses from 7th house 
are 7,8,9,12,4,5- improve the matters of the person or the 
opponent denoted by the 7th House and hence they are evil to 
the Native and victory to the opponent, 


The improving houses namely 1,2,3,6,10,11 are harmonious 
for material benefit and progress of the native or the querent In 
any litigation, Competation, election, contest etc., while their 
opposite houses (houses 4,5,7.8,9and 12) are inimical and 
inharmonious, and prove beneficial to favour the opponent 
dencted by the 7" house (Mrs.Bala/sri.N. Krishnamurthy) 


On the above please do not forget that every rule will always 
have an exception. That is 6" house will not be considered as an 
improving house for marriage. Similarly 4° house will not be 
considered as an improving house for child birth. 


Also please do not forget that 11° 9° and 7 houses an their 
lords are badhakasthanas and badaka lords respectively 


400 «ASTRO SECRETS « 


At birth that is in a birth chart or horary chart, when any or many 
Planets in the Sub of such planets that has the power to operate 
1,2,3,6,10,11 houses that native lives a rich life in all respects. 


similarly planets in the Sub of such planets that has the power to 
operate 7.8,9,12,4,5 houses, that Native lives a poor life in all respects. 


lf a plant has the power to operate say 11 the house the 
house of profit . then its Sub found !n all the 27 subs - that is all 
the 27 Sublords of the 27 stars are even ready to offer only 
faavourable results. These subs - that is Sub divisions may be 
Spread over in dor 8 Or 12, but when a planet is found in such 
subs - then as said above they are ever ready to offer only 
favourable results. Such planets in their Dasa/Bukthi /Anthara 
will offer good results with out fail you can verify this for yoursellt. 


Houses 1,4,7,10 are called as kendras. They are at 
0", 90°.180°270° level distances. In general they do not offer a 
desired and gocd results. Any planet or planets at kendra level 
distances of 90° 180" and 270°d0 not ofler favourable results. 


Opposite Houses are supposed to be the enemy camps. A 
planet of its own House to it is known as the opposing House, of 
the enemy quarters e.g., for Venus, Mesha and Virchika will be 
the opposing Houses Thula and Vrishaba. Similarly for all other 
Houses are to be understocd. 


For example a marriage is promised. On the time of events if 
you have 4-10 significations or connections the marriage will 
be delayed. 4in means a stone in the well, that does not move. 
10" means, by nature it will not alow speedy disposal. 


In these opposing Houses even the plants are not spared. 
For example ; 
sun is exalted in Mesha debilitated in Thula -opp.-houses 

Moon is exalted in Rishaba and debilitated in Vriscnika -opp. 
houses 

Mars is exalted in Makara and debited in cancer ~copp. houses 
Mercury is exalted in Kanya and debited in Meena -opp. houses 
Jupiter is exalted in cancer and debited in Makara -opp. houses 


KRTSHAAWTRTI PADHIFHATIO 8 Tit 


Venus is exalted in Meena and dehited in Kanya -cpp houses 
saturn is exalted In Thula and debited in Mesha -opp houses 


From the above it is now clear ,that opposite signs oppose 
each other .The (Lagna) 1* house and 7" house opposing each 
other will fight for power over a trial of strength. If the first house 
is stong.7" House will be weak and vice versa.7" House is the 
house of marriage which we have to analyse carefully. For this 
reason only, for marriage we study this house with utmost care, 
and then proceed for matching of Horoscopes. Oppesite poles 
altract each other-no doubt-but in really it will be full of push and 
pulls and even contradictions. 


Next to marriage, for Business matters when we study the 
opposite signs it will help us to tell whether a person can do 
independent business or partnership business or in whose name 
a business can be started, that is inthe name of his wife or brother 
or father or children and so on. Similarly construction of house 
or purchase of a Lottery ticket and so on . 


Suppose some one asks you to predict by a Horary chart, ifa 
particular law suit, of his whether he will succeed or not, then judge 
the langa first according te KP and compare its strength ,with the 
7” house, which is the Lagna of the opponent. ifthe Lagna of the 
querist is stronger than that of the opponent and is connected 
with house 2,3,6,1 Cor 14 he will win the suit and vice versa . If itis 
connected with 3 and 9 both, a compromise is likely. If connected 
with the 7" , a tough fight is indicated. The role of 4m and 710" 
houses in matters of litigation, competition and election is if a dual 
nature. The fourth House indicates the end of any undertaking. 


The 10” House has two roles to play in this connection. Firstly 
the tenth house being the strongest of the kendras, a planet there 
in is essentially dignified - and Mars and Sun get Dig-Bala in it. 
Secondly the 10° house is 12 to 11™.Here while Lagna 
significators in 10 give good results: a signifactor of 17 in 10° 
protends evil. Unless of course, it is rendered strong by ils 
constellation position or by being exalted or by a benefic aspect. 


102 *ASIRO SLOCRUTS « 


From the above we now understand about the 
opposing House that is 


1X?, 2X8, SAO, 4X10, 5411 and 6412 - again explained as 


1" the native X ?" lite partner, Business partner. 
any one opposite to yo vapponent}

Now | request the students to go through the famous article 
"Learn KP and Earn - No Income Tax" by our beloved Guruji Sri 
KSK - where in every line and word if the article enlightens your 
knowledge in KP with reference to improving X non improving 
Homes. The arlicles is reproduced. 


| request KP students to go by the spirit of the articles relevant 
to what we are discussing as Opposing Houses - that is you 
are informed of the negating Houses, which are the Dividing line 
of 1-? Houses of every Houses of the Bhava, that is 1X7, 2X8. 
3X9, 4X10, 5x11 and 6X12. 


Similarly Sri KSK in the Ill Reader, pages 258,259(reproduced 
} has explained about how a marriage was prevented from 
fructifying, details of which are very much relevant to our subject 
- Improving X Non improving Houses.

Similarly in Vth Reader -page 219 Sri KSK speaks -LIFE WITH 
WIFE; ROOT FOR FRUIT -READ. 


"Though it may appear to be funny, now-a-days, | am doing 
experiments Upon such people who are not having children for 
the past 4 years or 5 years or 6years after the marriage by giving 
them the most auspicious time to be friendly with their wives so 
that they may have atleast one child. The timings selected was 
when Moon was Transiting in such a star, the Lord of which is the 
significator of 2,5 and 11 not at all connected with 1,4 and 1Qand 
the Sub selected also should be governed by the significators of 
2,5, and 11 and the Sub transited by the ascendant is ruled by 
the significators of 2,5 and 11.1his is a case wherein | want to 
prove that there, where the lady cannot conceive for years, 
becomes the mother, after the due course. One also should note 
that the Dasa and Bukti should be governed by the significators 
of the houses 2,5 and not connected with 1.4,and 10. 


Further K.P Students are advised to go through Reader III 
pages 228 to 231 under the heading "Choice of Friends (friend 
or foe)" to have easy grasp and understanding. Pages 228 to

KRAISHNAMURT! PapupHat: ¢ 105 


(LEARN KP AND EARN ) 


HORARY: 


Only in the month of April 1971 while going on doing research 
it is confirmed beyond doubt that a person who wants to play 
cards or bet in the Race Course should adopt the following 
method, whether he has birth horoscope or not. 


Note the place of judgment. Provide yourselves with "Table 
of House and the Ephemeris". Take any number either which 
comes to your mind or which you see. It is preferable fo have a 
book containing 250 pages and take that number which you see 
on opening the book. If in that particular page, the page number 
is not printed, either you do not play or you neither lose nor gain. 
ff you find any number please refer to Krishnamurti Padhdhati 
Table and find out where that particular sub commences. 


Take it as the starting point. That is the Ascendant. Work out 
the other Cusps for that latitude of judgment. 


Note down the position of the planet at the time of judgment. 
Find out the Sublord of the 5m Cusp. 


lfthe Sublord of the 5" Cusp is deposited in any constellation, 
but in the Sub of the significator of the Houses 6 and 71, one 
wins most satisfactorily. 


lf the Sub Lord of the 5* Cusp is deposited in the Sub of the 
significator of 1 and 3 there is the gain. But it will be insignificant. 


lf the Sublord of the 5” Cusp is deposited in the Sub of the 
significator of 12 and 5 there will be great loss and one will be 
necessitated, even to borrow money or run to bankruptcy. 


But if the Sublord of the 5° Cusp is deposited in the Sub of 
the significtor of the Houses 4 and 8 one will not over-trade and 
the loss will be moderate. 


106 ASTRO SkCRETS ¢ 


ffthe Sublord of 5t is deposited in the Sub of the significator 
of the Houses 7 and 9, the loss will be feeble - negligible. 


This is the general rule, which is proved to be very correct in 
about 95% of the cases according to our statistics. But it is also 
found that in one in twenty cases if the Sub Lord of the 5" Cusp 
moves from one Sub at the time of judgment and to the other 
sub at the time of playing the game, the results vary. Further 
more research is being done and it will be announced in the 
magazine, afler my next visitto Delhi where this is Being done by 
a few intelligent and pains taking scholars. 


CHEATING: 


Ambrose Bierce has written in the Devils Dictionary as follows: 


"don't steal though never thus compete 
successfully in business. Cheat". 


lf a person wants to cheat another then the Sub Lord of the 
second House in his horoscope should be deposited in the 
constellation of the Sub of the significator of the Houses 6 and 
1Q. The second House indicates the benefit obtained by any 
manner, 10" House shows that one has it as a profession 6m 
House denotes loss to the person with whom one transacts. 
Unless another loses, how can one gain. 


lf a person is cheated by ancther, then the Sub Lord of the 
12™ cups will be in the constellation and Sub of Planets connected 
with 5 and 8. The Planets by nature are mostly Saturr and 
Mercury. If both Saturn and Mercury are connected in any manner, 
a person either commits such a crime when they are significtors 
of 6 or loses due to such a crime committed by another when 
they are the significators of 12. 


Therefore, if a person wants to do business, he should know 
whether the would be cheated by another, if it is promised, it 
does not mean that one should not do business, but it warns 
one to be careful during the conjoined period of the significators 


KRISTINANIRTI PapHitiaTl « 1(y¥? 


of Houses 5.8 and 12. During other periods he will have gain © 
loss according to the disposition of the planets who rule the Dasa 
and Bukthi. Falsification of accounts, foregery etc. are generally 
done by intelligent people, but they forget that there is God, who 
will see that there will be a hole in the Ship to sink it when the evil 
time comes to the cheat. Such an 2vii time is indicated by the 
significators of the Houses 3 and 12. 


The significators of the Houses 5,8 and 12 will operate at a 
time when one will be caught. The significator cf the Houses 2,6 
and 11 will operate when he cheats the other. 


lf the significators of 2,6 and 11 operates first, followed by 
the significators of 5,8 and i2 then such a crime committed by 
him will be found out, exposed etc. But if the conjoined period of 
the significators 5,8 and 12 operate first, then the native is cheated. 
If by God's Grace the conjoined period governed by the 
significators of 2.6 and 11 follow, then he does not lose. 


He will regain One signs an agreement during the period of 
the Planets who are the significators of the House 3,5,9 and 11. 


ii those Planets are also the significators of. ihe 6" house 
and not the 12". this person has the signature of the other in his 
unguarded moment with the intention to cheat. 


But if the Planets who ruled that time, happened to be the 
significators of the 12” House also then the native will be cheated. 


Example Horoscope will be published in the subsequent 
issue to explain the above rules to be followed by Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati followers. 


Sir, how to find out why a marriage which was about to be 
settled was prevented from fructifying ? 


In Horary astrology the querist gives a number and you 
calculate the nirayana position of the Lagna, Exactly 180° away 
is the seventh Cusp. The Sub Lord of the 7" Cusp should be the 


108 © ASTRO SECREIS « 


significator of the Houses 1,6,10 or 12. It shows that the marriage 
will not take place with the party in question. If the Sub-Lord is 
net only the significator of 1 or 6 or 19 or 12 but also the significator 
of 2, then the marriage is stopped due to want of money to meet 
the expenses. It is mainly due to lack of means. If the Sub-Lord 
of 1 or 6 or 10 or 12 is also the Sub-Lord of the 3ra House, then 
the marriage is dropped due to interference of neighbours or 
cousins or due to any information received by the other party, 
against the interest of the querist. Ifthe Sub-Lord of 1,60r1Ocr 12 
is also the Sub-Lord of the 4° House, then the mother is on the 
way of fixing the marriage; or it may be due to disagreement in 
giving a House or estate or vehicle. If the Sub-Lord is also the 
significator of the 5” House; then the previous love affairs of the 
querist will be t rought to light and due to his bad reputation for 
loose living, the marriage will not take place. 


lfthe Sub-Lord is the significator of 1 and 6 then the marriage 
may be stopped due to ill- health of the querist, being known to 
the other patty, or the maternal uncle will play foul game or 
servants may do mischief or the secret enemy of the other party 
may carry tales against the querist. 


lf the Sub-lords is also the significators of the 7", then on 
hearing that a law suit pending against the querist, the other party 
will disagree. Ifthe Sublord is alsothe significator of the 8" House. 
then the marriage is stopped as the querist does not get as much 
dowry as he demands from the other party or it may be due to 
the death of the relative which will be taken as an ill-omen. 


Ifthe Sub Lord is also the significator of the 9° marriage will 
not take place as the party could not come in time and he does 
net get leave or is in a foreign country and could not come, or 
one's examination will be taking place or the relations of the other 
party will stop it. 


lf the Sub-Lord is the significator of the both 1 and 10 then 
the wedding does not come, through the interference of elders 


KRISHNAMURT! Pabubiat = 109 


or officers or superior or due to his professional status which in 
the eyes of the other party is inadequate. 


Ifthe Sub-Lord of these House 1 or 6 or 19 or 12 is also the 
Significator of the 17" House, the marriage is stopped due to the 
interference of friend or elder brother. 


Ifthe Sub-Lord of the 127 Is also the Sub-Lord of 1 then tt is certain 
that there is some tale carrying, and secret enemies hover round making 
false propaganda. So the marnage does not come up. 


Will there be any raid in my House? 


Raid is generally a result of some secret inimical activity 
resulting into loss of reputation and also money. Now-a-days, a 
few persons have amassed wealth by not submitting correct 
accounts and save money either in this country or abroad. But 
when their time is bad the servants or the neighbours or some 
unreliable friends who gather information, during Unguarded 
moments, betray, give information, leak out the truth and land 
the native in trouble. 


The 12t House indicates sudden and surprising loss, 
confiscation by Government etc., by one's own wrongful acting, 
secret enemies, secret inimical activity, cheating etc. 


Who will betary and give information to the police is to be 
judged from the Sub-Lord of the 12" Cusp. If the Sub-Lord of 
12° Cusp is connected with Houses 3 (younger brother or 
neighbour} and 6 (open enemy) the one's own younger brother 
or neighbour will openly batery . If it is connected to Houses 3 
and 12 (secret enemityjone's own younger brother or neighbour 
will secretly give the information to the police. Houses 6 and 12 
indicate that servants will do harm . 11 and 12 show that the so 
called friend or elder brother betrays the native. 9 and 12 indicate 
that either father or a stranger will be harmful, 4 and 72 show that 
the informant is in his own House, street or town.7 and 12 threaten 
that either the partner in business, as soon as he severe 


110 * ASTRO SECRETS 


connection, shows his true colour, or the native's wife, affer 
divorce etc will call on the police and give information. 


-The 12" House shoes loss of money, and also loss of 
reputation as it is 12m to 1" House(showing repytalion of the 
native). 


To ascertain loss of reputation and that of money, consider 
the 12" House and find out the significators. The significators 
are to be found out in the following manner. 


(i} The planets situated in the constellation of the 
occupants of the 12” House. 


(ii) The Planets tenanted in the 12" Bhava. 
(iii) Planets in the constellation of Lord of 12. 


(iv) Lord of 12 (Lord of the sign in which the 
12" Cusp falls). 


(v) Nodes firstly give the results of the planet or Planets 
with which they are conjoined, then of the planet in 
improving and Non-improving Houses -students are 
requested to fead in terms of 2X8 opposing opposing 
Houses. 

From Sri. M.P. Shanmugam 


Repayment of loan/Debts 


1, 12" means one's money is spent (wasted) it will also mean 
investment. 


« 4-12 means money spent for House &House hold . 
5 -|2 means money spent for children. 

1-12 means money spent for one’s own. 

5-12 also means money spent for sex matters. 


3-12 means money spent for court affairs &younger 
brothers. 


KAISHNAMURT] Padnupuart « 111 


12" indicates several means for expenditures. 


3. 8" means - 2” to life partner/ousiness partner and any 
person whom we contact in this world . 


One having borrowed or have to repay or in any manner 
this 8" is 2na that is the Dhanasthana for others(epponents). 
Therefore 8" Sun (that is money meant for others) if it signifies 
the 2na of the request it indicates the Dhanasthana of the qurrent. 
Therefore it means "returns of the borrowed money". 


The same 8" connected to 70” itis 4” to the opponent. Hence 
money increase to the opponent. This is the truth. Likewise 12° 
indication is loss to one's own. It may be indirectly a capital asset 
in terms of investment. That is by spending the money only some 
other property can be created. That property will be with us only. 


Bul 8" is not so as explained above - what has gone is gone. 
Al the same lime our money reaches the opponent. Debt means 
the money we have already borrowed from others. Or it may be 
like payment of Tax etc., This paid amount will not return back in 
some other shape as property or investment. 


3. if there is no 12" we cannot have even a very small 
matenal. At the same time our money will be spent (wasted) and 
at the same time we get what we want say a desired material. 
This is the real picture of 12". 


4. But 8" is not so as explained for 12". It is what we(owe} 
give to others - or payment of Tax - or paid to others in any , 
manner all these we will not get back in any shape as a property 
or in any other shape this money gone is a river of no return. 


5. Wife inheriting her parents property, insurance , three 
Dhana ete - through 8'" - wife is also 7" and all other also 7". 


6. There \fore the clear picture is -if the 8" Sun signifies 2 or 
10 in returns the borrowed money - will be the true meaning and 
the correct meaning.

@ CHOICE OF FRIENDS (FRIEND OR FOE) ) 


By friendship, it does not mean, that everyone can expect 
something or other from the friend; either by his physical labour, 
or correct advice or by assisting at the time when one needs. 
But a person is to be considered as a friend- 


(1) if he never thinks evil, never does harm or be observing 
the mischievous action of the evil-doers, though he may not 
connive at it, 


(2) if he gives moral support and acts as an intelligent 
minister; 


(3) if possible. lend assistance when one demands or needs tt. 


One is a real and useful friend if he understands the situation 
of a person and helps the person to fulfil his desire. 


Astrologically, 11* house indicates realisation of one's 
ambition. it also denotes elder brother, real friends, permanent 
friends, one's gains or the assistance received by one. 


(1) If lord of 11 Is in the constellation and sub of lord of 
1,2,3,6,10 or 11, that person will have friendship with one who 
will be helpful. 


(2) If lord of 11 is in the constellation and sub of planets 
signifying the matters of the houses 4,5,7,8,9 or 12, the person 
will be a loser through his friend. Lord of 11 or planet signifying 
11"house matters in the sub of | denotes sincere and permanent 
friend who will materially help. Lord of 11 or planet signifying 
11° house matters in the constellation of lord of 2 or sub of 2 
indicate that one can make money and gain through friends. 
Some will give encouragement by offering mental solace while 
the person is depressed and in many fords give the person 
confidence. Lord of 3 or planet connected with 11 * house matters 


KRISHNAMURTT PubpHisttatl = 113 


give chance to make friends during short journey or by 
correspondence and it may be for a short time. If lord of 3 is also 
lord of 12, then this person, on a later date will prove to be a 
scoundrel, cheat and secret enemy. Never talk to such rogues. 
In weak moment if you hint anything they will build up, give shape 
to it and either write anonymous letters or betray the person. 


A person born in Cancer Lagna, had his Venus in Revathi 
constellation ruled by lord of 3 and 12. He had a friend born in 
Virgo owned by Mercury. The friend knowing every secret of the 
person gave information at such a time that the person was 
arrested a couple of hours before his daughter's wedding, when 
there was a large gathering. This scoundrel did not attend the 
marriage. Hence those who are born in Cancer or Capricorn 
should never make friendship with those whose ruling planets 
are Mercury and Jupiter, respectively. If lord of 11 or significator 
of 11" house matters were to be in the constellation of lord of 4 
and 9, do not make friendship with those whose ruling planets 
are the lords of 4 and 9. Such friends are for taking money and 
material and never remaining grateful. 


lf it were to be in the constellation of lord of 5, you will always 
lose, the so-called friend will ever gain. Kis very true, if lord of 5 
is also lord of 8 or 12 . This is invariably true for Gemini borns 
who will ever lose through friends born in Venus constellation. 
so also Sagittarius-born through those born in Mars constellation, 
similarly Aquarius-borns lose through those whose ruling planet 
is Mercury; Leo borns lose through Jupiterians. If it were fo be in 
the constellation of lord of 6, he ever loses: the native gains The 
friend gives and the native receives. Suppose you are weak 
minded and you want to play cards, you play with such people 
who are born in that constellation, lord of which is the lord of 
either 1 or 20r3 or6or10o0r 11. You will win. But if you play 
with those born in that star (Nakshathra) lord of which rules the 
houses 4,5,7,8,9 or 12 in your chart you have to lose. 


114 * ASTRO SFCRETS « 


If the lord of 11,0r planet signifying 11° house is in the 
constellation of lord of 7 or 8 or 9, you cannot rely on him. He 
will be time-serving, 


Lord of 11 the constellation of lord of 10, most helptul and 
faithful friends. Reputation, honour, and prestige will be on the 
increase. Such persons born in the constellation of lord of 10 
will be a good propagandist te make the person popular. 


Lord of 11 in its own constellation brings permanent friends 
whe are very useful. 


Lord of 11 in the constellation of lord of 12 is dangerous. 
Never rely on persons born in the constellation of lord of i2. 
They are your secret enemies. They cannot but be silly towards 
you. They will behave as though they are low-born and ill-bred. 
They will talk pleasantly but be planning to do harm. Never allow 
them inside. Stop them near the gate. Talk and send them away. 
They do not deserve a better treatment from you. 


Generally one can have good friends if lord of Lagna of lord 
of 11 form good aspects. Planets forming adverse aspect with 
lord of Lagna show that people born with those planets as their 
ruling planets cannot be good friends. 


Malefics in the constellation of lord of 12 threaten that these 
born in their constellation can never be a faithful friend. Kethu In 
11 is also not auspicious. Cheating will be the motte. 


Benefics in the constellation of lord of 12 indicate expenses 
with pleasure or purchases or investment. Planets in the 
constellation of lord of 12 (benefics) show pleasant expenses, 
buying materials or investing on lands, buildings, business etc. 


But if lord of 12 is a malefic and a planet is in its constellation 
whichever house the planet may own or occupy, the ultimate 
result is loss. 


KRISHNAMURTI Papuptati « 115 


if lord of 3 is in the constellation of lord of 12, the loss may 
be through mother, conveyance, change of residence, building, 
failure in education etc. If it is lord of 5, loss may be through 
visitors, companions, music or musicians or children or through 
speculation or pleasurable pursuits. 


6ih house lord denotes loss due to disease: 
7 house lord denotes loss through litigation, 


8™ house lord denotes loss by repaying prohibitive interest 
on the money borrowed. 


Lord of 9 indicates expenses through strangers, father, long 
journey, higher studies etc., Father himself may prove to be untrue 
to the person especially when lord of 9 is also lord of 12 A friend 
of mine is born in Libra. Lord of 9 Mercury owns the 12” house 
also. Saturn was in Ashlesha rules by Mercury. During Saturn 
Dasa, Mercury Bukthi, his father gave away his possessions to 
another scan and did not give anything to my friend. 


Lord of 10 shows change in service: illegal gratification given 
for promotion. Lord of 14 in the constellation of lord of 12 
indicates loss through elder brother or friend or son-in law or 
daughter in-law. 


, 4f lord +2 is stronger than lord of 1 or 11, the secret enemy Is 
more powertul. 


Lord of 7 stronger than lord of Lagna, opponent is powerful. 


lflordof 1,2,6and 11 are stronger than lords of 7,8,12 and 5, 
the native ever gains, wins the litigation, comes out victorious in 
election, passes through competitive examination, wins in 
competition etc.

(RULING PLANETS ) 


As a K.P student -beginner , or in a little adyanced stage, 
YOU are aware that A.P is the Master key in KR You have cone 
through the K.RReaders -Magazines and also the A.P &K.P All 
the study made, should make you a skilled KR astrologer. But 
that is not so .We have several shortcomings in mastering the 
R.P al the mental level because your study commenced or 
commences al the superficial level, so to say we are all spoon 
fed. 


Now let us think 4a little deeper on this subject RP Astrology 
is the science of all sciences. So much so Sri K.S.K is the Scientist 
of all the Scientists. In Science, as it develops through research 
you have-two fields. One is the Fundamental Research and the 
next is applied Hesearch. Between the Fundamental Research 
and applied Research Scientists at work are called SEARCHERS. 
Our Guruji was the real SEARCHER, who toiled to find out the 
missing links in Traditional Astrology. During his SEARCHES, he 
stumbled on Jinendra mala, porasara and Varaha Mihira, only to 
find out in utter surprise, that his own findings of subs are the 
secret chambers in the Zodiac, and these secret chambers, if 
they are to be opened , one needed a master key. And to make 
this , he did not simple make - but almost fabricated as a scientist 
and as a Technocrat, this golden master key, that is Ruling Planets 
, as found in the spiritual and ceremonial Vedic hymns. 


It is a common observance in our day to day life, on certain 
days we have poojas, or a marriage ceremoney or Opening on 
new Accounts Books. When an election time/ Muhurtha is fixed 
say 9to 10.30 A.M or 11 A.Mto 12.00 NOON and so on. During 
that time the purohit initiates you to the pooja or commenced the 
ceremoney after praying to Lord Ganapathy. The purchit 
proceeds-shobhe -shobane Muhurthe....................... and 
further proceeds.-

The first one says, the Lagna now what ever it may be as | 
have selected and commenced - let it be a good day. 


Thara Balam -let the Star be strong - and give me the 
strength. 


Chandra Balam - let the moon be strong- and give me the 
strength. 


Vidya Balam - No ignorance - Biss absolute. 
Deiva Balam - let the God's help me in a strong measure. 


What is this Deiva Balam ’?- It is nothing but the strong in the 
R.P and as explained by Sri K.M.Subramanyam, it reveals the 
deeper matters. Further Deivabalam covers the 5" poorvapunya 
and the 9" the luck Factor cum providential help. As destined - 
also called Bhagya. 


As said above, what else is not found in RP or what more 
you néed, to shape you as a skilled and as an able KR Astrologer, 
having the master key the RR 


R.P .is trancendant. RP transcends(meaning = go beyond or 
nse or surpass or excel). These ruling Planets translocates amongst 
themselves. This was found by Guruji during his SEARCHES. Then 
he explained that R.Rs al the time of judgement and those F.R's at 
the time of fructification of an event are the same. 


sri K.S.K. in the fifth Reader-Page Viii-States- "Another reason 
is really the most appealing. If one lakes the pre-natal epoch, it will 
be seen that the Moon's position at the time of the birth in the chart 
is exactly the ascendant(Lagna)jat the time or the epoch in 50% of 


1 18 . ASTRO ALMRETS © 


the chart. So at the time of the epoch, a particular part of the zodiac 
rose in the East. Affer roughly 9 months , when the Moon transits in 
that position, birth takes place. Similarly that particular part of the 
Zodiac which rose at the time of the birth called the Ascendant of 
Lagna was exacily by {he same position of the moon at the time of 
the epoch of the child. Thus Hindu sages compare the relative 
position of the Ascendant (Lagna) at the time of the epoch is Moon's 
position in the birth chart. As the child grows trom the time of the 
epoch, it would be really more appropriate and correct to take that 
into consideration. This may convince every one. 


Ori AR what K.S.Khas already explained are reproduced in 
a step by step manner. 


Our Guruji says take the common Planets found both from 
the House significators and the ruling Planets. Then take the 
fruitful signigicators and the ruling Planets. Out of the fruitful 
significators , select the conjoined Planets periods to fix the day 
as date of event. 


It is here the K.PStudents get stuck up for a short while, as 
the final selection of Planets are made as per fruitful significators, 
and these Planets will have their respective places in the Zodiac. 


These respective places are the sensitive points of the 7odiac. 


Beiore | explain about ihese sensitive points, lef me request 
you to go through the page on Ruling Planets as explained by Alan 
leo, so that one can have a deep insight on the very words ruling 
Planets. Ruling Planets as explained by Alen Leo is no match to the 
words ruling Planets coined by Sri K.S.K but still it is worth something. 


Now from the VI Reader, let Us go through/ few lines from 
few pages, which are from the mouth of Sri KSK. 


VI Reader page 127 last para-

fructification of query.

To find out the correct time, note the ruling Planets at the time of 
judgement. Find out the sign which is rising and which is to rise next 
and so on. Then that sign which is governed by one of the ruling 
Planets should have the Star governed by another ruling planet. In 
that you have te find out the Sub Lord of which is one of the ruling 
Planets. When this position in that sign would rise in the east.... 


Vl Reader page 176- para 7? and page 202, para 4 and page 
224 1*' para-

check up whether any of them is posited either in the canstellation 


or Sun of a retrograde planet. li there is any, reject it and accept 
the remaining. 


Page no:202- 

One should not make a haste and accept these ruling Planets 
as they come. See whether any of them is deposited either in the 
constellation or Sub of a retrograde planet. If there is any reject it. 
Page 224- 


All the ruling Planets are not always beneticial. When they 
are deposited either in the constellation or Sub of retrograde 
planet, they will ultimately prove to be tempters. 

Page 261- para 3 
"True only here the ruling Planets will guide you". 


Page 289- para 4 


Any thing in life which is promised by the planets will be 
experienced when Dasa-Bukthi of the common Planets between 


120 « ASTRO SECRETS 


Significators and ruling Planets operates. (suppose child birth 
Was promised to a person and even for 10 years after marriage 
no child was born. This is because the particular Dasa-Bhukthi 
was not operating . Once it operates, he will have.) 


From the above said the students are requested to acquaint 
several terminologies used by Sri KSK, on the Sub ruling Planets. 


students are requested to go through pages XVI & XVII of 
R.P&K.P 


lf the ruling Planets selected were to be in the Sub of a 
retrograde planet then also this ruling Planets is not useful. Even 
through ruling Planets are selected in the order given in paral. if 
a ruling planet were to be in the Sub of another who is detrimental 
to the House to be judged for a particular matter by being the 
significator of Houses 8 and 12 to the House to be judged then 
this will not be a fruitful ruling planet. 


sri P.y.K. Punneswara Rao says 


When Rahu or Kethu to be a ruling planet to its sign Lord if 
not already in the ruling Planets, it may be taken as ifthe Rahu or 
Kethu represents the sign Lord by virtue of its position in the 
sign. 


| let us proceed further to know \, as much as possible about 
this R.R 


1. First thing we have to know about RP is - - if there is 
no RP then there is no KR 


2. Throughout this reading we are not repeating again 
and again the Day Lord, Moon Rise Lord, Moon Star 
Lord , Lagna Rasi Lord and finally the Lagna Star Lord. 
Orderwise - their strength and so on , as we know 
about it. And then certain important point may be 
repeated from para to para. Please do not take it as 
repeated, because they come through as required. 


* KRISHNAMURTL Papo biiat « 121 


3. Very recently KP Stalwarts according to research 
findings have included Lagna Sub Lord also in the RP 
as it is found to explain deeper maiters of the problem 
or the matter in question 


4. Whether you prepare a birth chart or Horary chart you 
must first make out the RP 


5. RP is made to make use of it - for the purpose itt is 
made. For example , from the RP You wish to know the 
correct Lagna position, then for that only you must 
make your observation. From that RP you should not 
jump to find out when you will go to market, ora 
phone call is expected of Gas Cylinder will reach 
your door. 


6. While making the RP the KP Astrologer should have 
the strong urge for the purpose it is made . Blind usage 
of RR will certainly lead us into deep waters. Unless the 
Urge for the matter is deep and sincere we should not 
resort to ruling Planets as advised by our Guruji. 


li 1} About RP the KP principle is -(as explained by 
Sri Vaikari Ramamurthy)- 


When a person in distress consults the astrologer at a time 
and at that time when RP is made, the Lagna sign and Star Lord 
of RP will be the person's Moon Rasi and Moon StarLord and 
Moon Rasi and Moon Stariord of RP will be the person's Lagna 
sign and Star Lord. 


lt About RP-KP Astrologer N.Nataraj-says- 
1. The most precious finding in KP is the RPs. 


2. Sri KSK's during his research has found that several 
thousand events take place on a day - but without the involvement 
of RP not a single event can take place. 


122 + ASTRO SHCREIS © 


At times other than RPs the transitting Planets gets the power 
from RR For example we find a planet as lagna Star lordin ‘iP 
moving in U.Palquni. And there is a planet in Hastha. Usually we 
do not include in RP the planet in Hastha. ff the planet in RP as 
lagna Star Lord and the planet in Hastha is in 3 conjuction, planet 
in Hastha should be included in RR 


Theretore it is our duty to include a planet with in 3° range 
over the lagna sputa or chandra sputa. 


3. when RP is made, all the 6 Planets including the Day 
Lord should be worked out upto Deg-Min-Sec. That is- 


Day Lord-———————————-in. Degg - Min -Sec 
Moon fast Lord———-in Degg -~ Min -Sec 
Moon Star Lord—————-in Deg - Min -Sec 
Lagna Rasi Lord——————-in Deg - Min -Sec 
Lagna Star Lord——_ in Deg - Min -Sec 
Lagna Sub Lord—————_in Deg - Min -Sec 


4. Then the Rps in whose constellation they are, must also 
be worked out ot the sign-Star-Sub level. 


5. Then Planets with in 3° to the Lagna Sputa and or Chandra 
Sputa should be included in the Rops. 


6. While making the RPs all the Planets are in Gochara transit 
that is transit level. These planetary position should be noted 
down in Deg-Min-Sec. We may think it is not necessary. But when 
you do, they will be useful to take stock of aspects, conjunction 
Retrograde, Eclipse etc., 


7. Other than RPs other Planets in direct aspect {7 aspect) 
should also be included in RPs. 


Planets in 120° aspect with RPs are very strong and they 
should find a place in RP, without fail. 


+ ARISHNAMURTL PADHDHAIL © 123 


8. Amongst the RPs, more than two and upto 9 have their 
required strength. Amongst these 9 APs, selection should be 
made according to their Sub, which tells the real and correct 
strengih of the RPs. This way of selection is more useful. 


9. Generally we say - that in the order of strength - the 
lagna Star Lord is the strongest of all followed by the Moon Star 
Lord and so on. But this type of sorting is not the final one. For 
example Day Lord supposed to be the Weakest, has given the 
expected result, equally well like the lagna Star Lord. 


10. When a Planet amongst the RPs, appears twice or thrice 
such a Planet get increased power. 


11. Ifa Planet in RP say - Venus if tt is in its own Sub then 
that Planet is more powerful. 


12. Amongst the RFPs in any of their signs Rahu/‘Kethu are 
there and if they are alone, then we leave the Planet and take 
Rahu or Kethu or both according to our observation. But if this 
Rahu or Kethu is deposited in the Sub of Retrograde Planets 
then Rahu / Kethu carries no strength at all. 


13. Inhorary amongst the RPs made at the time of judgement, 
Planets connected to Moon are stronger - that is Moon Rasi 
Lord - Moon Star Lord and Planets within 3° of Chandra Sputa. 


14. Contrary to the above, in a Natal chart, amongst the RRs 
made at the time of judgement, Planets connected to Lagna are 
stronger - that is Lagna Rasi Lord - Lagna Star Lord - Lagna 
Sub Lord and Planets within 3° of the Lagna Sputa. 


15.RPs and House significators coordinate with each other, 
to form the conjoined significators period to offer the desired 
and expected result. lf they co-ordinate, then only the result 
materialise of a particular event. 


16.lt is the Ruling Planet that induce to stir our thoughts, 
then our actions and finally the results also. The RPs offer the 


124 * ASTRO SHFEIS ° 


result on the basis of time - that is not only Dasa / Bukthi / Anthara 
/ Sookshama, but also on the basis of transits of Lagna - Moon 
- Sun - Jupiter and or significators. That is Ruling Planets offer 
results only when they tally with lords of Dasa / Bukthi / Anthara 
lords in transit. - . 


17.lf you find the RPs have the power to operate the 
improving Houses 1,2,3.6,10,11 you can boldly declare the result 
will be positive. 


18. To make the best use of RPs in Horary - make the 


a) The horary number chart with Sputa on one side - with 
Planet Sputa. 


b} Then have the Lagna and other Bhava Sputa made at 
the time of judgement - as if a child is born - that ts like 
a birth chart. No doubt you get the HPs in this. !n this - 
planetary position will be the same - except that, the 
lagnas will be different. 


From the above set up with the help of RPs you will be able 
to Know the strength of Planet significators that offer the results 
in a full measure or appear as temptors. 


Do not forget - Transit also should agree. 


Judgement made as said above with the help of RPs, gives 
you the courage to get rid of doubt, and enables you to make 
bold prediction. 


Totell the whole thing ina Nui-shell it is RPs must havr strong 
connection with House significators. This is the teaching made 
by our Guruji when he says take the common signitica.ors from 
RPs and House significators and then again select the fruitful 
Significators. 


IV - Late Sri.M.P.Shanmugan Says:- 


You have the House significators - you have the RPs. A Planet 
in RP is not found in any manner amongst the House signficators 


KRISHNAMURTI Pateiiatt * 125 


- to enable us to take the common significator and then the fruitful 
significator. Then in thal case take that Planet in the RP and find 
out from the RP whether tt is a significator, for the matter we are 
analysing - relevant to conjoined Planet period. 


‘The Arrival of Moon" an article of late Sri. M.PShanmugam 
is reproduced to understand the RPs from a different angle. 


“Bus Follows KP" an article by Sri.N.Mohan is reproduced 
which is a treat to you. 


"A Few Words about Ruling Planets" by late 
sri.N.Krisnnamurti is reproduced. Read the lines underlined they 
are wailing, only to open your eyes. 


Events that will happen, from rising sign, because that 
particular influence is prominent, and until the person has worked 
his way though if, he will be continually under its power. For 
instance, Aries persons would be under the Aries influence, their 
health would be affected through the head and they would always 
be independent and impulsive and desirous of being at the height 
of things. 


When we come to the Huling Planet, however we have 
something totally different. Nearly everyone who is progressing 
in any way passes as it were through the rising sign te the 
Ruling Planet. Suppose some one took up the study of Astrology 
with the idea of developing himself, and thought that these were 
higher goals to be attained than that for which he had been 
striving. His first business would be to find out his Ruling Planet. 
(| may say that the Ruling Planet is the Lord of the sign rising, as 
a rule, but some times the Planet in the ascendant., if there is 
one; thus we find cases of persons who have worked through 
the Planet Ruling the sign ascending and taken up the Planet 
rising). Each of the twelve signs has a Planet as ifs ruler. Mars 
govern Aries, Venus, Taurus; Mercury, Gemini; the Moon, Cancer, 
the Sun, Leo and so on. 


126 » ASIRO SECRETS 


BY ALAN LEO: 


By Ruling Planet is meant that these particular Planets find 
their best expression through these particular signs. Thus the 
influence of Mars can express itself best through Aries and 
Scorpic, 


Saturn Saturn

Jupiter Jupiter Jupiter 
Mars Mars Mars 
Venus Venus Venus

Aqu. Pis. Aries Tour Gemini Can. Leo Vigro Libra Scor. Sagi. 
Gap 


+ - . + . + - _ . ' 


Positevly or negetively as the case may be. This Is a very 
important point. The Planets have each a positive and negative 
sign, and you get the real quality of the two Houses expressed in 
the on Planet, ie, the Planet itself has the internal quality. And 
that seems to be the quality we are to evolve, because we are to 
progress, first out of the sign of the Zodiac, then beyond the 
Ruling Planets, and finally inte the particular Planet governing 
the whole world for the time. Thus we see how important itis to 
know what one’s Ruling Planet by for when on has worked 
threugh the rising the sign, overcoming its different vices and 
tendencies, the Ruling Planet's infulence must be taken up and 
that affects the life. Itis as though one rises from the purely psychic 
into the higher intellectual conditions, as though one rise to the 
point where he can see more clearly and is less biased by the 
sigm the Planet has previously worked through. It is as though 
he has extracted the whole of the virtue of the sign and found its 
complete expression in the Planet. 


With regard to the next point the rulers of nations we have 
some very interesting points for consideration. There are certain 


*KRISHNAMUARTI PatwtoHatt « 127 


sign that rise rapidly in some countries than in others. Each sign 
governs a race or nation. 


RULING Planets 


By Ruling Planets, it is meant that a particular moment is 
ruled by a few Planets. That is one is to note (1) The exact position 
of the Zodiac which would be rising for that moment for that locality 
on that day (2) the name of the day (3) the constellation in which 
Moon would be passing then (4) the sign in which Moon would 
be. 


Every day has its Lord as follows:- 


1. Sunday is ruled by Sun,2.Monday by Moon 3. Tuesday 
by Mars 4.Wednesday by Mars 3. Thursday by Jupiter 6. Friday 
by Venus 7. Saturday by Saturn. If Rahu or Kethu were to occupy 
a sign then Rahu and Kethu will act as an agent of the lord of the 
sign. Suppose Rahu is in Aquarius or Capricorn then Rahu also 
should be taken as a Ruling Planet for Saturday or when 
Capricorn or Aquarius is the Lagna or the sign in which Moon 
passes. Kethu in Leo will represent Sunday. If Kethu were to be 
in cancer it indicates Monday. Kethu in Gemini represents Virgo 
also. If Moon or Lagna is in Virgo Kethu should be included. 


The Lord of the sign rising in the east. i.e., the Lagna. Ifa 
Planet owning two Houses, rules this sign and either Rahu or 
Kethu were to be in either of the two signs, node must be included. 
The Lord of the Star in which Moon passes comes next. 


The Lord of the sign in which Moon ts at the time. This Lord 
may own another sign and a node may be in either of the two. 
Node should be taken for judgement. All the above Lords are 
called the ruling Planets. 


Among these, those deposited in the constellation of a 
retrograde Planet should be rejected. Those which are retrograde 
will cause delay till it is retrograde and then will be fruitful. after 
they in indirect motion reach a particular Sub. Planets which are 


128 « ASTRO SHCRETS 


in the Sub of those who are detrimental to the matters of a 
particular Bhava indicate when the matter will fall through. Thase 
which are in direct motion and which are the significators of the 
matter under judgement, they give the desired results. 


A person may receive advice from a foreign land saying that 
the machinery had been shipped. Yet one would like to know 
when it would be received. The above method is to be followed. 
similarly if one wants to know the moment when the astronauts 
will return after landing in the Moon, the method is the same. 
Hence the principle remains the same. 


N.B.- lf a matter is to be materlialised in days and within a 
month you take the position of Moon and therefrom you calculate. 
But if it would take more than a month, move the Sun from the 
present position of the Sun. if the matter is to fructify in some 
years move Jupiter from the position occupied by Jupiter at that 
time. If one asks which month | can celebrate the marriage of my 
daughter in that year, Sun must reach the position goverened by 
the Ruling Planets. But if one asks in which year one will build a 
House, move Jupiter. If one wants to know when his wife would 
deliver and adds that it is the fourth month, then move the Sun. if 
it is the same month for delivery, move Moon. if expected on the 
same day take Lagna. If one says that one would like to start a 
business in afew years, then move Jupiter. This is the way how 
one is to make the best and most correct method of using the 
Ruling Planets.

a A FEW WORDS ABOUT RULING PLANETS 


BY LATE SRI. N.KRISHNAMURTHY 


RULING PLANES - DETAILS: 


1. Lord of the week Day 
Day means from Sun Rise to Sun Rise - Day Lord 


2. tn which sign Moon is - Moon Rasi Lord 
3. in which star Moon is - Moon star Lord 

4. In which sign Lagna rises - Lagna Rasi Lord 
5. In which star Lagna is moving Lagna Star Lord 


The above 5 planets are the Ruling Planets. 


Amongst the 5, Lagna Star lord is the most powerful. Day 
lord is the weakest. 


Just before you proceed to verify or analyse the Horoscopes 
these RPs should be made. 


In Horary charts, the conjoined periods of the significators 
are lo be decided with the help of these ruling planets. 


In Birth charts, after selecting the powerful significators, take 
from RR which are also the significators in the birth chart. The 
conjoined periods of such significators, during their Dasa/Bukthi/ 
Anthara will offer the results. 


For the matter that you are analysing, the significators selected 
with the help of RR should be in the Sub of fruitful significators. 


Ruling Planets in Retrograde, will not give any result till they 
become Direct. When they become Direct, that Day itself they 
will offer the results. 


lf Rahu/‘Kethu are found in the sign of the R.Ps then Rahu and 
Kethu are to be taken as Ruling Planets and also to be made use of. 


These are the important Points that we should take note of 
while telling a prediction.

a Seminar was held on this article, with appreciation from every 
one. A news item about this appeared in the Daily "DINAMALAR" 
on 24.03.1982. 


To participate in a Seminar at Kancheepuram, on 14.3.1982, 
sunday, we were proceeding by Bus, from Madras to Kanchi. 
The Bus was speeding on the Highway Poovirundavalle. Sri K.M. 
SuBramaniam, my Guru, myself and a friend of mine Sri. Palani 
(a KP. student) were the three amongst other Passengers. 


Sri. Vaikari Ramamoorthi, Editor of this magazine "Nakshatra 
Jyothidam’, also partook in the sensitive and graced the function. 


My friend Sri. Palani, raised the question, as to at what time 
this Bus will reach Kanchi, and he excepts the answer. That is he 
has turned out to be a Doubting Thomas. The question is Both 
beautiful and absurd. Time 12:31 RM. (Neon) 


Why the doubt? Certainly we can tell - said Sri K.M.S. Hence 
the question, O.K. -let us try -{ said (Mohan) | asked him to speak 
out the present Ruling Planets. Sri Palani tells the R.Ps. 


Day - Sunday Day Lord sun 
Moon is in Thula (Libra} Moon Rasi Lord Venus. 
Moon is moving in Vishaka Star -Moon Star lord Jupiter 
Current Lagna - Mithuna- Asc. Ras: Lord Mercury. 


Current Lagna moving in Arudhra Star Lagna StarLord Rahu 


Lagna Rising in Mithuna at 68.56 


After a little careful study over the Ruling Planets | said this 
Bus will move in Mithuna Lagna itself, over Punarvasu Star, Venus 
sub and in the Sub-Sub of Rahu. Immediately our Doubting 


*KRISHNAMURTI PapwnHale - 131 


Thomas Palani questions - why not in Karkata. Moon is not in the 
R.Ps - Therefore Karkata (Cancer) ruled out. 


sun is there. In that case Bus may travel upto Simha (Leo). 
Jupiter is there - in that case the Bus can travel upto Dhanus and 
from there to Meena - too. 


You mad guy. If we are to say so, are the RA.Ps have given 
sufficient ground. Certainly not. 


Our doubting Thomas thinking that he is too wise again repeats 
- that this Bus will reach in Meena only. How you people say no. 


Lagna Sublord Jupiter, as on today - is moving in Rahu Star. 
Rahu is in Mithuna, that is in the Lagna Bhava itself. Therefore 
Jupiter gets the power to the Lagna Bhava. Hence there will be 
no break - of journey. The bus will have a safe reaching. In case 
the travel is disturbed, there will be a little delay - that is all. 


Besides Lagna Sublord, Jupiter is Stationed in Sara Rasi. Jupiter 
in Rahu star and Rahu is in Ubhaya Rasi. As long as these two Planet 
have no connection to Sthira Rasi - there is no chance for the Bus to 
delay the travel. (if Sthira rasi connection is to be there - then delay 
can be thought of }). Therefore the Bus will reach in Mithuna itself. 


Alright - now how to change this Lagna position to clock time? Oh 
- by Topsy - turyy lesson only. What we do to work out the Lagna 
position from Glock time, the same we should now do. The opposite 
way - that is instead of top to bottom - it will be from bottorn to top, - the 
Lagna position gets converted to clock time. That is, all additions 
become subtractions and all subtractions become additions. Therefore 
Mithuna - Nirayan 87:22 (Deg.Min) to which as - Ayanamsa 23:30.

Which is 20°.42 in Sayana Sputa in Cancer. With the help of 
K.P. Krishman’s Tables of Houses, we must find out the 
Nakshathra Hora (Sidereal Time).

Deduct 24 Hours from this figure -24 
Finally this is the 1.S.T (Clock Time) 1.54.01 


That is the Time, this bus will reach Kancheepuram. Will it 
reach? Let us wait and see.

Sri.K.M.S - Asks - Mr.Doubting Thomas - What is the time? 
Sri Palani (Our Doubting Thomas}- 1.54, Sir. 

Jupiter - the Great Jupiter travelled well in time. 

Really a good prediction - is it not’? This is a Mini - 


Joint - Prediction. Likewise, in KP One can have thousands 
and thousands of predictions - Thank God.

@THE ARRIVAL OF MOON AND THE ACT OF MOON ) 


BY LATE SRI. M.P SHANMUGAM 


We all are aware that when an event meets with hurdles the 
general public is curious to Know why such hurdles occur and 
unaware of themselves due to their ignorance of Astrology, it is 
very common thing to note that these people indicating the arrival 
of Moon - say - Oh!, the day and the star has yet not come. 
Every event in he world takes place on a particular day at a 
particular hour and between few minutes. 


One celebrates a marriage, one lady delivers a child, one 
conducts the Opening Ceremony of an Industrial Unit, one joins 
service, one joins the Ministry, one gets judgement to be hanged, 
- likewise crores of event take place in our daily life. As os such 
events, several stages are set by several Planets by their 
conjoined acts. But that particular event to be completed or to 
take place in its full and final stage has to occur only on a particular 
day. And on that particular day only, when the Moon enters that 
particular star, the event occur, this is the greatest singular truth, 
which truth the general public is unaware of and in general 
indirectly express oh!. The day and the star has yet to come 
awaiting the arrival of Moon. 


Amongst the public Astrology lives as it likes and also very 
freely. But in the hands of an Astrologer this Astrology undergoes 
all sorts of analysis. Who knows when this Astrology will 
commence and experience a happy life. For that | tco appeal to 
Moon and say has not the day and the star yet to come!:. 


Moon on an average transits a star per day. In 27 days Moon 
transits the 27 stars and completes one round of the Zodiac. A 
planet is owner of 3 stars. According by the 9 Planets, as per set 
rules govern these 27 stars. In that Moon is also one. As said 
above, for a particular event to occur, and that event to occur is 
related to a particular planet, and which of the 3 stars governed 


134 » ASTRO SPCRETS 


by this particular planet is connected to this / thal particular event 
in that star when Moon transits, then only the event takes place. 
How this event / matier fakes shape is explained below:- 


A person is fo get married. He may be a Mesha Lagna by 
birth or by Horary, the lords of 2-7-11 Houses Venus, and Saturn 
and the Planets in their stars are the important people to conduct 
the marriage. In this one’s Dasa, one’s Bukthi and other Anthara 
/ Sookshama is on, which is the commencing of several stages 
of the marriage event. So much so the Dasa natha runs for several 
years the Bukthi natha for few years, the Anthara Natha in terms 
of months and the Sookshama Natha will run its period for few 
days. \f our observation is from the commencement of Dasa / 
Bukthi / Anthara / Sookshama and till their end time, these lords 
are to give only marriage, then in that case a person will have 
several marriages to take place. Or if we predict by Guru Balam, 
from birth to death, several Guru Balam will come and go, and in 
all such Guru Balam only marriage is to take place; just imagine 
what will happen. Therefore all these observations are not 
properly reasoned. 


The Planets they are responsible to conduct the marriage, 
set the ball rolling, to start with matrimonial matters, and several 
stages are formed to shape the final event. Then according to a 
conjoined set up , the star of the most important planet in this 
conjoined set up, will be selected for marriage. Accordingly when 
Moon transits in this/ that particular star, that day , the marriage 
will take place . The Dasa/Bukthi/Anthara/sookshama lords, 
having been waiting for several months to a ready stage will be 
again awaiting the arrival of Moon to transit the selected star. 
The moment Moon enters this selected star, marriage takes place. 
Of the transit of Moon in that particular star, Moon to transit along 
the Anthra/sookshama portions or otherwise negatived depends 
onthe 7" Bhava Sublord, with whom this Moon has a contract/ 
commitment is inclusive of this Moon's commitment. In case 
Moon is not committed to this 7” House Sublord, then this person 


* KRISHNAMIURTI PapeiHatt « 135 


has no marriage in his/ her life, in any Dasa/Bukthi/Anthara/ 
sookshama. No Guru Balam can conduct the marriage . In chart 
he/she will have no marriage at all. At the very birth, on the 
marriage contract / commitment, over the selected star day 
clubbed to certain Dasa/Bukthi/Anthra/sookshama which runs, 
and in it over a very short period, whether Moon should/will 
transist or not, will be clearly indicated by the 7" Sub lord and 
thereby proclaiming about marriage to these persons ié .Yes or 
No at the very birth itself. lf this proclamation is favourable then 
only marriage can take place, according to the several stages 
set by the Planets and to culminate by a conjoined period. In this 
conjoined period one particular star day of a planet is selected. 
After this selection, all these conjoined Planets will be awaiting 
for the arrival of Moon to that particular planet. In case the 
favourable indication was not given by the several stage for the 
marriage and proceed the look afler other affairs of the life of the 
person in question. As informed of the favourable stages there 
are two levels. One is Planets responsible to conduct the marriage 
- in their very beginning of Dasa /Bukthi/Anthra/Sookshama 
period - says within a month - then Moon's transit alone, is 
enough. 


lf it is more than a month then in the group of Planets to 
conduct the marriage Sun also should join - waiting for Moon's 
arrival. lf the(time) period of marriage is more than a year. Jupiter 
and Sun should join the group of Planets responsible to conduct 
the marriage, and all of them together will be waiting for the arrival 
of Moon. 


When there is a compulsion of Jupiter and Sun to join the 
Group of Planets, before their arrival (i.e, Jupiter &Sun) even 
through Moon transits several times in a particular star - marriage 
cannot take place. 


When there is no necessity for Jupiter and Sun to join the 
group of Planets for marriage - that is in a short period i.e¢., with 
in a month -Moon during fs first arrival (first round) itself - the 


136 * ASTRO SLICRUIS + 


marriage will take place. So much of several stages to be shape, 
whether | be fora marriage, or for any other event big or small - 
all the planetary set up as explained above subjected to an event 
(will}must and should take place accurately. 


i 
Leaving such accuracies in calculation, of what use it will be 
to tell a planet is Ruling, Exalted (ucha) and other unwanted 
slokas, where to our utter disappointment, no event can take 
place. 


Therefore of all the planets, Moon is the most important to 
pin point the event .No single event in the world takes place 
without the entry (arrival) of Moon is now crystal clear to us. 


What all explained above were above the untiring Research 
findings of the mighty giant Jyothish marthand Prof.KSK whose 
findings lead to the evolving of RULING Planets, a master key of 
PAR EXCLLENCE in Astrology, handed over as a big boon to KP 
followers. 


We shall now explain by a simple example about Moon's 
importance and how he(Moon) acts. 


Imagine a Post office. From this Post office letters are 
delivered to a place having 27 Houses .These 27 Houses are 
grouped as 3 Houses per street, having a total of 9 streets. The 9 
streets and the 3 House in each street are symmetrical. The 9 
streets and the 3 House in each street are symmetrical. To deliver 
the leffers to all the 9 streets, only one post man is on duly. This 
postman enters street by street in an order and delivers the letters 
to the 3 Houses in each street. Now the postman as he enters a 
street having 3 Houses, enters and delivers the letters only fo a 
particular House, having the address in the letters. He will not 
enter the other Houses as there were no letters addressed to 
those remaining Houses. But people from all the 3 Houses will 
be eagerly awaiting the arrival of PostMan. So much so the 
postman delivers the letters which contains the address of that 
particular House only, and he has nothing to deliver to other 


KRISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI « 137 


Houses. Why he did not have letters addresses to certain other 
Houses ?7It means no one from far off had addressed to those 
Houses. In the same analogy of a postman, the Moon acts. 


As the postman enters street, all the people in the 9 streets, 
House after House to wail for the arrival of the postman. 


Here | request the readers the Readers not to take the 
example of postman as to what a big research point has been 
thrashed out. Please think a little deep .A letter is sent. It reaches 
the post office. The postman who carries the letters and if he 
enters a House then only the letters are delivered to that House. 
Similarly an event is shaped by his parents -next negotiation 
takes place- then confirmation- then betrothal ceremony, in which 
a date for marriage is finalised. All these maffers for an event of 
marriage is given shape by group of planets and the final day of 
the marriage, when Moon transits that particular star day, the 
marriage takes place. This is similar to that of the postman who 
- lf he enters a particular house, that House alone gets the Mail. 


In the same manner at the very birth, a marriage when by 
the 7" Sub lord the group of Planets lined up in their Dasa - 
Bukthi - Anthra -sookshama - in which during a short period as 
predestined, the Moon declares his arrival 


Of the 3 Houses in a street, the postman enters only that 
House for which there is a letter addressed to in other Houses 
the postman does not enter, as there is no letter for those Houses. 


This is exactly what the 7" Sub Lord declares. {tf a far off 
person has posted a letter, the post man surely will enter that 
House to deliver the letter. 


in the same manner if the 7" Sub Lord has permitted the 
marriage (if the far off person had posted the letter - reaches the 
post office and delivered by the postman), Moon enters the star 
day and conducts the marriage event give shape, step by step 
and keep every thing ready for the moons arrival and entry to 


138 ' ASTHD CHHEIS = 


that star day already predestined by the 7” Sub Lord. Therefore 
an event is completed only on the Moon's arrival and entry to a 
selected star day as explained above. 


50 much so not only fer each and every event it is the Moon, 
which is of great importance, but also other events, the 
importance of Moon is reflected. They are explained as below: 


1. 


lf Moon is posited in the star of Lagna Lord, one will most 
of the time think of himself, his body, his longevity etc. 
Moon rules the the mind. So when Moon is posited in 
the star of any one Bhava, accordingly of that Bhava his 
thinking will be centered. 


Moon if posited in the star of the II House Lords, one will 
always be thinking of his family, about his wealth and 
features of his face. 


Moon if posited in the star of Ill House Lord, one’s 
thoughts will always be of his brother, liking for travels. 
unwilling to stay confined to home etc. 


Moon if posited in he star of IV House Lord, one will 
always be thinking of his education, House, vehicles, 
Mother, ancestor's properties and how to safe guard his 
wealth secretly. 


Moon if posited in the star of V House Lord, one's thinking 
will be about cinema, drama games, some about their 
children, some about love affairs, some about gambling 
and some about philosophical scriptures. 


Moon if posited in the star of VI House Lord one will 
always be thinking of winning over enemies, about 
disease, about debts, about service, and to take food in 
hot condition. 


. Moon if posited in the star of VIl House Lord, he will always 


think of his wife, business partner , his personal business 
set up(enterprise) and his popularity amongst the public. 


- KRISHWAMURTL PabHDuHari « 139 


8. Moon if posited in the star of VIIl House Lord, one will 
always be thinking of his lie span, how best he can borrow 
and about committing suicide 


9. Moon if posited in the star of IX House Lord one will 
always think of Research, Higher education , about his 
father , about his father , about spiritual emancipation 
and long distance journey. 


10.Moon if posited in the star of X House Lord, one will 
always think of his name and fame , about interest in 
political matters etc. 


11.Moon if posited in the star of Xl House Lord, one will 
always think of as to attain all the comforts in the world, 
about friends, about elder brother and about profits. 


12. Moon if posited in the star of Xll House Lord one will 
always think of loneliness, about investing his money on 
some matters, about secret activities, about going aboard 
and so on. 


13. Therefore we find that Moon is linked to all the acts of 
living being of the world, and Moon gets importance for 
the reason that all the acts to reach its completion stage, 

‘ Moon is a must. Not only this, Moon in which star he is 
posiled , for that birth that star, to which Bhava(House) it 
is connected , that House matters and qualities are 
revealed in a higher degree. 


Thus importance of Moon is two fold is two that is its act 


completes an event to its final stage and also reveals the House 
matter and its qualities buy its stellar position.

¢ SENSITIVE POINT } 


The word Sensitive Point carries a different meaning in our 
daily life as corroborated (corroborate — give support to) in KP 
terminology. 


When the Election is announced, the Election Commission 
first identifies the trouble in some polling stations where goondas 
creep in, and such polling stations are declared some as sensitive 
and some as hyper-sensitive. 


The dictionary meaning says - for sensitive - touchy or quick 
to take offense- readily susceptible to light, agency, touch etc. 


The word Sensitive comes from the word sense, Sense is 
Noun where as Sensitive is adjective. An adjective qualifies the 
Noun. Sense means a sensation is caused to sight, hearing, smell, 
taste, touch by the normal state of mind. 


Plant mimesa - (Common Name =touch Me not) droops or 
close when touched. When a person feels hurt due to inferiority 
complex, or even superiority complex, we say - he is sensitive. 


Therefore Sensitive point can also mean Flash Point, Volatile 
Point, Boiling Point, Hot bed, Body Trap, Cut off stage and so on, 


Explained as above, about this sensitive Point is to make KP 
students understand, that Sensitive Point in the 7odiac is similar 
to the land mines on earth. 


These sensitive points have a direct relation to Timing cof 
Events in our KP We can understand this by the example of a 
time - born which explodes at the said time, it being triggered 
through a remote control device. 


In KP the time bomb is made of the conjoined significators 
who are the Dasa/Bukthi/Anthara/Sookshama lord. In KP the 
triggering is made by the selected planet which is in the sub of 
Significator whose constellation is not tenanted. 


« KRISHNAMURTI Papuniiall « 141 


in KP once the trigger is set - "Charge" is the order given 
and this order is executed by -Transit to agree = significators, 
Jupiter and the exciting planets Sun, Moon, and the Lagna 
transits. 


sri KSK says - | follow the constellation theory. 
| make use of the nirayana Zodiac. 

This Nirayana Zodiac is the Kala Pursha. 

This Nirayana Zodiac is Time Personitied. 


Every thing living (or inanimate) on earth has a place - a 
permanent place on this Time Frame, from birth to death. 


On the above said, Sri KSK has done all work for all of us 
single handed, over this time Frame - which consists your Dasa/ 
Bukthi/Anthara/sookshama. For the final stage of any event in 
your life be it higher education, or enter into service, or enter the 
Dragon -> Marriage, or be it your funeral, Sri KSK says, now you 
move the significators or Move Jupiter or Move the Sun, Move 
the Moon, and Move the Lagna ever the Sensitive Points on 
Zodiac and have the Sensational results. 


Archimedes once said,- given me the lever the fulcrum in 
the ouler space - | will life the earth by one foot. This is a child's 
play on the outer space, very near fo our earth. But our work is 
the Lunar cum Solar mansions having the Sign -star area which 
we call it as cosmobiclogical or Stellar Zone or Stellar area, which 
has the Chambers popularly known as SUB. 


We have no difficulty at all to assess this sign- star - Sub 
area, but when you set to work you feel the weight. Why? Because 
the conjoined Planets are in a Combination set up - say Mars - 
Venus -Sun in Mesha -Simple - that is Mars Dasa - Ven Bukthi - 
sun Anthara - that is from the four fold significators of the birth 
chart or Horary chart you have taken the Mars Dasa -Ven Bukthi 
—Sun Anthara. 


142 * ASTRO SECRETS « 


Allthe charts will not give you this smooth selection. What is 
the reason? The reason is the planets arrange themselves to 
combine on the basis of permutation -Combination. That is this 
Combination falls under the permutation set up! 


Now we must have a clear picture about this permutation. 
Permutation means Per - Mutation. The word Mutant results from 
the word Mutation or Mutable - Meaning liable to change to give 
the variation. This change - is not a dingle phenomenon. The 
change - the mutant - is per - meaning for each. From Chemistry 
you know whal is Peroxide - Peroxide =oxide containing 
maximum proportion of Oxygen. 


In the same analogy Permute - means aller sequence or 
arrangement of. 


Now let us proceed further on the subject Sensitive Point. 
1. Regarding Conjoined Planets - V_ Reader Page 182 


Therefore one must note down which group of planets 
will offer success and victory over enemies or gaining 
or winning in Competition. (Here conjoined mean 
group of planets). 


2. Regarding Group of Planets coming under Permutation 
and combination - to form the Sensitive points. 
V Reader Page 180 and 181 are to be gone through 
where Guruji tells how he was held up and overcame 
this hurdle, in page 180 - from para 4 onwards 
“Similarly | verified series of charts, noted down their 
results, did Postmortem and discovered Krishnamurthi 
Padhdhati by Sub dividing the constellation into subs, 
as | could fix an event with in a range of 13 days, 
instead of exact date. There was also another 
handicap. 


lfone runs Mars Dasa Kethu, Bukthi F used to predict that a 
matter will materialised between 13” April and 26" April as in that 


' KRISHNAMURT] Pabittogiait » 143 


fortnight Sun will pass in Nirayana Mesha owned by Mars and 
kothu Star Aswini. 


lf it were to be Sun Dasa Kethu Bukthi, | predicted in the 
second fortnight of August as Sun would be in Sun sign, Kethu 
Star Makam. If it Were to be Jupiter Dasa Kethu Bukthi, then the 
matter will materialise in the second fortnight of December as 
Sun would be in Jupiter Sign Kethu star. 


But for Kethu Bukthies in other Dasa, | could not give, even 
this range. 


if one had been running Mars Dasa Venus Bukthi, | pitched 
up the days when Sun was transiting in Mars sign Venus, Star or 
Venus sign Libra, Mars. Thus when | proceeded, | found that in 
Mars sign, there is no Moon, Rahu, Mars Stars, in Venus sign, no 
Saturn, Mercury Kethu Venus Stars. Hence to Dasas, all Bukthies 
had no constellation. 


Then tt struck me that as long as Stellar Theory is correct, 
instead of taking sign, take the star to represent Dasa, and the 
sub to indicate Bukthi. Now every period and sub period has 3 
positions in the Zodiac at a distance of 120° from one another. 


7. Note down, in which sub period, the native had won and 
which sub he and lost. Then one will find the group of planets 
which offer advantageous resulls and the group which always 
works against his interest. For the future, in the diary, note down 
the hours and minutes in a day, when lucky group's sub will be 
transited by Moon. These are the hours and minutes where one- 
can surely gain. 


Horoscope: 


lf one has got horescepe, then nole down those planets 
which are the significators of 6 and 11. Only those planets not 
connected with 8 and 12 will ever give profit. If a planet is the 
significator of 8 and 12 reject it, it is only fo cause loss. Therefore, 
you have to erect the horoscope of the native. Note down the 


1 feb * ASTRO SECRETS * 


significators. Find out those which are not connected with 8 and 
12 and select those which are the significators of 6 and 171 then 
work out the days when this group will conjointly be operating. 
Le. when moon will be transiting in the constellation of one of the 
planets, being the significator of 6 and 11 and among the sub of 
a planet which is also the significator of 6 and 11. Then only, one 
can be sure of gain, even when one runs bad time. 


Again on this Permutation Combination we should go through 
the V reader 154.155 and 156 which is reproduced. that explained 
the group of planets through Permutation combination, which 
explain the group of Planets through Permutation Combination, 
which act as Body Trap (that is Sensitive Point} Body Trap = 
apparently harmless object designed to explode when touched. 


You are now requested to go through VI Reader Page 138 in

sensitive Points of the Zodiac - Explained by Sri N.V.S. Rao 
Hyderabad 


| in his article "Promotion When", has explained and defined 
about the sensitive points of the Zodiac. His article is furnished 
for the benefit of KR students, as it is KP enlightened. 


The sensitive Zone is a point in the zodiac ruled by the 
fructifying signifcators of an event- especially the combinations 
of Dasa Lord and Bukthi Lord. By such consideration one can 
always predict accurately. 


The transit of the Dasa Lords should be the first consideration. 
The transit of Jupiter over a Sensitive point indicates the year of 
fructification of the event under consideration. The transit of 
luminaries Sun and Moon which are the exciting planets over the 
sensitive zones indicates the month and the day of the 
fructification of an event respectively.

Learned K.P.Author Sri. M.C. Khare defines:- 


"Sensitive Point" as - "The predetermined events tructity 
when the luminaries coincide in transit with directional Arc 
(Vimshothari System) of the Sensitive Zones over the Zodiac 
governed by the Heavenly bodies signifying the event" 


Then a single page from the article by Sri. S. Sivapadam is

PROMOTION —-WHEN 


(COURTESY) BY N.V.S. RAO, HYDERABAD 


You must and definitely be promoted on Wednesday 24-6- 
1970, on Satabhisha star day. This prediction was given to a 
relative of mine on 17-1-1970. The prediction was based upon 
his wife's horoscope as this Gentleman did not have his birth 
particulars. 


The Natal chart is as follows and ascendant of this Gentleman 
is taken as his wife's ascendant is Kanya.

The timings of birth was rectified strictly in accordance with 
the principles of KP 


A promotion is realisation of ambition of fame, name, 
prosperity and popularity. Hence 11" to 10" bhavas are to be 
considered. As a promotion in service results in increase in 
income 6" and 2° houses are also to be considered. 


Time of any event is most accuralely done only with the help 
of K.P’s universal rule that the common planets, between the 
fruitful significators, from house significators and fruitful ruling 
planets, be got as ata timings conjointly ruled by them - as per 
Vimshottari dasa system, and the transit of significators must 
invariably support. 


Fruitiul significators are those which are deposited in the 
Sub of significators of related bhavas. To cite a general example 
for promotion, a significator of any of the houses of 2,6,10 or 11 
should be deposited in the Sub of the significater of any of these 
four viz., 2,6,10 or 11 bhavas. Such fruitful significators are to be 
considered. 


The following is the exhaustive list of significators from 
various considerations:- 


) Planets deposited in the star of the occupants of a Bhava 
are the strongest signiticators of that Bhava. 


li) ifthere are no planets in the stars of the occupants, and 
if those occupants are in the slars of the occupants or the owners 


148 - ASTRO SECRETS 


of the related Bhavas under consideration of a matter, those 
occupants are also the strongest of the significators. 


li} If no planet has occupied a Bhava, then the planets 
deposited in the star of the owner of a Bhava are strong 
significators. 


iv} The Lord of the Bhava is a strong siqnificator of that Bhava 
only if no planet has occupied that Bhava and if no planet has 
tenanted the stars of that Bhava Lord. 


Il The planets which are conjoined with cr aspected by any 
of the above significator of that Bhava. (Western system of aspects 
is to be followed). 


lil A planet which is aspected by ancther planet which is in 
conjuction with a significator of a Bhava is also a significator e.g. 
For Aries ascendant Mccon in Mirugashira | pada in II Bhava is 
the strongest significator of 4° house as Mars is the low occupant 
of 4" house. [nsuch acase if Jupiter, being in Rohini star, conjoins 
Moon than any planet in 8" and 9"" houses within the orb of aspect 
of Jupiter is also a strong significator of 41 house. 


IV lf a planet "A" is in its own star and is a significator of 
Bhava B then the palnets in the other two stars of the same SIGN 
of which the planet “A” is the occupant, should be treated as’ if in 
conjunction with planet "A" and hence they will Become the 
significator of Bhava "B". 


V Ifa planet is in any of the star of the star Lord of cusp that 
planet will be a significtator of that Bhava, and if no planet is 
tenanted in the star Lord of a cusp, that very star Lord will Become 
the significator of that Bhava, 


VI Similarly, if a planet is in any of the Mars of the Sub Lord 
of a cusp that planet will be a significator of that Bhava. If no 
planet is tenanted in any of the stars of the Sub Lord of a cusp, 
that very Sub Lord of the cusp will be a significator of that Bhava. 


* RRISHAAMIRIE PADHDHATI- 149 


VIL A node occupying any of the signs lorded by a 
significators is more powerful than the significator itself. Hence 
reject the significator and select that node as a more powertul 
representative of that significator. 


By such considerations we will very frequently face a situation 
where in almost all the planets will be formed to be the significator 
but only a few of them will be formed to be getting the event under 
consideration. Hence the selection of fruitful significator is a vital 
task. for which the following procedure must be invariably followed: 


|. If a significator of a query happens to be the strong and 
single significator of a negating house, reject it outrighte.g. lfa 
significator of 2 or 7 or 11 for marriage happens to be the strong 
and single significator of either 6" or 10" house, that can never 
vote for marriage. 


Il. From the remaining significators, we have to select the 
fruitful significators, definition is given earlier as those significators 
which are deposited in the Sub of the significators of related 
bhavas of a query. 


A Bhava indicates various matters but a significator of that 
Bhava realises only a few out of them and to find out which few 
out of those various matters that significator signifies connected 
the bhavas signified by the singificator and take the resultant 
matter. To put it the other way, a significator of a Bhava signifies 
only that matter, out of the various matters governed by the Bhava, 
which results due to the combination of the bhavas signified by 
the significator and the sublord occupied by the significator eg. 
suppose there are three planets signifying the sixth house. If the 
Sub Lord of any of the significators signifies the first house, then 
that significator gives illness. If that Sub Lord signifies 1 and 12 
houses the significators gives illness and hospitalisation. If the 
sub Lord is the significator of 2 or 10 then it indicates service 
and gains or position in the occupation is to be read. Likewise, 
we have to proceed. 


150 - ASTRO SECRETS « 


Even at this stage of selecting the fructifying significators, 
we will find many fruitful significators but the fructifying ones will 
be a few only, and this' should be accomplished by the aid of 
ruling planets, the discovery of which by ouf GURUUJI has 
revolutionised the astrological world. The ruling planets are the 
guides inselecting the fructifying significators amongst the fruitful 
significators and all of them are not fo e taken for granted. In 
order of importance, the star Lord rising in the east at the time of 
judging any query (never take the time, when the query is put, 
for considering the ruling planets), the sign Lord rising in the 
cast, the star Lord in which the Moon is posited, and the day 
Lord are the ruling planets. Also consider those conjoined with 
and strongly aspected by them the following procedure must be 
invariably followed in selecting the fruitful ruling planets. 


1) Reject the ruling planet which is deposited in the star of 
retrograde planet. 


ii} Reject the ruling planet which is deposited in the Sub of 
a retrograde planet. 


iii) A ruling planet which is in retrograde motion and 
deposited in the star and Sub of planets in direct motion 
becomes a fruitful ruling planet only when it ceases 
retrograde motion, passes beyond the point of zddiac 
from where it has started retrograde motion and reaches 
a Sub the Lord of which is a fructifying significators. 


iv) Those ruling planets which are deposited in the stars of 
planets occupying or owning the bhavas not connected 
with the query are not the fructifying ruling planets. Reject 
them. 


¥) The following are the charactersitics of the fruitful ruling 
planets: 


vi) tt should be in direct motion. 


“KRistinawt KLL Portela © 151 


vii} It should be deposited in the star and Sub cf planets in 
direct motion. 


vill) The star Lord and Sub Lord where in the ruling planet is 
deposited must be the fruitful significators of the query 
under consideration. 


c) The star Lord and Sub Lord where in the ruling planet is 
deposited must be ihe fruitful significators of the query under 
consideration. 


By the consideration of above principle we can select the 
fructifying significaters of a query. Select that permutation and 
combination of planets tor Vimshottar! dasa system at which time 
all the fruitful significators transit is favourable. A Knowledge of 
primary and secondary directions (Western system of time of 
events) and Western aspect greatly simplifies the correct 
permutation which will be invariably the fruitfying time of the event. 


Transits: Immeasurable rules will be available in traditional 
Hindu System and Western system which are contradictory and 
conflicting with the same branch of rules and deeper one goes 
with those systems for correct predictions the more one will be 
confused and correct prediction will be a mirage even after 
decades of constant and intelligent practice. KP system of 
predicting event makes one predict ever accurately and never 
errignly. Hence, the following of KP need never resort to the 
ambiguous statements of prediction and to its and buts. 


K.Padvocates only ane rule for transits and that is universally 
applicable and that is universally applicable and yielding correct 
results invariably. 


selecting that time indicated by the permutation of fructifying 
planets - as per Vimshottari dasa system - when all the fructilying 
significators transit the constellation and Sub of the fruitfi' 
signficators of the query under consideration. This ° 
invariably correct. 


152 


The transit of the dasa lords should be the first consideration. 


The transit of Jupiter over a sensitive point indicates the year 
of fruictification of the event under consideration. 


The transit of luminaries which are the exciting planets over 
the sensitive zones indicate the month and the day, of the 
fructification of an event, respectively. 


The sensitive zone is a point in the zodiac ruled by the 
fructifying significators of an event - especially the combinations 
of dasa Lord and bukthi Lord. By such considerations one can 
always predict accurately. 


In the light of the theory given above, let us examine the 
horoscope under consideration for promotion in profession. 


For the above said reasons 2-6-10-11 houses are to be 


considered.

Here all the significators are fruitful, as the Sub lords of all 
these significators ae fruitful significators only Sun and Venus 
are weak in strength.

This matter was judged at 10 hours 14 minutes on 17-1 -1970 
when Jupiter. Star, in Jupiter sign was rising. Moon was in Sun 
slar, Venus sign and the day was a Saturday. Hence Jupiter, Sun 
and Venus are the ruling planets and Saturn and Rahu are also 
to be considered by virtue of Jupiter's aspect to Saturn and Rahu 
and all these are frutiful ruling planets. 


* KRISHNAMURT! Papiunrals * 153 


Rahu dasa, Saturn bukthi, Jupiter anthara operates from 24- 
2-4970 lo 11-7-1970. This is selected as Rahu, Saturn and Jupiter 
are found to be the strongest significator of this query. 


The exciting Sun's transit hints the month. Infebruary second 
half, Sun transits over Satabhisha. But the other fructifying 
significators do not have favourable transits. 


More over Saturn Is in the tenth house. Hence the realisation 
of higher position will be only at a delayed time. hence the later 
date should be selected. 


From Kanya Asc of the wife please note that Rahu is the 
strongest of the signficator by being the star Lord of 2-6-10 cusps, 
by being the strongest significators or tenth house dasa Lord. 
Hence the transit of Sun in Arudhra must be chosen 1.e. feam 
21* june to 5" july 1970. That coincides with Rahu dasa, Saturn 
bukthi, Jupiter anthara and Rahu Sookshama. 


Even during this period, the transit of the exciting planet 
Moon, indicates the day. To pin-point the date, consider the transit 
of Moon on everyday. On Satabhisha star day, the area ruled by 
saturn the bukthi Lord and the Rahu the dasa Lord, ie. On 24-6- 
70 everything is benifiting. 


Similarly the time of receiving orders should be calculated 
when the ascendant is a point governed by the strongest of 
fructifying planets and simullaneously the Moon be transiting in 
the Sub of strong fructifying planet. 


On this day all the fruitful significators were transiting the 
star and subs of fruitful planets. 


such lucid, simple. Clear and easily understandable prnciples 
which are universally applicable and which always yield very 
accurate results are available in no other system of forecasting 
the events other than the Krishnamurthy Padhdhati - Advanced 
Stellar astrology. High school standard is sufficient to master this 
science in a few months. Even with Ekalayva, Susrusha, it takes 


454 “ASTRO SECRETS » 


around an year whereas in other system, oné may spend any 
number of decades of constant and intelligent practice and yet 
correct prediction will be a mirage. For any single, event, 
hundreds of rules will be offered and none confidently can say 
before the event takes place which rule should be applied for 
what reason and why the other rules should not be applied. 
Fortunately those system are so vast that one can find some or 
the other rule, for psotmortem explanation of an event, ie after 
the event has occurted, in one of the other of innumberable texts. 


It is Krishnamurti Padhdhati and Krishnamurti Padhdhati 
alone which has universally applicable rules understanding which 
anyone can confidently declare, the time and dale of any event 
before hand. The querist can have maximum advantage only by 
consulting KP hence | strongly advocate and advise anyone 
interested in this divine science to follow Krishnamurthi’s 
Padhdhati and Krishnamurthi Padhdhati alone.

/WHO WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL 
ASTROLOGER? 


(BY COURTESY} SOTHIDAMANI (LATE} SRI. A.SIVAPATHAM, SRILANKA 


There are several requests from friends to enlighten them 
on the above subject. Traditionally there are many slokas and 
combinations to proclaim the astrologers from the charts but in 
practice they fail to confirm the truth of the slokas and infact 
contradict each other. As such, opinion varies from one to another 
on the same subject. On the aboves subject, | repeat what our 
late Guruji K.S. Krishnamurthi had mentioned, with some 
additonal information arrived at during the author's research along 
with some views to contirm his findings. 


To check up whether one will be a good astrologer or not, 
the horoscope should be cast very correctly according to K.R 


There are several Indian Astrologers and editors boasting 
about their systems and in the habit of writing scurrilous articles 
about them and their works under different pen names or through 
their assistants. Whatever their systems may be they fail miserably 
in their predictions and fail tao score atleast 20% of the 
performance when compared with that of others whose 
horoscopes will be discussed here in series. 


These traditional astrologers tune and harp the strings of 
Eastern or traditional systems and start condemning the western 
systems while at the same timings the language adopted to 
express their views, the dates and times selected to cast the 
horescopes are all western. When they think it over, it should 
enlighten them that the basic fundamentals under the Sun are 
same throughout the length and breadth of this universe while 
the application may be diiferent. All will accept these tree 
comments with malice to none as | do not hesitate to expose the 


156 As TREE SLORETS 


boastings of any self styled astrolgers who hoax the public under 
any type of systems whether traditional or hereditory or any other. 


According to Westerners, Uranus gives knowledge in 
astrology. Good aspects between Jupiter and Mercury is good 
for study and prediction. Uranus is good for invention and 
research; as such it is not suited for practical purpose. The 
Ascendant and the 9" cusp ff connected with Saturn and Mars, 
show that he will be a good astrologer. 


Saturn and Moon in 1,3,9 or 10 give desire to learn Astrology. 
Uranus with good aspects with Jupiter makes one a research 
scholar. 


Mercury forming good aspects with Uranus produces one 
with deep consideration and ability to judge properly and interpret 
correctly. 


Mars forming harmonious aspects with Mercury gives 
argumentative faculty, success in th material field and leadership 
in all pursuits. 


Harmonious aspects between Mercury and Moon, show clear 
exposition, proper wording and intuition. 


The Sub-Lord of the Ascendant should be the significator of 
the 9°" or 12° house. The 12™ house shows occult science while the 
9" shows higher studies of Philosophy, Religion, Astrology etc. 


Jupiter should be in the Sub, the Lord of which is the 
significator of the 9" orthe 12". 


Moon should be in the sub of a planet who Is significator of 
the 9" orthe 42". 


Any of these planets in the Sub ruled by the significators of 
10" shows name, fame, reputation and honour. 


Any of these in the Sub governed by the signiticators of the 
9" or the 12" gives sound knowledge. 


KRISTNARIUIRTT PARBIIATATI « 157 


saturn in the Sub of the significators of the 9m or the 12" 
gives sound knowledge. 


Planets in the Sub or constellation of occupants or owner of 
the 3a give opportunity to edit, print and publish of the 3ra house 
is connected with Mars. Otherwise one can only contribute 
articles. 


Good aspects between Saturn and Mercury, show that they 
will be exact, precise, methodical, good in mathematics besides 
forethought, persistence and reasoning ability. 


Venus and uranus in good aspect will confer titles. 


if Jupiter and Venus from a vigintile (18°) aspect, the native 
will be conferred a title. 


If Jupiter, Mercury and Mars are the significators of 2,10 and 
1+, he will be an editor or publisher. 


Jupiter and Mercury, significators of 3 and 9 will make him a 
journalist. 


According to the traditional method, Moon in cancer makes 
the native an astrologer. 


Those born in Sathabisha star or Sakuna Kama can learn 
astrology. 


Mercury in 1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10 or the 11 house. Venus and 
Mercury in 2nd and 3ra or Gemini lagna with Jupiter in 2 or Lord of 
2nd becoming strong make the native an astrologer. 


lf Mercury is in lagna or 4" or 7™ or 10” or Lord of 2na is 
exalted or if Venus is in Mithuna or Kanya or Dhanus or in its 
exalted position, the native will be an astrologer. 
New Findings 


Ifthe Sub Lord of the 2% cusp is in the 7” from 27° and 
becomes a strong significator of the 2na, the native will study or 


158 * ASTRO SUCRITS + 


know the shastras. The type of shastras has to be decided by 
reference to the planets. If rhe same Sub Lord aspects or become 
the significator of the 9" or the 12", it is definite that he will be a 
good astrologer or good in occult science. 


senstive Points in Astrology 


1. 18°00" to 18°30" in add signs and 11°30 toa 12°-00° in 
even signs denote "learned in shastras". This may indicate 
scientists, professors etc. 


2. 20°-30' to 21 °-00" in odd signs and 9°00" to 9°30’ in events 
signs denote "all scholars dealing with Vedas and Vedangas, 
well versed in astrology. Ayurveda and such subjects as they 
come under Vedangas”. 


3. 21°-00' to 219-30" in add signs 8°-30" to 9°-00" in even 
signs denote those "well versed in shastras, scholars ,teachers, 
ete”. 


4, 23°-00" to 21° -30" in odd signs and 6°-30' to 7°-00" in 
even signs denote accountants, statisticians, astrologers, 
astronomers etc. 


Now, we will consider the horoscope of “CHIJRO” who was 
very popular in the field or Palmistry, Numerology and Astrology 
for his correct predcition. This chart was send by a pentriend of

( TIMING OF EVENTS ) 


Sensitive point and Timing of Events are like Twin Sisters. 
We are dealing the Topic separately. To understand about this 
Timing of Events, students are requested to have a pictorial 
Zodiac Map and the Tables as Subs with them out side the book, 
as you find in this book. This will help your eyes to move along 
the track of the Zodiac of course on the Pictorial Zodiac Map 
along the Sign-Star-Sub, first thereafter in the Zodiac itself. 


The Supremacy of Indian Astrology is known to the entire 
world on account of the perfectness it has on the Timing of Events. 
No one has a second word to say on this, inspite of certain 
missing links, as explained by Sri. K.S.K. 


This Timing of Events was meticulously perfected by our 
beloved Guruji Sri. K.S.K who made use of - 


1. The Nirayana Zodiac. 
2. The Constellation theory. 
3. And his Ayanamsa derived from New Combe. 


Time:- 

What is Time? Time is a Measure but not the Time itself. Because 
when you say Time - it has the past - present and future. 

About Time - What the Dictionary says - 

Time - at the same time - at times - from = to - in no time - 
Timefand Motion - Time bomb - Time honoured - Time Keeper - 
Time lag- 

Time off, out - Time on - Time piece - Time Surer - Time Signal 
Time switch - Time table - Time Zone - Time tested - Time to come - 
Time te go - Time spent and so on. 

Timer- Person or device that measures time taken. 


On this word time, some amore reading has to .e.made 
which are elementary. Now the question arises whether we need 


160 _astnwo SECRETS - 


to knowall these details of elementary nature. By knowing these 
details you don't lose anything. You stand to gain for the simple 
reason you aré an astrologer and more so a KP astrologer. You 
have the occult experience within you, without which you would 
not have entered this field of Astrology. +, 


The general Public - the whole world Knows about this time 
more than you and me, as they have to be in Time at the Officer 
or Factory or School, Farm and so on. !f you miss an appointment- 


The general public knows one good joke and that it is 
Amavasya will not wait till the Purohith turn up. That is Time will 
not wait for any one. Time is precious. 


Time is all powerful only to be understood as Kalapurudha 
Lord Siva is known as Kala-Kaia, Kala one meaning is Space 
and Kala - the next meaning is Time. That is Space - Time. 


Astrology is a Science that deals with Time. 


Sun is the pace-setter. A time to show and a time to harvest. 
Time has a substance. This, the Time, unfolds through Sidereal 
activity. The primordial force that Creates, having created Protects, 
when worn out by its expiry nature Destructed, all the three 
emanates from the womb of Time to Speak through Sun and 
Sidereal activity. 


Time is ever potent. Carl Jung says - "Whatever is born or 
done this moment of Time has the qualities of this moment of 
Time". 


The commen Man if he does not believe in Ged he is asked 
to look at the fresh Cow dung from which within three days young 
larvae are seen. 


And the common Man if he does not believe in the Panchang 
he is asked to lock at the Grahana (Eclipse) which date and Time 
is correctly mentioned in the Panchang, much ahead of its 
occurrence. 


KAISHNAMUATI PabHiaadi - 161 


Therefore if there is no Sun, there is no Panchang - that is 
Time. Whatever the short comings may be we all must respect 
the Purohith community as a whole, because it is they who have 
the Panchang with them all the 24 hours, right since their age of 
6 and 7 at Gurukula till today. But we astrologers have taken up 
this Panchang in our hands only today. 


Man is in tune with the cosmic order of Time. Therefore the 
term. Time has a Role to play within the body of Man, through 
body Chemistry or bio mechanism. Man, the intelligent creature 
found this Time operating within him, as he observed his 
breathing. Breathing means one inhaling followed by one exhaling 
makes one breathing. It is explained as- 

Inhaling - SO Exhaling » HUM = SOHUM 


Very near to you, suddenly you find a Tiger or Snake, this 
SOHUM is stopped for a while dué¢ to fear. But pulse beat will be 
there. When the pulse beat count goes down - you know whal 
the (Medical) Doctor will say. 


Then the Time factor within Man through his mind and Body 
followers the Major Dasa one affer according to their Elements 
for good or bad. 


THE YUGA PERIODS:- 


We breath 21,600 times per day of 24 hours, that is inclusive 
of both day and night. This one day is the breathe of the Lord of 
the Earth. Therefore what is 21,600 days for human beings - is 
one day forthe Lord. Likewise for humans 30 days - one month 
and 12 months - One year. Therefore His one day is 60 years for 
human beings. His oné Month is 1800 years for human beings. 
His one year is 21,600 years for human being.

2193 Sub-Sub Lords = 1 Day 


19689 Sub-Sub-Sub-Lords = 1 Day 


Now let us know from a few KP scholars about this Timing of 
Events. 


1. KP Stalwart Sri.PV.K. PUNNESWARA RAC in his Book "A 
Treatise On Predictive Stellar Astrology" - pages 13 and 14 says 
COMMON PLANETS-:- 

-, 

As the ruling Planets have a definite bearing over the events, 
it is found that the common Planets between the ruling Planets 
and the selected significators will contribute for the fructification 
of the event. 


TIMING OF THE EVENTS:- 


Timing of the events is very important in predictive Astrology. 
No specific rules were laid down in the classical books. Much 
dapends on the personal skill and experience of the astrologer. 
But in K FP system, an event will materialise during the conjoinec 
period of the common Planets derived from the significators anc 
the ruling Planets. 


164 » ASTRO SECRITS « 


The following specific principles were laid down for timing 
of the events. 


if the 11° Cusp Sub-Lord happens to be a Fast or Slow 
moving Planet and posited in Movable, Fixed or Gommon signs, 
the results will be as follows: 


Fast moving Planet The event will happen 
Posited in: In a few: 
1. Movable Sign Hours 
2. Fixed Sign Days 
3. Gommon Sign Months 
Slow moving planet posited in : 
1) Movable sign Days 
2) Fixed sign Months 
3) Common sign Years 
FIRST METHOD 


i) While timing the events, when the event is to happen with 
in a few hours, the transit of Lagna is to be considered. 


li) ifthe event is to take place in a few days, Moon's transit 
will have to be considered 


ii) ifthe event is to materialise within afew months, the Sun's 
transit will have to be taken into account 


iv) ifthe event is to take place in some years, the Jupiter's 
transit will have to be considered. 
SECOND METHOD: 


The timing of the event can be done by taking into 
consideration the cross-transit of the Dasa lord, Bukthi lord and 
Anthara lord who will be within the common Planets. 


THIRD METHOD: 


For timing of the event the transit of Dasa lord, Bukthi lord 
and Anthara lord is to be taken into account. The event 


*"RERISHRAWERT! PADHDHATT = TéS5 


materialises whenever the Dasa lord or Bukthi lord or Anthara 
lord transits any of the three sensitive position viz., the Star of the 
Dasa lord is to be taken as the Star and that of the Bukthi lord as 
the Sub or vice-versa or inter-se-Dasa. Bukthi and Anthara lords 
during that Dasa, Bukthi and Anthara period. 


Note: if in any case Saturn becomes a significator of the 
relevant houses under consideration, Saturns Dasa or Bukthi or 
Anthara should be preferably considered for the timing of the 
event as Saturn takes the credit of giving the events while letting 
down his predecessor Planets. 


2. KP stalwart Sri. K.Namachivayam in his article “Marriage 
and Behaviour of Nodes" says. 


One of the difficult problems confronting amateurs as well 
as professionals in the fields of astrology is timing an event. It is 
always a hard nut to crack. Even stalwarts in the field of astrology 
are bound to err. It posed difficulty not only to our ancient thinkers 
On astrology but even now it is puzzling the mind of our research 
scholars in astrology. In spite of constant research and study 
undertaken both in India and abroad the mystery behind it is not 
yet fully solved. 


Every student of astrology is very much indebted to Prof. K.S.K. 
whe discovered the "Advanced Stellar System". Is “Sub Theory’ 
has solved the mystery to a very good extent and his method of 
selection of ‘significators’ for the fructification of an event is indeed 
a break through in the field of predictive astrology. Several 
occasions [ have arrived at correct period of an event without 
indulging in any elaborate calculations. But at the same time several 
predictions have gone wrong inspite of my careful and detailed 
calculations. The reason for it is not very far to seek. Future is not 
an open book which one can read it with all ease. When time 
comes, it unfolds all the events which are to take place in one's 
life. So timing an event is not an easy problem. To know everything 
beforehand, what time factor has in ifs store is definitely a thing 


166 s ASTRO SUCRIDS 


which no ordinary human being with all its limitations, can achieve 
or imagine to conquer. God only knows what is going to happen 
next moment because he is an all prevading entity. His 
perverseness and omniscience can only achieve what he wills. 
Devotion and intution will render help very much what one’s 
erudition and mathematical skill find to achieve. | have expenenced 
this aspect of astrology in the course of my reading horoscope. 


3. Sri. KSK, the architect of KP in his article "Traditional 
transit system - Defective ", in para 6 - explains about Saturn, 
relevant to Timing of Events. 


saturn relevant to Timing of Events- 

saturn is considered to be a delaying planet and occasionally 
a denying one depending upon the ownership and accidental 
occupation at the moment cf birth of the native. Whenever Saturn 
is in any manner connected with Moon or Mars or Jupiter, there 
cannot be delay. It can delay till its own, Le., Saturn period 
commences and when once Saturn sub period starts, it fulfills 
surprisingly suddenly and most satisfactorily. lf Saturn is said to 
be a delaying planet, it does not allow the lords of the previous 
sub-periods to offer the result which he is also entitled to give. 
When Saturn is really very much connected with houses 2, 7and 
11 by being the owner by being the occupant of the constellation 
of lord of 7, by aspecting the constellation of lord of 7, by 
aspecting 11 etc. and is conjoined with Mars, aspected by Jupiter 
etc., then Saturn does miracles with lightning speed. 


4. Sri K.Hariharan, under the article titled 


"SUB SUB AND ITS USAGE" - relevant to timing of events 
explains about Saturn - of the nine Planets, Saturn is the most 
Slow moving one. ittakes on an average of 2% years to cover a 
sign and rather roughly around 13 months, to complete the transit 
over a constellation. So it takes a few weeks to cover a SUB. To 
fix the day, while timing an event, the SUB, SUB also comes to 
your rescue. 


KRISHNAMURT] PADHDHATI ° 167 


The article said about is reproduced under the title SUB SUB 
AND ITS USAGE. 


5. Sri. Vaikary Ramamurthy - says 


Be it a birth chart or Horary chart - the Planets in the 11™ or 
the lord of +1" indicates whether the event to take place will move 
the timing of event, with a speed, or make it to slow. 


Amongst the AP, the Lagna Sublord decides the Timing of 
Event, of a matter. 


Lord of 711 oroccupant of 14" or Lagna Sub Lord, if they be fast 
moving planet - then the event is completed at a lightening speed. 
I they are slow moving Planets the event to take place will be delayed. 


6. On the Timing of Event, | too join the Stalwarts to add 
few lines- 


TIMING OF EVENTS: 


The Timing of Events can be understood by the example of 
a time-bomb, which explodes at the said time, it being triggered 
through a remote - control device. 


MbBdern scientists have accepted time as the Fourth 
dimension. A planet significators is the key to un-lcck the time of 
an event, and the AP's is the Master - key. 


okill, intuition, common sense, a good experience and soon 
are required infixing the time of Events. 


One basic fact must always be keptin mind. Timing of events 
is made on the basis of Dasa - Bukthi - Anthara - Sockshama 
that is period sub period and further smaller division of Planets 
and transits. 


A gem stone is appraised in terms of Sizé. weight and Luster. 
It should have no blemish at all like spots, cracks etc., and so it 
is with planetary periods. In KP. STARS and Subs are more 
Valuable than the gems.

168 “ASTRO SECKFIS «©. 


On Timing of events, in a Natal chart we go by Planet 
significators and transit. 


In a Horary chart we go by House significators supported by 
Ruling Planets, first to make out the common significators, then 
the truitiul significators, whese locations are the sensitive points 
of the Zodiac as Dasa/Bukthi/Anthara Stariord which ignite such 
sensitive flash points, during their transits in tune with transit of 
oun and Moon the exciting Planets, the two being last but not 
the least, as one more lighter is required and that is the Lagna 
transit, to arrive at the day, and time during a month in a year. 


On the Timing of Event a few lines from 
I¥ Reader Page 112 and 113 - Reads 


As often advised by Prof. Krishnamurthi, the transits of the 
Planets should also be taken into consideration so that it is 
possible to time an event accurately. 


It is necessary to take every one of the transiting Planets and 
relate them to their own birth positions and to the radical positions 
of all the other Planets and also to the cusps of the Houses in the 
birth horescope. Furthermore, the Planets in the various nakshtras 
and Sub divisions of the nakshatras according to Krishnamurti 
padhdhati should be given importance. Only then will it be 
possible to get the correct clue to the time when an event will 
culminate. 


I¥ Reader Page 219 


(Whenever one wants to find out the day of an event in any 
Bukthi or Anthara, one is note whether the Lord of Bukthi and 
Anthra are strong or the Lord of the constellation. The Lord of 
the constellation, if stronger, will give the results only on its day) 


VI Reader Pages 222,223 and 224. 
Will | be able to clear off loans? When? Sri. K.S.K explains 


*KRISHNAMURT! PACDHDHATI. 169 


The pages are reproduced. From these pages you will find 
Dasa/Bhukti/ Anthra is worked out, but there is no House 
Signiticators, then common Planet and so on. But Guruji has 
straight away taken the conjoined period of the APs and they are 
kept ready as Sensitive points of the Zodiac and the timing of 
event is set according to Sun transit onthe RP - (Conjoined period) 
area fixed as Sensitive points. What is said above - has to be 
understood, that the Horary Chart is prepared on 16-7-1960. 
Repayment starts from 22-1-1970. Naturally KP students 
beginners will be searching for House significators. 


The above said in contrast to what Sri. K.S.K explains in page 
124 - para 3 and 4- 


Since the call is to materialise in minutes or in hours one need 
not work out Dasa balance, one has to note only the movement 
of the ascendant and calculate when the ascendant will come to 
the position inthe Zodiac which is governed by the ruling Planets 
and also the signiticators of the Houses 3,9 and 71. 


A Planet which is the significator of 3 should also be the 
Significator of 9 or 11. Similarly the significator of 11 should be 
the significator of 3or 9. Such of the significators alone must be 
taken. {fa Planet in not the significator of 9 and 11 but is the 
Significator of 6 or 8 or 12, one can take it that, that particular 
Planet is not the significator of the third House. Similarly if a Planet 
is the significator of the 9 and it is also the significator of 6 or 8 or 
12, and it is not the significator of 3 or 11, then the party in the 
other end will be absent, only when significator of the 9" is also 
a significator of either 3 or 11, then alone he will answer the call. 
lf a Planet is the significator of the 11" House and not the 
significator of Sor 9, but is the significator of other Houses reject 
this Planet. Select those Planets which are the significators ot 
the 11” House and also the significator of 3or 9 or both. 


KP Astrologer Sri.N.Nataraj on Timing of Events says- 


170 ASTRO SLCRUIS 


What Sri.N. Nataraj has explained below is not the one, the 
Dasa Balance at birth followed by subsequent Dasas. It is the 
Planet Dasa- that is as we work out, for Moon at birth, every 
Planet in a Star the Dasa/Bukthi is worked out. We have already 
explained about this as to how KP stalwarts resort to Cuspal 
oUblord Dasa and or Planet Dasa to be worked out, when the 
routine Dasa/Bukthi started from Moon at birth eludes to give 
the clue of an event for Timing of Events. A Dasa Lord in whose 
constellation it is, offers the results of the constellation it is, offers 
the results of the constellation Lord has his own Bukthi. That is 
say - Mesha Lagna - Mars Dasa Lord is in the constellation of 
Jupiter and in the Sub of Jupiter. Jupiter is in the constellation of 
Jupiter and in the Sub of Jupiter. Jupiter is in Mithuna. Then it is 
certain, that Mars the Dasa Lord will offer first the resull of Jupiter 
in Mithuna (3'*) and then the Houses Dhanus and Meena (9& 
12). Now Mars Dasa - Jupiter Bukthi, Bukthi Lord Jupiter is in the 
otar of Saturn. Saturn is in Kanya . Saturn owns 10 and 11. 
Therefore Dasa Lord Mars, and Bukthi Lord Jupiter will offer the 
result of Houses 3,9,12 plus 6,10,11 (6,10,11 will be the Role of 
Sub i.e. Jup). 


Mars is in Kumbha in Jupiter Star. 
What Sri Nataraj KP astrologer says is 


Mars in Jupiter Star - Jup Sub - the result of 3-9-12 Houses 
will be predominant and the events arising out of 3-9-12 will be 
of greater importance's. Houses 6,10,11 operated gets only the 
second importance. 


AS paid above similar will be the result for Anthara, 
Ssookshama also - that Is 


Mars Dasa - Jup Bu. - Jup Anth. - Sookshama 
Mars Dasa - Sat Bu. - Jup Anth. - Sookshama 
Mars Dasa - Mer Bu. - Jup Anth. - Sookshama 


In this chart, the Sub Lord of 11* Cusp Le., fulfillment of 
aspiration is Venus. Venus is a strong significant, pertaining to 


KAISHNAMUARTI PADHDHATI + 171 


overseas travel because it is in the Sub of Jupiter (NOT 
RETROGRADE}, which is the Sub Lord cof 12" Cusp, and thus a 
healthy deciding factor related to foreign trip. Venus also plays 
an amazingly supporting Role, with parlicular emphasis on travel 
matters as itis the Sub Lord of cusps 1,3,7,9,11 all travel Houses. 
Further, Jupiter which happens to be the Sublords of cusps 
2,4,6,10,12 is posited in the Sub of Mercury placed in 3, a travel 
House. Jupiter thus, plays a leading Role in professional as well 
as travel matters. 


Now considering all the positive control of Sub as detailed 
above, let us analyse when the subject will be able to make up 
the trip, to secure the foreign assignment. The related Houses to 
be examined as explicitly stated in KP Horary Astrology, Advanced 
stellar System page 300 are 3,9,12 


Now the significant Planets connected with these Houses 
are Kethu, Venus, Sun and Saturn. 


Now according to Vimshothari Dasa system the subject when 
approached me was passing through Mercury Dasa, Sun Bukthi, 
Rahu Sub Sub period which was from 24-5-1984 to 10-7-1984. 
My friend met me, during the end of May 1984, during the course 
of which, basing the then existed ruling Planets, | predicted that 
he would definitely make up the proposed overseas trip between 
1 -6-84 and 7-6-34. 


Actually my friend lefl home on 3-6-84 for his onward journey 
to overseas, when he was passing through Mercury Dasa, Sub 
Bukthi, Rahu Sub Sub period, Jupiter sookshama. 


The day of the above departure was on a Sunday, when Moon 
was transiting the constellation of Jupiter (Sub Lord of 12" Cusp 
of Natal Charl} which tallies with all the above significators. My 
esteemed friend immensely thanked me for my prediction.

« KRISHNAMURTI Paty btialy - 17f 


4°? 


In Krishnamurti PADHDHATHI, the strength of a PLANET is 
assessed in terms of its NIRAYANA sign position, irrespective of 
its station in the beginning or in the middle or in the end of the 
sign. 


The assessment as far its significations and the nature of 
the result is that which is indicated by the BHAVA occupied by 
the Lord of the constellation: and also the results of the BHAVAS 
owned in it, there is no planet tenants that planets constellations. 


Whether the matters signified by a planet be fulfilled or nor, 
if one will meet with success or failure in attaining such matters 
signified, accomplishment of such matters or otherwise, delay in 
attaining them, any disappointment in the way of fulfillment, are 
judged from the lord of the SUB occupied by the planet finally. 


Ifthe Lord of the constellation denotes matters signifying 
marriage and the Lord of the SUB occupied by the planet is in no 
manner connected with the BHAVAS or VII or XI, then every 
attempt will be made during its period and Sub period, but one 
cannot finalise and celebrate marriage in that period. 


this is the essence of KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATHI. 


Further, a planet may not be the significator of marriage, not 
being VENUS the general karaka of marriage life, not occupying 
any of the 3 houses Il or VIl or Al and further not owing any of 
them. ‘Yet if that planet is in a constellation owned by either the 
occupant or owner of any of these 3 houses i.e. Il or VIl or Al or 
conjoined with them, it has the full signification to offer the result. 


Even then if the Lord of the SUB is not at all any one of the 
significators of the particular matter which is judged, then this 
planet will be rendered incapable of fulfilling that matter. 


178 » ASTRO SECRELS 


In this line of thought that is another point we have to closely 
waich. 


inthose cases where the Lord of the SUB ts to fulfill, buy yet 
ifthere are 2 planets in close conjunction in the same sign, same 
star and same SUB, one of the two gives, the other does not. Or 
the period and Sub period of one of the planets in the same 
sign, and SUB promising and happy results enjoyed and the 
period and SUB pericd of the other planet in the same sign, star 
and SUB is not. 


In such cases, SUB SUB distinctly points out which of the 
two planets will be favourable and which is unhelpful. 


All of you know well that SUN and MOON are in close 
conjunction on the New Moon day. Some birth, do take place 
during that roughly 4 hours of the exact conjuction of SUN and 
MOON. In the process of our close following the results of such 
births, we are happen to notice that people born between 14" and 
2/* April in the star ASWINI and it is natural they have KETHU 
Dasa birth. Then during VENUS Dasa successful educational 
career is enjoyed, and in the end puts into service. In the following 
sun period gets elevated in his service, and looks very fortunate. 
But Moon Dasa of 10 years, nothing happens to his credit and on 
the contrary some serious troubles he faces in his service life. In 
such position, when the SUB, SUB was worked out, one will 
certainly find that Sun who gave happy results was in the SUB, 
SUB of the significator of Xith Bhava where as Moon was in the 
SUB, SUB of Villth Bhava singificator. Further, while time an event, 
SUB, SUB is very useful to pin point the day or hour or minute of 
the same, by considering the transit of planets or the Lagna degree. 


Of the nine planets, SATURN is the most slow moving one. It 
takes on an average 21/2 years to cover a sign and rather roughly 
around 13 months, to complete the transit over a constellation. 
50 it fakes a few weeks to cover a SUB. To fix the day, while 
timing an event, the SUB, SUB also comes to your rescue. 


KRISHNAMURTI Paripuall ¢ 179 


Of the planets, Moon is afast moving one. It moves in a star 
on an average of 24 hours. So to cover a SUB, it takes 3 hours 
on an average. |o further reduce the time and arrive at the exact 
hour minute. SUB, SUB is very useful. 


Lagna degree moves in one sign in 2 hours approximately; 
and in the same manner in each star Lagna moves in 52 minutes 
on an average. So each SUB it moves for nearly 5 minutes to 8 
minutes even. To pin point the exact minute and second of an 
event, SUB, SUB alone is useful.

Your Mars is in Aries 18? 16 minutes. !t means tft is in Mars 
Sign Venus Star, Rahu Sub Saturn is in Saturn star, Saturn Sub. 


How to predict’? 

What is your ascendant? 
"Libra". 

What does each planet signify? 


Sun, Lord of 11 ,depositd in Rahu star Moon Sub in which 
House is Rahu? itis the 9°° House. Hence Sun will offer the maffers 
signified by the 9" House i.e, father, wife's younger brother, 
younger brother's wife grand child, next elder brother's elder 
brother, as regards relationship; other matters are higher 
education, long journey etc. Hence during Sun period and 
whenever a Planet transits the position cecupied by Sun through 
it is in Lagna 9s House matters will be enjoyed. Is there any Planet 
in Sun's star? None in that case Sun will also indicate Lagna 
Bhava results. (ff there is any Planet in Sun star, then Planet will 
give to a greater extent. Lagna Bhava results.) 


ls there Rahu or Kethu in Sun's sign No. Then its results will 
not be shatfed by or represented by any other Planet. 


lf there is any, then what are we to Judge’? 


lf there is any or there are many, those Planets situated in 
Karthi or Uthrapalguni or Uthrashada will give the matters signified 
by Lagna Bhava. 


So Sun will give both Lagna and 9°" House results’? 
Mas" 


How will it give’? 


182 « ASTRO SECRETS . 


“The nature of the result is shown by the Lord of the 
constellation by tts occupation. So 3" House results. 


Also, only when there is no Planet in its star, the matters 
signified by the Bhava occupied by it will be given. 


[ see". 


“You need not see. Hear attentively. Apply systematically. 
Arrive at each, methodically. Proceed patiently and properly; then, 
predict precisely. Now again you note". 


' "What is it Sir"? 


Sun rules Leo. 11* Cusp is in Leo. It extends upto 8 degree 
32 minutes in Virgo form 7 degree 32 minutes in Leo. In this 
area, there is no occupant. So you should take that Sun, owner 
of the Sign Leo, where 11 Cusp has fallen is the Lord of it". 


"Then". 


"As there is no Planet in Sun's star, Sun has to indicate the 
11° House matters also". 


"SO Sun indicates the results of the Houses 1,9 and 11. Is it 
correct, Sir". 


“You are very correct". 
"How will the above results be accomplished"? 
i mean, what is the source for this nature of result? 


"Source is to be judged from the matters signified by the 
Bhava or Bhavas owned by the Planet and also the Bhava 
occupied by it’. 


Right, sir, if you take another Planet and explain, | will have 
clear idea. You know that Saturn is in my Lagna Bhava and hence 
| am a little slow in grasping. | assure you, sir, that wen once | 
have learnt, then | never forget as | repeat what | learnt within 
myself.

Alright, take Moon. It is in Libra at t2 degrees 16 minutes 
Le.. in Venus Sign Rahu star Saturn Sub. Moon rules rohini, 
hastham, and sravana Stars. itis in Rahu star which is situated in 
9" House. Hence any Planet in Rahu star will give Sn House 
results. So Moon also will give 9in House matters. 


No Planet is in Moon's star. So the Bhava occupied by it 
being Lagna, Moon will give Lagna effects also. 


Further in Moon's Sign, the meridian alone is. In 10" House 
there is no Planet. So Moon is to offer 10" House results also as 
there is no Planet in its star. Hence Moon is te bestow the results 
of the Houses 1.9 and 10 during its periods. Sub period's etc. 
and any Planet transiting in the position occupied by Moon will 
indicate matters connected with the Houses, 1, 9 and 10. 


“The source will be form first and tenth Houses, as it owns 
the 10" and occupies the first Bhava". 


"Thanks sir, 


"Hello, you have asked about Mars Saturn transit. so hear in 
full about Saturn and Mars". 


Mars is in the 7" House. its stars are mrigasira, chitra and 
dhanishta. Hence Jupiter in dhanishta will give the results of 7m 
House. Mars is in Venus star Rahu Sub, Lord of the constellation 
is in Lagna. Hence Mars, though Lord of the Houses 2 and 7 and 
is in 7, yet will offer the results of the Lagna, second House 
occupied by Mercury. 


50, the second House matters will be given by the Planets in 
Mercury constellation and if there is no Planet, in Mercury star 
aslasha jyeshta and revathi, Mercury will offer second House 
matters. Actually there is no Planet in its star. Therefore Mercury 
indicates both the second and 7° House matters. 


The source will be through 9" and 12" Houses. As regards 
Mars the source will be 7" and 2” House and the resulis will 
relate to Lagna. 


184 “ASTRU SECRELS © 


saturn is in Lagna Bhava, it is in its own star, and Sub Mercury 
is also in Saturn's star. Therefore, Saturn as it is in Lagna Bhava 
and Mercury. In Saturn’: star show Lagna results. Mercury has 
another portfolio, ie., «ne 7" House. There source or in other 
words how it will be accomplished is judged from the House 
owned by it; they are 4 and 5. As there is no Planet in the 5", 5" 
House results also will be given by Saturn. Even though he owns 
the 4" House, as there is Jupiter in 4%, Bhava Planets in Jupiter 
Star or Jupiter himself will give 4° House matters through 6" 
House source. Saturn gives mostly through 5° House and partly 
through 4" House matters. Thus, one should analyse and keep 
ready, a ready chart wherein for each Planet, which Houses 
matters they will offer and which is the source for the 
materialisation of the nature of the result. 


Sun gives the results of the Houses 1,9 and 11 as there Is 
ho Planet in ts star and tt is the constellation of one in 3 and it is 
the owner of the 11*. The sources are 1 and 11. 


Moon give the results of the Houses 1,9 and 10 through the 
1" and 16" Houses. 


Mars will give the result of the first Bhava through the second 
and seventh sources. 


Mercury offers the result of Lagna, 7" andthe second Houses 
through 9" and 12" Houses. 


Jupiter offers the results of seventh, sixth and 4" House 
through the 3° and 6” House matters. 


Venus gives its resulls of 9" Houses, results through Lagna 
and 8" House matters. Saturn offers the results of the first and 
the 5" Bhava through the first 4t) and 6" Houses. 


Rahu will give the results of 9* and 12m Houses matters, also 
the second and the 7" House matters. The source will be the 9" 


‘KRISHNAMURTI PanHisHati « 185 


and 12" House. 


Kethu gives the first House, 7" House, 5” House and 4* 
House matters through the third and sixth Houses. 


lf Planet transits, tt shows the source of a result (which will 
be explained below). Transiting Planet indicates how a matter is 
Brought out. 


What is the matter? That is judged from what the Planet. 
Whose position the transiting Planet passes, according to which 
House matters, that Planet signifies. 


lf we take Mars as the Planet which transits the position of 
Saturn, Mars shows the source. Saturn indicates what aspect of 
life is signified then. 


As Mars signifies the first Bhava, the source is mostly first 
House, partly second and seventh. Saturn is the significator of 
Lagna. Hence Mars conjeining Saturn indicates good health and 
success in your efforls. To younger brother prosperity; to mother, 
poor health, and gains. To children, long jounery, to wife indiflerent 
health (Saturn is in Bhadhakasthana to mother and it is 
bhadhakasthana adhipathi to wife); to you elder Brother short 
journey. Gains by salesmanship or by taking agency' gets 
brokerage eic. if Mars conjoins Mercury younger brother 
unhealthy as Mercury is Bhadhakasthanadhipathi to him. 


lf Saturn conjoins Mars, your health is good. Younger brother 
gains. To mother reputation, success. Children long journey and 
pleasant; wife or pariner un-health: to your father loss to elder 
brother auspicious agreeable results. 


As in this example chart many have the connection to first 
House only, one more example will be of advantage.

Let us judge Mars and saturn. 


Mars is in 4" House; Jupiter, Rahu and Moon are in Mars 
sar, 4" House matters will be given mostly, fo a good extent, by 
Jupiter Rahu and Moon. But Mars is in Kethu star which is also in 
4. Hence Mars also denotes 4" House matters. Then Kethu and 
Mercury also indicate to a little extent. We are concerned with 
Mars. It is in 4, in the star of node in 4. So it gives 4™ House 
matters, i.é., it is connected with 4'° House. 


It owns the 5" cups and no Planet is in 5. So Mars gives 5" 
House results also along with Moon, Rahu, Jupiter and Kethu 
(kefhu conjunction Mars is the way How it gets strength for Kethu). 
There is a Planet in 12" Bhava. Hence 12” Bhava results 
attributable to Mars will be given to'a mild extent by Mars. Hence 
Mars gives the results of the 4" and the 5” Houses, through 5* 
House matters mosily, and through 12" partly. 


* KAISHNAMUART! PADHDHATI - 187 


saturn in 12 is in Mercury's star which is in 8m Bhava. 
Therefore Saturn has to give the 8" House results. The source 
will be 2, 3and 12. Therefore when Saturn transits at 8 degree 14 
minutes Aries and conjoins with Mars, 4" and 5" Houses maiters 
will come to forefront through the 2nd, 3’ and 8" House matters. 


As he is a boy of 10 years, regarding 5" House matter one 
should not predict love affairs. But one has to star, that nowadays 
most of the people are very ambilious and even a variacious to 
have gains with minimum pains by way of lottery etc. So he will 
speculate; source being 2, 3and 12 younger brother may buy (Sr 
House) and give (the 2™ is 12 to 3). Purchase by brother and getting 
it, willbe at that time; 12" House shows investment. This is a pleasant 
prediction for which astrologer will be thanked. Again it can be said 
that 5" House indicates profit to the opponent. 3° House indicates 
pocket. 2nq House money purse. 127 House loss. So he will be pick 
pocked on that day. Astrologer, in this case will be scolded. 


Mars results say, loss, which is correct? As Mars is in Jupiter 
Sub which has to offer. Wzstaners consider that the conjunction of 
Saturn and Mars is very evil. Here the prediction is given taking only 
the nature of Planet into consideration; nothing else. So, one should 
not apply universally to all. The results given by them is mentioned 
briefly. "One develops rash, hasty and even murderous tendencies. 
Uncontrol above anger, cruel, accident, surgical, disease, separation, 
eminence eic., our burst of temper demoralising tendencies ruins 
himself by committing rash acts a commit theft-seqander a way 
estale-sulfer from poxes, carbuncle, rheumatic diathesis etc". 


The above is applicable only when Saturn and Mars in a 
chart were deposited in the constellation and Sub of the 
occupants of the Houses 6, 8 and 12 which Is rate, ie., Lord of 
constellation and Lord of Sub of both Saturn and Mars must be 
so. Therefore, majority will never suffer. Only a few will, 


Individual chart must be suited and prediction offered. 
General statements is useless. 


GOOD LUCK 


188 - ASTRO See rer « 


(TRANSIT (2)} 


We all know that Vidhi Means Lagna -Destiny. 
Madhi Means Chandra / Moon - Mind 
Gad hi Means Raw / Sun - Fate. 


Therefore, we have the Birth Lagna, Chandra Lagna and Ravi 
(Sun) Lagna at Birth. 


There is a proverbial saying in Tamil which says - Vidhi Ketta 
mathiaya paar - meaning if Vidhi (Lagna) is spoiled look to Madhi 
- Moon (Chandra) Lagna. 


Here the irony is (out side our KP family) we hear some 
Astrologers saying when both Vidhi and Machi are spoiled look 
to Gadhi (Fate). When people are in acute distress, we often 
hear them. Saying - what is my (Gadhi) Fate? Did they ever said 
what is my ascendant (Lagna) vidhi or what is my Moon (Chandra) 
madhi. Therefore it goes with out saying when Lagna and Moon 
are spoiled you have to look to Sun - that is Gadhi - that is Fate. 
When all the three Vidhi, Madhi, and Gadhi are spoiled where 
shall we to turn and look for what? Of the three we have to look 
to Vidhi - Lagna only as explained by Sri KSK - why Lagna alone 
is considered? -lll Reader Page 259-260 reproduced. 


Now for the above average common man to understand 
about this Transit - let us see what the text book in Astrology 
says. 


1. Inthe Birth Chart planetary positions at birth are fixed in 
their respective longitudes. That is permanently fr-ed. 


2.  Butthe planets are always moving from star to star and 
sign to sign in varying periods, with varying speed. They 
do not take rest. 


3. While so-moving they excite the forces of radiation from 
the gigantic stars for good or bad to penetrate over 


KRISHNAMURTI Patwourii + 189 


everything on earth, and we human beings also subjected 
to these radiating forces. When we are subjected to it we 
under go Subtle change, physically, mentally and morally, 
for good or bad. We understand this and we are very 
clear about it. We have more than enough information 
about this transit from Sun (ct the west} and Chandra 
Lagna of cur Hindu system or Traditional system. Our 
Guruji has already said that both are defective. Then let 
us not waste our time and energy. We will stick to what 
KP says. 


Why Lagna alone is considered? 
Dear Sir, 


! find in your magazine, that since a couple of years, you are 
hot suggesting that the Moon sign should be taken in case the 
Lagna is afflicted and Moon sign is not. Why? 


Answer: 


sir, | had been following the above methed of taking the 
unatilicted ascendant or Moon sign, in case the Lagna is afflicted 
and Moon sign is not. But in my research, only in 1965 end, | 
understcod that when twins are born, Moon does not move even 
a single minute, whereas the; Lagna alone moves and when the 
research on the Sub - Lord, came out successful to read out the 
diametrically opposite results amongst the twins, | have given 
up the idea of taking Moon sign. In case Lagna is afflicted, it 
needed reconsideration. So, we must, whether Lagna is afflicted, 
then the horoscope has certain defect, and simply because there 
is that defect, we should not jump te Moon sign which is 
auspicious. Afler having found cut this, | have stopped writing in 
the above manner mentioned by you. Therefore, | request all the 
readers to take only the Lagna and never the Moon sign, whether 
Lagna is afflicted or not. 


Not only the Lagna is important, but the exact pesition of all 
the 12 cusps are also important, to note the advantageous or 


190 - ASTRO SECREIS - 


disadvantageous results signified by the houses - Bhava. The 
sub Lord of the cusp above offers correct solution of that house. 
The significators show the timings of event when the matter will 
be favourable or not. 


On the timing of events we very often come across the word 
Transit, which means Gochara. 


Gouchara means Go = Planets at present - Chara = Moving 
at present. In English we call it as Transit. You know about it. You 
have read about it. Still you know a little more. 


Transit - The passage of a planet by Ephemeral motion. 
Apparent passage of heavenly body across the disc of another 
or meridian of place. 


Ephemera - May fly any transitory or short lived thing. 
Ephemeral - Short lived, transitory. 


On the timing of events you have the Dasa/Bukthi/Anthra 
which are already there on the Niryana Zodiac, the Aerox copy 
of which is your birth chart on Horary Chart, and with the help of 
it you have to wait till that position having the period to come for 
an event to masterlise. You can easily understand this. | am 
making it still easier by a joke from the Magazine -"Wisdom" 


(A person was born on 12-11-1967, With a mischivous mind 
he purposely gave his date of birth as 12-1-1999 to have a 
computer birth chart. The computer was a little more cleverer 
than this fellow. The computer quick gave the reply - What till 
you are Born). 


Now imagine this Dasa/Bukthi/Anthara period to come, 
waiting on the Nirayana Zodiac as a bride who holds the love 
and affection as sensitive points. 


Now imagine this gocharaAransit planets - be it fruitful 
significators of Jupiter or Sun or Moon or Lagna as Bride-Groom 
who equally has the love and affection for the Bride- his would 


KRISHNAMURT! PabHDHATI « 191 


be wife - fo reach that sensitive points of 2-?7-11 to culminate in 
marriage. 


This example can be: applied for all events. 


We have now understood that the passage of a planet by 
Ephemeris motion is known as Transit. 


Transits put up a pressure of powerful influence over the 
other influences of planets in operation for a positive or negative 
result. Transiting bodies on their move that step over the places 
of other planets or over important places in the Astrochart, do 
not fail to ignite such sensitive points at that pin - pointed Hour- 
Minute-Seconds eagerly awaited for, to offer the results. 


sri KSK perfected the predictive system, applying the 
constellation and Sub theory. Whenever, a hitch was there he 
applied the ruling planets. Still further he turned his attention to 
day to day Moon transit in each of the Day's Star, which he divided 
into 9 subs, and observed which of the subs gave profit and 
which of the subs gave loss. The divine intution, our Guruji sr 
KSK had, made him decisively tell about a favourable Dasa and 
in it the favourable Bukthi - Lagna transit also is a must, when 
you work out the Moon transit on the day to day star, of what is 
Said above, ‘was advantageously made use of by Sri 
N Sundaresan and MrR Sundaresan Rao, in their day to day 
sale of pesticides since 1998 and is being continued till today. 
The same was explained by Sri Sundaresan. in his article under 
this caption- "The Golden Rule in KP" Vide KP & Astrology August 
1994 issue. The same is reproduced for the benefit of KP students. 
Day to day Mcon transit over a star, divided into 9 subs is also 
reproduced for reference. 


Sri N.Nataraj (KP Astrologer) says- 


1. On rectification of birth timings, observe the Sun trans: 
of the day when you work. Sun moving in which Sub that 
Sub will help you to correct the birth timings 


19? « ASTRO SN RLIIS + 


2. A planet in which Sub it is in the Natal Chart or Horary 
chart, during Transit the same planet moving in the same 
Said Sub operates the matter event. 


3. Planets during transit as and when they rub through the 
planets in the Natal Chart, and one should be very careful. 
Usually they create a sudden and undesirable results.

( THEGOLDEN RULE IN K.P. } 


Mr. PS. Rao, and myself are dealing in pesticides in Guntur. 
Our aim is profit. Our products are subjected to expiry dates. 


During February ‘92 first week we were holding stocks worth 
Rs.14 Lakhs. The Agriculture Season comes to an end by the 
close of February. During this time sales came to a sudden 3tand 
still, and there was no further enquiry from business people. 


Atthis time my frend PS.Raa asked me why not | work out a 
Horary for disposal of stocks. | though he Is joking and left my 
room. Next day my colleague asked me whether | had worked out 
the Horary number | am supposed to work out. He explained to 
me about the disposal of stocks. [hen | understood the senousness 
of the situation, took a Horary number from RS.Rao and worked 
the Horary chart on the models of - V reader pages 181-182 making 
use of the Daily Moon's transit in each star. This cloicked and the 
entire Rs.15 lakhs stock was disposed of in 15 days. 


On the same above model we had our sales during 92-93 
and had good success. On the strength of the success we wanted 
to increase our sales for 93-94. At this juncture | thought it is 
better to have some wise counsel. We therefore fixed an 
appointment with our Editor, on 26-6-93. When we reached 
HARIMANS we were informed that he left for Chidambaram and 
is expected back only after 3 days. As we had no time to wait for 
three days we contacted sriKMS seeking his guidance to operate 
sales through daily Moon's transit in each star in which we have 
to operate sales in each favourable subs of the day's star 
everyday. We are deeply indebted to Sri KMS for the guidance 
he gave in selecting the favourable subs. 


He having understood our approach through KP requested rne 
to provide all the daily sheets fo write an article and praised me to sky 
high stating that no one has done sales in this manner in the whele of 
India and Mr.N.s. is the only person having done sales through KP: 


$94 -'A-TRO CECFEIS + 


Now | am coming to the subject proper. 


The caption | have selected is from KP. and Astrology 
November 90 issue page 17 - right hand side - last four lines - by 
late V.N.N.Rangachar. This caption "The Golden Rule" is the 
quintessence in KP telling us how the cuspal sublord speaks 


and the planet sublord speaks vis-a-vis fruitful significators. 


Now what is the Golden Rule in KP- 


“Take the planets which are posited in the sub of the 
significators whose constellations are not tenanted”". 


Birth chart of Mr.PS.Rao is furnished wherefrom the Golucn 
Rule is applied in all ts thoroughness in our day to day sales. As 
our sales is operated throughout daily Moon's transit in each star 
every day, | am taking up planet by planet relevant to the birthchart. 


Our aim is profit in business

our desire is increased sales and increasing the Profits. 


For our daily Moon's transit, the Golden Ruk is applied planet 
by planet, in every star day on the split up of the star time hours 
to 9 subs of one star. As per birth chart. 


1. Venus - (The Planet) is posited in the sub of Mars-in 10" 
covering his own house Mesha 11" and his another house 
vrischika - the VI house. Mars constellations are not tenanted. 
No planet in the VI house. 10-11-6. Therefore Venus will give the 
resulis of 10,11 and 6m houses as Venus as the strongest. 


2. Mars - Mars (The Planet) is posited in the sub of Mars is 
10" and all the details as said above. [Therefore Mars also will 
give the resulis of 10,11 and 6™ houses. Mars is the strongest. 
10-11 -6 


3. Rahu - X Cusp sublord is Rahu. No planet in the stars of 
Rahu. Therefore Rahu is a strong significator of the xth house, 
even though he occupies the 9°". Rahu is in the sub of Mercury. 
sun is in the star of Mercury. Therefore Rahu emerged as the 
strongest as the cuspal sublord but got the status stronger, as 
Rahu is inthe sub of Mercury and in Mercury star Sun is. Therefore 
Rahu as a planet is stronger but not strongest. 10-1 -4. 


4. Sunis inthe Sub of Rahu. No planet in Rahu stars. Sun is 
in rapt conjunction with X cusp sub Rahu. From not a strong 
position Sun gets the strength because it Is in the sub of Rahu 


« KAISHNAMLATI Paniiuilari = 19? 


and Rahu is a full significator of X house, but Rahu is in the sub 
of Mercury which is tenanted. Therefore Sun as a planet is 
stronger but not strongest. 


5. Xl cusp sub lord is Moon. - Moon is inthe X. No Planet in 
the stars of Moon. But Moon is in the sub of Sun to give the 10" 
House results only. There are planets in the sub of Sun. Moon 
seemed to be the strongest but being posited in the sub of Sun, 
Moon gets the status stronger but not the strongest. 9+10-3. 


6. Kethu - is in the star of Venus in Xl and sub of Mercury in 
X. Sun is in the star of Mercury. Therefore Kethu is not the 
strongest or stronger. - Kethu is strong only. 10-1-4. 


7. Mercury- is in the star of Kethu in 3ra in the sub of Mercury 
in X. Sun is in the star of Mercury. Therefore similar to Kethu 
Mercury is not the strongest or stronger, but only strong. Mercury 
is strong only. 10-1-4 


8. Jupiter - is in the star of Saturn and in the sub of Saturn in 
dra, Which is an improving house. That is all. There are no planets 
in the star of Saturn. Therefore Jupiter is capable of giving the 
results of house 3-8-9 only. Rahu and Jupiter are in the 9%. 
Therefore Rahu does all the work for Jupiter in terms of Houses 
fand .10. Therefore Jupiter is not be seriously taken as a 
signiticator for business. Jupiler can give only a helping hand. 3- 
8-9 


9. Saturn is in the star of Sun (Sun is in rapt conjunction 
with X cusp) and is in the sub of Saturn in 3°. No planets in the 
star of Saturn. Therefore Saturn cannot contribute to business 
matters. To the contrary he weakens Jupiter and Sun by 7" Aspect. 
Sun and Saturn are natural enemies. We have observed whenever 
Sun is moving in Saturn stars, or at the time of applying and 
separating conjunctions with Saturn we always had problems 
which were sudden and time consuming to overcome the 
problems. 3-8-9 


198 «#4sreo SECRETS 


Besides Saturn being lord of 8 and 9 from Lagna he is lord 
of 10 and 11 i.e., from Mocn, Saturn badakathipathi. Saturn tell 
us "touch me not" Thanks to Sani Bhagavan with due respect. 


To conclude on the above analysis made we found that 
whenever Moon transits the stars Bharani, Poorvapalguni and 
Poorvashada our sales was always double the normal or average 
sales. We are very much benefitted in our sales making use of 
the daily Moon transit of the star day over the 9 subs.

Whether one invesis money or incurs expenditure or repays 
loan, judge the 12” cusp and find out whether the Lord of the 
Sub of the 1+2'" cups is either retrograde or deposited in a 
constellation whose Lord is retrograde. One cannot either invest 
or repay loan. If the sublord and Lord of the constellation in 
which the Sub Lord is situated, is in direct motion, then one will 
invest or repay loan. [ff it is Saturn, then there will be delay and 
some obstacles to repay. ff it is Mercury, one will correspond, 
send agent and repay in installments. If it is Jupiter, by lawful 
means all the legitimate amount will be repaid. If Mars, is the 
sub Lord, the lender threatens and then the borrower repays. If 
it is Venus, with a spirit of compromise and sweet words one 


200 - ASTAO SECRETS ° 


repays. If Sun is the Sub Lord, through the help of either father 
or Government Officials one repays. If Saturn aspects the Sub 
Lord, may itbe any planet, one repays only a part of the whole or 
repays part by part. 


To note Sub Lord, the number given by the querist within 
249 is to be used. The number given here is 20and the Horary 
chart prepared from this number according to K.R, with the 
planetary position tat the moment of judgement, is as given above. 


In this Horary chart the 12" cusp of 21'".03' Pisces, i.e. in 
Jupiter sign Mercury star Venus Sub. The Lord Venus is in direct 
motion. It is deposited in the constellation of Moon who Is never 
retrograde. This shows that you will definitely be able to repay 
your loan. 


To know the time of repayment find out the ruling planets at 
the moment o Tf judgement i.e. at 7.30 PM. LS.T. on 16-7-1969. 


The day is Wednesday - Mercury rules. Kethu occupies the 
sign Kanya owned by Mercury. Take Kethu. (Nodes represent 
the planet or planets with which they are conjoined, the planet 
which aspect them and the Lord of the sign in which they are 
deposited). To-day Moon is in its own sign and Mercury star. 
Lagna is Makara owned by Saturn. 


Therefore Mercury, Kethu, Moon and Saturn are the ruling 
planets. 


All the ruling planets are not always beneficial. When they 
are deposited either in the constellation or Sub of a retrograde 
planet, they wilt ultimately prove to be tempters. In the present 
case none of the ruling planets is placed in the constellation or 
sub of retrograde planet. Therefore they are all beneficial. We 
have already seen above that the repayment will be little lesser 
than the full amount and that too will be in installments. These 
installments will be paid in the conjoined period o f the ruling 
planets. Balance of Mercury Dasa is 9 years 9 months and 29

days from 16-71969. In this, Moon Bukthi has already 
commenced on 15-6-1969. This will run upto +5-11-1970. 
Therefore the various periods of repayment of the loan will be as 
follows:- 


(a) Mercury Dasa Moon Bukthi Saturn Anthra from 22-1-1970 
to 13-4-1970. 


(6) Mercury Dasa Moon Bukthi Mercury Anthra from 13-4- 
1970 to 25-6-1970. 


(c) Mercury Dasa Moon Bukthi Kethu Anthra from 25-6-1970 
to 25-7-1970. 


The actual dates of repayment of the various installments, 
based on the transit of 


sun during the above periods, are as below:- 


(a) 22-71-1970 - Sun transits Moon star Mercury Sub in the 
sign Makara. 


(ii) 23-3-1970 - Sun transits Saturn star Mercury Sub in the 
sign Meena. 


(iii) 22-4-1970 - Sun transits Kethu star Moon Sub in the 
sign Mesha. 


(iv) 7-6-1970 - Sun transits Moon star Mercury Sub in the 
Sign Rishaba. 


(v) 25-7-1970 - Sun transits Saturn star Mercury Sub in the 
sign Karkata. 


TRANSIT OF PLANET IN SIGNS 
STAR AND SUB IN [996 


This publication is an attempt to fulfil a long-felt need of KP 
followers. A few of the purpose served are listed below: 


202 * ASTRO SLORLIS 


|. Transits and Dasa Bukthi 


Guruji Sri .S.Krishnamurti had stated on several occasions 
hat one's current Dasa Bukthi and transits agreed 100 percent. 
This publication provides the daily transit of all the planets in 
sign, star and Sub for the entire year 1996. 


?. Future Predicitions 


Future predictions can be given by considering the transits. 
lf one's Dasa, Bukthi and Anthra help to offer predictions nearest 
to the day, transits of planets help to offer predictions correct to 
the Hour and Minute. 


3. Favourable and Untfavourable Results 


lfthe most favourable results are experienced on a particular 
day and timings, check up the transit of Dasa Lord and Bukthi 
Lord in sign, Star and Sub. One can notice that the transit is in 
those of the Signiticators of the relevant cusps. Similarly, 
unfavourable results can also be checked up with reference to 
transit of Dasa Lord and Bukthi Lord in unfavourable sign, Star 
and Sub. On the basis of such a careful study, similar future 
predictions can be given. 


4. Rectification of Horoscopes 


Horoscopes can be rectified if one finds that the Dasa Lord's 
transit in a particular Star and Sub brings good results and in an 
another Star and Sub brings Bad results. 


5. Judgement of Horary chart 


Horary charts can be taken up for judgement quickly as all 
the Planetary transits in Sign, Star and Sub and Sub are given. 
Moon's transit in subs is given from 5-30 am on every day. 


6. Planetary positions for Horoscope 


Planetary positions for Horoscopes (for births taking place 
during 1996) can be worked cut as the longitudes of all the Planets 
and sidereal time are also given. One can note down the Sign, 


* KRISHNAMUKRTE PABHDHATI * 204 


star and Sub positions directly and quickly. Thus it serves more 
than the Ephemeris. 


7. Magazine predictions 


Daily, weekly, monthly and annual predictions in newspapers 
and magazines are offered purely on the basis of transits. If 
receipt of money is predicted during a month in moSnthly forecast, 
money is received on a day or afew days only and noton all the 
30 days in that month. Actually, when money is received? It is 
when the transit takes place in the conjoined position of 
significators of 2nq and 11" Houses. Checkup the transit. 


8. Moon Reflects Mind 


In a Horary chart, the Sign, Lord, Star Lord and Sub Lord 
position of Moon at the timings of judgement exactly reflects the 
mind of the enquirer. Moon's position in this publication is given 
from 5.30 am daily. Find out the House or Houses in which 
Moon's Star Lord and Sub Lord are transiting at the timings of 
judgement. They reveal the secret and also the nature of enquiry. 


9. To know the right timings 


When a work is to be completed successfully, it must be 
commenced atthe right time. The time is when Moon transits the 
significators of 1" and 11” houses. Your current Dasa Lord and 
Bukthi Lord also should transit favourable star and Sub Lord 
positions. Find them out quickly from this publication. 


10. Chandhrashtama 


Moon's transit of 8th House is referred fo as Chandrasniama. 
8" House consists of 3 star Lords’ extent or roughly 30 degrees. 
Transit in the 8" brings hurdles. This happens especially when Moon 
transits your 8" House Star Lord's Stars. If you want to avoid 
unnecessary troub'e, worry, headache, failure, disappointments, 
delay obstacles and hurdles, avoid important works during Moon's 
transit in the 8" House Star Lord's Stars. But the trouble is, you 
cannot avoid. You will get involved and worry. 


Z04 ®* ASTAHO SECRETS = 


similarly, Moon’s transit in the 12° House Star Lord's Stars 
will give you unnecessary expenditure, investment, unavoidable 
delay, ill health, failure etc. 


Similarly results will be experienced when Dasa Lord and 
Bukthi Lord transit the 8" and 12" House Star Lord's Stars. These 
problems cannot be avoided or overcame. But you can be at 
least a bit cautious. Please note that the 8" and 12" Houses are 
counted from the Ascendant and not from Moon's Rasi. 


Note the Sub Lord of Bin and 12" cusps. The transit of Planets 
in the 8" and +2" cusp Sub will give similar results. For instance, 
if a person's Ascendant is Leo, his 8" cusp is 342 degrees, 48 
minutes, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars and Sign Lord, Star Lord and 
sub Lord respectively. The 12"cusp is 103 degrees, 49 minutes. 
It refers to Moon as sign Lord, Saturn as Star Lord and Rahu as 
Sub Lord. If planets transit in Saturn Stars (Poosam, Anusham 
or Uthrattathi) there will be general failures (plus 8" House results) 
because Saturn is &" House Star Lord and 12” House Star Lord. 
t will be maximum when the transit is in the 8" cusp Sub Lord's 
position i.e. Mars in this case or Rahu who is 12" cusp Sub Lord. 
Transit need not in all cases take place in the 8” or 12" Houses. 
For instance, the transit is in 222 degrees 07 minutes. It refers to 
Mars as sign Lord, Saturn as Star Lord and Mars as Sub Lord. 
This combination of Saturn Sub refers to 8" House and therefcre 
8" House results will be experienced. though the actual transit 
takes place in the 4" House. So the transit of Mars and Saturn 
as star Lord and Sub Lord or vice versa give 8" House results 
irrespective of whatever House is transited by a planet. (For 
instance, in the case of our RM. Rahu its transiting first house on 
?7.12.1995. But Rahu's transit in Venus sign, Mars Star, Mercury 
Sub signifies 8" cusp which is not at all desirable from longevity 
point of view.) 


The source of result is to be ascertained from the nature of 
Planets. [n this example case, Sun ts the ascendant Lord. If Sun 
transits this combination, this individual will experience 8" House 


* KRESS aAMERTE PABHDHATI « 205 


results. There will be troubles from father of the native and 
government also. If it is Moon, trouble is from unexpected 
sources. If it is Mars, trouble is to and mother, father landed 
properties, household goods and also from brothers, police, 
sharp weapons etc. as Mars, as karaka for brothers and Police. 
lf Mercury transits the avb9ove, Mars, Saturn combination trouble 
is from friends, elder Brother and money matters. There will be 
trouble relating speech and eyes also as Mercury in this case is 
Lord of 2. If Jupiter transits in this combination, trouble is from 
children, court etc. If Venus transits, trouble is from neighbours, 
younger brother, job, ladies, servants etc. Thus the source and 
nature of trouble is to be ascertained on the basis of one's 
Ascendant. 


similarly, receipt of money is to be predicted by considering 
the transiting Plant's ownership of Houses and 2na House 
significators. For each House, if the combination of Planets 
signifying that Houses is correctly worked out predictions relating 
to that House can be given by looking at the TRANSITS. 


11. Results Experienced by Twins 


In the case of Twins, Ascendant Lord, Planetary positions, 
Dasa balance and Dasa Bukthi will be more or less the same. 
But why there are vast variations in the results experienced by 
Twins? Guruji Sri K.S. Krishnamurti’s discovery reveals the 
reason. Even though the Ascendant Lord may be the same, (in 
some cases, even the Ascendant Lord may change, if it is the 
Starting point of sign) the Star Lords of all cusps in some cases 
and Sub Lords cf all Houses are ditterent in the case of Twins. 
This explains the ditlerences in resulis. This is the essence of 
KP When these principles are applied to transits, even though 
the Dasa Lord and Bukthi Lord are the same of the Twins, the 
star and Sub portion transited by them signify different Houses 
for the Twins and hence the difference in results. Check up the 
transits in this publication to understand the differences. 


206 _ASTROSEKCRETS - 


12. Aspects & Conjunction 


During the transit, the planets aspect certain Houses. All 
planets aspect the 7" House. Mars aspects the 4m and 8" Houses 
also. Jupiter aspects 5° and Sin Houses also. Saturn aspects 3'° 
and 10" Houses also. Find out from this publication which of the 
Houses in your Horoscope are aspected and which planets are 
aspecting. Count the Houses from ascendant or ascendant Lord 
or Dasa Lord or Bukthi Lord or all of them are aspected by Mars, 
you will be rash in your behaviour. You will have a hot 
temperament. Your BA will shoot up. You will get injuries and 
accidents. lf Jupiter is aspecting, you will have a divine outlook. 
Your thoughts will be just and reasonable. You will visittemples 
and undertake religious pilgrimages if your 9" House and 9" Lord 
are aspecied by Jupiter. if Venus is aspecting your ascendant or 
ascendant Lord, you will be after the opposite sex. You will look 
at things artistically. You will appreciate love and beauty. If Saturn 
is aspecting your ascendant or ascendant Lord, you will be dull 
and slow. if your 10" House is aspected by Saturn, your job will 
be dull. If itis 7" House, marriage will be delayed. Similar results 
will be experienced whenever your ascendant Lord is in 
conjunction with planets. Hindu aspects are given in p.420 to 
p.126. You can check up all these things and master Astrology 
by a regular perusal of this book. 


13. Cause & Effect 


Nothing happens without a reason. Even minor incidents 
are as a result of Planetary transits. When you have a severe 
cold if you check up, you will find your Ascendant Lord is transiting 
in a watery sing and in star and Sub positions which signify 6” 
and 12° Houses. If you develop skin diseases suddenly, you 
Ascendant Lord Dasa Lord or Bukthi Lord is in conjunction with 
Rahu or transiting in Rahu Star. If you have a lot of confusions, 
you will find Kethu in conjunction with you Ascendant or 
Ascendant Lord. When Sub aspects, you get favours from the 
Government. You prove to be clever when Mercury is aspecting. 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI + 207 


You will be on the path of discover, if Uranus is in conjunction 
with your Ascendant Lord while in transit. Your behaviour will 
also be somewhal strange. 


What more do you want from the publication? Take this book 
wherever you go. Ina horse race, game of cars, crickel etc., you 
will be able to find favourable times. 


14. Waich Others Horoscope Also 


The Horoscope of one's relalives and those of national leaders 
also can be closely observed by comparing transits and events. 
For instance, our RM’s Horoscope can be observed. Date of Birth 
28.06.1921. Time 13.00.20 I.3.T. at Warangal. | cusp 175-20-21

Hahu transits Venus Mars Mercury. This date is not all good for 
longevity. Rahu fully signities first house. 


15. Diary of Events 


For the sake of comparison, maintain a diary of events, 
grouped according to House signification. | House success |! 
Receipt of money Ill communications I¥ Purchase of assets V 
Pleasurable pursuits Vl Debts, diseases VII Matrimonial & 
Partnership Vill Accidents etc. |X Visits to temples X All matters 
relating to job Al Gains All Losses & Failures. If events of the 
same nature are studied with reference to transits, it will be 
possible to establish the signitications of Houses. For instance, 
whenever Moon Star Jupiter Sub or Jupiter Star, Moon Sub is 
transited, there is receipt of money. Then, Moon and Jupiler 
signify 2nq House and 11"House. Similarly, Sub is transited there 
is trouble then Saturn and Mars must signify 8" and 12° Houses.

praise go to our Guruji Sri K.S. Krishnamurti. 


* KAISHNAMURT] PADHDHATI + 209 


( HORARY ASTROLOGY ) 


Guruji: Sri K.S.K. has explained about this Horary Astrology 
in Vl Reader from Pages 14 to 18. Therefore the same thing need 
not be repeated. However a small detail is explained. In page 16 
(Vl Reader) - under the Head Not Numerology - Sri K.S.K. Says- 


"There number indicates the Ascendant for that Query and 
he (Astrologer) Calculates the position of planets for that moment 
of Judgement and then judges the result". 


In page 15 (VI Reader) first para Sri.K.$.K. says- 


“It is the divine force which works and enables the astrologer 
to predict. The number that he gives depends upon his past action 
or karma as well as the future results he is to enjoy just as the 
moment of birth is the effect of his past karma. 


Our KP Horary has drawn enough inspiration from our 
ancient texts like Prasana lantra, Jinendramala, Prasna 
Aaroodha, Prasna Marga and so on. 


Horary is closely connected with Karma. Horary means a 
question made at a particular time - Hora = Hour - a query by 
the querent for which a result is answered, by the KP astrologer. 


Prasana Aaroocdha - what is the correct meaning that we can 
arrive at. 


Prasana means - Query. 
Aaroodha means - Direction where one stands. 


We often say Lord Siva as Rishaba aroodha and Lord Vishnu 
as Garuda Aaroodha - meaning. 


Rishaba or Garuda stands, on which Siva is rising or Vishnu 
is rising - that is mounted. 


210 » ASTRO SECRETS = 


In the same way Lagna is rising. Every 4 minutes a fresh 
degree on the Zodiac Is rising. That is a fresh Lagna is rising - 
mounted on the Zodiac. 


The urge of the querent was when he will construct a house. 
He had some work on hand for a few days and he could not 
meet the astrologer. On one Sunday he decided to meet the 
astrologer, and started from home, with the full urge at 3.00 PM. 
and reached the Astrologer at 3.30 P.M That means during this 
30 minutes travel he had 7 full lagnas rising. Now which one of 
the 7 lagnas we should think of. The traditional astrologer will 
take the Lagna rising when the querent puts the Question, if he 
is free to start the calculations immediately. Otherwise he will not 
down the time and work after some time. In this the thinking of 
the Astrologer on account of the belated work - his urge will be 
missing. 


That is why Sri.K.S.K. says to have a KP Horary Number (t- 
249) which established the rising Lagna of the Querent on his 
urge and the astrologer when he starts the work his urge is also 
a fresh one -a fresh Lagna. [he strength of the urge of the querent 
by Number and the urge of the astrologer at the work time made 
our KP Stalwarts to evolve the famous "Gulbarga Theory" which 
is popularly used for short technique predictions. That is the 
Horary Number Sublord should be either Ascendant Star Lord 
or Moon Star Lord in the KP. When that is so success - is the 
reply to the querent. 


There by we are not making any claim that KP Horary is the 
best. We are making a.bold and tall claim that ONLY KP Horary is 
the best. 


For example - we all Know that VIMAL people wanted to 
increase their sales turn over. They called for Suggestions. One 
person suggested the banner tithe ONLY VIMAL - After this ONLY 
VIMAL - their sales turn over reached a new peak over others. The 
person who suggested the title had the reward of Rs.One lakh. 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI » 211 


Similar to correct birth times, in Horary also, the public also 
some times approaches with a lose thinking. For the number 
given prediction fails. Guruji has clearly said that if the Moon 
does not reflect the query, not to proceed further with further 
calculations. A few of the consulting public even comment - as 
to - what prediction the astrologer is unable to give over a birth 
chart, can the Horary chart speak better? Even when you convince 
them, and take a number, it will not give any result as the very 
faith is warning, why go the Moon and Lagna sub. Such of the 
public on the consulting day may be having the effect of Moon 
on Mind and Body. It is explained by a Diagram and a small 
illustration. 


EFFECT OF MOON ON BODY: The Moon is the satellite of 
the earth, and being very near to the Earth, it has great effect on 
the water on the earth. The obvious proof of this is, that the time 
of tide and ebb changes daily alongwith the Moon day. 


212 


From the rotation of the Moon around the earth, you will 
observe that on the 4", 5", 6) 117 14*, and 15%, 191°, 294 26" 
and 29/307 of Moon - days, the earth and our body come directly 
against the Moon. At that time the walter level in the sea and in 
our body rises. 


It will also be observed that on the full Moon day or the New 
Moon day, the effect of the Moon is most powerful. 


Hints forjudging a Horary chart, an article for Beginners from 
the KP archives is reproduced. 


Further a Horary Number on a particular matter will tell every 
thing about matter only. For example - a person he / she tells a 
Number for marriage, we can answer about marriage - say bride 
groom, his Whereabouts, his profession and so on. But one 
should not ask on thal number when the Bridegroom will 
construct a House. Late Sri. N.Krishnamurthy says - Readers 
should not take it amiss or take it for granted that a hundred 
questions, irrespective of the subject matter, can be judged from 
one and the same Horary figure. 


Once the prediction is made, the Horary (Number) chart 
cannot be probed further extending on its Dasa / Bukthi. When 
predictions fail on a Horary (Number) chart, we must take a fresh 
Number, after some time. Students are requested te go through 
Astrosecrels and K.PPART - I for little more understanding - by 
sr.M.P Shanmugam, who further says - Generally the Horary chart 
will answer only the query for which it is intended, but not other 
queries. At the same time the astrologer must Understand the 
query, the manner, the situation, and the circumstances in which 
the query comes out. For immediate precise, and correct 
prediction the Horary chart is the best.

(FOR BEGINERS ONLY) 


he efficiency of KR System in pin pointing the future events 
is beyond doubt or debate now. However, for a beginner, the 
materialisation of an event and its time still seems to be a hard 
nut to crack. For various research scholars after years of 
dedicated research work on the lines suggested by late Prof. 
Krishnamurti have found out certain sure methods which the 
beginner find it difficult to comprehend as the material has 
scattered in various issues of the "Astrology and Athirshta". The 
book on Horary Astrology (Reader VI), no doubt, ever provides 
a beacon light on the subject, still beginner finds it difficult to 
correlate various problems and hence feels shaky in venturing 
predictions. As such, it may be of help to him, if some of the 
elementary, through important steps, for judging a Horary chart 
can be summarized in a systematic manner at one place. 


While attempting to summarize the same at one place, it is 
presumed that the beginner has the elementary knowledge of 
casting and judging the Horary chart but there are certain doubts 
in his mind need clarifications. 


(b} Casting of Horary Chart: 


1. For casting a Horary chart, take the commencing position 
of the Sub of the Horary number as the Nirayana Ascendant. 
This cuspal position of the ascendant remains the same 
irrespective of the year or the locality where the chart Is cast. 


2. For ascertaining the cusp of other Houses, one has to 
take the latitude of the place where the astrologer judges the 
chart even though the querist might have written from any part of 
the world. 


3. lIfone judges a chart immediately after casting, then one 
has to note the position of the planets when the casting of Horary 


O14 » ASTRO SECRETS = 


chart was Undertaken. In all other cases, the position of planets 
should be taken for the moment when astrologer commences 
analysing the chart. 

4. The query may be for the querist him self or for some 
relative or friend. Ifthe query is for himself, make all calculations 
from the Lagna. If it is for younger brother or sister, take the third 
house counted trom Lagna the ascendant for that younger brother 
or sister. If it relates to mother, take the 4th house. For son or 
daughter take 5". For wife or partner, take 7*. For father, take 9" 
and for elder brother and sister take 14" house as ascendant 
and find out. 


(c) Whether the Chart is radical: 


5, After the chart is cast, first check whether the chart reflects 
the mind of the querist. For this, check what Moon, the indicator 
of mind, represents by virtue of houses owned and occupied by 
it, is star Lord and Sub Lord. The Moon ought to be connected 
with the houses with which the question relates. Experience 
confirms that connection by Sub-lordship is very important. 


6. Ascendants also reflects the mind of the querist. Lagna 
Stands for the querist as well as for his query. Whatever the Sub- 
Lord of the ascendant indicates, or whichever matter it signifies, 
that is what the question would like to know. So, ascertain which 
houses are signified by tts Sub-Lord. 


(d) Whether matter is promised 


7. {ff it is found that the query is properly reflected from the 
disposition of the Moon, or the ascendant Sub-Lord, then and then 
only it is fo be examined whether the matter is promised or not. 


8. Whether the event will materialise or not, consider the 
11" cusp and find out whether the Lord of the Sub of the 11* 
cusp Is either retrograde or deposited in a constellation whose 
Lord is retrograde. If either is retrograde event will not materialise. 
lf the Sub-Lord and the Lord of the constellation in which it is 


KRISHNAMURT] PAabHDHAIT + 215 


posited are in direct motion and if the same Sub-Lord is also a 
significator of either the Ath or atleast anyone of the concerned 
houses then event is promised, otherwise not. Fulfillment of all 
house three conditions is a must. Ifany one of them is not fulfilled, 
event is not guaranteed. 


9. Another method to ascertain whether an event will 
materialise or not is to check whether the cuspal Sub-Lord of the 
main houses is the significator of the main or any of the subsidiary 
house(s) or the Aith house. For example, for foreign travel, Sub 
Lord of the XlIth cusp (main house} must be a significator of 
either IXth (long journeys) or of Ill (Movement trom residence) or 
of Allih (change of environment) itself. 


(e} Whether change is going to be beneficial: 


10. Very often, it is asked whether a change is going to be 
beneficial or not. For this ascertain whether the Sub-Lord of Xlth 
cusp signifies the concerned house. For example, if the Xlth 
cusp Sub-Lord signifies IInd house (Finance), the change will be 
good monetarily. But if it signifies 1“ ie. Xllth to IInd, it will indicate 
negation or worsening of financial position. 


14.The Sub-Lord occupied by a plane denotes whether that 
planet is auspicious for the progress of the Bhava of inauspicious 
so that one meets with obstacle of faces disappointment or 
negation of the matter. 


12.For ascertaining the Badhakstana remember that if the 
ascendant is in movable sign, 11" house is the badhakasthana. 
If the ascendant falls in a fixed sign, 9" house is the 
badhakasthana. If the ascendant falls in a common sign, the ?* 
house is a badhakasthana. 


(f} How to judge a chart: 


13.The first step is to identity the houses which have a 
bearing on the frutification of a query, then the planets which 
influence those houses i.e their significators. The respective 


216 * ASTRO Srtutis 


strength of the significators of a house , according to 
Krishnamurthi Padhdhati, is to be ascertained in the following 
manner:- 
i 
|. Planet in the constellation of the occupant of a house 
(That is the strongest) next. 


ll. Occupant of the House 


lll. Planet posited in the constellation ruled by the 
Lord of the House 


IY Planet owing the House; and 


Y Planet or planets conjoined with or aspecting the 
above significators and also the house in question. 


14.Rahu ar,d Kethu should be included as significators/ ruling 
planets if they are conjoined, aspect or tenanted in the houses of 
the significators / ruling planets. 


15.For identifying the lordship of a house. tt should be 
remembered that owner of a house is the owner of the sign wher: 
the cusp falls. This is very important in K.P System. 


(g) Selection of fruitful significators: 


16.Q0n the correct selection cf signiticators depends the 
accuracy of prediction. As such, which of the above significators 
are beneficial and which are just temptors have to be found oul 
first. Ii many planets become significators then selection will 
have to be made from amongst them. 


(h} Ruling Planets: 


17. There are several methods to find out the fruitful 
significators. The easy methcd is to select with the help of Ruling 
planets. It should be remembered that the ruling planets at tF 
timings of query would be the ruling planets at the timinr 
fructification of the expected results. As such, significator 
are in common with the ruling planets are to be selec 


*KEISHUNAMUBIT PanbHillall « 2) 


In order of merit and strength the following planets are 
regarded as the Ruling Planets of the time when the chart is cast 
and judgement undertaken. 


(i) Lagna star Lord 
(ii) Lagna sign Lord 
(iii) Moon star Lord 
(iv) Moon sign Lord 
(v) Day Lord 

(vi) lf any other planet strongly aspects (I) to (v) above, it 
should also be included in the ruling planets. 


19. One should not accept these ruling planets as it is. Check 
up whether any of them is posited either in the constellation or 
Sub of a retrograde planet. If there is any, reject it and accept the 
remaining. 


20. Sun and Moon are ever direct, never retrograde. Rahu 
and Kethu move in opposite direction; they never retrace their 
pathway and movement are steady in its own direction. Hence 
treat Rahu and Kethu as never retrograde. Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
Venus and Saturn can only be retrograde. 


21.Second method is to take the Cuspal Sub-Lord of the 
concerned houses and to check which cof the significators are 
posited in their constellations. Such of the significators who are 
posited in the constellations of cuspal Sub-lords can betaken as 
fruitful significators without hesitation. The rest can be dropped 
or eliminated for further consideration. 


22. The third method is to take the significator one by one 
and check in whose Sub-Lord ship they are posited. If its sublord 
is included in the list of significators, such a planet can deemed 
to be fruitful significater. 


23. Alternately, all those significators which signify Allth to 
the concerned houses should be rejected. For planets which 
are in 6,8 and 12 to the concerned houses do not contribute to 


218 * ASTRO SHORETS 


the maters influenced by those houses. Similarly the houses 
which are in 6,8 and 12 to any houses are considered to negate 


the affairs influenced by the house concerned. 
a 


24.A planet which appears a higher number of times, 
amongst the significators/ruling planets or one who is connected 
with various significatos their constellation of Rasi Lord or as a 
Sub-Lord should be taken as the strongest: Conversely, a planet 
which is not in the Sub lords of the concerned houses should be 
taken to be the weakest. 


25. Node firstly give the results of the planets with which it is 
conjoined, then results of the planets in whose constellation it is 
deposited, then the result of the planets aspecting it and lastly 
the results of the owner of the sign in whichthe node is deposited. 


26.When Rahu or Kethu appears to be a Ruling Planet/ 
significators its sign Lord is replaced by it. 


27. Another point to be remember is that the ruling planets, 
have a definite bearing over the event. Particularly it is found 
that if the sign Lord and star Lord of Sun are also common 
amongst the already selected Ruling Planets, the Sun's star Lord 
and sign Lord becomes strongest to offer result according to 
their deposition. 


(i) Timing of Events: 


28.An event will materialise during the conjoined pericd of 
the selected significators especially when the luminaries transit 
through the Zones indicated by these planets. 


29. While timing the events it must be remembered that transit 
of Lagna is to be considered when the result is to be got within a 
few hours, but when question of days comes transit of Moon 
should be looked into and when months come position of Sun is 
to be counted, 


30. For this, find out the Lagna which is rising at the timings 
of judgement. The which is to raise next and so on. Then that 


KRISHNAMURT! PAGHDHATI + 219 


wing which is governed by one of the selected significator should 
have the star governed by another strong significators. In that, 
one has to find out when the third significator becomes the Sub- 
Lord. When this position in that sign would rise in the east or 
transited by Moon or Sun as the case may be the event will 
matétralise. 


31.But in case the event is to materialise in days or months 
then that date and timings should be taken when the Moon or 
sun as the case may be, transits in that sign star and Sub-Lord. 


32.In Horary horoscope, planets in retrograde motion can't 
give results as along as they are retrograde. However, if a 
retrograde planet is deposited in the constellation of a planet 
which is in direct motion indicates that after some obstacle and 
delay, the matter will materialise, when the planet assumes direct 
motion and passes beyond the point where from retrograde 
motion started. 


33. But if a planet, even when it %s direct if deposited in the 
constellation or Sub of a retrograde planet, it will appear to give 
results But will ultimately fall through. 


34. Similarly, planets in retrograde; if deposited in the 
constellation of another retrograde planet or in its own when 
retrograde, promises only failure. Never success. 


35. It is also worth noticing that those which are born with a 
planet in retrograde motion, have an advancement in the career 
when the same planet is again retrograde during transit. 


36. If planet 'A' and 'B' in their periods give a result then the 
planet in 6 or 8 or 12 to 'A' and 'B’ will give the diametrically 
opposite results. lfone joins a service during 'A' Dasa 'B’ Bukthi, 
then he will lose or leave this post during 'C Bukthi if *C’is in 6,8 
or 12 to 'A' and 'B' forms evil aspect with ‘A’ and 'B'. 


37.Whenever one wants te find cut the day cf an event in 
any Bukthi or Anthara, one ts to note whether the Lord of the 


220 ‘ASTRO SECRETS 


Bukthi, and are strong or the Lord of the constellation. The lord 
of the constellation, if stronger, will give the results one on its 
day. 


38. For ascertaining a particular date, the transit of the 
selected/fruitful significators should also be scrutinized. They 
should be transiting the constellation and the Sub of the 
significators. 


39. If the Xl cusp Sub-Lord happens to be one of the strong 
significators, then an event can materialise in the Sub-period. 


(j) General: 


40. In case the Sub-Lord of the Horary number happens to 
rule the constellation in which Moon is posited at the timings of 
query, the answer will be affirmative to the question. 


41.It is often useful to scrutinise what the ruling planets 
signify, their aspects with the cusps, cusps Lord and other plants, 
how far they promise good resulis of some Bhava and affects 
the results of other bhavas. 


42. The nature of planets should invariably be kept in view. 
Sun stands for Government Ketu/Mere for quick grasping. Jup 
for law and judgement, Moon for liquid, Mars for engineering 
and Sat for metal. 


43. A planet in whose star there is no other planet is strongest 
to give the result of the house of whose significator It is.

1. Before commencing your days work, pray God - Uchista 
Mahaganapati. 


2. Take a number between ito 249, analyse this chart - and 
know for yourself how for yourself how for this day - your job 
(Astrology), income and other connected matters are. 


Before you prepare the chart, make the Ruling Planets, and 
keep them carefully in your mind. 


That is Day Lord. 

Moon Rasi Lord. 

Moon Star Lord. 

Then the Lagna rising at that time - 
Ascendant Rasi Lord 

Ascendant Star Lord 

Ascendant Sub Lord 


Keep these above 6 levels calculated correctly. In the above 
6 levels 1 to 5 will always be constant in a majority of the cases, 
from Morning to Noon and the 5” level will vary roughly every 52 
minutes. 


The Sixth level that is Lagna Sub will be changing 
continuously - You know about it. 


Therefore note the 5 level carefully in you thinking - that is 
your mind. 


3. Persons approaching you for consultations with their 
horescopes, majority of them will meet you on the 1,2,3, level 
mentioned above - that is on stars of the planets of 1,2,3 and 
their Basic - (Moon Sign) 


222 e ASTRO SLCRIT s + 


Next the Lagna transit from morning and up to evening, 
roughly for every 2 hours the Lagna will change - accordingly 
persons who approach you will fit in the above 4,5,6 levels of KP. 


4. On the RR, that Moon Star will be the star ofthe consulting 
person - or star one above (Previous) or more next to it. The 
Moon star in the RP may be the current Dasa/Bukthi of consulting 
party. 


5. In case the Ruling planets has no connection to the 
horoscope of the consulting party, then your analysis should be 
made with utmost case and predictions made. 


6. When you tell a prediction, you must never say - that may 
happen, this may happen in a vague manner. You must 
emphatically tell this will be the result. No doubt about it. 


7. When predicting the result, you must take care to see that 
persons are not upset. You must tell only plus points. In case 
very harmful results are to be said, you must watch your tongue, 
measure the words, and tell them that through certain remedy or 
parihara, such and such evil results, can be reduced to a great 
extent. You must build up a confidence in them. 


8. Persons consulting you, may no have a KP chart, but have 
a Rasi navamsa chart. That chart they have may be full of errors. 
Under such circumstances make the R.A, adjust their chart to 
the RP. and accordingly tell the result. Nothing compels you, 
should predict only through KR KP prediction should be made 
only to intelligent people and those who know some thing about 
KR For charts prepared under traditional method, if is not possible 
to have cuspal Sublords etc. You must take stock of the current 
Dasa/Bukthi, the Lagna whether it is Chara Sara Sathira, ubhaya 
then ff it is bathakathipahi Dasa in current inform about harmful 
results. 


When Rahu/Kethu are aspected or conjoined by 
Bhadakathipathi planets predict harmful results. Sort out carefully 


KRISHNAMURT! PAGDHDHAT! < 223 


ié planets conjoined or aspected with Bhadakadhipathi and they 

are Lords of which houses. Then such houses relates to whom, 
nat is wife or children or the Native or profession accordingly 
the harmful results should be predicted. 


. When it is not KP chart, that is Rasi Navamsa Chart, any 
planet in the stars of Lords of 5-8-12 houses and runs the Dasa, 
predict that the results will be harmful or unfavourable. Planets 
in the stars of lords 2,3,10,1 and runs the Dasa predict that the 
results will be favourable and beneficial. 


Dasa Lord connected to 2-6 the Native can 

expect good income. 

5-9-3 change in job. 

Dasa Lord connected 3-6-12 change of place. 

Dasa Lord connected to 9-12 the native will go abroad or 
have change in profession, or break in Education. 

9-11 Education continues 

9-11 New ventures in profession takes place and 

thereby good prospects. 

10-11 Same as said above 

19-42 Any Dasa Lord, running its Dasa if it is mixed up or 
connected with lords of 5-8-12 houses predominantly fore 
tell harmful results. 


Even though the planets are lords of 5-8-12 house, if they 
are mixed up or connected with 2,3,10,11.6.7 houses, then 
2,3,10,11 will give very good results, and other will give middle 
level benefits. 


In this, your attention must focus on 11 -9-/ respectively of 
Sara-sthiva-Ubhavya when predictions is made as the lords oi 
11-9-7 are badhakahipahi (malefic), to offer only harmful results. 
Keep in mind that these badhakahipahi will kill a person, without 
killing him, by subjecting the Navie to as much adverse Situation. 
as possible. 


2rd » ASTRO SECRETS 


11. Lord of 6” occupying its own house (Swakshathran) or 
exalted and runs the Dasa and aspected by Saturn sure 
imprisonment. Similarly lord of 8" aspect by Saturn-fore tell 
downfall, and worst disgrace. Also fare-well the naive is likely to 
loss his entire property. Foretell the same result for lord of 12” 
aspected by Saturn. If Jupiter aspect is there, then the harmful 
results will be reduced. Jupiter aspect will also pull down the 
intensity of Saturn's evil aspect. 


12. Ifa planet connected only to 10" house and runs the 
Dasa a profession will be thee, without a profit. But name and 
fame will be there. 


Lord of 10" having no connection to 6 or 2 or 11, these will 
not be a single profit. 


13.When you analyses a KP Horary chart (1 -249), the cuspal 
sublords are to be studies very carefully. It is marriage 7" cusp 
sublord. 


Profession 10 cusp Sublord and so on. 


When it is a KP birth chart, you must give your Tull attention 
to Dasa/Bukthi lords. 


Next a badhakasthan. This badhakasthana is to be taken 
note of not for life alone, but for all other matters also like 
profession and everything connected to the naive. We must 
carefully observe how it is connected to 5-8-12 for profit and 
other favourable results. Careful study of 2-3-10-11 Houses 
should be done. 


14. Houses 6-11-9-7 and 4 becomes result oriented, only 
when they are connected to other Houses. 


Separately (individually 6 alone or 11 alone or 9-4-7 alone 
has note to play. 


lf you desire a flow of income then 6-11 or 2-6, or 2-11 should 
operate conjoinily. 


KRISHNAMURT] PADHDHATI » 225 


Kit is business (profession) 7-11 or 7-2 Gr 10-7-2 or 4-16-1! 
should operate conjointly. 


For marriage to take place without delay, in KP Horary 7* 
sublord should be subjected of 3-7-2 Houses. 


ifthe 7° sublord is subjected to houses 4-10 marriage will 
be delayed. 


A mere 11 or mere 9 signification also will delay the marriage. 


Similarly a probe for marriage through Birth chart, lord of 7 
or 2 or 11 should run the Dasa. Jupiler transit is a must in any 
one of the houses 2 or 7 or 11. (Because Jupiter improves the 
house it occupies). For more than 30 years of age (for marriage) 
the level of Saturn should be looked into. 


Lord of 7 if he is in close connection with ‘ord of 6 or lord of 
/ deposited in the stars of lord of 6 marriage proposals will be 
disturbed. If marriage takes place separation will be waiting. 


To the contrary on the above said lord of 7 close to lord of 6 
or lord of 7? deposited in the stars of 6 - the profession in terms of 
service - that is paid job will abundantly improve. In the same 
manner lord of 6 occupying the 7" house marriage will take place, 
but it will not be a happy one. But the independent business will 
abundantly improve 


15. Mars Dosha (Kuja Dosha) 


In the Horoscope if Mars in is own house or exalted inform 
there is no Mars Dosha. 


Instead if Mars is in 2,4,7,8,12 house, and one of these 
houses are not owned by mars or not exalted in any one of these 
house inform there is Mars Dosha. For such a type of Mars Dosha 
chart, Mars Dosha chart should be matched. 


lf Jupiter aspect is these Mars Dosha is very much reduced. 
That is when Mars is occupying any one of the Houses 2-4-/-8- 


226 ASTRO SECRETS 


12 with the Dosha factor, but aspected by Jupiter, Mars on its 
own reduces its own Dosha effect, and hereby does not cause 
any evil effect. For such charts, you can match 

horoscopes of Boys/girls which does not have the Mars Dosha. 


16. Similarly in the traditional method Lord of 5™ in the star of 
lord of 4" means child birth is denied. In case a child is born it 
will not live. If Rahu is in the 5" it tells he same thing. (Rahu as a 
snake will eat the egg). If Jupiter aspect is these the evil effect 
will be less. 


When you give prediction for house 1 to 12, when a house 
runs a Dasa, lord of that house in 12” or lord of 12" to that house 
in any manner connected, will always emerge as harmful to deny 
the said Bhava-Dasa result. 


Further Reference - Vl Reader Page 297 - By Sri K.S.K. 


In Hindu Astrology, it is said that planets which are in 6,8 
and 12 to any house do no contribute to the matter influenced by 
that house; similarly the house which are in 6,8 and 12 to any 
House are considered to negate the affairs influenced by the 
House concerned. 


When lord of 4" occupies 3° - death fo mother - what is said 
will result during the connected Dasa - Bukthi. 


When you foretell about education house 4 or 9, when 
connected to 11* house only, education is completed in the 
desired way. 


11" house is the house of fulfillment of desires or a matter 
event. But 11™ has no power to operate or act independenily. 


2-11 Money, Finance Income 

3-11 Change of place 

4-11 Wealth, Bank Deposits, House, Education 

5-11 Success in Love affairs, speculation, prosperity to 
children. 


KRISHNAMURT] PADHDHATI » eof 


6-11 Flow of income, success in all undertakings 

7-11 Agood wife and a good life and so on. 

This is how the 11” subjects itself to fulfill one's desires. 
Under any circumstances, never go to one's house, to tell 
predictions. 


Never chargé a very low fees for your predictions. According 
tothe area and locality the minimum fees thal you charge should 
be Rs.50/-. Ifthe person is poor you can take a grade. But on the 
sign Board - it should be written that you charge Rs.100/- for 
astrological predictions. The public should know and realize that 
Astrology is second to none, of the other sciences and Arts of 
the Day. 


By changing a lesser rate, the astrologer lowers his-own self- 
respect.

The Horary chart relates to a lady. For the question the lady 
spelt the No.9. The question is "AM | PREGNENT?". The day of 


* KAISHNAMUAT! PADHDHAT! » 


the question was 20 days (4-3-81}) since having not had the 
monthly mestrual cycle. During the short period the lady 
consulted, as it is not possible for a medical check at such a 
short period. During this K.P tells clearly the result. 


Rule.1: St sublord in which constellation it is, that star lord 
should signify 2 or 5 or 77. 


Rule.2: 5°" sublord should be stationed in the fruitful signs 
Karkata, Vrischika or Meena. 
In this history chart: 

1. 5*sublord in SUN. SUN is in the star of SATURN. SATURN 
is the significator of 11° 

2. 5" sublord SUN is stationed in Meena. 


The above findings tally with KP to confirm that, lady is 
pregnant. 


Such prediction made, how to know te it will prove correct. 


Rule : 3r¢ Sublord if connected to 7" Bhava slar lord prsublord 
or as a significator of 7m, or by aspect or by conjunction or in any

‘amain some loopholes. The reasons for such loopholes are 
numerous. | am now pointing out only some hints on tt. 


ltis seen that in most of the cases generally, lord of the sign. 
its position in the zodiac, relation and aspects between the Planets 
are being taken into consideration. But it cannot give a full 
analytical picture of a planet. Let us take a planet. It has some 
natural qualities of its own. Such natural qualities of the planet 
may be modified due to the following reasons:- 


a) That due to its disposition in a particular sign. 


b) That aspects of some other planet on it may be malefic 
or benetic. 


c) That it must be deposited in a constellation. Thus the 
nature and the results of a planet is modified. 


' KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI » 231 


Late Prof. Krishnamurti laid much more importance on 
constellation. He explains thus, suppose a) there is a light in the 
centre of a circular room provided with 12 glass panes of different 
colours, b) around the room there is a verandah and outside tt, 
there are 27 glasspanes. 9 different colours, three are of the same 
colour. Now, if a person walks outside the circular vaarandah 
looking at the ligh inside he will find the colour of the light getting 
changed according to the colour of the coloured panes. Similarly, 
the results of the Planets are modified by the lord of the sign 
indicated by the lord of the Nakshatra or constellation. 


In course of my studies on this subject, | have observed that 
vital importance of the planetary occupation in a constellation is 
‘considered first, by the sages of the past which they considered, 
in this way, not only at radix but also in transit. 


Now one must agree how a planet modifies in its initial stage. 
Everyone considers rasi - position and aspects; and generally 
discards constellation - position of a planet. It is seen, some of 
are in habit of giving predictions without considering the occupation 
of a planet in a constellation, the results of which fails miserably. 


Think of the most natural benefic planet, Jupiter. Accidentally 
if it is deposited in the house of an enemy and also in a Nakshatra 
which is malefic- in this case, the natural qualities of Jupiter must 
be changed or moditied. 


The difference as benefic or malefic have been made 
according to the natural qualities of the Planets, it is completely 
wrong to rely on such difference, while the judgement of a chart 
is given. As itcan't be taken into benefic as a whole when Jupiter 
is the significator of fifth and also eighth and twelth houses. 
Prof.Krishnamurti says, no planet is wholly a benefic nor in full a 
malefic. It is similar to the rose with thorns. A planet is said to be 
a malefic when thorns are many. A planet is a benefic when the 
thorns have fallen down and the rose alone looks bright, without 
any bee which may perchance sting. 


232 * ASTRO SUCRITIS 


Take for an example, in the case of Late Louis Pasteur, father 
of Bacteriology, Libra rising Saturn the most benevolent planet 
deposited in Aries, in the constellation of Aswini, Lord of which 
was in 10". It is observed that in the major period of Saturn he 
made most of his discoveries, received many honours both at 
heme and abroad. Let us concentrate on the position of Saturn 
in the horoscope of Sri Nixon. Saturn the ruler of 6" (Service) 
and of the 7" (foreign or public relations) is in the 10° (house of 
profession). Generally, democracy. It is well posited in Rasi, and 
deposited in the constellation, Krithika (Tauri Aloyoni}, lord the 
sun. now the sun is the Ascendant Lord is well placed in 5™ with 
the ruler of 5", the most benevolent Jupiler -a good yoga. Jupiter, 
Mercury and Mars are in close conjunction in 5". At the face of 
major period of Saturn the native became vice-president of the 
U.S.A. But he was also defeated due to Saturn's placement in an 
inimical constellation. Thus, Saturn gave mixed results in its 
period. The major period of mercury started around in April, 1970. 
Mercury is ruler of the 11“ and 2na in his horoscope. It is very well 
placed with Yogarkaraka Mars and Jupiter in the 5° house. 
Beginning of the period is remarkable for different activities; but 
the seeds of destruction were sown al the watergate Hotel in 
Washington. Thus it is observed that benefic by the way of 
ownership or position may not always bestow good resulls. It is 
evident that the good results turned into bad due te Mercury's 
occupation in the constellation Moola (Scorpions), Lord of which 
is Ketu, sneaky by nature deposited in the 2na house (Maraka). 


lf we look into the chart of Sri Morarji Desai, it is seen that he 
has risen to a great extent bul also fallen from that heights. In the 
major period of Saturn, he became a Cabinet Minister and Deputy 
Prime Minister. He contested twice for Prime-Ministership but failed. 
Lastly, in Rahu sub- period of Saturn major period brought him 
down. saturn is the ruler of the 8" and 9* house, well placed in 
Libra, exalted and retrograde. Saturn being the ruler of 9" and its 
occupation in Visakam (Librae), owner Jupiter, lord of the 7" and 
19” is placed in 2nd - exalted. Saturn being placed in 5” it has also 


" KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI = 233 


conferred on the native a decent, respectable and responsible ° 
jolitical position. Besides, Jupiler being deposited in Pushyami 
(Cancri) forms a Sookshma powerful Rajayoga. But Saturn has 
another role to do. According to the classical authors. Some of 
them says, a tetrograde and exalted planet acts as if in debilitation 
(Saturn in retrogression at birth), so weak and harmful. Some other 
blamed only the Bhukthinatha, Rahu in 9", the native's paintul 
falldown is well-known. From the position of Jupiter and Saturn it 
may be confirmed. It is the owner of 7™ (Public relation) and 10° 
(profession) deposited in Saturn's constellation who is the ruler of 
8" (Destriction) and 9" (negation to the professional house), placed 
in 5” (12" to 6" service). Both exchange their place through 
constellation. So, in major period of Saturn, it has double role to 
do. Rahu also helped to do this mischievious work, who is placed 
in 9° conjoined with Sun, ruler of the 3° (6" to the 10"). 


so Prof. Krishnamurti says rightly that no planet can claim 
as benefic or malefic unless it is wholly qualified so. A planet 
may be a benefic by nature or by ownership, but its disposition 
in a house or bhava in a constellation may turn into a functional 
malefic. So prediction based on only in a consideration of a planet 
by its own nature and lordship must prove meaningless. 


Generally it has been observed that consideration proceeds 
with the sign being treated as house or bhava. Two persons born 
on a day, say at 5 a.m. and other at 6.30 a.m. Their planetary position 
in signs of their charts will be same. Even these Natives may belong 
to the same ascendant. Apparntly no difference will be found 
between these two charts. But if we go through it deeply some cirtical 
position must come into our sight. It is clearly evident in the case of 
a twin-birth where diametrically opposite results are found. 


The Ascendant is an imaginary point which will rise on the 
horizoninthe cest al the place of birth. The distance of each house 
from Ascendant will be more or less equal. It is astonishing how 
these imaginary points of the twelve houses exert a great influence 
on the life of a native. 


334 « ASTRO SEcHet’s © 


In the above case, the planetary position in signs of their charts 
will be same. But in consideration of Bhava, the Bhava position of 
the different planets are not identical. While judging a Bhava, 
generally following are considered: (I) association, (ii) aspect, a) 
interchange of places. According to the classical texts, Bhava 
strength is judged with the Planets, residing in it. Bhava Sandhis 
(the beginning of the Bhava and the end ofthe other). It is said, a' 
planet ina Bhava-Sandhi is utterly powerless, and the results it 
produces are practically nil. Bhava madhya (mid-point). The influence 
of ab hava begins at the starting point and gradually increases anci 
reaches the highest limit in the mid-point. Then again the effect ~' 
the Bhava begins to fall and remain nothing at the Virama Sancii+ 
(last point). A planet at the mid point gives the full effect of the Bhava. 
So at these three points of a bhava results must vary. 


In this case, the Ascendant of the native born at 5 a.m. is 
raising before the sun ie applying to and the Ascendant of the 
native born at 6.30 a.m. is raising affer the Sun i.e. separating 
from. The aspect grown stronger and stronger as it draws near 
to the Sun, when the influence reaches it peak. Thus, the Sun's 
eftect is great in the first case and feeble in the second. Thus all 
Planets are considered. 


Moreover, the rising point in the east must touch a sensitive 
point in the Zodiac, according to the nadi Literature, each Rai ts 
divided into 150 equal parts of 12’ each. Birth in each division is 
supposed to give different results, although the results are ge jeral 
and are subject to modification by the position of the Planets. 


According to the Stellar system, advoca’ed by 
Prof.Krishnamurt it must rise in a constellation and the lord of 
this constellation has a great influence on it. Further more, if will 
rise in a Pada or in a sub, results of which must be felt keenly. 


Each sign can offer many types of profession. A sign os 
divided into 3 major divisions by constellation. Now if we consider 
constellations, each will represent only some of them. Further if 


« KREISHMAMURIT PADHDHATT = 235 


sub is included, exactly the profession may be fixed. A 
constellation extends to 13-20° where as a sub extends only 
between 0.40' to 13°.20”. therefore the broad prediction indicated 
by a constellation is specifically defined by the sub. 


For example, twins are born having the meridian in the sign Anes 
and the constellation Bharani, ruled by Mars and Venus respectively. 
But their profession may not be same. If we include this sub, a clear 
picture is found out. Say, one having meridian in sign ruled by Mar, 
constellation ruled by Venus and sub ruled by Jupiter whereas the 
other person has Mars sign, Venus Star and Saturn sub. Both are 
sanitary inspectors. One works in Animal Husbandy Department whose 
sub is ruled by Jupiter (as Jupiter is the chief Governor for production 
and progency) and the other is working in the slaughter house whose 
sub is ruled by Saturn (as Saturn is the Karaka for Death). 


Thus, in consideration of an Ascendant , such difference in 
resulis can be experienced by nature, heath, longevity etc., of 
the natives born in the same sign within an interval of even a few 
minutes. Although these are general, and subject to be modified 
on the position of the lords ruling jointly the cusps and other 
related factors thereOin. 


Then, why should we not judge other cusps in this way’? It is 
critisized that such judgementis an admixture of Indian and 
Western system. No harm, as our aim is to give only correct and 
precise predictions. 


That is why, judgement of each Bhava cusps is essential. 


Summing up the above points, it is suggested to predict after 
going through subtle and analytical assessment of the activities 
of the Planets as well as the Bhava cusps of a horescope so thal 
astrological prediction may prove its usefulness. 


| have only struck on a few out of a lot on the principles of 
judgement. Thus we ignore such numberless points while judging 
a horoscope. As a result, prediction goes out of our expectation

/NEW HORIZONS IN KRISHNAMURTI 
PADHDHATI 


T.R.RAGHUNATH - MADRAS - 44 


"Astrology and Athrishta" which came into existance on 30- 
3-1963 has, in my humble opinion, served as beacon light to 
these who grope in the dark in the vastmines of astrology. My 
best wishes to Mr.K.Subramaniam for upholding the torch of 
stellar astrology with the demise of our late crusador Jyothisha 
Marthand K.S.Krishnamurt:. | shall now place before the readers 
of this esteemed magazine the product of my humble researches 
in KP. 

1. SELECTING STRONG SIGNIFICATORS: 


This is naturally a tough job for beginners in K.R and in some 
cases il even baifles the adept. 


Method A: Significators which are fruitful: 
1) Planets in stars of occupants of a Bhava 
2) The occupant 

3) 

4) The owner 
9) 


Planets in the stars of owners of a Bhava 


Planets which are conjoined with or aspected 
by significators. 


Even in the above method, a golden rule has to be followed 
which is as follows.: 


“it you get 3 or more planets as significators by applying 
rules (1} and (2) under method "A" it is advisable to stop with 
them. We need not apply rules{3} and (4) but we can Tfollow rule 
© which will guide us satisfactorily". 


~ KRISS AMERIL Pateierady = 257 


Applicable only in Horary astrology (1) planets in stars of 
the Stariord of a cusp (2) Stariord of the cusp (3) Planets in the 
stars of the sublord of the cusp (4) sublord of the Cusp (5) Stariord 
of the Sublord of the Cusp. 


The above method also has been tested by me and it has 
worked most satisfactorily in Horary predictions. 


Methed ©: Select the Planets deposited in the sub of 
occupants of the particular bhavas. 


The student will do well to test the above methods and select 
the method which gives accurate resulis in practice. 


2. RULING PLANETS: 


1. They are the lords of Lagna, Lagna Star, Moon Rasi, 
Moon Star and day of judgement. 


2. The Lagna Sublord at judgement also deserves 
attention. 


3. Ifa planet who is a strong significator happens to be 
retrograde at transit and also happens to be either 
Dasa, bukthi or Anthara lord it will give the result only 
when it becomes direct. 


4. Planets in the stars of the ruling Planets are also 
effective. 


5. Fruitful ruling Planets are those who are deposited in 
the Star and sub of significators which are fruitful. 


3. DIVINE NUMBER: 


In case of doubt in your selection of Dasa/Bukthi/Anthara or 
sookshama lord open a book and note the co-rulers of the 
number printed on that page. These co-rulers will definitely guide 
you provided you are blessed by God and Guru. There should 
be no wishful thinking. 


2345 * ASTRO SHARES 


4. TRANSITS: 


1. Solar and lunar transits over the conjoin portion in the 
zodiac ruled by fruitful significators or ruling Planets. 


2. Solar and lunar transits over the conjoint portion 
in the zodiac ruled by Dasa/Bukthi/Anthara or 
sookshama lords. 


3. Transit of Dasa/Bukthi:Anthara lords in such a Star 
and sub ruled by ruling Planets or fruitful signiticators. 


4. Most important is the transit of the Sublord of the 
particular Cusp in Horary chart over the conjoined 
portion in the zodiac ruled by ruling Planets or fruitful 
significators. 


For example, take marriage, "The 7" Cusp is the main Cusp 
to be considered and the transit of the Sublord of this Cusp is 
important. This holds good only in Horary Astrology. 


5. SOME ADDITIONAL POINTS: 
a) The Dasa lord wiil give the event in its own Bukthi ff it in 
the Star or sub of the karaka planet. 


b) Eliminate planet in the sub of Karaka Planets occupying 
the karaka Bhava. 


c) Eliminate Planets posited in the sub of significators or 
Planets posited in detrimental bhavas and having their 
star un-occupied. 


6. SOME POINTS REGARDING MATRIMONIAL COMPATABILITY 


1. The ruling Planets at birth of the girl or boy should be co- 
rulers of the 7" Cusp in the chart of the other and vice versa. 


2. As per Horary system, ascertain a number from the boy 
or girl and analyse the co-rulers of the 7" Cusp, these Planets 
should be ruling Planets at the birth of the- other for good 
compatibility. 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI » 239 


3. Mars inthe Star of sun or own Star and occupying houses 
1,2,4,7,80r 12 only, constitutes Kuja dosha. If connected to Jupiter 
and Venus, it will nullify the malefic aspects. 


For further details, read the six readers of Shri. K.S.K. and in 
particular Fourth Reader to know more about marriage as per 
K.R 


Also note that whenever Rahu or Kethu signify a particular 
event. Planets in their stars or sub are also important. 


| have also done research on various factors in K.R and this 
will be dealt within a future article.

¢ ‘OH’ WHAT A HATRED ON K.P.’} 


BY K.M. SUBRAMANIAM. . 
Sir, 


| reproduce here under a letter published in a magazine from 
Bangalore under caption “Instant Astrology" to facilitate the 
readers of Astrology and Athnstha". 


“It is interesting to read in a magazine from Madras that the 
contributors claim ability to accurately predict the time of, say, 
the birth (and sex) of a baby etc., the arrival of gas cylindera < 
restoration of electric supply! Recently a contributor wrote an 
article about his predictions regarding the recovery ot salary 
arrears of an Eng.neer of UR 


| wonder why this person who "accurately prec.cied” the time 
of recovery of salary and replied to the UR Engineer within a week, 
had to wart fer nine months with all unpleasantness, annoyance, 
and embarassment” subjected to, by his "fantastic" friend asking 
him, "ina mind mocking tone and tenor": about the corrections of 
his forecast. Surely this astrologer could have asked for a Horary 
number from his “fantastic friend and predicted the dale of arrival 
of the reply fram UP and thus made even Parasara and 
Varahamihira bow to his 'revered’ Guruji from heaven. 


| feel that there is a calculated move by certain section of 
astrological enthusiasts in India to denigrate Hindu Astrology and 
mislead the gullible and ignorant public, instead of learning and 
propagating what our ancient savants discovered and taught us 


Of Course democratic India has given the right to any citizen 
to "Propound" any "Padhdhati" and watch the fun. 


Though the above writer had not come out openly, [ can 
understand that this letter pertains to the Article submitted by St: 
Logarajalu, published on page 25 of A&A Feb.'79 issue. 


KRRISHNWABRMUERTI PADUDHWATI « Za4i 


| noticed that the Article has been written very well and no 
sentence was found to mean criticising the so called Hindu 
Astrology owned by them. | say, we are also Indians (Hindus) 
and Hindu Astrology is no private of those people. 


Let them say that they do not possess the capacity to 
understand KP; and it is not their concern to say that Democracy 
has given right to propound any padhdhaiti. It is the finding of a 
master mind and as he has opened the eyes of Astrologers and 
given to Astrology a status in the predictive portion, fof which 
this is the way how Sri KSK and KP enthusiasts are begin treated. 


The above writer scandalises that there is a calculated move 
by a certain section of Astrological enthusiasts to denigrate Hindu 
Astrology. He may kindly note that KP is an improvement on the 
predictive wing of Hindu Astrology. KP followers never said in 
any place what so ever that KP is a new thing sprang up suddenly; 
except that the padhdhathi is an invention by introducing the 
"Sub" which is division of the Zodiac of 360° in terms of the 
unequal proportion of the vimshothari Dasa years allotted to each 
planet is in that Vimshothari system of 120 years; and we like to 
impress upon him that KP had been based on the old fundamental 
concepts of Hindu Astrology only. We use the same 9{nine) 
planets with the same significations are Karaka that was, as told 
in Hindu Astrology; Let our friend now understand KP is born 
oul of Hindu astrology; and further advanced we and Hindu 
Astrology Is not their property alien and not alone to KP followers 
as well. 


In the first paragraph of his letter, in a sarcastic manner he 
tells that KP followers claim the ability to accurately predict the 
time of the birth of baby etc. because, he is not endowed with 
such a facully in predicting, he need not entertain such a feeling. 
Truly a good KP follower can do it with ease and give starting 
predictions.

* KAISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI = 243 


(KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI) 


From July 1927, | started reading Astrological books and 
from 1934, | was trying to find out why an event in one's life has 
happened applying both Hindu and Western systems. For twelve 
years, | discussed with so-called veterans then, in Madras state. 
Neither | found any uniform method in them nor such practising 
astrologers were able to convince me. The more | met the then 
old known Astrologers, the more ! was depressed and 
discouraged. 


In 1939, | came to the conclusion that one can simply read 
these texl books and say that he knows astrology by repeating 
poems or Slokas but none can predict correctly either the nature 
of event or the actual date of event. But in a way general picture 
ranging for some menths with alternatives will be boldly given; 
they were at a loss when unexpected moments according to 
Hindu traditional systems, things have happened. It is fact. 
Nobody can deny. The only excuse was, "oh! The time of birth 
given must be wrong". Another will say, "No, No, the Panjang 
used by you, is wrong “and yet another will say, "The Ayanamasa 
followed was incorrect". Thus every one will give an excuse and 
so far, none had been successful in improving the incomplete 
and incorrect dicta propounded by our Sages. They do not want 
to confess that the rules were confusing and contradictory; not 
useful but general; incomplete and incorrect. 


A few attacked me saying that 1 don't respect the sages. 
They have not understood me. Are there not 18 Sidhanthas? 
Suppose, one wants to known where Moon is at a particular 
moment, are we not getting different answers? Then, any one of 
them may be correct; or all the eighteen wrong. So which Sage 
or Saint or Savant am | to respect? Further, we are aware that if a 
person is very able, brilliant and intuitive, it does not mean that 
he must be correct in all that he says. Is notto err human? Do not 


f 
244 “ASTRO SECRETS * 


the opinions of people differ? Do the Sciences stand stagnant? 
Therefore, in these calculations without any instrument in those 
days, it is but natural to give incorrect datas. 


From 1939, 1 had enough opportunity to devote most o* my 
time in a peaceful atmosphere to carry out the research with the 
able assistance of 2 colleagues. We did honest and intelligent 
work. Lord Ganesh gave me intuition to proceed in a particular 
direction. So | and according to my instruction my two colleagues 
began te collect twin horoscopes and did the research with open 
mind. 1 found that planets in the same sign, inthe same degree, 
in the same minule and in the same Bhava can give different 
results. This led me to think deeply. When twins are born with 8 
minute's interval, the position of the planets remains the same. 
But how is il, either of the two has an advantageous result whereas 
the other faces troubles? Don't we know that the twins born in 
those eight minutes difference, one lives, one die? One gets very 
good education and comes out successful whereas the other 
fails year after year. One gets married early, the other late., One 
has many children, the other none. One is in service, explain? 
Actually nothing: nothing in Traditional system. If there is any 
traditional astrologer who can give the reference for such 
difference, it is welcome. Here you are all. come on. To my best 
of knowledge there is nothing. So ! thought what is that moves, 
within that time. It is only the position of the Lagna - the point 
which rises in the East which moves, 1° in every 4minutes and 
thereby the 12 cups. There should be a method where in the 
rules should give systematically and exhaustively for such small 
differences mosily for every degree of the Zodiac. 


Again, | found that there may be three or four planets in the 
same sign, in the same star and in the same Bhava; these planets 
by ownership and deposition of a Bhava appear to be 
advantageous but they produce unexpected adverse results. 
Those planets, .which are said according fo traditional astrology 
evil by occupation and ownership, offer surprisingly pleasant 


- KRISHNAMUERTE PADHDHATI - 245. 


results. When such had been noticed, in many cases, it suggested 
to me that a person even though considered to be lucky in a 
particular Dasa he ts not throughout enjoying; but every sub 
period gives out different results- a few of the resulls are most 
favourable ones and a few irreparable loss. [his gave me a clue 
i.e. the planets deposited in a particular constellation can indicate 
only the nature of the event i.e., which house matter the planets 
include due to the Lord of the Constellation by its occupation. It 
does not mean that a planet deposited in a constellation should 
necessarily be favourable and contribute for the benefit of the 
matter signified by a Bhava occupied by the Lord of the 
constellation. For example, Guru and Sani were in the same 
constellation. Guru is in the beneficial sub, whereas Saturn is in 
an adverse sub. So during Guru period one enjoys the results of 
the Bhava occupied by the Lord of the constellation where as 
during the period of Sani he faces just diametrically opposite 
results in the same matter. If in Guru sub period, a child is born 
during Sani the same child dies. It means Guru and Sani are in 
one constellation and the Lord of the constellation is in 5. Guru 
was in a favourable sub and Sani was in an unfavourable one. 
What is meant by Sus? We follow Vimshodhari system. Each 
constellation extends over 13 degree 20 minutes. If a child ts 
born as secon as Moon enters in that star we call that the child at 
the moment of the birth was running the Dasa and Bhukti of the 
Lord of the star. As Moon moves in the same Siar, even though 
Dasa remains the same, the Sub Lord gets changed in the cyclic 
order of vimshodhari Dasa system. We are aware of the dilterent 
resulis in ditterent Bhuktis even though Dasa remains the same. 
Therefore ¢ divided the constellation into nine parts and the 
proportion in which it is divided was the same proportion allotted 
to each planet in Vimshodhari system. This answers correctly 
why two planets at a distance of two degrees from each other 
give diametrically opposite results. Again a problem arose to find 
out why one of the twins get married and the other remains 
unmarried; why one of the twins get married only once where as 


246 FP ANTRO SRCREDS «= 


the other twice; why one has children and the other has none 
inspite of the planets remaining in the same degree and minute 
and in the same Bhava, same Navamsa, same Ashtagavarga, 
having same shadbala and every thing remaining the same. Then 
| found that it is the cusp of the 12 houses, which vary in twin 
births, and therefore it is the cusp, which should indicate whether 
that house matter will prosper or that house matter will suffer. 
Supposing the fifth cusp in one falls in such a SUB, the lord of 
which denies birth of children by signifying the matters of the 
houses 1,4 and 10. Then he has no child. Every chart has 
significators. Significators can indicate the time. Ifthe cusp denies, 
significators cannot give. The SUB Lord of the Cusp is vital. 
Whereas the other horoscope shows that the SUB Lord of the fifth 
cusp is connected with houses 2 or 5 or 11, when he has children 
during the conjoined period of significators. Simillarly in one of 
the twin births the cusp of the houses 2,7 or 11 and he gets 
married. Then, whether he gets married, once or more than once 
depends upon the occupation of the sub lord or the lord of the 
constellation where the sub lord is deposited. If it is in a dual 
sign one marries more than once. If the seventh cusp falls in 
such a SUB, the lord of which signifies 1,6 and 10 without having 
any connection whatsoever with 2 or 7 or 11 then he remains a 
bachelor. Thus i found out that the only correct sookshama 
method is judging the cusp of each Bhava by considering the 
Lord of the Sub in which it, has fallen. When | found out this

THE HOROSCOPE OF 


SOTHIDA MANNaM, JYOTHISH MARTHAND | 
PROF. K.S.KRISHNAMUATI 


BY Sai.M.G.G.Nayvar 


Devotees of Mother Ganga worship Her with her own waters. 
Likewise, let us adore our revered Guruji Late 
Prof.K.S.Krishnamurti, an incarnation of the Presiding Deity 
(Devata} of Astrology with the scientific system of Astrology 
discovered and disseminated by him. 


Prof.Krishnamurti was born at Thiruvaiyaru (Lat.10°48N: Long. 
79° 15E}, a short distance Northeastward of the town of Thanjavur 
in Tamilnadu. Thiruvalyaru the ‘Sacred’ land of five rivers’ (Cauvery 
coleroon or Kollidam, Kudamurti, YVennar and Vettar) is considered 
as sacred as Kasi or Varanasi (Benares}, if not more. (Kasikku 
Yeessam adhikam Thiruvaiyaru). The place is associated with the 
name of Saint Thyagaraja, a great devotee of Lord Sri Rama and 
one of the Tirmunis (Trinity) of Carnatic Music, the other two being 
oti Syma Sastr and Sri Muthuswami Dikshitar. 


Prof.Krishnamurti was initiated into spiritual practice by 
Mahakavi Sri SUndaresa Sarma. Brahma Shree Sundaresa Sarma 
is a divine soul, a great Sanskrit poet and scholar. After finishing 
his education at St.Joseph's College, Triuchirapalli, Prof. 
Krishnamurti entered the service of the Government of Tamilnadu 
In the Public Health Department at the Kings Institute, Guindy, 
Madras 32 on 14-07-1927. He was fascinated by the Divine 
Science of Astrology even then. He studied the Hindu and 
Western systems of Astrology thoroughly, but was deeply 
disappointed at the inadequacy and lack of precision of both. 
He noticed that a planet in its period invoked the results of a 
house with which it is not connected by occupation, ownership, 


* RRISHKAMURITT PADHDHATT « 244 


association or aspect, which are the ordinary considerations in 
prediction. This opened his eyes to the supreme importance of 
constellations in prediction. He established by his researches, 
that the results of a planet (in its period) are strongly modified by 
the lord of the constellation in which it is posited according to 
the occupation, ownership, associations and aspects of the latter. 
That was not all. Two planets in the same constellation invoked 
the results of the house(s) signified by the constellation lord in 
different ways, one favourably and the other adversely. Prof. 
Krishnamurti understood that the difference in the result should 
be affributed to the exact portion of the constellation occupied 
by the planet. For determining the zone of the constellation 
occupied by the tenanting planet the constellation had to be 
divided in some signigicant, scientific manner. The idea of dividing 
the constellation in the mysterious unequal vimshotary proportion 
attributed to the venerable Sage Parasara struck him. Prot. 
Krishnamurti succeeded again in establishing he was a pandita 
or Samadarsin described in the great Scripture Bhagavad Gita 
who viewed all with an equalily of vision as the manifestation of 
the one God. He had also toured SriLanka and Malaysia at the 
instance of astrological notabilities like Jyothish Praveen Sri 
A.Sivapatham of Srilanka. Prof.Krishnamurti was the visiting 
Professor of Astrology of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and was 
the recipient of the titles 'Jyothish Marthand' and 'Sothida 
Mannan’, the former having been conferred on him by his 
Excellency Dr PV.Cherian, the then Governor 
of Maharashira in 1964 and the latter by Mr. T.Sivapragasam, 
S.M.S.; PJK., M.B.E., Of St. Jon on behalf of the Malayan 
Astrological sociely on 29-06-1970 in recognition of his 
outstanding services in the field of Astrology. Prof.Krishnamulti 
was verily an Emperor (Samrat) in the Astrological world, a Sun 
filling it with his dazzling brilliance. Or.NarayanRao, the Director 
of the King Institute, Guindy, Madras who knew Prof.Krishnamurti 
only as a subordinate of his, in office was astonished to realise 
his greatness as a gifted Astologer on seeing the journal "Blitz" 


250) «ASTRO SHORTS 


the photo of Prof.Krishnamurti being garlanded by the Governor 
of Maharastra at the special convocation of the Bharatiya Vidhya 
Bhavan. Dr.Rao is said to have taken a culling of news report 
and sent it to Prof.Krishnamurti with profuse congratulation. 


Inviable Fate of which he was a knower (Daivajna) snatched 
Prof. Krishnamurti away when he was at the height of his glory 
onthe 30" March 1972 drowning his family, friends and admirers 
in sorrow. Messages of hearifelt grief came pouring in at the 
news of the demise of Prof. Krishnamuri spread. Here is what 
His Holiness Swami Dayananda Saraswatiji Maharaj of the 
Chinmaya Mission said: 


“oome men never die. - sri K.S.Krishnamurti was one of them. 
| knew this grea man through Sri Ramaratnam, his disciple in 
Astrology, and [| had met him once. Within the short period of a 
few minutes of my talking to him, ! could very deeply feel that 
here was a man who would never die. 


“Our Rishis - whether they revealed Brahma Viday or any 
other branch of knowledge have been elernally alive in the hears 
of men. Sri. Krishnamurti belonged to that cadre. This is no praise; 
his is what | very vividly feel of him. Such men only prove the 
intrinsic strength of our Culture to throw men and women in 
different fields whose contribution would redound to its original 
Glory". 


Prof. Krishnamurti was born at Thiruvaiyaru (Lat.10°48'N: 
Long. 79° 15E) in Keelaka Varsha of the Jovian cycle of years 
(Bhaspathyavarsha) on the 17” of the Tamil month of Aippasi 
(Malayalam month Thulam}, on Sunday 1-11-1908 at 11 hours 
58 minutes local mean time (Abhijit Muhurta) in sravan Nakshatra, 
suklapaksha Asutami, Vishti Karana and Soola Yoga. One Ghati 
or 24 minutes on either side of the apparent local noon 
(idnamachya}) when the Sun is at the Meridian, constitutes the 
Abhijit Muhurta which is considered as auspicious. The Lord when 
he came down as Vamana Avalara is said to have chosen the 


KRISHNAMURT] PADAHDHATI « 251 


Abhijit Muhurta on the Sravan Nakshtra day in the month of Simha 
(Tamil month Avani) to give real Knowledge to emperor Mahabaili. 
The latter was puffed up with pride as man of great charities. The 
Lord showed mahabali, that giving up the separative ego is the 
real renunciation which gives the Bliss of Immmiortality, possessed 
of which, works do not taint one nor possessions bind one. The 
sravana Nakshatra day in the month of Simha (Avani) is 
celebrated every year as “Onam” by the Keralites. Prot. 
Krishnamurti was sent forth by the Lord into the world in Abhijit 
Muhurt on a Sravan Nakshatra day in the month of Aippasi 
{Thulam} when the Sun transited the airy sign of the balance 
symbolising justice and critical judgement to deliver the real Truths 
of Astrology to humanity.

PADHDHATI 253 


Born on Sunday, the day ruled by Sun, the King of planets 
and the Atmakaraka 


(Representative of the embodied soul), with Sun in 
Midheaven the native was highly noble in spirit and was intent 
on mastering the Knowledge that would be of service to mankind 
(Lokopakarakshma Viday }. Born with the Moon increasing in 
light (Vardhamanan thithi in a chara (movable) Karana, he showed 
high versatility and rose from height to height in glory like the 
waxing Moon (Kramena parivardhathe). If thithi is the difference 
between the longitudes of the Moon and the Sun (Moon minus 
oun), yoga is the sum of the longitudes of the Moon and the Sun 
(Chandrarkayoga). There are twenty-seven yoga commencing 
there with Vishkambha and ending with Vaidhriti. Each yoga is 
said to correspond to a Nakshatra whose lord rules the yoga as 
well. Vishkamha yoga corresponds to Pushyami Nakshatra and 
is ruled by Saturn; Preeti yoga corresponds to Aslesha Nakshatra 
and is ruled by Mercury and so on. The planet ruling the yoga at 
birth is said to be a yogakaraka. One may say, the planet gives 
the results of the houses signified by it ina good measure. Prof. 
Krishnamurti was born in Soola yoga which corresponds to 
Visakha Nakshatra and is ruled by Jupiter.Of Jupiter we shall 
see later. 


sravana Nakshatra (star ruled by the Moon inthe sign owned 
by Saturn) is said to indicate sobriety, caution, contemplation, 
dutifulness and service, patience and perseverance learning 
(Srutavan), fame (vikhyatah), traverse (atanah} and so on. 
We know how Prof.Krishnamurni emobodies these qualities in 
sufficient measure. 


Let us now asess the strength of planets in the chart and 
examine some of the traditional yogas present in the chart. Sun 
and Venus the signlord of the Sun and Mars the lord of the 
exaltation sign of the sun are in association, aspected by Saturn 
the exaltation planet of the sign occupied by the Sun offering 
Neechabahanga on the Sun unmistakably. 


254 "ASTRO SLORUES = 


(ladrasyadhipah taducchapak kendre and so on). Digbala 
(directional strength) is said to be more important sources of 
strength of the sun (Bhanordig Balamaha), pakshabala that of 
the Moon (sasinah slaghyam hi pakshodbhavam) and retrograde 
strength (chestabala) that of the other "planets" (Vakragamane 
taragrahanambalam). The 10" cusp is said to be the point of 
maximum Digbala for the sun. Mark Sun close to the 107 cusp 
fast ascending to it. Sun is elevated in Western parlance. Sun is 
thus strong. Moon is increasing in light (more than half of its dise 
visibie) and is sufficiently strong. Mercury the signlord of Venus 
and also the exalted planets of Venus Neecha sign 
(Taducchanathah) is in a kendra sign from the lagna and Moon 
conferring clear Neechabhanga of Venus. (Tadrasinathopi 
taducchanathah, sachandralangnadyadi kendravare). 


Apart from the Neechabhagangnrajayoga attributable to the 
sun and Venus, Sun is in Nipunayoga with Mercury. Except Venus 
and Saturn, all other planets (taragrahas)are said to lose power 
and deny resulfs when combust. Mercury, one may say, Is 
combust in the chart. But Prof.Krishnamurti has demonstrated 
through his researches that planets do not lose power or deny 
results when combust. He cites the charts of celebrated 
Mathematics, Engineers etc., where Mercury Is clearly combust 
. Nipuna yoga in a kendra, kona or 11 is a traditional combination 
for Mathematics and Astrology Budhabhanoo kendra Kona 
labhasthow). 


The 9" lord Mercury and 10™ lord Venus exchange signs in a 
sthoola dharmakarmadhipathi yoga. 


Jupiter the lord of Virtue, the owner for the 9* sign 
(Dharmasthana) of the natural zodiac is in the Navamsa sign 
Virgo (a human sign) and the Shashtiamasa sign Taurus the 
Vakshthana or Vidyasthana of the natural Zodize which represents 
amiability, learning (Vidya) and humility. (Vidya alone gives 
humility-vidya dadati vinayam). The $" cusp is in the Navamsa 
sign Gemini (a human sign) and the sashtiamsa sign Libra (the 


* KRISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI « 255 


sign of Justice). Mercury the 9m lord is in the Navamsa sign 
Sagittarius, in the human portion of the sign, (the Navamsa 
longitude Mercury is 13°30), and the shashtiamsa sign of 
Aquarius of human sign again, the sign of the perfect man. This 
indicates the native's attitude of reverence and surrender to the 
Supreme being and love and sympathy for fellow beings who 
are all His creation. 


Jupiter in the 8" sign from the lagna {moon sign) produces 
the effects of Adhiyoga by his benign aspect on the signs on 
either side of the lagna (Moon sign). 


Let us now examine the chart in a systematic manner. Six 
out of the regular planets (taragrahsa) vi, Jupiter, Venus, Mars, 
Mercury, Sun and Uranus are above the horizon, two important 
ones among them viz., Sun the atmakaraka and Mercury the 
planet of Astrology culminating (approaching the Midheaven 
cusp). This denotes great capacities, self-reliance, perserevance, 
high aspirations, energetic nature, full manifestation of capacities 
and elevation to great heights. Mercury the planet of Astrology 
‘and the owner of 9 (the house of Astrology) culminating indicates 
great aptitude for Astrology. 


The cusp of the ascendant falls in Capricorn, the sign owned 
by the dutiful Saturn, the 10" sign (Karmasthana) of the natural 
zodiac symbolising action done as service or sacrifice; Capricorn 
the Cardinal. Earihy sign owned by Saturn denotes an active 
and practical nature, persistence and perseverance, sagacity, 
Stability and self-reliance, judiciousness and caution and the ideal 
of perfection in action. Saturn the lord of the ascendan in excellent 
sextile aspect with the cusp of the ascendant accentuates the 
Saturnine qualities of the sign. As the exaltation sign of Mars the 
most positive and energetic planet, Capricorn show refined action 
and high forms of service. [he cusp of the ascendant falls in the 
constellation of the Moon (Sravana Nakashatra} whose qualities 
like sobriety, caution, contemplation etc. we have seen earlier. 
The Drekkana, Navamsa and Dwadasamsain which the cusp of 


256 * ASTRO SECRETS 


the ascendant falls are also significant in as much as they modify 
the qualities of the sign. The ascendant cusp is in the Drekkana 
sign Taurus, the Navamsa sign Aries and the Dwadasamasa sign 
Taurus again. The influence of the Navamsa sign Aries show 
energy and enterprise, independence and confidence and a 
pioneering spirit. The influence of Taurus (the fixed, earthy sign 
owned by Venus) as the Drekkana and Owadasamsa sign 
denctes sweet amiability, learning (vidya) and humility, a 
tempering of the impulse and ambition of the sign and Navamsa 
and an increase of qualities of persistence and perseverance. 
The second Drekkana of Makara Rasi is symbolised as beautiful 
young lady skillful in arts (Kalaswabhijnab jadalayatakshee) 
seeking newer and newerthings (vidhitrani chamargamana)}. Here 
was Prof. Krishnamurti as adept in the part of prediction, seeking 
and finding newer and more refined techniques of predicition. 


From the point of view of Krishnamurti Padhdhati, more than 
the ascendant and its lord, it is the sublord of the cusp of the 
ascendant and Its position and disposition that determines the 
personal characteristics of the native. The cusp of the ascendant 
is in the sub of Moon who is the planet generally examined 
regarding personal characteristic. Moon is a_ highly 
impressionalble sensitive and receptive planet who represents 
public life and domestic life at once. Moon in the chart owns. 7" 
house of public and is rising in the lagna in the 10" sign (the sign 
of fame and honour) of the natural zodiac indicating a happy 
domestic life and fame, prominence and popularity for the native. 
Moon is very close to the cusp of the ascendant, in the same 
constellation, Drekkana, Navamsa and Dwadasamsa of the 
ascendant cusp, indicating the same personal characteristics as 
described above. Moon when she is increasing in light is said to 
express the qualities of the sign etc., in which she is posited in 
the fullest measure. Saturn the lord of the ascendant is in its own 
constellation in, the sign Pisces owned by Jupiter. Saturn in 
Jupiter's sign is said to denote honour even from kings. (Pratyayia 
NarendraBhavane)}. It also indicates occult capacities. 


* KRISHNAMUARTI PabHOHATI 2 eof 


Let us now study the aspects of the Moon. The first significant 
applicant of the Moon is to the sextile (a very close one) of Saturn 
the lord of the ascendant. [hat at once sets the seal of stability, 
patience, persistence and perseverance of the personality of the 
native. Moon in the sub of saturn gives high degree of mental 
concentration, so says Prof.Krishnamurti. Moon in her own 
constellation in the sign of Saturn in excellent sextile aspect 60° 
70' with Saturn in its constellation is a deep connection of Moon 
with Saturn as her being inthe sub of Saturn. Moon in the sub 
Mars the planet of energy and confidence under the aspect of 
Saturn toning down this (Mars) impulsiveness and aiding mental 
concentration. The next important aspect of the Moon is her 
separation from the Square of Mercury 93°42’ Mercury is the 
lord of 9 (the house representing the higher mind) in 9 as a strong 
significator of 9 in the airy sign of critical judgement, Libra. The 
aspect amounts to a highly critical attitude of the mind towards 
the traditional and the conventional and a somewhat restless 
pining of something new and more perfect. As Moon is separating 
from the Square of Mercury, she is applying to the Square of the 
Sun (85°543. Sun is also inthe same sign and house as Mercury, 
and the Square aspect denotes a yearning for the expansion of 
the mental horizon, for a fuller expression of the inner and a 
venturesomeness. 


The planet Sun (the Atmakaraka} denotes individuality or 
character, (the inner man) and Mercury the mental qualificiations. 
oun in good strength in Libra the airy sign of the balance, the 
exalation sign of Saturn the planet of spiritual concentration shows 
a harmonious, noble individuality, a strong spiritual bent and 
intuitive perception. Sun's nearest application is to the Sextile of 
Jupiter (69) the planet of justice, virtue and wisdom laying the 
foundation of astrong moral character. Sun is in 9 reaching upto 
the Midheaven cusp, in the constellation of Rahu and the sub of 
Venus the lord of 5 and 10. Rahu is in the trine house 5 
(Poorvapunyasthana}, representing Mercury the lord of 9 in sign 
position and Mars in 9 stellar position. Sun is thus a strong 


258 t. ASTRO SLORUIS + 


significator of 9 showing a deeply religious disposition and self- 
reliance. Sun in Libra with Moon in Capricon in good strength is 
a favourable combination showing methodicity, caution, prudence 
étc., Sun's Square aspect with the Moon has already been 
discussed. 


Mercury is in 9 in Libra, a congenial airy sign, the sign of 
critical judgment in the constellation and sub of Rahu who 
represents Mercury itself through sign and Mars in 9 through 
constellation, denoting a highly critical and enquiring mind and 
keen intuition. Mercury in Libra shows oratorical powers as well. 
Note Mercury owning the sub on the cusp of 2 the house of 
speech. Prof. Krishnamurti Used to keep his audience spellbound 
by his lucid and powerful exposition of scientific Astrology. 
Mercury in airy sign Libra indicates very good memory as well. 
The Square aspect of Mercury with the Moon has been discussed 
above. Mercury in 9 without any planets in its constellations in 
the airy sign Libra as a strong significator of 9 is an ideal 
combination for Astology, which accounts for Prof.Krishnamurti 
capacity to make quick mental calculations and come of startlingly 
correct judgement in a matter of minutes. 


Coming to science of Astrology, Mathematical, Astronomy 
is the backbone of Astrology. The planet Mercury represents 
Mathematics and is thus the planet of Astrology. Westerners 
attach much importance fo Uranus as the planet of Astrology. 
Saturn governs prediction and Mars courage, confidence and 
success. Among Houses, the 9" House represents the higher 
mind which when awakened receives the Truths of Religion and 
higher sciences like Astrology. The 9" house is thus the primary 
House of Astrology. Prediction is governed by the second House 
which is the House of speech or expression (vaksthana). The 
12" house an occult House (leenasthana) represents the psychic 
mind in which receptivity to the inner world is awakened. It is 
also thus important in relation to the science of Astrology. Putting 
two and two together we have the conditions for proficiency in 


" KAISHNAMUAT] PanrnHati « 259 


Astrology. Mercury should be congenially placed and be a strong 
significator of 2,4, or 9 (Vidyasthanas) preferably 9 for proficiency 
in Astrology. Mercury and Sun aspected by Saturn is a traditional 
combination for Astrology and Mathematics. (Dwitheeyasthow 
ravibudhow-taveva sanina drishthow). Saturn should be well 
placed and be a strong significator of 2 for good power of 
prediction. Mercury and Saturn being connected with 11,as well 
adds to proficiency in Astrology. Mars influence on Mercury and 
saturn and the Houses relevant to Astrology indicates confidence 
and success. Mercury, Saturn, Uranus and also the Moon (Mathi) 
must have beneficial aspects. Many stray combinations for 
Astrology have been given inthe Hindu and Western Astrological 
texts which have relevance only if the general conditions for 
proficiency in Astrology are satisfied. 


li is a grievous error to think that Prof. Krishnamurti 
disparaged Hindu or Western Astrology. It is like suggesting that 
the one who put forward the wave theory of light was decrying 
the corpuscular theory of light and showing irreverence to the 
great Scientist Newton. The corpuscular theory of light account 
for which the wave theory had necessarily to be propounded. In 
the preliminary chapters of K.P. Reader Il (Fundamentals of 
Astrology} Prof. Krishnamurti exhorts students of Astrology to 
learn thoroughly the words of our sages and all books on 
Astrology written by the scholars on the subject. The Zodiac of 
Krishnamurti Padhdhathi is the constellation zodiac of Hindu 
Astrology. Prof.Krishnamurti’s system has need for accurate 
House cusps. He has accepted the scientific rlacidian cusps which 
are found to work well with Latitudes with which we are familiar. 
Any other cusps like the Topocentric ones need be thought of 
only in case of births near and beyond the Arctic circles. Prot. 
Krishnamurti has accepted all the important basic principles of 
Hindu and Western Astrology in his system. He has, however, 
thoroughly revolutionised the predictive portion (Phalabhaga) in 
his padhdhaii. 


260) «ASTRO SACRETS 


To come back to the chart, the ascendant is the man. Saturn 
the planet of concentration, methodicity and power of prediction 
and Mars, the planet of courage, confidence and success should 
exert influence on the ascendant, and the sublord of the ascendant 
should be connected with 9 or 12 for one to become a goad 
Astrologer. Saturn in the nativity owns the ascendant and is in its 
own constellation in excellent fine aspect with the cusp of the 
ascendant. Moon who owns the constellation and sub on the cusp 
of the ascendant is in the ascendant in her own constellation in 
excellent sextile aspect with Saturn. Mars is aspecting Saturn the 
lord of the ascendant from 9 from the Sign of Mercury the planet 
of Astrology.Mars is in Tredecile aspect 109°17 with the cusp of 
the ascendent. Moon the sublord of the cusp of the ascendent 
owns the constellation on the cusp of 9 { the house of Astrology} 
and Is in the sub of Mars in 9 in the sign of Mercury. 


The second house is the Vakusthana which is also a 
Vidyasthan. Tradition looks for learning in the position and 
associations of the lord of 2 (Arthaswamini muknyabhavajushi 
etc., chapter 16 of Phaladeepika). From the point of view of 
Krishnamurti Padhdhathi it is the sublord of the cusp of 2, its 
nature, position, disposition and connections that give more 
accurate clue regarding learning. This aspect has been put to 
test and confirmed by the learned sothida Mani, Sri. A. Sivapatham 
of Sri Lanka. He finds that the sublord of the cusp of 2 signifying 
9 or 12 makes one proficient in the occult secrets of the science 
of Astrology owning to the sub on the 2ng cusp of the nativity. 
Mercury is the lord of 9 (the House of astrolgy) in 9 in the 
constellation and sub of Rahu who owns the constellation on the 
cusp of 2 and is in Trine aspect (122° 20) with it (Mercury). Rahu 
by sign position represents Mercury in 9 in Libra conjunct Sun 
the representative of knowledge helpful to mankind 
(Lokopakarakshma vidya). Rahu is in the constellation of Mars, 
the lord of 17 in.9. Mercury also owns the constellation and sub 
on the cusp of 11. Note how Mercury is well connected with 2 
and 9, the Houses relevant to Astrology and also with 11. 


KRISHNAMURT! Papaorali + 761 


saturn the planet of prediction owns 2 (the House of speech) 
as Is in 2 (Vakkil Sani) in the occult sign Pisces owned by Jupiter, 
in its own constellation and the sub of Moon in its (Saturn's) own 
sign in excellent sextile aspect with her. Mars the lord of 11 
(Siddhijand Venus the lord of 10 Gaya or success) are practical 
wisdom owned by Mercury. What more is needed to account for 
Prof. Krishnamunti’s brilliant and baffling power of prediction 
(Vaksiddhi}’? 


The 3 house denotes mental inclinations, specialisation etc. 
The Sra house is spoken of as an occult house (Leenasthana). 
The 3a cusp falls in Pisces the 12 (occult) sign of the natural 
zodiac owned by Jupiter. Mercury the planet of Astrology owns 
the constellation and sub on the cusp of 3. (The House of 
Astrology) has already been discussed, Prof. Krishnamurthi's 
specialisation is at once clear. 


The 4th house represents education. The 6" house stands 
for receipt of money by way of loan, scholarship etc. The 12" 
house indicates benefits, profits (non-repayable receipts) etc. The 
sublord of the 4" cusp should be connected with 6 or 11 for one 
to receive scholarship. The sublord of the 4" cusp of the nativity, 
Rahu represent Mercury the lord of 6 by occupation of the sign 
Gemini. Rahu owns the constellation on the cusp of 6 and Is in 
the constellation of Mars who owns 4 and 11 and is aspecting 4. 
Mercury the 6" lord is also aspecting 4. Prof. Krishnamurti was 
the recipient of a Scholarship while he was student of the 
st.Joesph's College, Tiruchinapalli. The scholarship was awarded 
in August 1926 when he was running the Dasa and Bhukti of 
Rahu the sublord of the 4" cusp and the constellation lord of the 
sixth cusp. 


The 5" house is the house of Poorvapunya. It carries the 
perfume of past Karma (ihe deed in the past lives). The 5" house 
is owned by the benefic Venus who is in the constellation of Sun 
the Atmakaraka in 9 in elevation in Libra the sign of justice. Sun 
is in sextile aspect with Jupiter the lord of Dh’arma. Moon the 


262 e ASTRO SECREIS + 


constellation lord of the cusp of 5 ts in the ascendant in her own 
constellation in biquintile aspect (144° 54) with Jupiter. Saturn 
the planet of duty and service owns the Sub on the cusp of 5 and 
is in its own constellaitons in the sign of Jupitet. Saturn is in 
biquintile aspect which elevates Sun. Much Poorvapunya and a 
sound and strong character are indicated. 


Neptune is said to represent places of restriction like jails, 
hospitals, asylums etc., Neptune is in 6" House of service in 
association with Rahu the karaka for jails and in parallel of 
declination with the Moon (the 21°35 N and 21°55 S respectively) 
in Gapricon the “10°” sign of the natural zodiac. Neptune is in 
Quintile aspect 70° 20 with Venus the lord of 10. The indication is 
that the native’s job will be in some manner connected w.th 
institutions like jails, hospitals etc. Prof. Krishnamurti had to visit 
jails periodically as an inspecting Officer of Public Health 
Department of Government of Tamilnadu. According to 
Krishnamurti Padhdhathi, if the sublord of the 12" cusp indicates 
imprisonment, the event will fructify in the conjoint periods of the 
signiicators of houses 2,3,8 and 12. Prof. Krishnamurti says that 
even when he visited jails as an insepecting Officer the times would 
mysteriously be governed by the significators of these houses. 


Neptune in the 6" House (an occult house) in the airy sign 
Gemini owned by Mercury, in the constellation of benefic Jupiter 
the lord of 3 and 12 (both occult houses) in 8 (another occult 
house) in the sign of the Sun representing the “Intuitive heart" 
uniting all the four occult houses into a single strong influence, 
indicates a high form of intuition and keen intelligence. 


Prof. Krishnamurti’s noble and pious partner (Shahadharmini) 
was over in Jyesta Nakshaira (star ruled by Mercury in the sign 
owned by Mars). Note Moon the sublord of the 7" cusp of the 
nativity in the sub of Mars in Mercury's sign. 


The 8" house is perhaps the most important of the occult 
houses (Leenasthanas}. As the house of life (Ayyushsthana} and 


" KRHISHWAMTRTIE FAIHIFHaATT = 265 


earth (Mrithyusthan) at once, it conceals the mysteries of life and 
death viz., fate, life and death are one and not two. Eternal life is 
the death of the separative "|" as soon as it takes shape in 
manifestation. Benefic Venus the planet of love is in 8 in the 6” 
Sign (one of the leenasthanas of the natural zodiac} owned by 
Mercury the planet of Astrology, the science of fate. The supreme 
benefic Jupiter the owner of 3 and 12 posited in 8 in the 
constellation of Venus in 8 in excellent sextile aspected with the 
8" lord Sun, strong in Libra, indicates an intense yearning for the 
knowledge of the mysteries of fate. Note Venus on the 
constellation and sub of the 8" cusp as well. This yearning was 
at its height in the period of Jupiter (Guru) and had response 
from the Almighty through the Grace of Jagadguru Sankaracharya 
Swamigal of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham. Prof. Krishnamurti 
achieved inalienable contact with inner intuitive planes of 
consciousness and discovered the inner secrets of fate 
(Prediction) which were to be stabilised in the Dasa and Bhukti 
of Saturn, the establisher that followed. 


Jupiter as we have already seen, rules the yoga at birth (Socta 
yoga) and is thus a yogakaraka. Jupiler (Guru) as a significator 
of the trine house 5 gave the native the Grace of Guru and as a 
significator of the occult houses communion with inner planes 
of consciousness. 


Let us now enter the Mansion of Astrology viz., the 9" house. 
lf the trine house 5 represents past karma in the form of results 
(Poorvapunya), the other trine house 5 represents past karma in 
the form of results (Poorvapunya), the other trine house 9 shows 
the line of unfoldment in the present life. The 9° cusp falls in 
Virgo the sign of practical occult wisdom owned by Mercury the 
planet of Astrology. Prof. Krishnamurti’s destiny was to unfold 
himself fast as an illustrious astrologer. Mercury owns both the 
sign and sub onthe cusp of 9 and has been discussed in sufficient 
detail above. Mars the planet of energy and activity who owns 
the 11" house (the house in association with which all planets 


2 Geb “ASTRO SECRETS 


shine equally well} is posited in 9 in the sign of Mercury in mutual 
aspect with Saturn in 2 in the occult sign Pisces. Mars is in the 
constellation of Moon who owns the constellations on the cusps 
of 9 and the ascendant and is posited in the asoendant. The 
planets that corule the cusp of 9 and those that occupy 9 are 
strong significators of 9. Of them, Mars and Moon are strongly 
connected with the ascendant as well, inter linking the trineé house 
9 and the ascendent as well, thus showing the native's deep 
knowledge of the science {Sastra) of Astrology. Mars and Saturn 
influencing 9 is an asset from the point of view of astrological 
capacity, as we know. 


Mars is strikingly in close Square aspect with Uranus the 
palnet of Astrology showing a rebellious spirit towards Astrology. 
But Uranus in Trine aspect ‘24°10 with Jupiter the lord of Dharma, 
justice and wisdom and the owner of the occult 12" house 
indicating that all is well and that the rebellion is only against the 
inadequacy of the existing techniques of prediction and not a 
denial of the subject in the manner of the self styled rationalist, 
who seem to find reason in rejecting things they do not know 
without taking the reasonable trouble of enquiring or examining 
them. Also note Mercury the lord of 9 in Quintile aspect (72°58) 
with Uranus. 


The tenth house is the house of profession. Its cusp is in the 
sub of Mars in Virgo the 6" sign of the natural zodiac representing 
"Public Health" among other things, thus justifying Prof. 
Krishnamunt's job in the Public Health Department of Government 
of Tamilnadu. Venus the lord of 10 is in Qunitile aspect with 
Neptune, and Rahu the constellation lord of the 10° cusp in 
association with Neptune in 6, the House of service indicating 
connection of the native's job with jails, as we have already seen. 
Prof. Krishnamurli entered service on 14-7-1927 when he was 
running Rahu Dasa, Jupiter Bhukt. Note Jupiter in the 
constellation of Venus the lord of 10 in Virgo the sign of "Public 
Health". The day was Thursday (ruled by Jupiter the Bhuktinatha} 


« KAISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI + foo 


and Moon was transiting Purvashada Nakshatra ruled by Venus 
the 10” lord, in the sign Sagittarius owned by Jupiter the 
Bhuktinatha. Sun was transiting Gemini in 6, in the constellation 
of Jupiter and the sub of Venus the 10" lord. Rahu the Dasanatha 
Was transiting Gemini close of its natal position, in the 
constellation of Mars, the lord of 11 and the sublord of the 10” 
cusp and in the sub of Venus the 10” lord. Jupiter the Bhukthinatha 
was transiting Pisces his own sign, in 2, in the constellation of 
satu the lord of 2 in 2, close to Natal Saturn. 


The 10" house represents not only profession but all pursuits 
the native indulges in, whether to earn or to learn. Mars the sublord 
of 12™ cusp is in 9 (the house of astrolgoy) in the sign of Mercury 
the planet of Astrology in the constellation of Moon who owns 
the constellation on the cusp of 9 (the house of Astrology). Moon 
is in excellenet sextile aspect with Saturn the planet of prediction 
and Mars the sublord of the 10° cusp is in mutual aspect with 
Saturn thus justifying Prof. Krishnamurti's pursuit of the science 
of prediction as subject dearest to his heart. 


The 10" House is the House of success and fame (Jaya and 
Keerti). Mars the planet of activity and success and the lord of the 
auspicious 11™ house owns the sub on the cusp of 10. The sublord 
of the 10" cusp signifying the ascendant strongly indicates fame 
and success for the native. Note Mars the sublord of the 10" cusp 
of the nativity in the constellation of Moon the lord of the 
constellation and sub on the cusp of the ascendant, posited in the 
ascendant close to its cusp, in excellent sextile aspect with Saturn 
the lord of the ascendant. Moon owns 7" (the House of Public) 
and is in Capricon the 10" sign (the sea of success and fame) of 
the natural zodiac. How well Prof. Krishnamurti's great success, 
fame and popularity are accounted for! 


The 11* House denotes all acquisition including that of 
learning. It is the House of Siddhi. Mercury the planet of Astrology 
owns the constellation and sub on the cusp of 11. Mercury is the 
owner of 9" house of astrolgy) and a strong significator of 9 in 


266 * “ASTRO SH-REIS 


Libra, the 7th sign of the natural zodiac (the sign of the Public). 
Mercury is in the constellation of Rahu the consiellation lord of 
the 10" cusp and is in conjunction with Sun who is close to the 
10" cusp proclaiming Prof. Krishnamurti's success in Astrology, 
Popularity and great fame again. 


Ketu the representative of occult knowledge (Jnanakaraka) 
is in 11 in the sign of Jupiter in association with Uranus in 12. 
Uranus in 12, though favourable for psychic matters, portends 
mystery, confinement to prison etc, in horoscopes which are 
unfortunate on the whole. In Prof. Krishnamurti’s brilliant chart, 
however, Uranus in 12 in the sign of Jupiter in trine aspect with 
Jupiter, who is in a congenial sign meant great occult capacity, 
discovery of deep technique of prediction and no doubt a job 
that had to with jails. Jupiter the lord of 12 and Venus who owns 
the constellation and sub on the cusp of 12 have already been 
discussed in detail. 


Sayana Mercury is at 21°39, its sextile falling at 27°39. The 
right ascension of this point is 27°43. The R.A.M.C at birth being 
219°39 the are of direction “M.C.Sextile Mercury (zodiacal)" is 
51°04. One degree (60 minutes) of Right Ascension in the system 
of Primary Directions (zodiacal) means one year (365.26 days) 
of life and one minute of Right Ascension corresponds to 6.1 
days (approx.) of life. That is to say, the 10" cusp progressed in 
the manner of Primary Directions would be in exact sextile aspect 
with zodiacal Mercury at birth 51 years and 24 days after birth 
(1.¢@., around 25-11-59). 


Mercury being a strong significator of Astrology in the chart, 
this period (52na year) is significant in the life of Prof. Krishnamurti, 
as marking great mental activity on the subject and an illumination 
of the mind by a flood of New Lights on Astrology. If we may 
progress the planets to this period in the manner of Secondary 
directions, Mercury would be progressing in the 11™ house of the 
Radix in sextile fo its radical position and Venus the lord of 10” 
would be progressing in 10 in sextile to her own radical position. 


* KAISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI = 26/ 


vlars the lord of 11 and the sublord of the 10m cusp would be 
‘progressing in 10 in sextile to radical Uranus in a cease-fire with 
latter. Prof. Krishnamurti was then in Saturn Dasa, Saturn Bhuktt. 
The doubts were gnawing at his heart had been cleared. The 
rebellion had ended ina victory and discovery. He had consolidated 
the gains from his contact with inner planes of consciousness. He 
was growing impatient with his official duties and wanted to retire 
voluntarily from service and devote his whole time and energy to 
Astrology. He retired trom service voluntarily on Tuesday, 19-9- 
1961. Houses 5 and 9 which are in12 to 6 and 10 respectively and 
the 12° House denote retiremei from service. Prof. Krishnamurti 
was running Saturn Dasa, Mercury Bhukti at the time of retirement. 
The day of retirement is ruled by Mars. Note Mars on the sub of 
the «9 cusp as a Significator of 9. Saturn the Dasanatha owns the 
oub on the cusp of 5 and is in its own constellation and the sub of 
loon who owns the contellation on the cusp of both 5 and 9. 
oaturn is aspecting 5,9 and 12 and is aspected by Venus and 
Mars who are strong significators of 9. Mercury is a strong 
significator of 9 and is in the constellation and sub of Rahu who is 
5 as a strong significator of 9. Sun on the day of retirement was 
transiting his own constellation in Mercury's sign Vigro. Moon was 
transiting 12 inthe constellation of Venus the lord of +0 who signifies 
9 strongly. Saturn the Dasanatha was transiting 12 in its own sign 
in the constellation of Sun (in 9) and the sub of Rahu in 5. Mercury 
the Bhuktinatha was transiting his ov/n sign Vigro in 9 in the 
constellation of Mars in 3 in conjunction with Natal Mars. 


Prof. Krishnamurti was recipient of two titles as we have seen. 
Uranus and Venus receiving good aspects, and Venus in Vigintile 
aspect with Jupiter are two of the combinations mentioned for the 
receipt of titles and honour. Note uranus in Trine aspect with Jupiter 
and Venus in excellent Vigintile aspect with Jupiter in the Naimty. 


His esteemed magazine took birth on evening of Wednesday, 
20-3-1963 when Prof. Krishnamurti was running Saturn Dasa, 
Mercury Bhukti, Rahu Antara. Saturn Mercury and Rahu as 


za 4 “sASTRO SECRETS 4 


significators of Astrology in Prof. Krinhnamurti’s chart have be :n 
discussed above. The sign Vigro (which coincides with 9° h- 2+ 
of Prof. Krishnamurti’s chart) as on the ascendant and Moon 
was transiting Capricon Uttarashada the constellation of Sun a 
strong significator of Astrology in Prof. Krishnamurti's Nativity. 
The six Readers of Krishnamurti Padhdhati which embedy the 
deeper secrets of prediction discovered by Prof. Krishnamurti 
and Krishnamurti's Ephemeris for the years 1911 to 1970 followed 
the Magazine. 


Among Houses the 3’ House governs paper, writing, editing, 
printing, publishing etc., the 11 the house denotes fulfillment of 
desires etc., the planet Mercury represents paper, new, writing, 
editing etc., Mars indicates printing, (press, machinery etc.,) and 
Jupiter publishing. For one to write, edit, print and publish, 
therefore, the three planets must be connected with 3 and 11. 
Mercury in the chart is inthe constellation of Mars the lord of 11. 
Mars the lord of 11 is aspecting 3. Jupiter owns 3 and is in the 
constellation of Venus in association with Mars the lord of 11. 
Note Mercury the planet of Astrology on the constellation and 
sub of the cusps of 3 and 11, both houses of writings. Mercury is 
in the constellation of Rahu owns the constellation on the cusp 
of 10 (the house of publicity). Rahu is in the constellation of Mars 
the sublord of the 10° cusp and Mars is in the contellation of 
Moon in Capricon (the sign of publicity) showing how Prof. 
Krishnamurti wrote; edited and published his works for speaking 
the deeper secretes of prediction he had discovered. Fortuna is 
in 3 (the house of writing) blessing his endeavours. 


Prof. Krishnamurti was snatched away by fate on 29/30-3- 
1972, astrological day Wednesday at about 2 A.M., |.S.T. Mercury 
the day lord is a significatorr of Badhakasthana through its 
constellation lord Rahu. Mercury also owns the sub on the cusp 
of 2 (Marakasthana). The period then running was saturn Dasa, 
Rahu Bhukti, Rahu Antara. Saturn the lord of ascendant owns 2 
(Marakasthana) in addition. Of the two Markasthanas 2 is said to 


KRISHNAMURTI Pabiotiry * 2b9 


be more potent than 7, the occupant of 2 being a powertull killer 
(Adyavyayasthan aduttaram balavattaram). Saturn is in 2 in its 
own constellation and the sub of Moon the lord of 7 aspecting 7. 
Saturn the Ayushkaraka associated with Marakasthana is said to 
inflict death in its period in preference to other planets 
({atikramyetaran). Saturn is in addition under the strong aspect 
of Mars the Badhakasthanathipathi. Rahu is in the constellation 
of Mars the Badhakasthanathipathi. Rahu ts in the constellation 
of Mars the Badhakasihanathipathi who is in mutual aspect with 
afflicted Saturn the Ayushakaraka. Rahu is in the sub of Moon 
the lord of 7 aspecting 7. Uranus the destroyer is in Mokshashthan 
opposing Rahu, and Mars the constellation lord of Rahu is in 
Square aspect with Uranus. 


As for transits, Sun was transiting 2 in the constellation of 
Saturn and the sub of Jupiter the Mokshasthanathipathi. Transiting 
Sun was in association with Natal Saturn the Dasanatha. Moon 
was transtiting in conjunction with transiting Uranus the destroyer 
in her own constellation in association with Natal Mars, 
Badhakasthanathipathi. Saturn the Dasanatha was transiting in 
close conjunction with transiting Mars in Taurus in the 
constellation of Sun and the sub of Venus, opposing 
Badhakashthana. (Sun is a significator of Badhakashthana 
through his constellation lord Rahu and Venus owns the 
constellation and sub on the cusp of 12 (Mokshasthana). Rahu 
the lord of Bhukti and Antara was transiting Capricon in the 
constellation of Sun and the sub of Venus again. Transiting Rahu 
was close to the cusp of the ascendant. 


Progressed Sun was applying closely in the conjunction of 
Uranus the destroyer to12 in the radix. Uranus in transit was 
squaring its own radical position and progressed Sun. 


"Nature and nature's Laws lay hidden in night; God said 
“let Newton be", and all was light", so goes a saying about Sir 
Isaac Newton. The minute secrets of Predictive Astrology were 
long lying hidden in night. 


270 * ASTRO) SACRETS * 


We have heard the Puranic story of the churning of the Milky 
Ocean. Manthara Parvata which was used as the churning rod 
was sinking into the ocean. God came down as Koormavartara 
to raise it. Great Truths can be known only by those who have 
the courage to question and enquire. Like the Manthara Parvala 
of the Puranic story, Hindu Predictive Astrology was sinking into 
the depths of disrepute. Prof. Krishnamurti was sent forth by the 
almighty into the world to raise it to a respectable level. He had 
to take serious note of the sad inadequacy of predictive Astrology 
as it existed and not to close his eyes to it for fear of sinning 
against the ancient Rishis. He yearned for the knowledge cof the 
missing links in Predictive Astrology as it existed, enquired 
ceaselessly, discovered the sound stellar secrets of predicition 
through the Grace of the Almighty and scattered them broadcast 
to humanity. 


The name of Prof. Krishnamurti, our revered Guruji will be 
remembered so long as single soul devoted to the knowledge of 
the deeper truths of Predictive Astrology exists in this beautiful 
Earth. 


Before taking leave of the distinguished Readers let me record 
my deep indebtedness to Sri.K.Subramaniam, the learned Editor 
of this esteemed Magazine and his brilliant younger brother 
ori.K.Hariharan who readily responded to my requeste and made 
available the details embodied in this article in consultation with 
the learned Jyothish Visharad S.K.Ganapathi, who had the good 
fortune of being trained in astrolgy by his illustrious father himself 
through instruction, example and influence. My thanks are also 
due to the K.RScholar of the stellar Astrological Institute, Madras 
for his generous help.

THE LION ROARS \ 
“YOUAND YOUR STARS" J 


COURTESY BY MA.KANDIAH THIRU, JOURNALIST, SARILANKA. 
Question by Mr. Thiru : ls everything predestined? 


Answer by K.S.K. : Yes, of course, weak astrologers take 
shelter under the theory that "Astrology teaches tendencies" It's 
a leaky shed they are seeking shelter in. "When will 1 die? asks a 
consultant quite seriously. Is the answer to it "The tendency Is to 
die next year. But you can avert it". It is illogical. Events are events. 
They occur at a particular moment. You cannot avert them, and 
you cannot change their time. Pararabdha Karma is Destiny, 
which is inevitable and unavoidable. It will work, and bring out 
the result in the form of events, whether you like it or not. Nothing 
is in oul hands. Providence has willed if judging the good and 
bad deeds in the past births. His will, will work to the end of 
one’s life. 


Question : Some astrologers say Santhis, Propitiations, to 
God or gods or planets avert the evil. They cite treatises of Rishis 
as props. 


Answer : | do not wholly believe in Santhis. They are no 
Guarantee but for every action there is a reaction. No action goes 
waste, and nothing happens without a cause. Two men stand for 
election. They pray to the same God with an equal bribe. But 
one wins, because he was destined. His birth chart showed the 
event. God dispensed him that good karma. His bribe was not 
the cause. You cannot bribe god. But | do believe in prayer or 
atonement which certainly mitigates. It again depends on the 
gravity of the sin. Genuine penance has healthy rewards. 


Question : There is a snag about Birth charts. What is the 
birth time ? first cry? Nowadays, you know many children are 
forced out by doctors. How do you reckon their time? 


272 * ASTRO SOCRDTS 


Answer: The time of severance of the child from the mother 
is the time of birth of the child. Severance may be by any means. 
The moment the mother stops feeding the child through the 
circulatory system or the moment the child begins to live outside 
the mother under natural conditions is the actual time of birth 


Question : what is the Ruling sign (Rasi) of Ceylon? 


Answer : To be exact, | have fixed at the fifteenth degree of 
Capricon or Makara. 


Question : Does a province of Ceylon, say safina you know 
come under a different sign ? 


Answer : Inthe human body there are twelve signs or aha, as. 
In your house too, there are twelve signs or shavas. It is the same 
for villages, towns and countries. Jaffna or any other Province 
come under Ceylon. Yet, we have to take Lagna cr ascendant as 
the 15" degree of Capricon. 


Question : Our predictive system is based on the findings of 
our ancient Rishis like Parasara and Varaha Mihira. To support, 
the prediction on any point our astrologers rattle off their verse 
in the original or translation. When two horoscopes cannot be 
alike, Jupiter in Cancer (Kataka) will not give same effect in 
different horoscopes, where is the relevancy of quotation from 
the revealed texts. 


Answer : Meaningless. t loathe such quotations. Those men 
appear to have no deductive thinking. The palnets in the same 
longitude diametrically opposite results, depending on the 
ascendant and the cusps of the other 11 Houses. Take the charts 
of twins. Planets are inthe same position. Lagna is the same ; so 
is the Navamsa. One lives, the other dies. Or one marries; the 
other does not. Krishnamurti Padhdhati alone can explain the 
apparent difference. 


Question : Everyone is conscious of the tussle between the 
Vakya and Drik Ganitha methods of calculation. The adherents 


"*KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI = 2/3 


of one orthe other are legion even in this country. Which one will 
you favour ? Or will you advocate Raphael's Ephemeris and 
Deduct Ayanamsa ? 


Answer : Drik Ganitha is better and dependable. Forget 
Vakya; it is incorrect. Other Ayanamsas are incorrect, if it will not 
agree with Drik Ganitha. Take Raphael's Ephemeris, and 
krinnamurt’s Ayanamsa alone. Ignore personalities in your quest 
for method that will yield correct results. If you have a flair for any 
one, judge from his or her predictions of Mr. Dudley Senannayake, 
of Sri Giri in India, about Mr. Wilson's continuance in office in 
England, about Mr. Chavan's quitting ottice in India, years ago 
and the like. So such a system requires perfection. 


Question : When doctors of medicine disagree in diagnosis 
is it not possible to depend on Palmistry or Astrology to a certainty 
? Say, on an urgent matter like surgical operation? 


Answer: Palmistry will not help. Howcan a four inch line unravel 
the myteres of an eighly year span of life * some lines may appear 
in future, and some faded away already. What we can see is the 
part of whole. There is no cerainity: Astrology alone is cerfain. It 
will Turnish correct answers fo every question. In 1952 | visited 
crematoriums, for some months and saw the palms of the dead. 
Men of 80 and 85 had short line, including the Life Line. What was 
the index to their death ? Does this agree with the rules’? 


Answer : it is a dangerous question. We have to do more 
research in Astrology to include clues to such phenomena. Where 
is the rule for atomic war? 


Question : wnat is the planet ruling the Tamil race? 

Answer : Mercury 

Question : Many of our astrologers resort to birth - 
rectification. Have you any method by which you can say only a 


human being could be born, and not an animal, at a particular 
moment ? 


24 * ASTRO SLERLIK « 


‘Answer : Rules to determine it have been given by the sages, 
but thy need improvement as they fail. As if is, no rule is absolutely 
correct. Birth can occur at all time. The pressing need is to 
determine the sex of the child from the Horoscope, Even that is 
impertect. 


Question : Which is stronger, Janmma Lagna or Chandra 
Lagna’? 


Answer : Always go by Janma Lagna, not on Chandra Lagna. 
In the Horoscopes of twins, for example, the Moon remains in 
the same degree and minute while there is achange in the Lagna, 
especially the sub lord according to Krishnamurti Padhdhaii. 


Question: How do you determine the date of marriage 7 By 
the transit of Jupiter? 


Answer : TO take Jupiter's tansit (gochara) alone as per 
traditional system is to fool the ignorant customers. Just examine 
the horoscopes of men and women getting marriéd on a single 
auspicious day in a town. To their Moon sign, Jupiter will be in 
differnet signs. Transit should be judged according to 
Krishnamurti Padhdhati to determine one's marriage. It will take 
me three hours if you want me to explain the system. 


Question: Does prasna (horary) Astrology, on which you are 
an authority, serve to predict from birth to death? 


Answer: yes, itis an exact science. It is mysterious and quite 
perfect. Under this system the astrologer obtains a number with 
in 249 from the consultant, and bases all his predictions on that 
number. Generally, horary ig resorted to by those who have no 
horescopes or doubt the correctness of the horoscope or if one 
gets alternate dates. 


Question: what is your opinion of retrograde (vakra) planets 
in the natal chart’? 


' KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI « 2fo 


Answer: whether a planet is retrograde or in direct motion in 
a Nalal chart, the result is the same. But in horary Astrology 
retrograde planets delay or deny effect according to the 
constellations they are in and the motion of ils lord. In my 
emperience | have found constellations very potent. In 1922 many 
planets were retrograde. Men born then, ran dasa of Rahu, Jupiter, 
and Saturn one following another . I yet, some of them became 
high court judges or ministers of State. Did the retrograde planets 
affect them in their dasas? 


Question: You are aware that ancther person evolved a new 
system of prediction. He says he owes it to the ancient Hishis. 
DO you too owe yours to the ancients? 


Answer: For names of planets, signs and wmshottary dasa, | 
go to the Hindu Nirayana system. For divisions of House | go to 
the western system. For the predictive part | stand on my own. 
Mine is a unique discovery. itis entirely novel. | predictthe nature 
and time of every event correctly. The honours conferred on me, 
the gold medals given by very learned gents and my books are 
ample testimony to it. My system is no secret; it is elaborated in 
my book " Krishnamurti Padhdhati" | prefer a simple straight 
method to reach the goal. | abhor prevarications. A consultant 
wants a specific answer. Give it neat. And give it immediately: 
confusing methods are as bad as equivocaling answers. 


Question: We are following the fixed zodiac called Nirayana, 
while the Westerners are following the moving zodiac called 
sayana. Which is superior’? why? 


Answer: Neither is superior. You can follow either. Both are 
incomplete. Hence the need for my research. All who follow my 
system get at the same result. It varies not from intellect to intellect. 
| follow the constellation theory which is Nirayana, and | have 
advanced it. 


Question: some say when varaha wihira wrote his brihat jataka 
the starting point of the fixed zodiac and the moving zodiac was 


276 * ASTIOO SAOMAIS « 


one and the same namely, the O° degree of Mesha (aries). That is 
why he made no distinction between the two zodiacs. So say 
scholars. Is itso, according to your researches? 


Answer: No, at the time of varaha mihaira also the moving 
zodiac was moving in retrograde motion at the rate of nearly one 
degree for 71 years. That they coincided during his time is not 
true. Roughly once in 25000 years they coincide. Constellations 
are fixed . Hence our need to go on afixed Zodiac. The Nirayana 
Zodiac commences at a point right opposite (180 degree) citra 
or spica. 


Question: with no backing from sages or Rishis, the 
westerners seem to have come by a method to predict correctly. 
The murder of kennedy, the American do you think some of them 
have evolved a method superior to ours for prediction? Or is it a 
stray shot with the help of spritual mediums? 


Answer: In our system as Well as theirs, there are such lucky 
hits. But there are many miserable failures too. The woman who 
predicted kennedy's death cannot predict her own. No doctor 
takes even a friend of his to burial ground to show his patients 
who have succumbed. Nordoes an engineer show the buildings 
of his, that have cracked down. Likewise will an astrologer list up 
his failures! 


Question: can Nadi grantha,which goes by the different 
names like the khandas, sapta Rishi vakya,kausika vakya be 
depended upon toe predict the future?how did the ancient work 
on millions of horoscopes,as if on the permutation and 
combination method for most of us? 


Answer: it is a mysterious thing under the control of devils. 
The manuscript gives you correctly the past up to the moment 
of your consultation. Why isn't the devil capable of telling you 
what is to happen’? It is like the tape-recorder capable of erasing 
the old song and receiving the new one in its place also. There 
are a few possessors of those manuscripts who can improvise.

Question: There are some scientifiacally inclined astrologers 
here working with the works lahiri. Ils he dependable? 


Answer: yes. He was in the employ ofthe union Government. 
He is almost correct. He ever stands for reasoning. Late C.G 
Ran is also correct all other faulty ones are numbering their 
days. Incorrect ayanamsas, will have their natural death very soon. 


Question: To predict longevity is a puzzle to astrologers.? 


Answer: It is no puzzle to K.P followers. | predict if fo the 
very dale of death. The key to it is in my Padhdhati. 


Question: our Rishis of cold seemed to have combined 
plamistry and Astrology for prediction. What is your opinion? 


Answer: They enjoyed divine grace. They were inspired. The 
texts they left behind do not reveal the short cuts they followed. 


Question: Did our ancients envisage mudane Astrology? 
Answer: yes

Question: 's it possible to seek the aid of astrology for weather 
forecast? 


Answer: it needs more research. It is being done in Russia 
and America. 


Question: sust as we depend upon the Moon's sign (Janma 
rasi) for our weekly and monthly forecasts, so depend the 
westermers on the Sun. which is better? 


Answer: Both are absurd, if one takes either Moon sign or 
sun sign alone. Do not read such general predictions. 


Question: what is the peculiarity of constellation? 


Answer: prediction proceeds from the position of the planet 
in aconstellation. The Moon in a sign does not give the effect of 
lord of the sign she is in. she gives the eftect of lord of the 


278 *"ASTRO SECRETS « 


constellation or astensm she is in. In Mesha, we find nakshatra 
bharani, the Moon will do the work of Venus (sukra) and not that 
of Mars who is the lord of that sign. Similarly any plant in the 
kritika nakshatra will behave like the Sun who is the lord of that 
nakashatra though Moon may be in aries or taurus. The 
constellation is certainly stronger than the sign. You know the 
fate of the House rented out. The tenant is stronger than the 
landlord. 


* RRISHNAMURIT PADHDHATL + 279) 


(KP FIRST PERIOD) 


This book is an attempt to teach KP to KP students , who are 
beginners and to those who are a little in the advanced stage. 


When every details of KP can be had from KP Readers and 
KP magazines of the past and present, what made me to think of 
teaching is explained, in a few lines. 


First, in this teaching of KP, | wish to make this book a 
minicompendium of KP details, under one umbrella, for the 
benefit of KP students, culled out from several articles of our 
Guruji and from other leading KP astrologers in a step by step 
manner, so as to brig several KP details found scattered over the 
KP Readers/ Magazines which details are missed by KP students 
for lack of experience and want of the very magazines for 
reference. 


KP students in their initial stages are confused for one thing 
or the other, which is a quite natural thing. In the May, 1979, 
"Astrology& Athrishta" Magazine, late sri N. Krishnamurthy- in his 
article. 


"The business man and his planets"? says in the concluding 
para 


" This piece may be disappointing to the well wishers, 
enthusiasts and lovers of KP, who proudly spent for a copy of 
this monthly under their broad wings, because they do notfind a 
meandering (Wandering at random) or a megalomaniac 
innovation, making them-keep their fingers crossed; the students 
beclause, he is shall | say, a paget, desiring to know all about KP 
Stellar Astrologyin a short space of time; to the practitioners and 
the adepts because this does not contain what is beyond their 
ken. However, when it is born in memory, that the taste of pudding 
is in the eating of it,will make all the difference." 


280 * ASTRO SHORATS 


From athe above quote it will be clear that any amount of 
teaching and learning, can never tind an end, till the intelligence 
of the KP student does not open the doors for KP at the mental 
level, that is upto intuition level. 


Selected few are born astrologers and the rest others are 
made astrologers because Astrology is acquired through learning 
and practising. [hereafter every day experience will help us to 
advance. 


Therefore KP students will have to work hard, eventhough it 
is time consuming if only they desire to experience the thrill of 
KP As KP students make a steady progress he will find with out 
fail, what guruji Said. KSK said in the lil Reader KP practical 
page118 "God will help you in a mysterious way". No one can 
afford to brush aside these immortal words. 


For KP students to come up, they must go through every 
available KP articles, right from the mouth of KSK and his 
intelligent students, till date. Every article will open your eyes in 
one way or the other. 


Why so much a forerunner? Because - the first hurdle is the 
very English language. This English in all the 6 KP Readers you 
will find, it is the most simple English. several traditional 
astrologers who do not know english, have mastered this KP in 
a brick by brick manner_ Alphabet by alphabet- it is the KP 
students who is totally a stranger to KR This is the crux of the 
problem. 


Learning is a continous process. The Teacher and the Taught 
always have a rapport. About this Teacher and the taught,.| wish 
to narrate a small story. 


Guru (Jupiter) was the Teacher and Chandra (Moon) was the 
taught. Amongst several students Guru liked Chandra very much 
for his intelligence and grasp of the subjects taught. Subject 
jyothisha was one in the curriculum. 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI » 251 


The gurukulam course was over and by tomorrow all the old batch 
students are to take leave. Chandra was one amongst them. Chandra 
was very fond of the subject jyothisha, and he had undue over 
confidence on the subject, resulting in his superiority complex over 
others. Guru was silently observing Chandra for quite some time. 


On the last day, Guru called Chandra to his chamber and 
blessed him. Then he made enquiries about his learning all these 
years, and slowly dragged him in conversation. 


Guru said, Chandra. You aré a genius. You are having so 
much confidence on your learning. Saying so, he (guru) gave a 
Rasi chart te Chandra (Moon), about a one year old baby on 
earth and asked him say something. 


Chandra glanced the chart and said - oh. Useless chart Within, 
5 (five) miniutes the baby Is to die from snake bite. The Guru asked 
him to have second lock at the chart. Chandra repeated the same 
snake bite prediction and added Moon is not strong, further Jupiter 
dristi (aspect) is also wanting on the life line. 


O.K said the curu; let us watch the scene on Earth. The baby 
was on the cradle. The cradle was held by chains from the roof 
beams. The snake did come on the roof as predicted by Chandra. 
The child saw the snake and thinking it to be a doll, stretched its 
hands trying to hold. As the snake was Still at a distance, the 
child in its joy to catch the doll that is snake, moved from side to 
side in the cradle. 


The cradle was tilted, due to which the chains were bending. 
The snake was slowly moving downwards. As the chains were 
bending, the snake put its head on one chain hole and the tail 
was moving through another chain hole. As the child vigorously 
bumped on the cradle to catch the doll, the snake - the chains 
bent - bent in such a way, the snake was caught between the 
bends, crushed and it died. 


Now the Guru asked - what is it Chandra. You predicted that 
the child will die. Now tt is the snake that is dead. How do you 


282 -*ASTRO SHFEIS 


reconcile over the matter. Chandra feeling the defeat burst in 
anger and said- you have not taught me everything. Guru .alm 
and quiotly told Chandra-you are a fool. You are locking only to 
the chart. Go by common sense. Guru further said, Chandra, 
you are Dehakaraka. You are looking at the baby directly. 


As guru | am benevolent mightly Jupiter. 1am also locking at 
the baby directly. 


How can the baby die? Now look at the chart again, 
everything is there. 


Itis your ego, over confidence- and above all the superiority 
complex all these have blurred your observation of the chart. 


Needless to say Chandra apologized. 


As KP students, in the beginning we are similar to Chandra. 
There fore in the process of learning , never jump toe a conclusion 
that this not clear ot that is not clear. 


Once a KP student said to KSK, that there are no 
varahamihiras now. KSK shot back and asked, is there a 
vikramadhithya? There is no vikarmadhithya but young 
varahamihiras are emerging in thousands, day by day following 
KP, all over the world. 


My next observation is -we have butter on hand and crying 
for ghee (clarified butter). Such a situation arises, when a KP 
student feels baffled, while applying KP principles in a Natal or 
horary chart. Why is he baffled? Because this KP is very similar 
to paramapada game/also called ladder and snakes. That is 
Stellar wise you arrived at a positive result, which result is pulled 
down at the sub-level, and vice versa, as he has to arrive at the 
results, through a series of subs, which act as links. 


The Nursery rtyme twinkle twinkle little star is very much apt 
to KP students who are the tiny-tots in KP, do not have the strength 
or Stamina due to lack of experience, to take stock of aspects, 


KRISHMAMURIT PADHDHATL = 2s 


conjoints, Rahu/ketu, badhaka, benefics, malefics and so on 
while analysis. Any KP student, at the very outset feels allergic 
to the very word sub, then the cuspal sub, planet sub and so on. 


With all these varying complexes, one day, this KP student 
is sure to emerge as a KP Master, for the reasons, he is no more 
a weakling in the fundamentals of KP. In the process of learning, 
there are no shortcuts to cut short the time span of learning. Of 
the several subject matters like marriage, child birth, going 
abroad, profession, promotion and so on, take any one of them 
from the Readers or from the KP magazines and read regularly. 
slow and steady, but sure a success. 


Arise- Take up KP- Drop the traditional. 


Awake - search with in you the secret chambers-that is sub. 
stop not- till the goal is reached - to declare an event to the 
minute-day date and time. 


KP students as beginners finds it tough to Follow KR But Mr. 
Mohan, an expert in RP has explained how a Bus Follows KR 
Therefore when a bus could follow KP, why not we KP students 
follow KR Article on this you will find, where RP is explained. 


Next about Sub-how they link a matter and the event. On this, 
the KP expert Late Mr.Kudanthai Nathan, explains about this Sub 
by an example. No.45-B, Bus runs from T.Nagar to Saidapet 
enroute Krishnampet, which area is popular in the minds of the 
Public and it has the cremation ground on the road side and also 
has the Bus stage, stopping, a little nearby. Now for sub, imagine 
itis Bus No. 45-B. if you get into 45-B Bus you reach Saidapet to 
enable you to attend your work. lf 45-B Bus, runs on you, you 
reach Krishnampet, to enable you to attend your own funeral. 


- Here the 45-B Bus, the Hero-our Sub, links - you to Saidapet 
or you to Krishnapet, depending on the indication, that ts 
signification. Therefore one has to be very careful, with this very 
delicate Sub, during analysis. tt is similar to a double edged razor. 


284 * ATTRO SECRETS 


Let us first have a glimpse on the life history of our Guruji 
Or.K.s.K., the immortal legendary figure of this 20° century, 
followed by a few pages, under the caption. "The Lion Rears". 
These pages contain or reveal the mind and heart of a personality 
who emerged victoriously on his system called Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati, only to give his life time toil, as free gift to all of us. 


We are basking under that Sun - Marthand - Jythish 
Marthand 


KP students to advance in KP should have thorough 
understanding about Ayanamsa, about New combe, Placidus 
system, Geocentric Latitude, Ruling planets, Sensitive points of 
the Zodiac, timing of events, fruitful significators, the Golden Rule 
in KR improving houses and Non-improving houses etc.., 


For our study we will first take up the topic Ayanamsa. This 
is going to be a lengthy one. Once you grasp this Ayanamsa, it 
Will very much help you to understand KP. 


AYANAMSA 


Guruji Sri.K.S.K., has well explained about Ayanamsa in the 
KP First Reader, pages 55 to 59 and 61 to 66. Now let me explain, 
as simple as possible about this Ayanamsa. Ayanamsa is the 
faulty brain child of the Zodiac itself. All Physics students know, 
as they were taught, to first check up the error in the vernier 
caliper and or Screw gauge, before taking the measurement of a 
given material. Those who Know nothing about Physics - say a 
common man who goes with a vessel to the provision stores to 
purchase 1 Kg. of oil, the shopman first weighs the vesstl which 
is say 300 grams. Then the oil is poured and weighed to 1 Kg 300 
grams, minus 300 grams is the wt of the oil purchased - that is 
1kg. The same above said principle are equally applicable to 
Ayanamsa relevant to the Zodiac. The two Zodiacs are 


The great majority of Western astrologers use what is called 
"The Tropical Zodiac" of the signs. It begins each year at the 


KAISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI + 285 


vernal equinox, the first day of the spring, Aries which will be on 
21* March - roughly 23 days ahead of our Indian "Fixed Zodiac", 
commencing at 0° Aries, that is as on 13% or 14" April every year. 
You will find from vasan’s Drik Ganitha Panchanga, for every 20itn 
or 21* of each English month, where in it is mentioned as 
Rishabhaayana, Mithunaayana, Katakaayana and so on which 
speaks of the Sayana system. 


K.P. & ASTROLOGY (JUNE 1994) 
THE EDITOR SPEAKS 


It is unfortunate that a controversy has been raised now, after 
several years, in the KP world regarding the Ayanamsa factor. 


Late Prof. Sri.K.S.Krishnamunti, during his life time has clearly 
and unequivocally asserted that Ayanamsa, as printed in the 
Reader No. 1 alone is to be adopted bP foflowers. Guruji has 
proved by more than one example that his Ayanamsa alone works 
well in KP system of Astrology, and he has proved while rectifying 
Birth charts that only the Ayanamsa suggested by him should be 
adopted and any other Ayanamsa will give misleading results. 
According to Guruji’s Teachings, the Ayanamsa as printed on 
Page No. 58, of casting the Horoscope (| Reader) should be 
adopted for the various years from 1840 to 2001 has already 
been printed on the above said page and that Ayanamsa alone 
should be adopted without any doubt for correct results. 


For years beyond 2001 the ayanamsa of 50.2388475 seconds 
should be added per year to the Ayanamsa of 23° 47' and the 
same should be rounded off to the nearest Minutes. 50.2388475 
seconds is the average rate of precession per year according to 
Newcomb. 


Another point to be clarified is regarding the lables of 
Houses. The Tables of Houses have all been constructed on 
Astronomical formulae, which is always based on the centre of 
the earth as the focal point i.e., Geocentric. As such it will be 


286 * ASTRO SHEEIS * 


more appropriate ifthe Tables are used reducing the Geographic 
Latitude of the Place to Geocentric Latitude, by the Tangent 
reduction formulae. We append below a Table of Geocentric 
latitudes corresponding to Geographic Latitude. + - 


00 the controversy as to which Ayanamsa should be adopted 
by the KP followers Is treated as closed and no correspondence on 
this subject willbe entertained for publication in the magazine in future. 


GOOD LUCK. 


K.R & ASTROLOGY (AUG 1994) 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
SIR, 


In the june 1994 issue of the KP & ASTROLOGY, you have 
given your authoritative ruling on the correct KP Ayanamsa to be 
used, in response to the article published in the two previous issues. 


| entirely agree with the ruling. | checked up the horoscopes 
in Book 1,3,4 and 6 and by checking the position of the Nirayana 
position of SUN, have found that Guruji has consistantly used 
the Ayanamsa as given inthe Header 1. It is therefore established 
beyond doubt, that Guruji has laid down that only these given in 
Reader 1 should be followed for 1840 to 2000 AD. It is only for 
finding ayanamsa beyond 2000 that we have to use the figure of 
50.2388475 sec. per year, and not from year 291 AD, as some 
have incorrectly presumed. 


| entriely agree that TOH (Tables Of Houses) are all with 
reference to geocentric latitudes. However, since most persons 
using TOH (Tables Of Houses) do not know this, they tend to 
use the Geographical Latitude for calculation. It would be great 
help if a table showing the Geographic Latitude, and 
corresponding Geocentric latitude, is published in the Magazine. 


Regarding the Dasa Balance, it entirely depends on the 
correct Longitude of Moon, at the time required. While Raphael 


RRISHKAMURTL PADHDHATI * 2a? 


and Lahiri (Nirayana), give the position of Moon both at 5.30 
a.m. and 5.30 p.m., the other ephemerises give only the position 
at 5.30 a.m. every day. Since the motion of the Moon is not 
regular during the 24 hrs. calculations based on the 24 hriy motion 
would give some error. [here is a correction possible, - the 
Besslers correction-, which is applied over 4 days of fhe Moon's 
position. This gives a maximum correction of about 3 Minutes. 
50, persons desiring a better position of Moon, should use 
Raphael's Ephemeris, or apply the Besslers Correction.

FIXED ZODIAC OR SIDERIAL ZODIAC 


The Hindu Astrologers use a different zodiac known as the 
siderial zodiac of the fixed stars, that is the actual constellations 
from which the signs derive their names. Sun on its own ecliptic 
path intersect the celestial equator at two points. One is called 
as Vasantha Vishu, Vernal Equinox and the other is called as 
oarath Vishu Autumnal equinox. The Vernal equinox commences 
at 0° Aries of the zodiac. This 0° Aries of the zoidac, retrogrades 
roughly 50" every year. Our ancient sages knew much about this 
moving zodiac, and in keeping with our ancient tradition, our 
Hindu Astrology and its system of interpretation has stood 
unmoved through millennia. 


Thus, the temporary error of the zodiac, a creation of the 
zodiac itself, accepted as it is by the Westerners is called Sayana. 


Ayana - moving 
Ayanamsa 
Amsa - part 


oa plus Ayana - Sayana - the moving Zodiac. 
Nir Ayana - Niryana - Not moving - The Fixed Zodiac. 


The Sayana zodiac, till today is not acceptable to the Indian 
genius, for the simple reason, the supremacy of our Indian 


288 “s ASTRO SECRETS 


Astrology, has stood the test of time, expect for a small pericd, 
which supremacy can be observed on the predictive side in 
general and the exact timing cf events in particular right since 
the time of Varahamihira, and even before. 


Now we have to understand why the Indian genius did not 
accept this Sayana zodiac. It is because the zodiac is a frame fitted 
over the 27 fixed stars otherwise called the Lunar Mansions. When 
the frame is fitted we have a clear cut 12 signs of 30° each called as 
solar Mansion. The fixed stars - over which the fixed zodiac - the 
frame is fitted commencing at 0° Aries meaning commencing at 0° 
Ketu star, and the other end of the axis will be at a point which is 180 
opposite on the bright star SPICA - Chitra at Thula - it is the 14" slar 
of the 27 stars making up the Zodiac each extending 13°.20 Chitra 
(Spica) is taken to be at the end of Virgo and at the commencement 
of Libra. Equinox means Day and Night are equal on a particular 
day of the year. Hence Vernal Equinox and Autumnal Equinex - that 
is Vasantha Vishu and Sarath Vishu, has its day. 


sayana position of cusps and planets, as such cannot be 
made use of for our KP Steller Astrology. Hence with the help of 
Ayanamsa, Sayan posilions of cusps and planets, are to be 
converted to Nirayana by deducting the Ayanamsa and then fixed. 
Deduction of Ayanamsa from Sayana level, is the converted one 
known as the Nirayana Bhava Chart. 


Late Guruji Sri.K.S.K., says follow my Ayanamsa alone and 
reject others. 


ori.K.S.K., adopted his ayanamsa from New Comb who 
found the coincidence of both Sayana and fixed zodiac was the 
year 291 AD, and the retrograde motion is atthe rate of 50.2388475 
second per year, according to Mr. New Combe. 


In an interview with journalist Mr. Kandaiah at Ceylon, relevant 
to moving zodiac and fixed zodiac Sri.K.S.K says 


Neither is superior. You can follow either. Both are incomplete. 
| follow the constellation theory, which is Nirayana and | have 
advanced it. 


eR RISHSAMIRIY PatuliibHatrl IRD 


Throughout his life Sr.K.S.K has obe-red this avenimsa 
topic as vexed one for the simple reasor no one is ab'e to 
understand the mystery behind this zodiac moving backwards. 


Relevant to the vexed Ayanamsa Sri.K.5.K says in the fifth 
reader page 187 - second para 


"Again it proves beyond doubt that Krishnamurti Ayanamsa 
is correct, and if the Ayanamsa Is different, do not apply KR 


Now let us apply our mind on Sayana - Nirayana and the 
Ayanamsa. 


Our ancients knew about this moving zodiac. Sage Parasara 
mentions about this Vimshothari Dasa system but no where he has 
explained the how and why of Dasa years to planets such as Sun 6 
years, Moon 10 years and so on, making the total of 120 years. 


The supremacy of Indian Astrology rests on this 120 years Dasa 
system and this 120 years can be had only from the commencement 
of the O° Aries on a fixed zodiac. We know the zodiac is moving, and 
if you say we follow the fixed zodiac, the term fixed zodiac becomes 
erroneous. Then what is the correct picture? The correct picture ts - 
the zodiac is nothing but a frame fixed over the 27 stars. It is the 
frame that is moving and not the 27 stars. Therefore every year for 
our calculations we deduct the Ayanamsa and bring back the zodiac 
exactly over the 27 stars in tune with the 0° Aries, and call itas Fred 
zodiac or Niryana, when only Vimshothari dasa system can be 
applied, and also more effectively to be applied through KR Vice 
Versa KP itsself begins from 0° Aries to give birth to 249 subs under 
the same Vimshothari Dasa system meaning 120 years. 


We will explain this by an example. 


You want to book your ticket form Madras to Howra. For 
Howra, the counter No. is 7. Ticket counters from 1 to 17, imagine 
it as the Zodiac. The zodiac is moving. That is the Ticket counters 
fwhich are example zodiac) having moved, you are now at the 
counter No.7. when if was the original counter No.6. 


290) "ASTRO SECRETS = 


You are now asking for the ticket to Howra. The man behind 
the counter directs you to counter No.8 where the original counter 
No.? was, and also tells that at the present counter No.7, tickets 
are issued to Delhi. You can well imagine the confusion. 


Hope KP students would have understood the genius and 
the wisdem behind the Fixed zodiac - that is Nirayana. 


PLACIDUS SYSTEM 


The Astro - Chart comprises 12 Houses, that is 12 Bhavas. 
Again House/Bhava means cusp to cusp. What is the meaning 
of the word Bhava. Every one knows the word Swabhava - that 
is a person's nature. One is rude, one ts always shorl tempered 
and one is ever with a smiling face. It is their nature - that is 
swabhava. in the same coin Bhava is to be understood. Each 
Bhava from cusp to cusp is never a fi!) 30°. Some Bhavas have 
2B° total span or 31 ° total span and so on. That is measured as it 
was found or observed or calculated. Hence the word Bhava. In 
English Bhava.is known as House. Therefore the signs of the 
zodiac which are of 30° span sign to sign, will not be so in terms 
of House, otherwise known as Bhava. 


Your attention is drawn to page 164 - Fiflh Reader Para 3 
where in Guruji raises the question. 


Only in the map we draw for a horoscope, we draw lines to 
separate each sign. In the Heavens is there any partition wall? 


Therefore this question of Sri.K.S.K has meaning. The 
meaning is the zodiac in the Heaven by itself is a Time clock. As 
we find in our clocks the 1 to 12 numbers - known as signs then 
the modified version to be known as House/Bhava, as Bhava 
has a celestial limit (just as we have territorial limits on earth} 
between Bhava to Bhava. 


Now we come back to partition walls. Sign to sign partition 
walls are of 30° span. Then the equal house division - also has a 
30° span - that is Bhava to Bhava. 


* KAISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI - 291 


By now it will be clear that the partition walls that we make of the 
zodiac under the Heavens known as sign to sign or Equal House 
Division both are 12 Equal Division of space of 360° zodiac 30° each. 


Still further before | proceed, here with page +25 of an article 
fram KP year bock 1995 is reproduced for the benefit of the 
students. From this article in para two the author has well 
explained about the partition walls. The reason for placidus system 
is that, this system divides the distance from the Midheaven to 
the Ascendant by equal blocks of time. 


im contrast, the Siripathi system mentioned in Parasara 
divides the distance from the Mid heaven to the Ascendant by 
equal Blocks of space. 


It is now still clear to us, that what we need is a map of the 
heavens - which has 


12 Equal Blocks of Time - of the Zodiac, and not a 12 equal 
Blocks of Space - of the Zodiac. 


If you have a 12 equal Block of Space - Rent control Act 
carries no meaning at all. 


lf you have a 12 equal Block of Time - then the Rent Control 
Act - that is your Fate / Destiny carries its full meaning through 
the 12 equal Blocks of time, each Block has to tell very clearly 
about your life, Health, Education, love affairs - Marriage - 
profession - Child Birlh and so on with an error free prediction, 
all that was well stamped at your véry birth. 


Your fate / Destiny about which let us know as to how the 
Basic Character of Horoscope is moulded. 


The Sun rises in the morning. His rays, shoot straight across 
the earth, from East to West, and at Noon, when the Sun reaches 
the Mid heaven, its rays pour down:wards through the Earth, 
from South to Narth. These two lines of positive and negative 
cays are axis upon which we build the horoscope, and from there 


2a3 ASTRO STCRITS = 


the whole of the tweleve houses have sprung. [here are 360 
distinct types of persons born each day of twenty four hours, 
because every four minutes of time brings a fresh degree of the 
zodiac upon the Ascendant, and each of these 360 types of 
persons are a totally different Nativity. This you will understand 
more clearly under KP in general and of the twin birth in particular. 
KP has a clear say, because it speaks through subs. 


We shall now proceed towards the Semi Arc system, also Known 
as the placidus system. The meaning of Arc is -the distance measured 
along a circle. Birth chart should be prepared according to Westem 
methods that is Placidus systern (Semi Arc system). Details of the placidus 
(Semi Arc) system is explained in UTOH. KP students are requested to 
read UTOH, to understand Placidus System. To understand this, it needs 
a litte knowledge of Mathematics more so Trigonometry. All KP students 
can not have had higher mathemetics. Hence a little explaining is made, 
of course wih a lite joke for an easy grasp. 


We are now coming to the final stage of the partition walls of 
zodiac. Now the joke is, your birth Ascendant - for which you are 
making the calculations first you have to look fo the place of 
your livelihood - that is profession - by which you have name, 
fame etc., that is X house, that is Meridian that is Mid heaven. 
When a person is in uffer distress he does not look to the East - 
Ascendant or West or South (Nadir), but looks to the midhevens, 
seemingly where God is and Cries - Are Bhagavan 


Oh God 
Ya Allah - and so on. 


so the Placidus system (Semi Are System ) has its origin 
from the Meridian. 


From the above readings, students | hope must have 
understood well about this Semi Arc system also known as 
Placidus system. This Placidus system is followed in the West as 
it is a clear cul one, in the true scientific method giving us the 
partition wall of the zodiac, that has 12 Equal Blocks of Time, 


* KRRISHNAMURTT PADHDHAIT « 293 


that goes to make a birth chart under KP, which KP has 
incorporated the techniques of Semi Arc system under its fold. 


You are erecting a Natal chart or Horary chart with the help 
of Tables of Houses - be it Raphaels,or UTOH or katsHman. This 
Table of nouses are a mere ready - reckoner as they originated 
first from the Meridian. 


Under the Placidus system the Tables of Houses are in 
sayana. Now you know what to do. Apply only KP Ayanamsa. 
From the sayana Position deduct the KP Ayanamsa - you get 
the Nirayana Bhava chakra with 12 Bhava Sputas. Sputa in 
oanskrit means cleaning. Hence the Bhava postions are also 
known as Bhava Sputa. That is the

QINDO - AMERICAN - K.P. PREDICTIONS 


As in all areas of Astic'scy one enter the arena of the 
Krishnamurti Padhdhati, or Krishnamurti system, not without 
encountering some controversy. Our purpose today is not to 
question whether Krishnamurti was the first to deeply study the 
importance of the Lunar Nakshatras in prediction - he wasn't - 
or to speculate whether the astounding accuracy he altained in 
prediction was the result of siddhis or the outcome of becoming 
very adept at the exquisitely logical system. All | am trying tc 
offer you today is some examples of one person's attempts tc 
research the methods. Krishnamuri reveals in his books some 
times with tanta’, . .g incompleteness - in the hopes that more 
astrologer will continue discussing this fascinating subject. Please 
try to hold questions until a designated question period which | 
will announce. 


Lets begin with a quick summary of how the KP system does 
basic calculations. It's a system that for its best working demands 
accuracy with in less than minute, (but it rewards the user with 
commensuratley accurate resulis). [he Krishnamurti ayanamsa 
must be used. The House cusps must be calculated as in the Westem 
Placidus system, except converted to sideral. [here now is at least 
one computer program available that does these calculations for 
jyothishis - see me affer to find out about that. The reason for the 
Placidus system is that this sysern divides the distance from the 
Mideaven to Ascendant by equal blocks of time. In contrast, the 
sripali system mentioned in parasara divides the distance trom the 
Midheaven to the ascendant by equal blocks of space. 


Once the chart has been calculated with Krishnamurti 
ayanamsa ani the Placidus House cusps, we are ready to begin 
considering the effect of the placement of grahas or bhava cusps 
in the various nakshathras. By conside.ing the nakshtra 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHOHATI « 295 


rulerships we get much more density of meaning. Each House, 
or more correctly, each shava, has several layers of significators. 


The strongest or most influential significators of a House in 
the KP system are the grahas whose nakshtra lords occupy the 
Bhava. Let's illustrate this. 


In charti, the chat of President Bill Clinton, (rectified) Virgo 
is rising. Jupiter is in the sign Libra, but it is in the first | bhava. 
Mars and Venus also occupy the first bhava. Now, to find the 
strongest significators bhava, we look for all the grahas whose 
nakshatra lords are Jupiter, Mars or Venus. Jupiter is in the 
Nakshatra Chitra ruled by Mars. (| am assuming you know the 
planetary rulerships of the nakshatras). Therefore Jupiter in a 
kind of double whammy is an occupant of the first bhava and 
has its nakshatra ruler occupying the first bhava. We begin to 
sense the strength of this when we remember that in Jupiter dasa 
clinton was elected U.S.Prest. Rahu is in the sign Taurus, in the 
Nakshatra Mrigashira, also ruled by Mars. Thus although both 
grahas are Food for thought.

q@ PLACIDUS SYSTEM (SEMLARC SYSTEM) ) 


BY (LATE} SRI. N. KRISHNAMURT HY 


KP students are requested to read “Universal Tables of 
Houses" for better undersatnding. (As a matter of copy right we 
are unable to reproduce relevant pages). Universal Tables of 
Houses can be had from M/s KRISHNAMURTI PUBUCATIONS, 
Spencer Plaza, Mount Road, Chennai-600002. 


The Semi-Are systems goes by the name of the person 
Placidus, and which system is commonly followed all over the 
world for the reason it is simple to apply to arrive atthe 12 cups 
of the Zodiac to a given Date, Birth Time and Place of Birth with 
reference to Latitude and Longitude of the place. 


Every Astrologer should have a sound knowledge of 
Astronomy. lt is not possible because every one would not have 
had higher mathmatics - say Trigonometry etc. during their 
School /College days. 


But KP Astrologers, even though they do not know 
Trigonometry, as for that matter a reasonably good English. still 
they are able to work out the cuspal positions of the Zodiac, and 
to fix the planetary positions there in. 


such Astrologers said above, should have a fundemental 
knowledge, in a simple language, about this Semi-Arc system. 
Therefore we are reproducing a few paras from the article - 
"Casting an Accurate Horoscope Without Table Of Houses" by 
(Late) Sri N. Krishnamurty. 


Before the clock was invented, time was measured during 
day time, when the Sun was shining bright, with a reed measuring 
16 inches long. it is placed in direct sunlight on a level ground 
and bent at right angles at such a part, that the horizontal portion 
equals the shadow of the perpendicular part. The number of units 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI + 2o/ 


of length in the perpendicular part gives the time from sunrise in 
ghatikas. Ifthe length ofthe reed is 16 inches, the horizontal part 
11% inches and perpendicular part 41% , the time at the moment 
is 4% ghatis from sunrise. 


In a clear night, the stars guided to ascertain the time at the 
moment. The stars are identified by their appearance in groups 
and their resemblance to particular objects. For insatnce. 
Pushyami is described as "Potola pushpam Pushya threeni", 
meaning that many dim stars like the flower of snakegourd. 
"Aslesha sarapaakaaram nava". Aslesha consists of nine stars in 
the form of a snake. "Makha Andolika pancha". Makha consists 
of five stars in the form of staff used for palanquin, which is Semi- 
circular in the middle and protruding at the two ends in almost a 
Straight line. When a particular star is seen overhead, another 
Star at 90 degrees, elapsed time in that Lagna was calculated 
and therefore the time. 


Even these days, many indicate the birth time in the 
horoscope, in ghatikas and vighatikas, and the metropolitan city 
dweller is no exception to it. The fun of it is, the Clock time of 
birth is converted into ghatikas and vighatikas and stated as so 
many ghatikas after sunrise the native was born, just to conform 
to the age old custom. No importance attaches to it. Nor do they 
actually calculate the time in ghatikas and vighatikas by any 
method which was in vogue many many years ago. 


lf the birth time is given in ghatikas and vighatikas, itt has to 
be converted into equivalent hours, minutes and seconds and 
added to the local mean time(LMT) of sunrise for the place of 
birth, to arrive at the local mean time birth. If the time of birth is 
given in 


Local mean time, it is retained as it is. In either case, the 
Greenwich Time (GMT) of birth is got by adding to, cr deducating 
from, the local mean time, according as the birth place is to the 
West or East of Greenwich. 


298 * AST SHORAIS « 


Astronomy 


Before proceeding further with the computation of the 
longitudes of the cusps of the horoscope, | shall introduce the 
readers to elements of Astronomy which may help grasp what 
follows, with ease. 


Geocentric celestial longitudes and latitudes of bodies are 
reckoned taking the Earth as the centre of the universe. These 
are significant in astrological calculations. Longitudes and 
latitudes reckoned with the Sun as centre of the universe, known 
as helio- centric longitudes and latitudes, are not concerned with 
astrology. Longitudes and latitudes (geocentric) are given for 
Greenwich Mean Noon in Ephermerides. The longitudes of 
bodies for the given birth time are found by propotion from tha: 
longitudes at Greenwhich Mean Noon given. For determinating 
the planetary positions, we take the GMT of birth as longitudes 
of bodies are the same for all places, but for finding the RAMC, 
we take the LMT of birth because the RAMC varies with the place. 


The Horizon and the Meridians of any place bisect each other 
and each of them bisects also the celestial equator. So, the 
equator which is a circle of 360 degrees, is divided into four equal 
parts of 90 degrees. Each of these four quadrants is trisected by 
great circles passing from the North to the South point of the 
place. Thus, the celestial equator and the celestial sphere around 
every place is divided into 12 equal compartments of SQ deg‘ ees. 


These are the 12 houses of the horoscope with reference to 
the place. They begin from the eastern horizon and run eastwards 
or anti-clock wise in their numerical order past the Nadir. The 
first, fourth, seventh and the tenth are angular houses and the 
remainning eight are non-angular houses. 


Cusps of the Houses 


The ecliptic is divided into 12 equal parts of 30 degree termed 
the 12 signs of the zodiac. The signs of the zodiac are quite 
independent of the place on the surtace of the earth and result 


" KRISHNAMURT] PADHDHATI © 299 


from dividing the ecliptic into 12 equal parts. They should not be 
confused with the 12 houses of the horoscope, which are peculiar 
to each place and which 


result from dividing the celestial equator into 12 equal parts. 
The ecliptic is necessarily cut by the cusp lines of 12 houses of 
the place. The ecliptic points at the junction of the 12 cusp lines 
with the ecliptic are termed cusps or the first points of the 12 
houses. 


The cusps demaracate the 12 houses. In Astrology we want 
to know the longitudes of the 12 cusps of birth. The zodiacal 
extent of a house in the ecliptic is intercepted between the two 
consecutive cusps. It varies according to the time and place for, 
the position of the ecliptic varies according to the time of 
observation and the latitudes af the place. As the position of the 
oblique ecliptic changes from moment to moment during a day, 
_the zodiacal extent of any Houses is always the same even for 
the same place. At any particular place, the zodiacal extent of 
opposite Houses are the same and the extent of any consecutive 
six houses will together be equal fo 180 degrees. The opposite 
cusps are always 1&0 degrees apart but of the opposite zodical 
sign. Hence, if any six cusps are known, the remaining six can 
be found. 


The equatorial extent of every house of any place will always 
be 30 degrees. That is, the difference between the Oblique 
Ascensions (0.A.'s) of consecutive cusps is always 30 degrees. 
But the difference between the Right Ascensions (F.A.’'s) of 
consecutive cusps vary with the longitude of the cusp (with the 
time of cbservation and the latitude of the place and will not 
necessarily be 30 degreés). 


OEMI -ARC STAGE 


Having found the approximate Sayana longitudes of the 
cusps by Trigonometric Method, the next is the Semi-Arc Stage. 
The semi-diurnal and semi-nocturnal ares of the ecliptic points 


300 e ASTI SHORTS « 


on the cusps have to be found. Two integral degrees one on 
either side of the apporximate longitudes of a cusp are taren 
and called Limiting Degrees of the cusps. The Declinations of 
the Limiting Degrees of the cusps are found. The Ascensional 
Ojfferences of the limiting degrees corresponding to their 
declinations and geocentric latitude of the birth place are found 
from a table of Ascensional Difference. 


Semi-arcs 


The Semi-arcs of a body are the equatorial arcs between 
the Meridan of a place and the declination circle of the body 
when it is on the horizon of a place. Hence, the Semi-ares of a 
body are the meridional distances when the body is on the 
horizon. The equatiorial are traversed by a body from the moment 
it rises at the eastern horizon of a place to the moment it sets at 
the Western horizon is the Diurnal Arc and the Arc traversed from 
the moment it sets to the moment it rises again at the eastern 
horizon is the Nocturnal Arc. Half of each of them is called the 
semi-Are, diurnal Semi Arc and the nocturnal - Semi Are 
respectively. They are together spoken of as Semi-arcs and are 
together equal to 180 degrees. The limits of the Semi-ares are 
the RA of the body and the RAMC when it is on the horizon. 


RA AAMC (when on eastern horizon) = SDA 
RA RAIC (when on Western horizon} = SNA 


The difference between 90 degrees and the Semi-Are of a 
body at a place is the Ascensional Difference when it is on the 
horizon of the place. So, the Ascensicnal Difference of a body 
when it is on the horizon (ADH) varies with the latitude of the 
plae and the declination of the body. 


RRISHNAMURITL PADHDHAILT = aU] 


( LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES) 


As the earth, is spherical in shape, some guide line is 
necessary to identify any place on it. As the earth is rotating round 
its axis, the ends of the axis are faken as fixed points and are 
taken as North and South Poles. Taking these pole points as the 
basis some imaginary lines are drawn on the earth and any place 
on earth is thus easily identified with their help. 


LATITUDES 


Taking the North, South Poles as the basis, a circle is drawn 
on the globe (which is a model of earth) in the middle in such a 
way, as lo divide if into two halves and this towards both the pole 
points and these are called parallels or latitudes. The diameter 
of these circles becomes less and less towards the poles which 
aré mere points. The area between the equator and the North 
Pole {i.e., the area North of equator) is called Northern 
Hemisphere and the area between the equator and the South 
Pole (i.¢., the area South of equator) is called the Southern 
Hemisphere. 


There are 90 latitues in the Northern Hemisphere and 90 
latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (i.¢., one latitude for each 
degree). Each degree can be divided into minutes and second. 
The latitude drawn at a distance of 23°.30 to the North of the 
equator is called the Tropic of Cancer. The latitude drawn ata 
distance of 23°.30 to the South of the equator is called the Tropic 
of Capricorn. 


The direct rays of the Sun do not fall beyond these latitudes. 


The 667.30 North latitude is known as Arctic Circle and the 
66°.30 South latitude is known as the Antarctic Circle. The rays 
4fthe Sun may fall in the areas between the circles and the poles 
continuously for a day (24 hours) or for many days ({i.e., the Sun 
may be visible for days together). The darkness in the same way 


302 « ASTRO SAOREIS « 


may extend for days, Le., the sun may not be visible for days 
together. 


The biggest circle is the equator. The circles of the South 
and North of this are smaller in size. Thus the diameter of these 
cirlces becomes less and less as we move towards poles which 
are only points. 


LONGITUDES 


The cirlces drawn across the globe through the poles, cutting 
across the equator, are called longitudes. In fact the Semi circle 
that is between the two poles is counted as one longitude. Thus 
there are 360 longitudes cutting across the equator and other 
360 latitudes. The longitudes are also known as meridians. 


some longitude is to be taken as starting point to count and 
number these longitudes. For this purpose the logitude that 
passes through Greenwich in London is takne as 0° Longitude. 
There are thus 180 longitudes towards east and west and the 
180° east and west longitude would be the same. The hemisphere 
between the 0° longitude and 180° East longitude is known as 
the Eastern Hemisphere and Hemisphere between 0° Longitude 
and 180° West longitude is the Western Hemisphere. 


USES 


As the earth is rotating from West to East the Sun rises on 
the eastern longitude. (As the earth takes 24 hours to complete 
one rotation, the Sun takes 4 minutes to travel from one longitude 
to the next. Thus the difference is local time between two 
successive longitudes would thus be 4 minutes. Given the 
difference in local time between two places, the longitude on 
which a place is situated can be known) if the longitude on which 
the other is situated is known. 


if the latitude and longitude of a place are known , its location 
on the globe can-be identified.

Om Sri Ganapahaye Namah 


¢ GEOCENTRIC LATITUDE } 


On this topic, at the very out set, | request K.P Students to 
please go through, pages 565 to 568 from the book - Ato Z 
Horoscope Maker and Delineator by Mr. LLeweLLyn George. The 
entrie reading is self explanatory and thought provoking. 


From the above Book pages- In a nutshell we are reminded 
to Understand that we are living on Earth and not on the Sun. 
oun as centre (Heliocentric) is altogether different from those 
with Earth as focusing point. We live on earth - not on the Sun. 


Note: As a matter of copy right, we are unable to reproduce 
the relevant pages. 


Next Sri K. Balachandran has explained about this 
Geocentric, which is also self explanatory from the first two paras 
_ id thereafter it is all Mathematics and Trigonometry. 


Now for KP students, who have no knowledge of higher 
mathematics, any amount of explaining about this Geocentric, 
ubjected ta Mathematics, does not lead anywhere. 


Theretore let us chalk out our own thinking as a common 
an about this geocentric. 


There are three fields operating on Earth. 


1. Magnetic Field 
2. Electromagnetic Field and 
3. Gravitational Field 


Mother Earth at her surface and from below has the 
G:-ivitational Field. On account of this Gravitational Field, 
€ « 3rything on Earth is pulled down wards, through a force called 
ti ? Gravitational Force. This Gravitional force emerges exacily 
fram the centre of the Earth, that is Geocentre, and acts on all 


304 «A> PRU SECKEDTS 


directions over the earth and at any give point over the Earth be 
it North Pole, South Pole, East or West. 


Now let us look at this Geocentric Lattitude and geographical 
latitude from a different angle. '¢ 


A child is born at proper Madras. 
Geographical Latitude of Madras is 13.04. 
Geocentric Latitude of Madras is 12.59 


The birth chart prepared, you call it as Map of the heaven. 
But the child born is on the Earth and not at the Heavens. When 
you say Map of the heavens, the Map is nothing but of the 
Kalapurusha- Time Personified. Yes, time personified- where? 
Certainly on Earth. That is the child, from birth to deatn 
continuously occ. pies a space and time on earth. The child if 
not so occupying Earth- it has to float on Earth. As the child, 
having been bern on earth, the gravitational force is acting on it, 
pulling it down words to the very centre of the Earth, whether 
alive o” dead, and walking or sleeping. 


Therefore for proper Madras, when the Geocentric Latitude 
is 12.59 and a child when born, the Gravitational Force trom the 
Centre of the Earth is acting on the child. Again therefore if you 
prepare the birth chart for 13.04 the Geographical Latitude, which 
is the outer surtace line on Earth, a man made one - Some of the 
cuspal SUBS will certainly change, and you will be at a loss not 
knowing where you are. 


Another example by which we can understand is from the 
word contour. Have a Map (Allas Map). Whal is a Map? Map is a 
piece of ground, drawn on a piece of paper, reduced fo a certain 
scale. 


What is contour? Contour - Line on Map, joining Points at 
same altitude, is called contour. Contours will always be parallel 
(altitudes - height-of objects above Sea Level) Now what is Earth, 
North or South to the Earth's Equator. These Terrestrial Latitudes 


* KAISHNAMUARTI PADHDHATI - 


are also parallels but strictly spaking the places on such line of 
Latitudes are not excatly on the dotted line. But round the earth 
you will have several continents, countries, cities, towns and 
villages on the same Latitude a little up or down by few miles on 
those Latitudes. 


ltis here one should think. The famous leaning tower at Pisa, 
yet to fall, for ihe simple reason, the gravitional force from the 
Gecocentric is holding and will be holding it from its bottom level, 
that is foundation level, till such time the gravitational field is 
disturbed. 


Hope | have made it clear. That is a child born at proper 
Madras can have its birth only on 12:59 Geocentric Latitude and 
not on 13.04 Geographical Latitude, because 13.04 is the outer 
surface line on Earth. But 12.59 is from the Centre of the Earth. If 
you prepare the birth chart for the Geographical Latitude 13.04 
instead of 12.59, the gravitational field will be a disturbed one 
and as per KP the cuspal SUBS will change. Nothing to doubt 
about it. That is as explained tor the Leaning Tower at Pisa, every 
point on Earth, will certainly have a shifted gravitational field as 
calculated tor Geocentric Latitude, and because of the disturbed 
and shitting gravitational field and force, the cuspal SUBS of the 
birth chart is bound to vary vis-a-vis 12.59 and 13.04 at 
Madras.(now called Chennai). 


Late Sri N.Krishna Murthy an expert in KR says that one 
should prepare the birth chart strictly to the Geocentric Latitudes 
only. 


Another expert in KA Sri M.G.G. Nayar says that Geocentric 
Latitudes should be considered only for Latitudes from 50° and 
above and for Latitudes below 50°, Geographical Latitudes will 
sulfice. Further in his article, "Epileptic Fits", he says - Strictly 
speaking the House-cusps should be computed for the 
Geocentric Latitude of the place in question, although the 
adoption of the Geographic Latitude does not mean any 


J06 _ ASTRO SCFEIS 


apperciable error ordinarily. The learned Sri. Krishnamurti has 
mentioned the "tan" formula for conversion of the Geographic 
Latitude into the Geocentric one in his excellent article "Casting 
an accurate horoscope with out Table of Houses” in the May 
1978 issue (Annual Number) of "Astrology and Athrista". The 
constant in the formula as given by Sri. Krishnamurti is based on 
the value of 1/297 for the flattening factor (compression or 
ellipticity) of the Earth. The revised value of compression used 
in the Nautical Almanacs from 1968 onwords is 1/298.25. The 
difference is trifling. Nevertheless, lef us conform to the revised 
value, in which case the formula would be: 


Log tan A=Log tan B +9,9970826, 


where A and B are the Geocentric and Geographic Latitudes 
respectively. lf, as in Nautical Astronomy, we consider the Latitude 
(whether Northern or Southern) as postive always, all the terms 
of the formula are postive always. The Geocentric Latitude for 
our chart works oul fo 11°47 N. 


The Nirayana chart erected from the Universal Tables of 
Houses and the Mahabala Ephemeries adopting the Ayanamsa 
of 23°22°29" for the date of birth (adjusting the Nirayana 
Longitudes derived the Mahabala Ephemeris by (-} 1 '29" would 
be etc. etc. and so on. 


Putting to vote majority will vote for N.Krishna Murthy, as the 
majority will see the SUBS changing without fail, between GCL 
and GL. GL= GCL Table is also furnished. 


Example: Please see the example chart. 


otudents are requested to go through pages 33 to 42 of the 
book Astrology for Beginners- Vol-l, to their advantage. 


The example birth charts prepared for both Geocentric 
Latitude and Geographical Latitudes are furnished below: 


KRISUNAMOURTT PABMDTATT = ay? 


1. Two sets of chart of GL/GCL of Mother and Daughter 
both born at Madras are given below: 


Mother: Smt. Uma Venkataraman. 
Daughter: Sow. V. Raja Lakshmi. 


a) From the birth chart cf the child prepared for GL&GCL 
there is no change in any of the 12 Cusps. What is the reason? 
The answer is invisible- in the sense, at that time of birth, the 
earth on its rotation, having the tilt, was overlaping - that is the 
gravitational force is overlapping, but the Gravitational field and 
force at 12.59 was not disturbed. 


b) From the birth chart of the Mother prepared for GL & 
GCL you will find 11" Cusp sublord is Mer in GL chart and in 
GGL chart is Kethu. 


This change is due to, the gravitational froce though over 
apping between 12.59to 13.04, did tilt, to pull the object child to 
3CGL 12.59. That is gravitational force if disturbed several cusps 
sublord, would have changed as the disturbance crthe disturbed 
gravitational field will cross 13.04GL. Here, only the tilt was there 
.ind the gravitational field at 42.59 was not disturbed.

GEOCENTRIC LATITUDE 


COURTESY K. BALACHANDRAN, B.SC, 


Precessional Astrology is the key note of Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati. While traditional Astrology deals with ‘generals’, K.P 
deals with "specifics" KR System is based on the microscopic 
analysis of a Horoscope. The actual position of the Sub or Sub 
of cusps and the planets is therefore very crucial of pinpointing 
the events. 


In casting a horoscope, three details are necessary, Viz., 
1. Date of Birth 
2. Time of Birth 


3. Place of Birth with ifs geographic latitude and longitude 
as given in the Standard Atlas. If not all, atleast most of the 
atrologers cast the horoscopre adopting the geographic latitude 
of the place of birth, sometimes omitting even minutes of latitude 
to geographic latitude of the place of birth, sometimes omitting 
even minutes of latitude to avoid the tedium of calculation. Such 
an omission is bound to impair the correctnes of a horoscope. It 
is to be noted that the Longitudinal position of the various house 
cusps given in the Tables of Houses are based on the geocentric 
latitude and not on the geographic latitude. 


The earth is not a perfect sphere. It is an Oblate spheroid 
bulged at the equatorial region and flat along the polar region. 
While the equatorial radius is about 6378 Kms, the polar radius 
about 6357kms. Thus the geographic latitudes is not the same 
as the geocentric latitude. A Mathematical analysis of this will 
mak the posilion clear. 


31? "ASTRO SECRITS 


Suppose P is the point of observation on the Surface of earth 
taken as a spheroid, if we truncate the central sections of Earth 
through the point it will be an ellipse of Major axis AX’ and Minor 
axis YY¥'. The earth will rotate about minor axis Y¥. 0 is the centre 
of Ellipse (earth). Suppose a perpendicular is drawn from P to 
meet the major axis AA1 at M. 


Now < PMX is the geographic latitude g2 and POX is 
geocentric latitude q71. 


The difference q2 - q1 is called the reduction of geographic 
latitude to geocentric latitude. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, 
obviously q2 - qi =0 but as it is not q2 - qi is a small positive 
quantity. 


To find reduction of latitude: 
Let the Perpendicualr from P to XX’ meet XX1 at N. 


OX = a = Equatorial raidus of earth 
OY = b = Polar radius of earth 

In a triangle PMN tan g2 - PN / MN 
MN / ON =b* /a? 

tang? = PN/ON 

= (PN/MN} * (MN/ON} 


= tan q? ( b* /a*) (because PN / MN = tan g2 and MN/ON 
—- by f a®) 


= tang! = lang2 {b?/a*} 


tan (q2- qi ) = (tanq2 - tangl }/ (1+ tang2 * tanqe } 
(tang2 - (b° /a*} *tang2) / (1+ bo /a’ * tan’g2 } 
- (a® - b*) (tanq2 ) / (a® + b*) (lan’g2 } 


H 


Now b? = a” (1 - e°) where e is the eccentricity of earth. 


Hence (tan (q2 -q1 } = (a®e* tang? )/ (a° + a° (1- e*) tan’? } 
=e * tang? / (sec*q2 - e* * tan*q2) 


HKRDANAMUREE Parner. an 313 


= (e° * sing2 * cosq?2) / (1 - e° * sin’q2) 
= e* * sing2 * cosq2 (1 + e° * sin’q2) 
=e? *sing2 *cosq? +e’ * sing? * cosq? 


Value of e is so small that e* and above can be omitted. So 
as a first approximation, ultimately we have (tang? -tanql ) = e° 
* sing2 * cosq?2 


The reduction q2 - q1_ is very small 

Tan(q2 - 1) = (q2-q1 } in radians. 
Reduction of latitude (q2 - ql) =e? 
— e* * sin2q2 /2 


Ellipticity is defined as ¢ = (a-b) /2 where a is the equtorial 
radius and b is the polar radius. 


Now reduction of latitude as derived above is = (e? / 2)* 
Sineq2 (where Q2 is the geographic latitude}. 


Ellipticity c = (a-b) /a 

substituting the above 

Reduction of latitude = (a-a61-e*)}/a 
= 1-{1-e*)'" 

= 1-(1-'%*e*) nearly 

C =e /2 nearly 

Reduction of latitude (q2 - q1 ) - sineg2 


Thus we find that the difference between geographical 
latitude and geocentric latitude is given by the formula © Sin2q2 
where © = (a-bV¥2 and q2 is the geographic latitude 


C = (a-bj/a 
since the values of a,b,and q2 


314 * ASTRO SECRETS » 


2 are all Known, the geocentric latitude of a place can be 
calculated easily. 


Calculations of Geocentric Latitude of Madras using the 
above formula ° 


a= 6378 kms b=-6357 q2 =13°o4' for Madras. 
a-b/a —6378-6357/6378 =21/6378 -0.0032925 
Geographic latitude of Madras 13° 04' 


Is q2 =13°04' 
2q2 =2*19°04' = 26°08' 
Reductions of latitude = 0.003295 * 0.440615 
Antilog of Sin Value = 0.0014502 
= 0°§' 
Reduction of latitude = 5 minutes 
Hence geocentric latitude 
of Madras = 13°-0°.5 
= 12° 59' 


In practical Astrology, the following formula is adopted for 
easy calculation of Geocentric latitude. 


Log TanA = Log Tan B + 9.9970710, where A and B are the 
Geocentric and Geographic latitudes of place respectively and 
the constant 9.9970710 has a bearing on the elipcity of earth 
Chambers mathematical Tables can be easily used to evaluate 
the value of Geocentric latitude. 


A Practical example of how the Geocentric latitude of a place 
can be calcualted is shown below. 


Geocentric latitude of Madras is 13 ° 94’ 
Log Tan A = Log Tan 13 -04' + 9.9970710 


7 KRISTNAMURTT PADMIXTATT « 315 


From Chamber's table Log Tan B = 9.3656641 
Log tan (13° 04°) 

Add constant = 9.9970710 
Log value = 93627351 
Anti log = 12°59’ 

Geocaetric Lat of Madras + 12°59" 


For those who are not conversant with trigonometry shri 
M.G.G Nnayar has furnished an easy method of calculating the 
geocentic latitude in the Article written by him on “Geocentric 
latitude of place" in the Astrology & Athrishta of December 4980 
with worked examples. KR Astrologers are therefore Adviced 
to draw up the horoscopic chart of their clients using the 
Geocentric latitude of the birth place 14 ensure much more 
accuracy and precision.
