24 Medical Astrology 

Yavanas and others have enunciated the wonderful 
secrets of man's life being commanded and controlled 
as per the wishes of the planets. 

Different planets are assigned significations to 
diagnose the problems of health in astrology. 

6. AYURVEDA AND AsTROLOGY 

Infact, before the advent of modern medical 
science, in ancient times the physicians were 
advocated compulsory knowledge of astrology and it's 
relevance to various diseases apart from 
administering the medicines on different lunar days 
and on different stellar days. 

In Ayurveda, the diseases are classified in 
Tridoshas (three humours) to help to diagnose the 
disease. The tridoshas for the planets are: 

Sun bilous 
Moon airy and phelgmatic 

\ 

Mars bilous 
t", Mercury airy, bilious and phelgmatic 

"), 
> Jupiter phelgmatic 

Venus airy 
Saturn airy 

7. PLANETS, DISEASES, RASHIS AND PARTS OF BODY 
(SAREERAM VYADHI MANDIRAM) 

Apart from the Tridoshas, the planets are 
assigned different diseases by themselves. The rashis 
and various stars are also assigned different diseases 
on various parts of the body. 



CHAPTER 1 

" Introduction, Definitions and 
Yogas 

1. PRARABDHA AND DISEASE 

Every human body is prone for diseases of various 
nature. The types of diseases depend upon one's 
Karma i.e. one's past deeds in the previous births. 
Hindus believe that the law of karma is responsible 
to attribute diseases, from time immemorial 
depending on whether the karmic effect is Sanchita 
or Prarabdha. 

The cumulative effects of good or bad deeds in 
the past births is felt in this birth in the form of good 
or bad health which is essential for a man's enjoying 
and suffering of life. Apart from health, all factors 
connected to the life will be revealed in a horoscope 
called also a Karmic chart or Vidhi chart. 

Unlike any other science oriented towards a 
particular field, astrology is a multidimensional 
science depicting the branches of knowledge from 
matrimonial, mundane, electional, horary, medical etc. 



20 Medical Astrology 

2. HUMAN BODY AND PLANETS 

Astrologically, the human body is called 
microcosmos (Pindanda) and possesses all the tatwas 
present in the macrocosmos known as Bramhand. 
The macrocosmos consisting of entire cosmos is 
encompassed with pancha bhootas namely Akasha, 
Vayu, Agni, Aapa and Prithvi {Ether, Air, Fire, Water 
and Earth respectively}. The different planets namely 
Jupiter, Saturn, Sun and Mars, Moon and Venus and 
Mercury are also assigned different tatwas out of the 
five as given above respectively. These planets further 
represent ear, skin, eyes, mouth and nose etc. 
respectively, the different part of the human body 
called the microcosmos, and the five organs further 
represent the subtle nature in the form of Tanmatras 
as Shabdha (noise), Sparsha (touch), Roopa (sight), 
Rasa (Taste) and Gandha (smell) respectievely. 

It is mentioned in Srimad bhagavatam Puranan, 
that the lord supreme from his maya created his body 
in three ways. In that one having (11 Indriyas) 
Ekadasha Indriyas and each of these indriyas is 
assigned with Abhimana devatas and hence the God's 
body became Adi Daivika sharira. Secondly, thejeeva 
is called adyatma and thirdly the pancha bhoota as 
'Adhi Bhoota'. The supreme lord created power within 
him to give indriya shakti (sensual strength, mental 
strength and physical strength) and Deva Shakti. 
Then ultimately, the universal prana called the Maha 
prana as Sutratma came to existence. Then all the 
indriyas (senses) started their operations or functions 
in perfect obedience like a faithful servant following 
the master. When once this Maha prana gets out, the 
functions of senses are stopped. It is on this basis the 



Medical Astrology 21 

supreme lord, the God is considered as the driving 
force or Chaitanya Shakti in all the living beings. 
Upanishad says: 

3tO~ft~tH'1"  ~ '1t)~I"'1 ~ mm
" ,,,. . ri P\~t1~~ uki): I 

~. 

which means that lord dwells in every human 
being, creatures etc. in the minutest form of atom of 
atoms and function as Mahaprana Swaroopa by 
attributing life force to all the animate objects. 

"3. DEVATAS AND PARTS OF BODY 

Now let us restrict ourselves to the Adhidaivika 
Sharira explained as under with the abhimani 
devatas for various organs. 

ORGANS DEVATAS 

Face ~.- Agni 
Nostrils Vayu 
Eyes Surya and Chandrama (Sun 

and Moon) 
Feet & Legs Vishnu 
Ears Dishanatha (Directional 

lords) 
Stomach N adi and Sagar (Samudra) 

(Rivers and Sea) 
Heart Chandrama (Moon) 
Hairs Sasya devtas and Vanaspathi 
Skin Vayu 
Excretary organs Mit.ra  
NavMl Mrtthyu 
Jaws and Tongue Varuna 
Generative organs - Prajapathi 



22 Medical Astrology 

ORGANS DEVATAS 
Buddhi Bramha 
Ahankar Rudra 

Thus, the senses of Gods Adhidaivika sharir.a 
gave refuge to Abhimani devtas. The same is 
applicable to micro-cosmos. Astrologically, Sun and 
Moon are the rulers of our eyes, Saturn and Mars are 
the directional lords and hence are rulers of our ears. 

The propitiation techniques to satisfy the 
abhimani devtas of various organs of the lord supreme 
will help overcome or reduce the problems of the 
particular organs. 

4. UNIVERSE (Kala Purusha) AND PARTS OF HUMAN 
BODY: 

Now coming back to the relationship ofthe micro­
cosmos with macro-cosmos, (Yath Pindey Tath 
Brahmandey). 

i) Swarga loka (Heaven) is ruled by head (from 
neck) and above. 

ii) Mrityu Loka (Earth) is ruled by Nabhi and upto 
neck. 

iii) Patala Loka (Below the earth) is ruled by 
N abhi to feet 

iv) Dakshina Meru (The imaginary mountain of 
the heavens) is ruled by left shoulder. 

v) Uttara Meru (The imaginary mountain of the 
heavens) is ruled by Bramha Randra. 

vi) Stars are ruled by hairs in the body. 
vii) Mountains are ruled by skeletons and bones. 



Medical Astrology 23 

viii) Saptha Sagaras are ruled by saptha Dhatus, 
Meda (fat), Majja (marrow) 

ix) Rivers are ruled by veins. 
x) Saptha Maruths are ruled by sapthanadis like 

ila, pingala, sushumna etc. 
xi) Navagrahas are ruled by Navadwaras which 

mean the nine openings of the body like the 
two eyes, the two nostrils, two ears, mouth and 
two excretory organs. 

5. PLANETS AND PARTS OF BODY 

Let us analyse how the planets are linked to the 
micro-cosmos. 

1. Sun and Moon rule 2 eyes. 
2. Mercury and Venus rule nostrils. 
3. Saturn and Mars rule ears. 
4. Jupiter rules speech. 
6. Rahu and Ketu rules excretory organs. 

Thus, we find that the body is enshrined with the 
control of so many subtle forces. The study of 
astrology lies in the analysis of these in relation to 
the planets. 

In order to find out the disparities in the body by 
the imbalance caused by the influence of planets we 
have to know the significations (karakatwa) of the 
planets and the results of their action and inter­
action. 

Our ancient sages like Vyasa, Vashishta, 
Parashara, Kashyapa, N arada, Garga, Marichi, 
Angirasa, Chyavan, Jaimini, Gautama, Romasha, 



Yavanas and othen hav~ enunciated the wonderful 
secret~ of man's lif~ b~inli commanded and controlled

Different planets -are assigned significations to 
diagnose the problems of health in astrology.

10. DIAGONISING THE DISEASE IN ASTROLOGY INVOLVES 

THE STUDY OF: 

(i) zodiacal chart with the planets therein 



Medical Astrology 31 

(ii) aspects on them 
(iii) planets occupation in different stars 
(iv) study of Rashi 
(v) the tatwas of Rashis 

(vi) the tatwik nature of planets as : 
(a) Vayu tatwa depiciting sense of touch, skin, 

hands and body movements represented by 
Saturn. 

(b) The prithvi tatwa and lord is Mercury and 
depicits smelling power muscles and 
naramandala (nerves). 

(c) the akasha tatwa planet Jupiter depicits 
noise, ear, lightning. 

(d) Jala tatwa planet Venus depicts all types 
of juices produced in the body, blood, urine, 
mucus etc. 

11. MODERN TECHNOLOGY: 

With all it's modern technology and it's command 
of medical science many times the doctors find it 
difficult to diagnose. 

Whereas astrologically, merely by casting a 
horoscope (even without a stethoscope), with deep 
analysis not only the disease existing can be identified 
but also the disease likely to be arising in future can 
also be known. 

lAstrology goes many steps further than medical 
1. From the birth chart of a child it can be predicted that the 
native has a tendency leading to certain disease. The possibility of 
time of onset of the disease can also be predicted many years before. 
This helps the native to take precautions. 



32 Medical Astrology 

science as the disease likely to arise can be observed 
from the Dashas well in advance unlike the medical 
science detecting the disease after affecting the person. 

The greatest wonder of astrology is that the 
position of planets in the horoscope of a native th:row 
light on the health of the native and the horoscope 
also reveals with fairly good accuracy the types of 
disease likely to arise to the family members like 
husband, brothers, mother, father etc. at a given time 
which is impossible even to the slightest extent in 
medical science. This is in reality, the enigma 
astrology commands2• 

12. ROLES OF 6th, 8th AND 12th HOUSES 

Astrologically, to know whether a native in his 
life will be sick or not the 6th ,8th and 12th houses 
of a chart should be analysed to get a glimpse of the 
conditions of ones health.3 

13. AsSOCIATION OF PLANETS 

In addition, there are many factors mentioned as 
different yogas (by association of planets in differnet 
combinations) which cause various imbalances in 
health of a person ranging from minor problems to 

2. From the horoscope, the predictions can be made about the parents, 
children and wife etc. If there is affliction to the ninth and tenth 
house, karka Sun, it appears that the native may loose his father. 
The cause of death of father can easily be predicted in such cases. 
3. For affliction to health, an indication is derived from the position 
of 6th, 8th and 12th houses and their lords. But the primary factors 
are: (a) lagna (b) lagna lord (c) Moon (d) Sun. If there is affliction of 
these or if the lord of lagna and the Moon are weak and posited in 
bad houses, there is possibility of facing health problems.

chronic ailments. 
Before venturing into the identification of 

diseases let us analyse first, some of the planetary 
combinations for healthy and long life. 

14. COMBINATION FOR GOOD LONGEVITY 

(i) ~ err ~ err ~ err ~ ~

If there are no malefic planets in kendra and 
Trikona and iflord oflagna is in the 4th and Jupiter

and live for 100 years without disease.

(ii) If the eight Rashis or Randreshaamsha 
happens to be these Rashis, death will take 
place due to these ailments: 

An astrologer should study the chart keeping the 
factors mentioned and study with great care and 
patience the chart. He should not come to conclusion 
merely if the said combinations are fulfilled. He 
should study whether there are astrological counter 
factors towards these problems. The most important 
of the counter factors are, firstly the aspect of strong 
well placed Jupiter, Venus, Mercury and Shukla 



60 Medical Astrology 

paksha Moon in the respective order. Then the Roga 
(diseases) causing combinations should be studied, in 
particular reference to Drekkana and D6 divisional 
charts, Ashtaka varga and other charts. After 
carefully studying from different angles and applyipg 
sound astrological knowledge, the astrologer should 
pronounce the results. 

Sometimes all facts may prove fatal and the 
astrologer can say, he may die. But even then there 
may be some intricate points to protect the native 
form the jaws of death by succumbing to the disease. 
There are certain formulae enunciated which states 
that "Having given up hopes" the native overcomes 
the acute seriousness and comes back to life. One 
verse is explained here. 

~ ~ ~ lFG 'ft'1f.:qd'l I

If the eighth lord occupy kendra along with 
Saturn, even if the native is almost declared dead he 
will come back alive to live for long with wealth, 
though born poor. 

The principles enunciated are common for man 
and woman, young or old. But in case of children upto 
8 years we have to study Balarishta yoga and in case 
of Woman a seperate chapter in astrology by name 
female horoscopy is being studied. 

In a way Balarishta yoga is the study of pediatrics 
indirectly and this yoga stipulates that certain 
planetary combinations are responsible for the child's 
health and longevity during the first eight years after 
birth.

Mercury in 4th house, Jupiter in 3rd house, Sun in 
5th house, Saturn in lagna will cause problem to the

that all care should be taken during this period. 

Like this there are many planetary combinations

If the 5th lord occupies kendra and trikona 
sthanas it is auspicious for birth of children. If the 
fifth lord occupies 6-8-12, sons will not be born. If the 
5th lord is conjoined with malefics or combust, sons 
are not born. If born the sons will die. 

2. CHILDLESSNESS (some more principles and 
remedies) 

This is a major issue in the Hindu perspective 
and the marriage in Hindus has acquired sanctity 
because of the belief that the male issues are a must 
for the perpetual growth of the Vansha i.e. the clan. 

The eldest son is called the "Karma Putra" and it 



64 Medical Astrology 

is he who has the right to lit the pyre after death of 
his parents and it is also his responsibility till his 
death to perform the obsequies for his parents after 
their death. 

The Hindus believe in shastras. In Bhagvat Gita 
lord Krishna says "(,H41ITUI:;i 1'P"lI oi21 ~scm<f~" 
which means that shastras should be considered as 
praman, the reference and perform the Do's (karya) 
and Dont's (Akarya) as per the dictum enunciated in 
shastras. 

Therefore, Hindus in particular, have more 
inclination for male children though it is not ruled 
out in other religions. 

The shastra says that a man without a son does 
not get emanicipation (Moksha) by the saying 
"31g?H"tI Jifd ~, 

But, unfortunately, some parents do not be-get 
male issues at all in their life time, but there may be 
female issues. In some cases there may be absolutely 
no issues whether male or female. 

Many times, the couples may be puzzled for not 
becoming parents inspite of they being perfectly fit 
medically. Then what is the problem? 

Astrologically, there are number of factors for 
this happening. Sage Parashara has given as to why 
such childlessness take place. 

Particularly to those who suffer without a male 
issue, Parashara has stated a number ofputrakshaya 
yogas taking place due to curses of sarpa, brothers, 
maternal uncle, mother, brahmins, wife, lady and 



Medical Astrology 65 

atripta atmas i.e. unfulfilled & dissatisfied souls etc. 

Number of planetary combinations. have been 
enunciated to identify these curses. In short, 
Parashara has opined that one has to study the 
affliction of fifth lord, the putrakaraka Jupiter and 
the karaka under .whose heading the analysis for the 
curse (shapa) is made. 

For example one has to study Moon's affliction 
with her positioning or aspect along with Putra 
karaka Jupiter and the fifth lord. Moon being the 
significator of mother will throw light as to whether 
the native has any Matrushapa. Similiarly, Mars is 
to be analysed for Bhratrushapa, Mercury to be 
analysed to find out Matula shapa, i.e. curse from 
maternal uncle; Sun to be analysed with Ketu for 
Pitrushapa. Affliction of Jupiter to be analysed for 
Brahmana shapa. Affliction of Venus to be analysed 
for Sthree shapa and Patni shapa. Affiiction of Saturn 
and Rahu to be analysed for Preta shapa. During 
analysis of the curse the affliction of fifth lord and 
Jupiter is to be studied in common for all the 
mentioned curses.

To overcome the curse of brothers the native 
should listen to the purana related to Vishnu. He 
has to perform chandrayama vrata and take bath 
in the holy kaveri river or near the sacred Vishnu 
kshetra and plant an "Ash watha" sapling and 
perform the yagno pavith and marriage to it. 
(There is a vedic procedure to do it). There after 
give ten cows as Godana. Then perform prajapatya 
vrata and after completing it donate land 
containing fruit trees. Thus one can overcome the 
Bhratrushapa (the curse of brother) by doing the 
above shanti karma, the propituation procedure. 

Special Note: The curse from brothers on a native 
occurs very swiftly. If some one tries to cheat 
brother by not giving their due share of money or 
wealth or cheat the brother, those brother getting 
cheated will curse the cheater brother out of 
disgust and agony and this finally turn out as 
Bhratrushapa. This particular propituation is also 
helpful to make such cheating brothers to come to 
the righteous path.

24. DEFINITION ANn SUMMARY OF CURSES 

Curses are nothing but the painful outbursts of a 



90 Medical Astrology 

good and principled soul after being hurt by sarcastic 
• and derogatory remarks by a person on another and 

these lead to the utterances of the hurt becoming true 
to effect considerable misery on the persons becoming 
victim of it. 

Anybody may curse. Particularly the curse of 
mother, father, brothers, matula (maternal uncle), 
brahmins, ladies, wife are very serious and our 
astrological seers have given specific planetary 
combinations for the above curses and have also 
advocated remedial measures and these are 
mentioned in Jataka Parijata and Brihat Jataka. 

The Curses are named in the following manner: 

1. Mathru shapatsu puthra kshaya yoga. 

2. Pitru shapatsu puthra kshaya yoga. 

3. Bhratru shapatsu puthra kshaya yoga. 

4. Matula shapatsu puthra kshaya yoga. 

5. Stree shapatsu puthra kshaya yoga. 

6. Pathni shapatsu puthra kshaya yoga. 

7. Brahma shapatsu puthra kshaya yoga. 

8. Preta shapatsu puthra kshaya yoga.

There are certain planetary conjunctions which 
mar those leading to royal fortunes. There are 
others named ~qJJ (Reka) which produce poverty. 
Some again which are called RfilT (Preshya) i.e. 
those leading to dependence and servitude. And 
lastly, there are those called ct~1f (Kemadruma). 
These four classes of yogas abound in fortunes 
marred just as they were going to rise.

CHAPTER 3 

Moksha and Son 

ANALYSIS OF BEGETIING MALE CHILDREN ON THE PRINCIPLE 

"AI'UTHRASYARGATHIM NASTHI" (31!!?I'flI4fRi~) . 

The dictum "311];~ffi" of analysis from the 
astrological angle can be done in the following 
manner. 

"31g?l{,lPlm" contains 311];?1' and l"fffi as two words. 
Putrakaraka is Jupiter. To become 3lg?l~(1 i.e. sonless 
parents their Jupiter should be afflicted as Jupiter 
is putrakaraka. The second lord "7fffr" means Moksha 
or emanicipation. The houses of moksha are the 
moksha trikona sthanas, 4-8-12. 

When the puthrakaraka Jupiter fails to aspect 
4-8-12 or gets conjoined with 4-8-12 lords either from 
Janma lagna or Chandra lagn,a, then such parents 
are most likely to not to have male issues. 

It can also be observed that when Jupiter is 
transiting 4-8-12 houses from Janma lagna or 
Chandra lagna male issues are born. As per the

dictum "Aputhrasyargathim Nasthi" i.e. involvement 
of Jupiter and the emanicipation houses 4-8-12 for 
begetting male issues are together analysed. For

How To ADOPT THE PRINCIPLE OF MOKSHASTHANA 

The native of.the Chart I above gave brith to a 
male child in her very first pregnency itself. But, 
unfortunately the child died as there are indications 
in the horoscope also that the first issue may die 
because the fifth lord has occupied the eighth. 
Subsequently she gave birth to two female children. 

The couple however wanted a male child. But 
fearing the possibility of female child the couple was 
hesitant to have a trial for another child and had less 
hopes of birth of a male child to them. 

On a simple analysis Jupiter is in exaltation and 
has occupied the house of moksha or emanicipation 
from lagna i.e. the 4th house as a purushartha 
moksha house. Adopt the principle of Dharma, Artha, 
Kama moksha for Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer. 

By the advise of an expert astrologer who 



94 Medical Astrology 

confirmed male issue on the above grounds in the 
principle "31g?l\("i,PIR'l~" the native tried successfully 
to beget a male issue and got a son particularly during 
the period when Jupiter was transiting in Cancer, 
the 4th from lagna, the house of moksha Dr 
emanicipation. 

One ofthe major causative factors for childlessness 
is the affliction of Moon and Venus with impotent 
planets Saturn, Mercury and the obstacle causing 
planet Ketu along with its character of impotency. 

When both Moon and Venus are afflicted by these 
planets concerned, the native will suffer from 
shortage of sperms leading to childlessness. 

However, if there are indicative positive factors 
in the horoscope for improvement of the conditions 
by favourable Dashas and God's blessing, by doing 
suitable propituation issues are possible.

afflicted with planets of impotency. 

The native was unable to become a father for 
nearly six to seven years. Thus astrological analysis 
throw light of his impotency. 

Subsequently on verification for test of sperm 
counts it was confirmed that the native had far too 
short of sperm co~nts for successful issues. 

After adopting propituation techniques, the 
native's physiological conditions improved and a

female child was born in Saturn dasha and Saturn

children's birth as mentioned above due to conjunction 
of Saturn and Mercury with both Moon and Venus. 

The propituation techniques followed was 
performing of "Santana Gopala Krishna Homa" on 
Sravana star falling on Dwadashi tithi only followed 
by regular recitation of "payasa paravrithi" (i.e.

CHAPTER 5 

Female Horoscopy 

1. A girl after attaining puberty is fit for sexual 
union and to bear child. The Hindu Astrology has 
considered that it is necessary to cast a chart of the 
girl at the first point of observation of puberty. This 
chart will give the future of the girl. It is said that 
this time of attaining puberty even decides 
barrenness and other gynacological problems arising 
in the future of the girl's life. 

There is a seperate chapter in astrology regarding 
the effect of puberty being attained at a particular 
moment, place, clothes, colour of clothes, old, new and 
torn clothes being worn at that time, number of drops 
of blood discharge etc. which determine the future of 
the girl in regard to her happinesss, children etc. 

In female horoscopy, we have to study special 
feminine diseases like irregular menstural cycles, 
excessive discharge, problems in pregnancy etc. 

The menstural cycle is ruled by Moon and Mars 
and afflictions to these planets result in irregualar 
menstural cycles and other connected problems. 



100 Medical Astrology 
l' 

The present days call for giving valuable 
informations to the pregnant ladies in regard to child 
birth by natural delivery or by cessarian operations. 
Astrologically one can with a fair accuracy tell 
whether the native is prone for operation or not and 
indications of aspects of Mars on 5th house or 5th 
lord or 5th lord conjoined with Mars lead to almost 
certainity of cessarian operation except when benefic 
planets aspect to ward off these tendencies. 

There are inumerable cases of cessarian 
operations being performed in urgency and not 
waiting for natural process of delivery. Astrology can 
definitely guide the pregnant women in this matter. 

After birth of the child in some cases there may 
not be proper secretion of milk in the mother's breast. 
Astrologically, it may be due to the infants ill luck to 
not have mother's milk. There are many combinations 
indicating the ill luck of the child to not to consume 
mother's milk. In J aimini astrology it is said that if 
atmakarka happens to be posited in Virschika 
Navamsha the child is deprived of mother's milk. 
Reasons may be whatever.  

. Which states that if atmakaraka is in Vrischika 
navamsha, the infant so born will have sarpa ganda, 
in addition to being deprived of mother's milk. 

Astrology reveals the Garbha doshas (problems 
in the womb) and certain combinations in the 5th 
house and aspects indicate abortions. Some of which 
are Saturn and Mars combinations in the 5th house, 
5th lord occupying 6-8-12, fifth house conjoined with 



Medical Astrology 101 

Mars and Rahu, 5th house and it's lord aspected by 
malefics and a host of other combinations can be 
explained for causing trouble for the foetus and birth 
of the child. 

2. MONTHS OF PREGNANCY RULED By PLANETS 

Now let us analyse, how the feotus grows in the 
womb. Our sages have wonderfully assigned various 
months of pregnancy period to different planets as 
per this stanza.

8th Month Adhana lagna - The growth of body

9th Month Moon - Occurence of q,elivery pain. 
10th Month Sun - Delivery. 



102 ." Medical Astrology 

The above stanza states Kalala, Ghana, Ankura, 
Asthi, Charma, Angaja, Chetanantha are represented 
by Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Sun, Moon, Saturn and 
Mercury. 

Kalala in sanskrit means the combined fluid of 
male and female after sexual union. Here the male 
sperm is called Shukra or Shukla (white) and that of 
female is shonitha (blood coloured fluid). As soon as 
they are mixed it becomes shukla shonitha and 
conception begins and this period is ruled by Venus 
and will be fleshy. 

In the second month, it attains "Ghana" i.e. 
solidification and will be in the form of a kidney bean 
and this period is ruled by Mars. The third month 
causes "Ankura" which means sprouting when all the 
different organs of the body will sprout and begin to 
show themselves and this period is ruled by Jupiter. 
In the 4th month "Asthi" or bones are formed. This 
month is ruled by Sun. In the 5th month "Charma" 
or skin begins to form on the body and this period is 
ruled by Moon. The 6th month "Angaja" hairs and 
other organs are formed and Saturn rules this month. 
The seventh month "Chethanatha" conciousness 
begins to develop and this period is governed by 
Mercury. In the 8th month, the food consumed by the 
mother is taken by the foetus through the umbilical 
cord and this period is governed by the lord of 
conception time. In the 9th month "U dvega", the 
anxiety to get out of the mother's womb arises and 
this period is ruled by Moon. During the 10th month 
"Prasava" or delivery takes place and this month is 
governed by Sun. 

.'(16'1 i.l 



Medical Astrology 103 

There is a slight difference between Varaha 
Mihira and Yavaneshwara who says that the first 
month is ruled by Mars and second by Venus. 
Yavaneshwara gives greater details of foetal 
development. He says in the 4th month bones, blood 
vessels and nerves are formed. In the 5th month 
,marrow and skin are developed. In the 6th month 
blood, hair, nails are formed and the child will be born 
in complete shape. 

This knowledge of the growth of foetus in a 
woman is important for an astrologer to know. 
Depending on the lords of the month well placed or 
ill placed in woman's horoscope there will be tensions 
and anxities during the respective month of 
pregnancies. If the lord of the month is powerful in 
her horoscope, the pregnant and the foetus will be 
healthy and if the lord of the month is weak the 
pregnant and the foetus will suffer and there may be 
abortion also during such periods of month of weak 
lordships. 

It is a wonder that the modern science is unable 
to clearly attribute reasons for deformity of the child 
at birth whereas astrology has given certain specific 
combination of planets for specific deformity of the 
child at the time of birth. 

To quote a few example it is said that if Mercury 
is in 5th and 9th and other planets are weak, the face, 
the hands and the legs of the foetus will be twice the 
normal. 

If Moon is in Taurus and if other planets are in 
the last part of the Navamsha of the watery signs 
Scorpio and if all the malefic planets are posited there 



104 Medical Astrology 

a dumb will be born. Benefic aspect of planets, 
however reduce the effect and it can be said that the 
child will talk after some time. 

It is also said that when Moon occupies Cancer 
and also when the birth also happens to be Cancer 
ascendant and gets the aspect of Saturn and Mars a 
female child with bent back will be born. 

If the ascendant happens to be last part of 
Capricon and if Saturn, Moon and Sun aspect the 
ascendant a dwarf will be born. If Sun, Saturn and 
Mars occupy the first drekkana a shoulderless child 
will be born, if Saturn, Sun and Mars occupy middle 
drekkana child without feet is born. 

Thus it is still an enigma to the modern medical 
science to prove the congenetal defects of the still born 
child where as there are certain evidence through 
astrology to provide why such defective births have 
taken place. 

It is an astrological fact that deformities can take 
place as already mentioned due to the planetary 
weakness of the mother. Conciding with the transit 
position of weak planets without aspect or influences 
of benefics on them during the period of pregnancy 
not only deformation occurs, the foetus may also get 
destroyed. 

To illustrate as to when a lady will be in problem 
in pregnancy period, the chart on next page is taken 
as an example. 

In the said chart the lady concerned had a 
problem in the fourth month of pregnancy. The fourth 
month of pregnancy is ruled by Sun. When in transit, 



Medical Astrology 105 

Moon 
Lagna Ketu 

Mars Jupite

Rahu Sun Saturn 
Mercury Venus 

Sun was passing on 25th November 1988, in it's 
debiliated sign in Libra and at same time, the native 
was under the fourth month of pregnancy of which 
Sun is the ruler. 

As the native's fifth lord Sun was already in the 
8th house at birth and as the transit Sun was also 
debilitated in Tula during her fourth month of her 
pregnancy, the foetus could not grow and she was 
operated to remove the foetus. 

This is how the planets influence the troubles 
during various months of pregnancies, depending on 
the strength of the planets concerned. 

It is said in puranas that sexual union should not 
be taken place during the Sandhya Kalas i.e. during 
sunrise and sunset and the child born during such 
period will not be virtuous. In fact, in 
Srimadbhagavatam it is said that demons were born 
to the Sages as their wives forced them to have union 
in prohibited periods. 

3. SAFE PREGNANCY AND HEALTHY CHILD 

In order to have a healthy child and safe 



106 Medical Astrology 

pregnancy, our ancients followed an auspicious day 
and time for the neptual function i.e. for the first 
sexual union. Special time was fixed in the night only 
by the astrologer, after careful analysis of planetary 
combinations the sexual union taken place during 
that auspicious period is said to give healthy child 
and also a healthy pregnancy period for the mother. 

The conception time in a woman is known as 
Adhana lagna and this rules the 8th month of 
pregnancy. It is the belief of Hindus that the 8th 
month of pregnancy is a critical one as it rules the 
adhanalagna, conception time which if good will give 
good results and ifbad the bad results can take place. 
After passing the 8th month there is a sigh of relief. 
Of late it is said even the doctors are puzzled over 
this issue during 8th month. 

In fact, astrology also stipulates that during 
intercourse leading to conceptuous union satwik 
methods are to be followed and the children born will 
have Satwik (good) characters i.e. with good 
behaviour and nature. Otherwise, if Rajasik and 
Tamasik methods are followed, children of Rajasik 
and Tamasik character will be born. Children born 
in Rajasik character will have too much desire, greed 
aspiration, wants and over ambitious while Tamasik 
character will make the children exceedingly lazy, 
angry, dull, idiotic, attacking, getting addicted to 
drinks, drugs etc. Therefore, conceptuous union 
should take place in a peaceful atmosphere and 
husband and wife should have faith in God and follow 
satwik means. 

In fact, the modern science and psychologists also 



Medical Astrology 107 

guide the likely mother to follow certain disciplines 
to bear healthy children. 

Vishnu puranam says that certain days (Tithis) 
such as Ashtami, Dwadashi, Amavasya and Poornima 
are prohibited for sexual union. In fact astrologically 
the full Moon day is avoided for a sexual union for 
conception. 

The Garbhopanishad in Vedas has mentioned of 
the birth of thejeevatma. The jeevatma after death 
enjoys the heaven or hell as per past deeds of Karma. 
Mter enjoying / suffering the atman is entitled to re­
birth, unless the atman joins the paramathaman 
causing salvation, the Moksha, the cycle of birth and 
death follows as per the following dictum. 

~\WR~+RUi~~~mRl! I 

It is said that the atman in it's minutest form 
comes down the earth through rains and occupy the 
cereals and grains used for food consumption. 

The food taken by the male containing this 
minutest atman will find it's place in the semen of 
the male and during inter-course joins the Garbha 
(womb) and then on the conception takes place for 
the development of the foetus into a child. 

This may be the probable reason that our 
predecessors had practised a system of serving the 
food first to the male member of the family and female 
subsequently. The belief being that the atman 
containing grain, if enters a female will go waste in 
the excreta without any use what-so-ever. 

It is also said in Vedas that the atma suffer on 
this account very much. Also it is further mentioned 



108 Medical Astrology 

that the conception should not take place during 
menstural cycle. It is said that this type of conception 
particularly during the fourth day of mensus is said 
to be unworthy according to seers of astrology. 

In fact, the intercourse is prohibited during the 
five days of mensus period in the month. 

Our Vedic scripts have mentioned a number of 
Do's and Dont's during this period of mensus which 
the present day ladies oppose and call it idiotic. 

In the real sense, it is not so. We, the Indians 
have never practised research on our traditional 
sayings. In fact, if we do, a lot more knowledge on 
human welfare can be thrown to the ignorant people. 

In this context, I would like to narrate a research 
experiment carried out on the blood samples of lady 
during her monthly mensus period by a doctor namely 
Dr. Johnson in America. 

Dr. Johnson had asked her maid to regularly 
pluck fresh flowers and place them in a vaaz on a 
table for decorative purpose. 

Sometimes, continously for three consecutive 
days, the flower placed in the vaaz used to fade away 
in no time after placing in the vaaz. 

Dr. Johnson questioned the lady who was placing 
it and asked why the flower faded immediately after 
placing in the vaaz and asked her anything wrong in 
her body for which she answered that she was in her 
monthly mensus. 

Dr. Johnson immediately wanted to conduct 
research on this happening and subjected the blood 
sample, of the lady to chemical examination during 



Medical Astrology 109 

the mensus period. 

After analysis, it was said that, there was a poison • 
namely 'Monotoxin' in the blood which affects the 
heart and lungs. 

Probably due to this, for health reasons, Hindus 
have laid a stricture on ladies to sit seperately during 
mensus which was subsequently on research proved 
by Dr. Johnson that any person having body contacts 
during the monthly mensus period gets affected on 
his heart and lungs. 

Therefore, our knowledgeable Astrologers 
followed specific rules for the auspicious muhurtas 
of Neptuals only to see that the progeny will be 
healthy and further it was extended to healthy days 
of sexual union except during mensus periods. 

Subsequently to conception, during pregnancy, 
the pregnent women are asked to put photo of a 
healthy child or a photo of Balakrishna in her room 
only to induce psychological mind to give birth to a 
child as beautiful as the one in the photo adorned in 
her room. 

The calculation of the conception time is not here 
in this subject of medical astrology and there are 
many methods to calculate. 

Another point of special significance in female 
horoscopy is the fevers caused during post pregnancy 
which is called as "Sannipatha". 

This fever may lead the post pregnant women, 
whose body will be delicate after giving birth to child, 
to a sort of mental retardation. 

The transit position of malefic planets and it's 



110 Medical Astrology 

impact on Moon by way of aspect on natal Moon plays 
'an important role. 

We also find many times the ladies suffer with 
profused discharge of blood during the period of 
menupas (permanent stopage of menstrual cycle). 
Mars and Moon play havoc with Saturn during this 
period. 

There are many cases of removing uterus. 
However, astrologically all these ailments or events 
in women's body is possible only if Mars, Moon and 
the eighth lord is amicted along with the eighth house 
occupied by malefics and the lord of the 8th occupy 
krura navamsha. 

4. MEDICAL ASPECT IN FEMALE HOROSCOPY 

Thrust in the female horoscopy lies in the 
motherhood. A childless woman is condemned in the 
society as a barren woman. 

The woman's womb is the fertilising centre and 
is called kshetra while the sperm in the semen of the 
male is called Beeja. It is the beeja which gets 
fertilised in the kshetra and the child is developed.

Mars being posited in swa-navamsha with Jupiter 
restricted the deha kashta yoga. Sun being the karaka 
for health has occupied 8th house in Rashi and occupy 
shashtamsha (Rogamsha) with Saturn as reckoned 
from rashi lagna. Hence, the native's ill health can 
be confirmed. But when? at what point of time and 
what type of disease?4 

The native when running the 7th lord dasha, the 
Venus dasha which can be maraka dasha, created 
problem for the health. 

ANALYSIS OF 1ST BHAVA 

On analysis of the 1st house, the lord, the lord of 
4(a) Lagna has Jupiter and aspect of Venus, both benefic planets. 

benefics in kendra are best safe gaurd. Aspect of saturn on lagna 
is bad. Being lord of 11th and also Saturn is karaka for 
chronocity, if there is disease it would be of this nature. 

(b) The Moon is debilitated and weak (of Amavasya) 
(c) The lord of lagna Mars is afflicted. 
(d) In Navasmha lagna, lagna lord, the Moon and the Sun are all 

afflicted 



Medical Astrology 113 

the 1st is in Bhagya and in swa-navamsha with 
Jupiter indicating no problem for the head region, 
but he is shadowed in the mental zone by Rahu in 
some manner causing disappointments by getting 
cheated in various walks of life. The lord of the 1st 
house Mars being in Dhanus and Jupiter posited in 
lagna bhava itself indicate exchange of houses and 
gives tolerable results for the head and brain portion 
of the native and tolerable mental health. 

ANALYSIS OF 2ND BHAVA 

The facial zone is the 2nd house. The 2nd lord is 
in 7th in his own house and gets the aspect of Jupiter 
indicating a problem free facial zone. The position of 
weak Moon and Sun in 8th house creates poor eyesight. 

ANALYSIS OF 3RD BHAVA 

The 3rd bhava is occupied by Ketu a malefic and 
also 3rd lord Mercury has occupied 8th house. 
Mercury's occupation in 8th house is not bad but 
Budha by the association with debilitated Moon and 
Sun becomes bad. Therefore, the native had problem 
of throat for some days during Shukra dasha Budha­
Bhukthi. From Dashanatha Shukra, also the 3rd 
house is occupied by Kuja. Rahu at the time of the 
dasha period and hence the suffering of throat portion 
of the body was evident for some days.5 

As the adhishtitha Rashinatha of Mercury i.e. the 
dispositor of Mercury, the Mars having gone to 

5. On page 14, the principle given states that the association of third 
lord with Mercury and Rahu gives throat trouble. In this case Mercury 
is the third lord and Ketu is posited in third. The aspect of Mars on 
third plays very important role. 



114 Medical Astrology 

susthana (auspicious) house, initially didnot spoil the 
throat but troubled because of his association with 
Rahu. Thus the health of the 3rd Bhava of the native 
is concluded. 

ANALYSIS OF 4TH BHAVA 

The fourth house is occupied by Saturn who is 
the badhakadhipathi for Mesha lagna. Apart from 
this, the 4th lord, has gone to the 8th house and 
further debilitated. The Sun also ruling heart has 
joined the Moon in dusthana, the 8th house. Added 
to all these Mars aspects the 4th house. 

The fourth lord Moon is posited in Vrishchika and 
the dispositor of Moon i.e. Mars though posited in 
Bhagya is afflicted with Rahu. Summing up, the 4th 
house has got tremendous affliction and this resulted 
in the native suffering heart attack during Venus 
dasha and Moon-bhukti and susequently suffered the 
heart disease for a very long time. 

This long suffering may be attributed to the fact 
that the very badhakadhipathi Saturn and also a 
planet of chronic nature is posited in the house of 
heart and at the same time the fourth lords 
debilitation aggravated the disease in accompany 
with the 6th lord Mercury and the Sun. 

ANALYSIS OF THE 5TH BHAVA 

The native had periodically intestinal problems 
because of occupation of the 5th lord in 8th but as 
Jupiter aspected 5th bhava the problems were 
negligeble. 



Medical Astrology 115 

ANALYSIS OF 6TH BHAVA 

Stomach problems due to 6th lord going to 8th. 
The problem is not serious. 

ANALYSIS OF 7TH BHAVA 

No problems because 7th lord Venus in his own 
house getting the aspect of Jupiter. 

ANALYSIS OF 8TH BHAVA 

The native suffered from piles because the 6th 
lord, representing disease is posited in the 8th house 
of private parts and rectum. In addition to this, the 
8th lord Mars is conjoined with Rahu who rules 
excretory organs involving piles problems. The native 
had to suffer piles problems and the aspect of Jupiter 
made him to tolerate piles. 

ANALYSIS OF 9TH BHAVA 

No problems on thighs region were seen as 
Jupiter aspects his own house. 

ANALYSIS OF 10TH BHAVA 

No problem was found in 10th house i.e. the 
thighs as Saturn aspects his own house. 

ANALYSIS OF 11TH BHAVA 

Had an accident due to aspect of Mars and Saturn 
and suffered leg injury. 

ANALYSIS OF 12TH BHAVA 

There is absolutely no problem in the 12th house, 
the house of feet and it's lord Jupiter is posited in 



116 Medical Astrology 

ascendant . 
. But at the same time, the 12th house being the 

house of hospitalisation and 12th lord being in lagna 
and getting the aspect of 2nd lord and 7th lord confirmed 
hospitalisation and the native was hospitalised many 
times in Venus dasha, as Venus is aspecting 
hospitalisation lord of the 12th, the Jupiter.7 

DISEASES ENCOMPASSING THE WHOLE BODY 

There are some diseases which will affect all the 
portions of the body. They are diabities, blood cancer 
etc. In the said horoscope, the native also suffered 
from diabities as the janma lagna is occupied by a 
sweet planet Jupiter and aspected by another sweet 
planet Venus. These two factors along with JupIter 
in lagna attaining Vargottama caused Diabities. 

The native suffered diabities in Sun's dasha. 
Diabities in Sun's dasha was caused due to the fact 
that the sweet planet Jupiter is posited in lagna which 
is the house of disease from Sun. 

Thus the chart V is explained for acquisition of 
various diseases due to various factors of planetary 
configurations as explained. 

7. Accident is caused due to affliction to lagna, weak Moon, Ketu 
aspected by Mars in 8th from the Moon and the lord of 11th (leg) 
aspected by Mars .. There must be some hurt on hip and shoulder also.

Ascendant lord Jupiter with Rahu may cause 
some problems in the region of the head. This is 
further substantiated by the debilitation of the 
signifactor of mind the Moon that further gets affected 
by the aspect of Saturn on Moon. 

The native has felt a sudden mental aberration 
in Venus Dasha Moon's Sub period i.e. during the 
dasha of the sixth lord Venus and in the sub period 
of debilitated Moon the signifactor of mind.

In addition to the above problem, she has also 
suffered disease of the liver due to the planet ofliver 
Jupiter getting amicted with Rahu causing some sort 
~f shadow on the functioning of the liver. This trouble 
started in her Venus dasha, the dasha of the lord of 
house of disease, the sixth. 

2. BLOOD CANCER 

In the fag end of the native's Mars's dasha and 
at the point of Kuja Rahu Sandhi and in this dasha 
of the "Swadeha Maraka", (i.e the lagna lord himself 



Medical Astrology 119 

becoming the Mruthyu Stanadhipathi which is 
possible for only Mars and Venus becoming the lagna 
lord and the eighth lord for Aeris and Libra 
Ascendants), the native was struck with the disease 
of blood cancer.

In the chart, the eighth lord Mars has occupied 
his exalted house along with the twelfth lord Jupiter 
indicating hospitalization due to a diseasewhich is of 
expansive nature caused by Jupiter, the planet of 
expansion which makes the native suffer a disease, 
that encompasses the whole body like the blood 
cancer. 



120 Medical Astrology 

In addition, the eighth house is also occupied by 
. Rahu and it's dispositor being the planet of 

significator of blood, Mars, there is an indication that 
the native may suffer from blood connected diseases 
of a nature conducive to Rahu, a shadow planet wh? 
causes disturbance to the blood. 

Incidentally, the timing of the disease is at, Kuja 
Rahu Sandhi period, the transition of which period 
caused the emergence of Blood cancer to this native. 

It is to be carefully noted here that the native's 
longevity looks to be good due to exaltation of Mars 
in the Rashi chart and also occupying a friendly 
Navamsha of Pisces and therefore, the disease has 
struck the native at his beginning of Saturnine age 
as Sarturn aspects the sixth house to cause disease 
at later years of the native's life which is further 
substantiated by the fact that the planets posited in 
the 8th house Mercury and Rahu are in th~ star of 
Saturn. 

Mercury the sixth lord being posited in the eighth 
in Rashi chart and posited in Virgo (exaltation house) 
in Navamsha confirms the native's death due to 
disease which may get prolonged. Rahu dasha (Rahu 
posited in the eighth) may cause death to the native 
from this disease. 

3. MENTAL PROBLEM 

In chart VIn the Ascendant lord Moon is 
'debilitated indicating some disturbance for health as 
'no benefic aspects Moon. The Ascendant is also 
occupied by Mars and shadow planet Rahu giving a 
glimpse of some disturbance in the shiro Bhava, the

region of the head. 

Moon further getting the aspect of 8th lord Saturn 
on the region of the head will put the mental zone to 
opacity which is the character of the eighth lord 
Saturn causing trouble in the region of the head due 
to his nature of inflicting chronic aliment. Saturn 
projected in Astrology as Manda which means dull 
and delegates to the already debilitated signifactor 
of mind, the Moon posited also in the star of Saturn 
results absolute imbalance of mind. 

The whole focus center of the disease in this 
horoscope lies in the region of the head as the lord of 
Ascendant and the Kalapurasha Shiro Bhavaddipathi 
Mars both are in debilitation having influence of a 



122 Medical Astrology 

common enemy to both Moon & Mars, the Rahu. In 
addition Mars is in the star of Ashlesha that of the 
12th lord. 

The signifactor of intelligence, Mercury is in the 
star of Rahu again shadowing the intelligence zone. 
The fourth lord Venus is posited in the star of Jupiter, 
the sixth lord. 

These factors made the native suffer the mental 
imbalance perpetually.

in this book. 

Saturn, planet of chronic illness is aspecting the 
ascendant and Jupiter, the lord of the sixth house 
indicating chronic Asthma disease as mentioned above. 

6. GYNECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS 

In the chart XI of a lady, the fifth lord Venus 
representing the womb is debilitated indicating some 
problem in the first instance to the issues which is 
confirmed by Venus's occupation in the star of the

In addition, the sixth lord Mercury, the lord of

Mars, planet of surgery aspects the fifth house, 
the womb indicating surgery in the area of the womb. 
Added to the woe, Saturn is also aspecting the fifth 
house creating much more complications. Thus the 
combined aspects of both Saturn and Mars on the fifth 
house are not good for the protection of the womb. 

It is also seen that the fifth lord Venus is hemmed 

"

between malefic planets Sun, Krishna Paksha Moon, 
Kethu and Saturn causing Papa Karthari Yoga. 

In N avamsha chart the lord of the disease 
Mercury is in Uccha Vargotthama causing great 
concern for the health of the native particularly in 
the region of the womb as Mercury is conjoined with 
the fifth lord Venus which also represents 
Gynecological matters being a female planet. 

Thus by having umpteen negative points, the 
native was forced to undergo an operation for the 
removal of the uterus in her dasha period of Budha 
dasha and Budha bhukthi.

The native is Makara lagna born. The native's 
4th house contains Mars. But Saturn with exaltation 
aspects the powerful Mars which is the house of chest 
and heart as it is the 4th house from lagna. It is 
confirmed that she is suffering from Rheumatic heart. 
To further confirm the heart disease the lord of the 
5th house Venus who also rules the heart region is 
conjoined with Rogadhipathi Mercury in the janma 
lagna itself indicating that the native suffers illness 
from birth. 

The 7th house, the house representing abdomen 
is aspected by surgical planet Mars indicating an 
operation or wounds in the abdominal region. 

The native could not escape cesserian due to the 
aspect of Mars on 7th house on Moon, which is 
abdominal region. Unfortunately, there is no Jupiter's 

. aspect on the 7th house to ward off operation 
tendencies and this confirmed the operation further. 

The Moon, indicating labour pain, is aspected by 
Saturn and Mars indicating surgery as labour pain 
may not occur in time, giving birth to children in this 
case is complicated issue as the 5th lord Venus is in 
chara rashi accompaied with 6th lord indicating loss 
of children or abortions. 

That apart, the san thana karaka (Signifactor of 
children) Jupiter is conjoined with Ketu in the rashi 
chart in the 6th house and at the same time the 
Jupiter is conjoined with Saturn in Navamsha 

. indicating obstacles to the children, and delay to have 
the children. 

Obstacle is also in the form of Ketu with santan 
karka Jupiter and it gives a hint that there is l~ly 



Medical Astrology 127 

to be surgery in connection with becoming the mother 
of child as Ketu is said to follow Kuja (Kujavath Ketu). 

All these facts mentioned above throw light of 
some discrepancy for motherhood and also operation 
for becoming a mother and hence certain of cesserian 
operation.8

8. For progeny, we study (i) Fifth house, Lord of the fifth, Jupiter 
(karka), 5th from the Moon and fifth from Jupiter. In addition we 
have to analyse position in N avamsha and Sapthamsha. In this chart 
5th house is hemmed between Mars and Ketu, Jupiter is afflicted, 
Moon is afflicted, 5th from Jupiter's badly afflicted and 5th from the 
Moon is also afflicted. 



128 Medical Astrology 

7th house has Venus in his own house along with 
exalted Saturn. Saturn alone as badhakadhipathi in 
exaltation with Venus does not create problems of 
operation as the region is not aspected by Mars. The 
labour pain causing planet Moon is not aspected by 
Mars. 

Though the 5th house is aspected by Mars causing 
some tension of operation in house of children zone, 
it is thawtered off by the aspect of powerful Jupiter 
on the lord of the fifth, the Sun. 

However, the native had to undergo abortion due 
to the aspect of Mars on 5th house and further the 
5th lord occupying 8th house. 

The difference between the previous chart of 
ceasarian operation (chart XII) and this chart XIII is 
as under: 
1. The Badhakadhipathi of previous chart XII is 

Mars which in itself signifies surgery. 
2. The Badhakadhipati of Chart XIII is Saturn, 

who is a planet of delay and not surgery. 
3. The 7th abdominal region is occupied by it's own 

lord and gets the aspect of surgical planet and 
badhaka Mars and Saturn in Chart XII. While 
in the Chart XIII the abdominal region, the 7th 
house is occupied by Venus with badhadhipathi 
Saturn but without the aspect of surgical planet 
Mars. 

4. In the chart XII, the lord of the fifth Venus is 
conjoined with sixth lord Mercury in lagna 
indicating loss of foetus or child where as in this 
chart XIII the lord of the fifth Sun with the sixth 



Medical Astrology 129 

lord Mercury is in the Sth indicating loss of 
children either in foetus or after birth. Both the 
natives suffered loss of children: In chart XII 
there was abortion and in chartXIII also there 
was abortion and also death of an infant born 
baby after two days of delivery. 

6. In the chart XII, the labour pain causing planet 
Moon is aspected by Mars while in the chart XIII 
there is no aspect of Mars on Moon. 

6. In the chart XII the santhanakarka Jupiter is 
conjoined with planet of obstacle Ketu who acts 
like Mars while the chart XIII has it's Jupiter 
in exaltation without affliction. 

7. Adopting the technique ofkarakath bhava to the 
chart XII, Saturn is posited in exaltation in the 
fifth from Jupiter with the aspect of Mars on 
Saturn there by troubling the Bhava and 
underwent surgery due to the aspect of Mars 
while in the chart XIII the fifth house from 
Jupiter is conjoined with Mercury and Sun and 
planet of surgery Mars does not aspect. Hence 
there was no surgery for delivering the child in 
this case. 

S. Observing the rules of Bhavath Bhava in the 
1st case, the 5th from 5th the ninth lord Mercury 
is in lagna along with Venus indicating a good 
sign. But this is lost as the Mercury and Venus 
gets the Papa Karthari Yoga of Sun and Rahu 
indicating some difficulty in obtaining children. 
Perhaps, this Karthari yoga has also caused 
ceasarian operation to this native. 

In the 2nd case the Bhavath Bhava, the fifth 



130 Medical Astrology 

from fifth, the ninth house falls on Dhanus and 
it's lord Jupiter is in exaltation sign in 4th house, 
a susthana, (a benefic house) indicating that the 
children born will be born without much 
problems. 

9. The common factor in both the horoscopes are 
loss of children. The reason is that in the first 
case, the fifth lord Venus is in the star of 
Uttarashada ruling the Sun which happens to 
be the 8th lord and in second case the 5th lord 
Sun has occupied the 8th house.

die, similarly if Moon posited in Ascendent is aspected 
by Sun and if Mars and Saturn occupy 11th house 
the child born will die. 

If Moon is in ascendent and Mars in 7th, if benefic 
aspect, even though the child is born gets neglected 
and goes in the hands of its community and if aspected 
by malefics the child will go to the hands of different 
communities and dies early.

conjoined with planet of boils and wounds Kuja who 
also happens to be kalapurusha Shiro Bhava. Other 
important fact is that the Moon is in the star of Mars 
responsible for the region of surgery in the head 
portion. The other intricate point is that the steller 
lord of the lagna i.e. of Ashlesha star, is Mercury and 
he is aspected by Mars. 

Incidentally, the native suffered brain tumour 
and was operated at the end of Jupiter dasha the 
Roghadhipati dasha (dasha of lord of disease). 

The dashanatha Jupiter aspecting the 
kalapurusha shirobhava 8th house, though created 
tension by way of disease, made the operation 
successful. 

Study from the chart of husband: 

The importance of astrology lies in detecting the 



132 Medical Astrology 

disease of kith and kin, the husband, wife, the son 
etc. in their mutual horoscopes. 

Here, I have taken the example of the lady with 
brain tumour and I am studying her disease through 
her husband's chart (chart XV).

The husband is born in Sagittarius lagna. His 7th

becomes the first house to study the wife's future. 
Thus, the lord of Gemini, the Mercury becomes the 
"Shirobhavadhipati" i.e. the lord of the head portion 
of the wife. This Mercury is conjoined with Mars and 
Ketu indicating some problem in the region ofthe head 
of wife and also throw light on surgery to the wife in 
the region of the head due to the association of Mars. 

The tumour of wife was detected in the husband's 
Jupiter dasha. The Jupiter in the star of jyeshta 
whose ruling lord Mercury is the 7th lord in the 
husband's chart representing the wife.

look ugly and some disease connected to such 
directions will arise. 

The native has leukoderma making him look ugly. 
To further substantiate Mercury the lord of skin is 
conjoined with Ketu. Ketu to rule chitra varna, which 
means multicoloured substances, Leucoderma is a 
disease of different coloured patches on the body. 
Hence the native suffered Leucoderma in Saturn's

breasts were removed. Thus ugliness to the lady was 
caused due to aspect of planet causing ugliness to 
any individual, the Saturn (here the badhakadhipati 
also) on the breast lord Moon in the Rashi chart. 

Further (Saturn's) association with the

the aspect of Saturn who is badhakadhipati for 
Mesha lagna. The second lord Venus conjoined with 
the sixth lord Mercury and gets the aspected of 
exalted Saturn. Thus badhakadhipati for the lagna, 
Saturn is aspecting the lords of second and the 12th. 

In navamsha chart also the Venus is occupying 
the Sun's house and is aspected by Saturn. Thus there 
is some affliction to the eyes in the navamsha chart. 

Lastly, it is noted that the na ti ve is born in

In this horoscope, the karakas for eyes, the Sun

which are the burnt Rashis. This is a very serious 
placement for the karaka of the eyes, leading ,to 
blindness apart from the other unfavourable

The Chart of the Father 



edical Astrology 137 

The lagna of the father's chart (Chart XIX) is 
\ corpio. The 5th house rules the first child. The 

position of Venus in exaltation in 5th confirms that 
the first issue is a female. 

Considering the 5th house as the lagna of the 
daughter, the 2nd and the 12th house from the 5th 
rules the eyes of the daughter. The lord of the 2nd 
and the 12th houses are Mars and Saturn, 
respectively, and they rule the eyes. 

Unfortunately, Mars is debilitated and Saturn 
though posited in the 11th gets the aspect of Mars 
indicating considerable problems to the eyes of his 
daughter and the daughter suffered blindness at the 
fag end of Venus dasha of the father. 

It is also observed that the native's birth took 
place in shashti thithi. For shashti Aries becomes 
Dagdha or burnt house and this house rules the eyes 
of the daughter. Hence she lost her eye-sight. 

This also concludes that Mars dasha of the girl 
taking place after the end of Moon's dasha is 
unfavourable for her eyes as the Moon in the 
daughter's horoscope is in dagdha rashi. 

The native's daughter is advised to recite 
"Chakshushopanishad" to get back her eye sight apart 
from pacifying Rahu by reciting Durga mantra. 

13. DIAGNOSING DISEASES OF KITH ANn KIN FROM A 
HOROSCOPE 

After analysing the previous chart throwing light 
on daughter's eyesight problem from the father's chart 
we will further make attempt to know in detail about 
the fascinating part of Astrology in diagnosing the 



/ 
138 Medical Astrology I 

disease of the kith and kin from any given horoscope. / 
Astrology can only can effectively prove the credibility 
of such analysis with perfection to a greater extent. 
Till now, there is no science in the world which can 
authoritatively spell out the likely bodily, mental and 
physical problems faced by the relatives ofthe native, 
except astrology. 

It is not magnification to state that one can know 
the diseases likely to get affected to the mother, 
brother, sister, wife, father, father-in-law, mother­
in-law etc. who are closely associated with the native. 

What is the ground on which such analysis is 
made? How a native's horoscope can throw light on 
relatives in his surroundings through the chart? 

How can it throw light on the health of a native's 
relatives? 

These are,  the fundamental doubts tha, t can be 
raised by the scientific community and the people at 
large also. 

Astrology explains this phenomenon by its tool, 
the karma philosphy which makes anyone born in 
this earth to have connections with his or her kith 
and kin and surroundings whether one likes or not. 
The native has to work for various causes of the men 
around whether to attend to the hospital work of those 
admitted to hospital for a specific disease or to spend 
money for the purpose of hospitilisation of the 
relatives etc. All these are visualised in the chart. 

We also find a family, the wife healthy but 
children may suffer ill health due to some disorders. 
One of the native's children may have an ear problem. 



Medical Astrology 139 

This is amazingly reflected in a native's chart where 
in one can find that the third house from the fifth 
house will be afflicted by malefic planets or the 
seventh lord can be in a bad state in the chart. 

Similiarly the same problem may be reflected in 
one's brother or sister's chart where in by analyzing 
the third house from the the third house one can know 
whether his or her co-born's ear is troubled or not by 
the way of hard of hearing or any ailment whatsoever. 

Is it not agonizing to think that one's children 
suffer from some handicaps? How much the parents 
feel for such happenings in their life? Why only some 
unfortunate parents suffer these agonies from their 
children's side while many are away from such 
problems? 

Similiarly the better half of the native may suffer 
from disease like Bronchitis in which case one can 
find that Jupiter or Moon may get posited in the sixth 
house from seventh house in a watery sign. Thus 
umpteen number of examples may be given to 
substantiate this fascinating is.sue of identification 
of diseases of the kith and kin. 

Whatever may be the planetary comibnations 
linking the kith and kin for the troubles they undergo 
and the sufferings and pain the connected persons 
undergo, the fact is very clear that it is the past karma 
which has established a definite empire for us to work 
as per the karmic dictates whether one is reluctant to 
accept or not. 

Now let us try to understand more horoscopes, 
which throw light on the diseases of the kith and kin 
of a native. 



140 Medical Astrology 

In the chart XX that of a male, the seventh house 
represents the wife. Keeping this as ascendant in the 
mind, the sixth house from this house is Capricorn 
whose lord is Saturn and he represents the lord of 
the disease of the wife.

Saturn is exalted in Libra in a Vayu rashi. Saturn 
is a planet representing vatha humour. Thus Saturn 
has a powerful Vayu connection, which has affected 
the wife with die sase connected with Saturn in 
astrology, the Arthiritis. 

In the navamsha chart which is nothing but wife's 
chart, the sixth lord Moon representing the disease 
of the spouse is conjoined with saturn in the 
ascendant causing arthiritis specially knee pain to 



Medical Astrology 141 

the wife of the native. 
However, Jupiter aspecting the Ascendant in the 

Navamsha chart somewhat makes the native's wife's 
disease bearable and does not allow to aggravate to 
an unbearable level. 

The native's wife also suffer's from nervous ~ 

disablities as Mercury is posited in the Ascendant in 
Navamsha along with Moon the sixth lord and she 
complains of the severity in rainy seasons because 
the sixth lord in D-9 i.e. spouse chart is a watery sign. 

14. MEDICAL AsTROLOGY AND KARMA THEORY LINKING 

THE DESTINY WITH RELATIVES AND ALL HUMAN BEINGS 

The interesting factor in medical astrology is the 
application of Karma Theory in the real perspective. 

The debts of our past karma has to be cleared in 
any manner, whether it is father, mother, brother, 
sister, wife, friend or an employer, one has to perform 
the duties as doctrined by the law of karma which in 
our daily life gets going unnoticed. 

The Hindu way of analysing the life of a man after 
his death is in the concept that he has completed the 
drama of life and is said to have born to clear his debts 
ofthe past. This is called the Runanubandha. Pets, wife, 
children and possession of house are made available by 
God as per the past karma of the person. There is saying 
in Gita "Runanubandha Rupena Pashu Pathni 
Suthalayaha". 

The above dictum not only mentions of obtaining 
pets, wife, children, sons etc., but also extends to the 
service a man has to do, to protect and rare them 
during his life time to clear his past dues. 



142 Medical Astrology 

Bearing the above in mind, it is surprising to note 
that this great $cience of astrology is capable of 
unfolding the secrets of many facets of life including 
the diseases of kith and kin of the native from one's 
chart which is already explained in previous example. 

From a given chart, one can study the type of 
mother, father, brother, sister, friend etc. a person 
will come across in his life and also the diseases 
affecting the kith and kin of a person. 

The horoscope, which is also mentioned as ''Vidhi 
Chakra" or "Chart of fate" or "Karmic Chart" 
gives scope to analyse and explain the subtle factors 
of a native serving the kith and kin by taking care of 
them during their sickness or at least getting 
information of their sickness at various span of his 
life causing disturbance to mind though not one is 
inclined to,serve due to circumstances. 

Astrology with fair accuracy throws light on the 
disease of the kith and kin from a native's chart unlike 
the medicinal science which diagnose the disease of 
the kith and kin as can be done in this great science 
of Astrology without physically testing them. 

Ultimately, Astrology lies in the fact that a native 
is destined to have his kith and kin in a definite 
fashion as per the ordain of the planets on his kith 
and kin imposing diseases, accidents etc. or causing 
happiness to them through marriage, birth of sons 
etc. 

To narrate in simple terms, it is destined for a 
native to be the son or daughter of a heart patient, 
diabetic patient, parents with different dieases like 



Medical Astrology 143 

leukoderma, short of hearing, eye problems etc. or as 
children of healthy parents. 

It is also destined that a native may have healthy 
co-borns or no-borns at all, sickly or healthy wife etc.

In the chart XXI, ninth lord Venus representing 
the house of father is debilitated and is conjoined with 
6th and 8th lord. This combination is evident to show 
some trouble to the father by way of disturbance in 
health. 



144 Medical Astrology 

To diagnose exactly the dise~se of the father, the 
6th, from the 9th house Libra is occupied by a 
debilitated planet Sun who is the 4th lord of the 
father's house and represents the region of the heart 
of the father. Sun being debilitated cause trouble to 
the heart of the father and this is further 
substantiated by the conjunction of Sun with Saturn 
in the navamsha chart. 

Further from the pitrukaraka Sun, the 4th lord, 
the region of heart ofthe father, the Saturn is in 12th 
house getting conjoined with Mars and Venus, the 
8th lord from Sun. Saturn in navamsha is conjoind 
with Sun. These factors are self explanatory for an 
astrologer to confirm the problems to the heart of the 
father of the native. 

The father suffered first attack during the Mars 
dasha of the native as the 4th lord ruling the heart 
region from the 9th from the dashanatha, the Sun is 
debilitated without Jupiter's aspect. 

Till now, the aspect of Jupiter is not mentioned 
only to confirm the intensity of the trouble on the 
heart of the father, Jupiter aspects Saturn, the 4th 
lord from pitrukaraka but does not aspect the 4th 
lord the Sun reckoned from the pitru bhava the 9th 
house. 

There are number of malefic influences mentioned 
as above and aspect of Jupiter could only reduce the 
intensity and he became somewhat instrumental in 
making the native's father survive four heart attacks. 
Moon also became somewhat instrumental to 
overcome these attacks as she, as an exalted planet 
occupes the Tanu bhava (the body house) as a benefic 



Medical Astrology 145 

in the bhava of father, the 9th house. 
The father also suffered diabeties. This can be 

analysed by the occupation of the lord of the pitru 
bhava, the 9th house, Venus in Virgo getting the 
aspect of sweet planet Jupiter at the age ruled by 
Saturn i.e. 50th year, during the Rahu dasha shukra 
bhukti of the native, the father was fifty years and 
he suffered diabeties. The timing of the disease is 
attributed to the fact that the 9th lord representing 
the father's house Venus, itself a sweet planet is 
aspected by Jupiter another sweet planet. 

The father of the native also suffered piles due to 
the fact that the 8th house from the pitrukaraka, the 
Sun representing rectum region is owned by Venus 
and firstly debilitated causing some concern to the 
region and this concern looks aggravated by the 
conjunction of Mars, the planet of rectum of the 
natural Zodiac and also the planet of piles with Venus. 

The 8th lord Jupiter reckoned from the 9th also 
aspected by Mars indicating piles. The father had to 
undergo operation for piles and Saturn delayed the 
curing by which time the father died. 

(ii) Diagnosis of Disease of Mother 

The fourth house indicates the mother. In the 
chart XXI, the 4th bhava is Sagittarius. The 6th house 
from the 4th rules the disease of the mother· and is 
Taurus whose lord is Venus which is conjoined and 
gets the aspect of Jupiter and she became a diabetic. 
The mother also suffered high blood pressure due to 
the association of Mars with the lord of the disease 
Venus. 



146 Medical Astrology 

The mother got afflicted with diabeties and blood 
pressure during the Jupiter dasha of the native due 
to aspect of lord of disease Venus, Mars and Saturn 
on Jupiter, the lord of the 4th house, the mother. 

(iii) Problems to the Maternal Uncle 

It is mentioned in "Shambhu Bora", that when 
Rahu occupies the 6th house, the maternal uncle will 
become childless and may die due to fall from height. 

In this case Rahu is occupying the 6th house and 
one of the maternal uncles is childless and another 
has fallen from heights. 

Thus from a given chart one can make an attempt 
to diagnose the problems and diseases to the kith and 
kin and also can know with fair accuracy the timing 
of the problems and ailments. This is how, the karma 
theory has engulfed the native in the chart XXI. 

16. ANALYSIS OF DISEASE OF HUSBAND THROUGH A 
LADIES HOROSCOPE 

In the chart XXII the 6th house from the seventh 
i.e. from the husband's house is Meena and is watery 

.sign occupied by Moon, a watery planet and is a lord 
of watery mansion Cancer. 

Added to this Jupiter, a planet of Phlegm is 
occupying the 6th house from the 7th where Moon, 
another planet of phelgm is posited. This made the 
husband of the native to suffer from cold connected 
diseases and he is suffering Asthma. 

In the navamsha also, the Jupiter is in a watery 
sign the Cancer in exaltation aspecting the 6th house 
and the 8th house from navamsha lagna, the houses

This also substantiates disease of Asthama to

17. DETECTION OF DISEASE THROUGH HORARY 
METHODS 

Prashna Marga also throws light on various 
diseases the planets cause to the mankind. If Sun 
and Moon are ill placed they cause bilous diseases, if 
Venus and Moon are ill placed watery diseases are 
caused, if Mercury is ill placed diseases from airy, 
watery and bilious doshas are caused, if Jupiter is ill 
placed diseases due to akasha tatwa will arise. 



148 Medical Astrology 

f It is also said that the nine planets rule different 
parts of the body: 
, Planet Part of body 

Sun stomach, 
Moon heart, 
Mars head, 
Mercury chest, 
Jupiter thighs, 
Rahu and Ketu Feet. 

At the time of question of a patient, depending 
,upon the planetary position at the time of query, one 
.'can predict the part of the body subjected to disease, 
iwounds etc. 

It is also said that at the time of the question if 
the ascendent of the question time falls on a chara 
Rashi (cardinal) sign i.e. Mesha, Kataka, Tula and 
Makara, Urdhva Rashi (i.e. the sign of Sun's previous 
house) and Shirshodaya rashi (i.e. Simha, Kanya, 
Tula, Vrishchika, Mithuna, Kumbha) the question is 
said to have diseases in upper part of the neck. 

If the ascendent rises in fixed signs Taurus, Leo, 
Scorpio and Acquarius or the Thiryang rashi i.e. the 
sign ahead of Sun or Ubhayodaya rashi (Meena rashi), 
the disease is to effect from neck upto the waist. 

If the ascendent at the time of question happens 
to be Ubhaya Rashi i.e. Gemini, Virgo and Sagittarius 
or Adhomukha rashi (posited house of Sun) and 
Pritodaya rashis (Aries, Taurus, Cancer and 
Capricorn) the questioner is said to have diseases 
below the waist upto feet. 



Medical Astrology 149 

Thus, horary astrology helps in detecting the 
focus centre of the disease. 

18. DETERMINATION OF FECUNDITY .AND VERILITY 

It is natural that the couple become anxious when 
they don't become parents for long time. 

Astrology has it's own method of analysing the 
potency of the father and bearing capacity of the 
mother. To find out the birth of children in such cases, 
astrologically Beeja sphzttas for male and kshetra 
sputas for female should be calculated. It is the male, 
who gives the seed (Beeja) to the female foetus, 
kshetra means fertilizing centre i.e. the place where 
the seed grows and it is the womb of mother. 

There are certain calculations to arrive at the 
Beeja sphuta and kshetra sphuta. 

Beeja (the seed) and the kshetra (the fruit) should 
be strong in the horoscopes of male and female. If 
the seed is weak and the fruit is strong the couple 
may become parents very late after performing 
necessary propituations to get children. 

Some school of thought mention that Sun and 
Moon are responsible for the conception and the 
planets should be placed favourably in odd signs. 

To find out the beeja sphuta, add the longitude 
of the Sun, Venus and Jupiter of the male chart and 
divide the sum total by 360. The remainder is the 
beeja sphuta. 

To find the kshetra sphuta, add the longitudes of 
Moon, Mars and Jupiter and divide by 360. The 
remainder will be kshetra sphuta. 



150 Medical Astrology 

If the beeja sphuta is in odd sign and in odd 
navamsha and gets conjoined with or aspected by 

~ benefics, the beeja is said to be strong and such a 
person will be able to become father of a son. If in 
odd sign in Rashi chart and in even sign in the 
navamsha chart or vice versa the birth of children is 
said to take place with great difficulty. If the sphuta 
is in even sign in both Rashi and navamsha children 
will not be born to him. 

If the kshetra sphuta occupies an even sign and 
even navamsha and gets conjunct or aspected by 
benefics she can be confirmed to give birth to children. 
If the kshetra sphuta occupies odd sign in rashi chart 
and even sign in navamsha or vice versa, the native 
will beget children with great difficulty. If the kshetra 
sphuta occupies odd signs in both Rashi and 
navamsha children will not be born to them. 

Further, these sphuta rashis will not be aspected 
by malefics or hermephrodite planets. The 5th house 
from sphuta rashis also should not be conjuncted with 
malefic planets or aspected by malefics. It is also said 
that Rahu should not occupy the beeja sphuta or 5th 

. house therefrom. 

19. SEXUAL INTEREST 

If Venus is in exaltation or dehilitation and is in 
the first half of Leo or in 6-8-12, the native will be 
very sexy. 

If Venus is in his own navasmha the native will 
be sexy. 

If malefic planet aspects Venus, the native will 
be sexy. 



Medical Astrology 151 

IfV enus is in Gemini or in it's own sign the native 
will be sexy. 

If Saturn is in Sagittarius or Taurus or in lagna 
the native will not have much interest in sex. 

If ascendent happens to be an odd sign and Venus 
is posited in the 4th house. 

20. AYURVEDIC CONCEPT FOR GOOD HEALTH 

It is said in the medical science of the yore, the 
Ayurveda which is an upanga of Atharva veda was 
given by Brahma with one lakh shlokas to Ashwini 
devatas. They in turn preached it to Indra and he in 
turn to Dhanvantari and he in turn preached the 
science of Ayurveda to the sages. The ayurveda lays 
down the following principles for good health to be

celibacy will not have good health, wealth and 
longevity. 



CHAPTER 8 

Three Humours and Diseases 

Let us now understand the types of diseases 
caused by different humours in Ayurvedic science of 
medicine and the important sites of location of these 
three humours are as under. 

Urinary Bladder, rectum, waist, thighs, legs, 
bones and colon are the sites ofVatta; amongst them 
colon is the most important site. Sweat, rasa, lasika 
(lymph), rakta and small intestine are the sites of 
Pittha; amongst them small intestine is the most 
important site. Chest, head, neck, joint, stomach 
(upper part of intestine) and fat are the sites of 
Shleshma, phlegmatic. Amongst them, chest is the 
most important site. 

Vatha is divided into various categories like prana 
etc., with its different sites for each division. The sites 
mentioned in the above passage are those where the 
vitiation of vatha generally manifests itself and the 
diseases caused by this humour vatha are difficult to 
cure. So if vatha is controlled in these sites, all.types 
of vathik,1 diseases can be prevented. 

( 



Medical Astrology 157 

TYPES OF DISEASES CAUSED BY DIFFERENT HUMOURS 

The entire body is in fact an abode of all the three 
doshas, Vatha, Pittha and Kapha. According as the 
doshas are normal or abnormal the good health or 
diseases are caused, respectively. In normal state 
good health results like good complexion, happiness 
etc. are felt while in abnormal state various diseases 
are likely to affect. 

Endogeneous diseases are again of two types viz. 
diseases are caused by Vatha (gaseous), pittha 
(bilous) and kapha (phlegmatic) in general and the 
specific diseases caused by the vitiation of the vatha, 
pittha and kapha. Diseases caused by vatha are of 
eighty types, those by pittha of forty types and those 
by kapha of twenty types.

Endogenous diseases of the general type 

(samayaja) are caused by the combination of two or 
more doshas. Astrologically invariably the 
combination of planets depicting different doshas 
have to ,~ e studied. 



Medical Astrology 161 

The endogenous diseases of specific type 
(nanatmaja = nat an atmaja + atmaja = atmaja are 
on the other hand, caused by only one of the doshas 
without having been associated with any dosha. 

Even if some of vathika type of diseases are 
caused by other doshas besides vatha it is actually 
vatha which is responsible for transmission or 
otherwise of the vitiated doshas to a specific organ of 
the body as it has been said "Kapha Pitta and Dhatus".

Medical Astrology 163 

or implied, the inherent natural qualities and actions 
of pittha are quite obviously manifested wholly or 
partially and as such it is not dificult for a competent 
physician to correctly diagnose the paittika type 
diseases. The inherent natural qualities of pittha 
diseases are excessive heat, liquidity, sharpness, all 
colours except white and red, fishy smell, acrid and 
sour tastes and fluidity. 

The natural actions of pittha moving from one 
part of the body to the other are burning sensation, 
heat, perspiration, sloughing, putrification, itching, 
discharge, redness and the exhibition of its inherent 
smell, colour and taste - these are the actions that 
help a competent physician to diagnose pitthika type 
of diseases. 

This should be tested by drugs having sweet, 
bitter, astringent and cooling qualities and such 
devices as aleation, pugation, unction, affucion, 
massage etc. which should all contain material having 
anti-pittika propereties. This is of course to be done 
with due regard to the dosage and season. Of all the 
devices stated above, purgation is the treatment par 
excellance for curing the pitthika diseases because 
immediately after it is administered, it eliminates the 
vitiated pittha from its very root. When it is over come 
in the (small intestine), it allivates the entire vitiated 
pittha dwelling in other parts of the body. This can 
be likened to a hot chamber being cooled by removing 
the fire from inside it. 

These qualities are represented in astrology by 
the two planets Sun and Mars who are tejattawa 
planet signifying bilious nature. 



164 Medical Astrology 

Mars being a planet of bilous nature planet 
represents burning sensation, fire etc. 

Now we shall explain the twenty varieties of 
diseases due to the vitiation of kapha (phelgmatic) 
which are most commonly manifested. 

C. TWENTY TYPES OF KAPHA DISEASES 

There are many diseases due to vitiation ofkapha. 
The following are the major diseases occuring due to 
phelgm or kapha. 

1. Thripthi (anisexia nervosea) 

2. Tandra (drowsiness) 

3. Nidraadhikya (excessive sleep) 

4. Staimitya (timidness) 

5. Gurugatrata (heaviness in the body) 

6. Aasyam (laziness) 

7. Mukhamadhurya (sweet taste in mouth) 

8. Mukhasrava (salivation) 

9. Slesmodgirana (mucus expectoration) 

10. Malashikya (excessive excretion of excreta) 

11. Balasaka (loss of strength) 

12. Apakti (indigestion) 

13. Hridayopalepa (phelgm adhered vicinity of 
the heart region) 

14. Kanthopalepa (phelgm adhered to throat) 

15. Dhamanaipraticaya (hardening of vessels) 

16. {ialaganda (goiter) 
(, 



Medical Astrology 165 

17. Atisthaulya (obsesity) 

18. Shitagnitha (suppression of digestive power) 

19. Udaeda (urticaria) 

20. Svetavabasata (pallor) 

netra varchastva (whiteness of urine, face and 
eyes) 

In all the shleshmika (phelgmatic) type of 
diseases the inherent natural qualities and actions 
of kapha are quite obviously manifested fully or 
partly. Coolness, whiteness, heaviness, sweetness, 
steadiness, slimness and viscosity are the inherent 
qualities of kapha. 

The natural actions of kapha moving from one 
part of the body to the other are whiteness, coolness, 
itching and stability. 

Numbness as ascribed as the action of both kapha 
and vata in the former due to inaction, in the latter 
due to loss of sensation. 

GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF TREATMENT FOR KAPHA 

DISEASES (Phlegmatic diseases) 

They (diseases due to vitiated kapha) should be 
tested with drugs having pungent, bitter, astringent, 
sharp, hot and unctuous qualities and by such 
therapies like fomentation, emesis, elimination of 
doshas from the head, exercise etc. which shall 
contain materials having anti-shleshmika properties. 
This is of course to be done with due regard to the 
dosage and season. Of all the devices stated above 
emetic therapy is the treatment par excellence for 
the cure of diseases due to kapha because 



166 Medical Astrology 

immediately after entering the stomach, it strikes at 
the very root cause of the vitiation of kapha.

the eastern direction and by doing so there will be 
relief from the disease.

186 Medical Astrology 

Day Disease is suffered for period of 
Wednesday 18 days 

Thursday 10 days 

Friday 10 days 

Saturday 25 days 

Perform pooja to a golden idol of "Poosha" devatha 
adorned with red cloth. Offer guggula dhoopa and 
"Ekka flowers". Offer gingely rice to the idol. Offer 
bali with jaggery rice to the northern direction for 
getting relief from ailment. 

Thus our ancients have mentioned the duration 
of the disease striking on a particular star by 
analysing the cosm~c effect on the human body and 
had devised various remedial measures by way of 
propitiation to overcome the disease by taking the 
Agama Shastras and Vedic Mantras into the fold to 
pacify the nakshatradhipathis who play vital role in 
causing and ameliorating the diseases. 

ASTROLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS 

Observe whether the birth of the native has taken 
place during the Visha Ghatika of the nakshatra in 
which the native is born. In such cases in propitiation 
technique will not work as the native is born in Visha 
ghatika. 

Observe whether the natural significator for 
health Sun is well placed or ill placed. 

Note: The most important factors of diagnosing 
diseases of any native consists in analyzing the 
planets directing sickness and its confirmation is done 
on the basis of their influence with 



Medical Astrology 187 

1. The Badhakadhipathi 

2. The karakas of the concerned diseases 

3. Influence of the chronic disease inflicting 
planet Saturn 

4. Maleifc planets occupying the ascendant 

5. Association of planets with Rahu or Ketu in 
particular 

6. .Lord of ascendant with sixth, eighth or 
twelfth lord 

7. Sixth, eighth or twelfth lord in the ascendant 

8. Nature of the Zodiacal signs 

9. Failure of aspect of Jupiter on sixth house 
or sixth lord 

10. Existence of Deha Kashta yoga in the chart 

11. Sixth lord in the sixth 

12. Sixth lord getting exalted. 
Lord of sixth representing a particular disease 

getting exalted causes the disease attributed to that 
planet. Observe whether Sun, the natural signifactor 
of health is well placed or ill placed. 

The Various diseases of the native pertaining to 
various Bhavas should be analysed in the manner 
already mentioned in this text taking into fold the 
Bhava lords, stellar positions, the dashas ,running at 
a given point of time to strike the disease etc. 



CHAPTER 10 

Effective Vedic Remedies for 
Pediatric Problems 

There are innumerable mantras from all the four 
Vedas. Rigveda, Yajurveda, Smaveda and Atharveda. 

Our ancients have specified the recitation of 
several mantras for several diseases in Ath~rveda in 
detail apart from certain mantras in other three 
Vedas. The sages of the yore and the Vedic scholars 
of the recent past have gone totally to back seat to 
day due to the advent of allopathic system of medicine 
besides scarcity of such, knowledgeable persons and 
availability of many granthas which were destroyed 
due to the continuous invasions and wars by the 
foreigners, the Britishers in particular, who ruled our 
country for over two hundred years, have caused 
somehow ignorance of manthric powers for the 
present generation. 

REMEDIAL MEASURES To OVERCOME ILL EFFECTS OF 

BALA GRAHAS AFFECTING INFANTS 

Sometimes young babies cry too much, resist to 



Medical Astrology 189 

take food, get frightened, suffer purging, vomiting etc. 
and no amount of administering medicines will cure 
the child. Our ancients were of the view that there 
are some invisible forces called as "Balagrahas" which 
are considered as evil wandering souls which specially 
and specifically attack only infants and children. 

It was the practice of the ancients to drive these 
subtle and invisible forces by chanting the Yajurvedic 
Mantras by following certain procedures by using 
white mustard in homas. 

Even today this is practised in many parts of 
India and is time tested successfully which relieves 
the child's suffering from the problems mentioned above. 

Balarishta 

Astrologically there are certain combinations 
which cause problems for the health of the child 
during the first eight years from birth and this 
problem is named as Balarishta. The balarishta 
doshas also fit in during this period, particularly the 
infants becomes vulnerable to this dosha if the 
planetary combinations for the balarishta are present. 

There are many combinations ofbalarishta which 
affect the children from birth up to eight years and 
the sages of the past were aware ofthe delicate health 
of children caused by the planets while in the present 
day there is specialisation in treating children in 
,medical science in Pediatrics. 

An astrologer can understand through the 
Blaraishta the ill health of the child during the first 
eight years and also the cancellation of ill health by 
astrological dictums by various planetary combinations.

of malefic planet there will be some form of deformity 
in the concerned limb. 

Locate in which decanate a planet is posited and 
in what bhava or the house the concerned bhava lord 
is posited to know about the organs health. 



192 Medical Astrology 

Example: Suppose a planet is in the first 
decanate and is in the fourth bhava, then it will affect 
the right nostril. 

Similiarly Shashtyamsha also can be used to 
analyse diseases or troubles caused to various parts 
of the body. 

Each Shashtyamasha has a devata assigned to 
it. The Shashtyamshas are classified as krura and 
soumya. They are further classified as Deva, Pitru, 
Rishi, Manushya, Pishacha, Mohini and Kshudra. 
Each Shashtyamsha of lagna (ascendant) Chandra 
lagna, the ascendant lord, yogakaraka, atmakaraka 
and the respective bhava lord of significance should 
be analysed. 

If the ascendant is occupied by Saturn and gets 
the aspect of many malefics, the native will be 
subjected to troubles from evil spirits and robbers.
