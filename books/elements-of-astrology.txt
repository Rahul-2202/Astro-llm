FOREWARD 

 
This is a collection of notes, prepared and compiled by Mr. A S Writer, who has 
been teaching both Astrology and Palmistry at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan since 
1994. 
 
Prior to that he was a student of this Institute and is a gold medalist in Jyotir 
Vid.During his career as a lecturer he was involved in research in Natal astrology, 
Krishnamurthy Padathi and Palmistry.  He has completed a thesis on Fixed Stars 
and has been awarded Jyotir Visharada. 
 
While compiling and preparing these notes he has referred to a vast collection of 
text books as mentioned in the bibliography.  He has taken care to illustrate the 
subject in very simple and lucid language which can be easily read and followed 
both by the students and the layman who wish to get an insight into the elements of 
Astrology. 
 
He expresses his deep gratitude to the Management and staff members of Jyotisha 
Bharati for encouraging and guiding him from the inception, both as a student and 
lecturer. 
 
Further, he confesses that this book would not into print if not for the untiring and 
selfless work of Mr. Jaydeep Malaviya  and his dedicated team. 
 
I whole-heartedly recommend that this collection/compilation of “The Elements of 
Astrology” be read and used for further studies and research work.

Significance of a Horoscope 
 
The twelve signs of the Zodiac form the basic clock relating to the journey of the 
Sun through the heavens, a cycle that takes a year to complete. This astrological 
year starts in the late March at the time when the Sun enters Aries . Thereafter the 
signs change at monthly intervals. The Zodiac is divided into twelve Signs or 
Rashi’s . Theoretically each sign is of 30. Aries is the first sign of the Zodiac ; 
followed by Taurus and the others. 
 
The Zodiac chart is the map of the heavens at the time of the event is under 
reference. Hence the birth chart is the map of the heavens at the time of the birth at 
the given place of birth of the child and is known as the “Birth Chart”. The rising 
sign at the time of the birth is known as the Ascendant and signifies the East 
direction and is also the 1st. house of the horoscope. The sign opposite the 
ascendant is known as the descendent, is the West direction and is the 7th. House of 
the horoscope. The sign at the top and at right angles to the ascendant is the known 
as the Mid heaven ,is the South direction  and the 10th. House . The sign opposite 
the Mid heaven is known as the Nadir , is the North direction and the 4th. House. 
 
Signs : They indicate the trend and the quality of the human mind. They confer 
power to resist against odd environments or circumstances. 
 
Houses: They denote the environment, circumstances and conditions of human 
life. Each house has its own specialties. Each sign is a content and each house is a 
transparent receptable . This content when put into the house gives a special 
quality to it. The beginning of the house is known as the Cusp of the house . The 
house extends from the cusp of the house to the cusp of the next house. However 
the  
Indian tradition to call cusp as “ Bhava Madhya “ is now accepted by Western 
Astrologers also, that being the most sensitive point of the House. 
 
Planets: The human mind is influenced by planets according to their inherent 
tendencies and the way their influence works in every walk in life. Desirable  
influence is felt under good aspects while undesirable influence is experienced 
under bad aspects or afflications – a planet in bad aspect is termwed as a planet in 
afflication or afflicated or afflicting.

Planets in Fire Signs 
 
 
 

Live in a highly excited state, 
Inspired activity, 

And maintaining the state of being 
Is crucial for the fire signs 
To stay healthy and happy 

 
Planets in Earth Signs 

 
 
 

Are grounded in physical reality; 
The material world and considerations 
Are related to security & achievement 

Motivate their behavior 
More than anything else. 

 
 
 

Planets in Air Signs 
 
 
 

Live in the abstract realm of thought 
A thought for them is real 

As any material object 
 
  
 

Planets in Water Signs 
 

 
 

Live in the feelings 
It is their emotional state 

That determines their behavior 
Than anything else

  Masculine or Odd Signs: If most of the planets or points occupy these Signs 
the native is more masculine in appearance and by nature, even though a 
female. They are also called cruel or fierce signs 

 
 Female or Even Sign: If most of the planets or points occupy these Signs the 

native is more gentle and feminine in appearance and by nature, even though 
a male. They are also called as gentle or saumya signs. 

 
        Thus the above can be summarized as

CARDINAL Aries Capricorn Libra Cancer 
FIXED Leo Taurus Aquarius Scorpio 
MUTUABLE Sagittarius Virgo Gemini Pisces 
Profession Kshatiyas Shudras Vaishnavas Brahmins 
Gender Positive Negative Positive Negative

Planets and Aspects 
 
Aspects indicate opportunities and situations, either easy or difficult, which arise in 
life. Good aspects bring favourable opportunities or situations; whilst bad / hard 
aspects create difficult situations. But they do not obstruct progress or success in 
life. 
 
Geometrical relationships between planets are called aspects. These relationships 
affect and modify the energies of the planets concerned. Some aspects have been 
shown to generate problematic events in our lives, while others seem to smooth the 
path with relation to the areas governed by the planets, signs and houses 
concerned.  
 
Should a planet have difficult aspects, or be in an unsympathetic position in the 
zodiac, it is said to be afflicted. Its negative characteristics may be exhibited on 
occasions through unfortunate personality traits, or through difficult circumstances 
arising in your life. Should it have favourable aspects, however, its effects will be 
more beneficial. 
 
Difficult aspects, especially to the "malefic" (dangerous) planets, are often quite 
problematic and can even be catastrophic in their effects. They are, naturally 
enough, more conducive to personal development, for they tend to generate 
complex results requiring considerable interpretation and self-analysis, while 
favourable aspects more often produce simple effects which are easy to 
understand. In any case, the chart must be viewed as a whole, for positive and 
negative characteristics may cancel each other out, or appear in mitigated forms, 
according to circumstances depending upon other factors.

Aspects usually described as difficult are :- 
 

 opposition (180° apart on the chart circle)  
 square (90°)  
 semi-square (45°)  
 sesqui-quadrate (135°)  
 quincunx or inconjunct (150°) and  
 contra-parallel (opposition of declension, or latitude). 

 
Favourable aspects are :- 
 

 trine (120°)  
 sextile (60°)  
 semi-sextile (30°) and  
 parallel (conjunction in latitude). 

 

Conjunction (0°) may be favourable, difficult, or both, depending to a great degree 
upon the nature of the planets involved. 
 
Other aspects can be important in certain circumstances, as can the midpoints 
between planets, along with a number of other sensitive positions on the charts, but 
they are beyond the scope of the present discussion.

 When the aspect is formed between Sun or Moon and another planet 10 orb 

may be allowed and between Sun and Moon – an orb of 12 
 When swifter of the two planets is going towards an aspect – it is an 

applying aspect and it is separating after completion. 
 A separating aspect is stronger than an applying aspect. You can resist the 

evils of a separating aspect but it is not possible to resist against the evils of an 
applying bad aspect. 

 When two planets occupy the same degree of declination, whether N or S , 
they are in parallel position. Like the conjunction , its nature is variable and 
an Orb of only 1 is allowed.

THE  GRAND  CROSS 
 
The Grand Cross, as its name implies, incorporates planets in square and 
opposition to each other and involves all four sign of a particular quality – 
Cardinal, Fixed or Mutable.  It is sometimes referred to as a “Dilemma’, in that 
when it is triggered – especially by a transiting planet-everything  seems to happen 
at once.  As a result, people with this tricky combination often seems to lurch from 
crisis to crisis as if their mettle is constantly being tested.  Buy if and when they 
finally master their formidable energies, they may be capable of quite exceptional 
result.  People with a cardinal grand cross have tremendous drive and energy,  but 
also meet with a great deal of resistance in achieving their aims.  While they may 
blame others for the frustration they experience, may of it is self – induced , for 
they seldom plan or think carefully before they act and insist on doing everything 
their own way.  Those with a Fixed Grand Cross Tend to do everything within 
their  considerable  power to keep things as they are .  valuing reliability and 
preservation above all else, they will passionately hold out against anything or 
anyone who tries to upset their sense of order ; when change inevitably comes it is 
usually dramatic and sudden.  Mutable grand cross types have n o difficulty 
accepting change – infact, this is their problem.  Rather then face a challenge they 
tend to alter their course in the vain hope that by changing their external 
circumstances, they can avoid unwanted difficulties.  The lesson they have to learn 
is that their conflicts arise from within, as a result of a lack of consistency and 
tendency to spread themselves too thinly.

THE  GRAND  TRINE 
 
The Grand Trine consists of a triangle of three or more planets 
– including sensit ive points such as the Ascendant and MC – 
which al l make trine aspects to each other in one of the 
Elements (Fire, Earth, Air, Water). Traditionally, the Grand 
Trine was thought to be extremely fortunate, but the modern 
view is that on its own it may be too fortunate.  Since it shows 
natural talents which usually emerge early on in l ife, there may 
be  a tendency to take these gifts for granted an and 
corresponding lack of resolve to develop them.  The effects are 
much more posit ive when one or more of the planets in Grand 
Trine also makes a hard aspect  - such as a square or 
opposit ion – to another planet.  This stiffens the ‘ easy come, 
easy go’ attitude, urging the subject to put more effort into 
channeling their planetary energies purposefully. A more 
common version of a Grand Trine is the minor Grand Trine is 
the minor grand trine, which occurs when two planets trine 
each other and at the same time makes a sexti le aspect to 
another planet.  The effects are similar but often more 
dynamic since the sexti le introduces a sense of perseverance 
that may other be lacking.

The  Stellium 

 
A Stellium (also known as Satellitium) is an aspect pattern made up of three or 
more planets which are either in the same sign or in the same house (although if 
they are only in the  same house and their signs are different , the effect is less 
intense.).  the group of planets form a chain of conjunctions, so that while the first 
and last planets in the chain may not be in aspect to each other, they are joined 
through their conjunctions to the planets in between.  The effect is to exaggerate 
the qualities of the sign(s) and house (s) in which the stellium falls – although 
sometimes overpoweringly so, at the expenses of any planets which do not happen 
to aspect this relatively common configuration.

The T‐square 
 

The  T-Square-an opposit ion with one (or more) planets 
squaring both ends – is similar to the Grand Cross, expect that 
it has one ‘arm’ missing.  It is held to be easier to handle than 
the Grand Cross,  for the empty arm offers an escape route 
and creates less of a feeling of being torn four ways.  The 
tensions sets up can also be released through any planet(s) 
which makes sexti le or trine aspects to one of the planets 
within it. 
 
The same sorts of di lemmas apply to the Cardinal, Fixed and 
Mutable qualit ies of the T-Square as to the Grand Cross. 
However, because the planetary energies are not as prone to 
being bottled up, people with this combination usually manage 
to sort out their inner problems more easily.

The  finger of Fate (Yod) 

 
The finger of fate (Yod) is a rare pattern in which two planets in sextile 
to one another are both quincunx (150 Deg.) to a third.  The Yod takes 
its name from the Hebrew meaning ‘blessed’ and is reputed to have a 
quality of fate about it – in other words, the planets and houses involved 
point to a certain direction in life.  This is not an easy pattern to work 
with, but if the tensions it shows can be resolved, great achievements are 
possible.

The  Mystic Rectangle 

 
The mystic rectangle is a complex pattern consisting of t wo oppositions, 
the ends of which form sextiles or trine to each other. Because of its 
shape, the flow of energy may be limited to the soft aspects, missing out 
the hard ones altogether and leaving important issues unresolved, as with 
the Grand Trine.  However, if the oppositions are integrated, the blend  
of hard and soft aspects can result in the kind of dynamic tensions that 
enables peoples to develop their natural abilities to the full.

The  kite 
 
The kite occurs whenever three planets in a Grand Trine link  upto another which 
opposes one and is sextile to the other two.  Its effect  is much the same as the 
Mystic Rectangle in that the many soft aspects can lead to a reluctance to face the 
difficulties shown by the planets in hard aspect.  But again, if the issues shown by 
the opposition are confronted, the potential rewards are high.

DISSOCIATE PATTERNS 
A Dissociate Grand Trine occurs when one planet of the triangle falls in 
a different element from the other two.  This can only happen when the 
planets involved are either very near the end or at the beginning of their 
respective signs. Because one of the planets in this configurati9on falls 
in an inharmonious sing, the flow of energy is less stable than the pure 
Grand Trine.  The errant planet introduces a quality of tensions 0 rather 
like a square 0 to the aspect pattern, and offers a greater chance of using 
the planets  collective energies assertively. Dissociate Grand Cross and 
T-Squares are also softer versions of their pure forms.  At least one 
planet in the configuration falls in a different quality to the others, and 
consequently tones down the overall level of tension.  The same 
principles apply to all dissociate aspect patterns.

The Planets 
 
Astrological ly ,  each s ign symbolises  certain specif ic  characterist ics  in 
nature and,  as  the planets move through the s igns,  they st imulate (or 
perhaps s imply ref lect)  reactions in the individual   
 
Each planet symbolises particular sides of your character; for example, Mars stands for 
action and passion, Jupiter stands for fortune and higher thought and so on. Planets are 
located symbolically in the chart: the signs and houses filter their energies through the 
planets.  
 
The Sun passes  through one s ign a month on i ts  annual  passage around 
the Zodiac.   
 
Other planets ,  because they actual ly  orbit  the Sun,  seem to travel  rather 
erratical ly  through the Zodiac.  This  is  real ly  an i l lusion,  generated by our 
changing earthly perspective with respect  to  the planets'  placement in 
their  orbits ,  but  i t  does  have some interest ing effects .  From time to t ime,  
al l  planets  except  the Sun and Moon slow to a halt  ("stat ion") and then 
begin to move backwards through the Zodiac.  This  phase is  cal led 
retrograde motion.  
 
The Planets  can be divided as  under 
 
The Sun and the Moon – also known as the l ights   
 
Inferior planets  namely – Mercury and Venus fol lowed by the  
 
Superior planets  namely – Mars ,  Jupiter and Saturn 
 
The two shadowy planets  –  The Nodes of  the Moon – Rahu and Ketu 
 
The Extra Saturnian planets  namely-  Uranus,  Neptune and Pluto

The Sun, the life-giving heart of our solar system, rules will and individuality. 
It is the core of your potential and uniqueness as an individual: who you are 
and what you are about. It represents the main direction and focus you want 
your life to take and your determination to accomplish what you set out to do.  
 
The Sun's position in your horoscope demonstrates the depth of your personal 
honesty and integrity, the ability to command respect and authority, to 
impress and influence others. It indicates the stamp of your character, the 
deepest flavour of your individuality.

Moon's Nodes 
 
In astrology, the Moon's Nodes are not planets in the strict astronomical 
sense, but rather sensitive points on the ecliptic, where the Moon crosses from 
north to south latitude and vice versa. The body of the "energy dragon" is the 
fourth-dimensional path of the Moon by declination, as she weaves her web 
around the earth. The nodes are commonly known as the Dragon's Head 
(Caput Draconisin Latin), the North Node, and Dragon's Tail (Cauda 
Draconis), the South Node, although in Indian Astrology they are known as 
Rahu and Ketu. The Dragon's Head, a "shadow planet" exalted in Gemini, is 
considered benefic (good), whilst the Dragon's Tail, exalted in Sagittarius, is 
considered malefic (evil) in influence. Their motion is normally retrograde at 
the rate of roughly one degree every 19 days (compare the 19 year cycle of 
lunation); periods of direct motion are therefore considered unfortunate. 

The Dragon's Head (North Node): Rahu 
Rules: Virgo & Aquarius. 
Exalted: Gemini & Taurus.                                      
 Detriment: Pisces & Leo. 
Fall: Sagittarius & Scorpio 
 

Aspects to the North Node concern or affect relationships to prevailing trends, 
attitudes and opportunities. The Dragon's Head represents your karmic 
objectives in this lifetime. It points the way towards soul growth and 
evolution. The sign holding your Dragon's Head reveals the flavour of your 
karma in this lifetime, while its house placement shows the area of life in 
which you need to develop, or become conscious of this karma. Positive 
aspects to the Dragon's Head are generally favourable from the benefics 
(Venus and Jupiter), Sun, Moon and Mercury, whilst sextile or trine from 
Mars, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto also have beneficial effects. Square 
and opposition from the benefics and conjunction, square and opposition from 
the malefics are unfortunate, according to the matters signified by house and 
planet afflicted.

The Dragon's Tail (South Node): Ketu 
 
Rules: Pisces & Scorpio 
Exalted: Sagittarius & Scorpion 
Detriment: Virgo & Taurus  
Fall: Gemini & Taurus 
 
Aspects to the Dragon's Tail display the results of innate unconscious 
tendencies and karmic patterns as they emerge in the life. They tend to be 
separative and destructive. Any aspect to the South Node from any planet is 
unfortunate for matters to do with the house and planet activated thereby. 
Past life hangovers are represented by the position and aspects of the 
Dragon's Tail.

The karmic lessons we have come to experience and overcome in this lifetime 
are expressed by Saturn. He spends around two and a half years in each sign, 
taking about twenty-nine years on his journey through all the signs. Each 
twenty-nine years naturally presents us with the challenge to rise to new levels 
of awareness, or face the consequences of having failed to gain the wisdom 
required so to do.  
 
 

• Denotes necessity for obedience to law. Necessity is the mother of 
invention.  

• Teaches the value of labour, of patience, intelligence and economical use 
of time and material.  

• Without Saturn men would lack bones, teeth, hearing, hair and skin.  
• Saturn protects and limits the soul till it is capable of leaving its earthly 

conditions and entering its spiritual heritage.

Rules: Aquarius 
Exalted: Scorpio 
Detriment: Leo 
Fall: Taurus 
Exalted Degree: 23 Scorpio 
 
 
Principle  :  Individualist ic  freedom, freedom of  self  ego 
 
Urges represented:  urge towards differentiat ion ,original i ty  independence 
form tradit ion 
 
Needs Symbolised :need for social  approval  ,need to rely on one’s  own 
resources and work. 
 
Posit ive expression:  Attunement to truth;  original i ty  Inventiveness ,  
Directed experimentation ,respect  for freedom. 
 
Negative expression:  Wil l fulness ,  rest less  impatience;  constant  need for 
excitement and purposeless  change;  rebel l ion;  extremism. 
 
Uranus, the planet of sudden and unexpected changes, rules freedom and originality. In 
society it rules radical ideas and people, as well as revolutionary events that upset 
established structures.  
 
The personal implications of Uranus in your life are shown by its house position and its 
aspects with other planets in your chart. It describes areas of unpredictability and 
difference. Being highly unorthodox, Uranus identifies the unusual or unique. Friends and 
associations to which you belong are indicated, as is your potential involvement with 
arcane studies, science and technology, computers, and the media.  
 
Uranus, one of the outer, transpersonal planets, takes around seven years to transit one 
sign, or about 84 years to move through all twelve signs. Groups of people with Uranus in 
the same sign are separated by 84 years, so the influence of this planet is primarily 
generational.

Exalted Degree: 3 Cancer 
 
 
Principle  :  transcendent freedom; unif icat ion; freedom from self  ego 
 
Urges represented :  urge to escape from the l imitat ions of  one’s  self  and 
of  the material  world.  
 
Needs symbolised :  Need to experience a oneness  with l i fe  a complete

Negative expression:  Self-destructive escapism ,evasion of   
responsibi l i t ies  and refusal  to  face one’s  motives  and to commit  self  to  
anything.  
 
Neptune, the planet of deception and spiritual enlightenment, rules the oppressed and 
abandoned: the misfits of society. On a higher level it rules visionaries, and those who are 
glamorous and charismatic. It represents spirituality, mysticism, and ideals.  
 
Speaking personally, Neptune's house position and its aspects with other planets in your 
chart will describe spirituality, abstract thinking, illusion, disillusionment, and areas of 
your life where things aren't always what they seem. It rules derangement, guilt, 
persecution and describes the potential for experiences related to confinement, 
abandonment, and addiction or physical intolerance to drugs and alcohol.  
 
Neptune, one of the outer, transpersonal planets, spends about thirteen years in each sign, 
taking around 164 years to move through all twelve signs. Since 164 years separate people 
born during its transit of one sign and those born when it returns, Neptune's significance in 
any sign is described as generational or historical.

Uranus & Neptune: 
 

• Are frequently regarded as malefic, but this opinion is derived from a 
shallow and shortsighted views of character and purpose.  

 
• The evil they bring is caused by the ignoring of their proper purpose or 

by warping their forces into improper hand of activity.  
 

• Both Uranus and Neptune are spiritual planets and act to develop and 
hasten human evolution. 

 
• When an individual’s evolution is retarded Uranus and Neptune act to 

remove the hindrances or obstructions. The hindrances to evolution are 
ignorance, greed, laziness, lust, tyranny, and prejudices. Therefore, the 
institutions, habits or characteristics to which these vices are attached 
are the ones apt to be assaulted or overthrown by Uranus or Neptune.       

 
• Obstinate refusal to consider or apply spiritual principles to the life may 

cause these transcendental planets to act with tremendous malevolence 
in the life, either to limit the life from useless indulgence or to fee the life 
from shackles binding it to useless hindrances. Considered from a 
physical standpoint Uranus and Neptune may be compared to high 
frequency electric phenomenon, requiring for its control extraordinary 
precaution in insulation and proper grounding. 

 
• Neptune’s vibrations are of such high frequency that they tend to break 

down the insulation in the brain cells and nerve fibers of the body unless 
a proper outlet it found for its activities. This is cause of the chaos or 
confusion or frequently ascribed to Neptune.

Posit ive  Expression :  Acceptance of  the need to focus one’s  mind and wil l  
power on one’s  own transformation;  having the courage to face one’s  
deepest  desires  and compulsion and to transmute them through  effort

Negative Experience :compulsive expression of  subconscious cravings;  
wil l ful  manipulat ion of  others  to  serve one’s own ends,  ruthlessly  using 
any means to avoid the plain of  facing one’s  self ;  infatuation with power.  
 
Pluto, the lord of the underworld, symbolises the forces of deep transformation in our lives. 
A slow-moving planet, Pluto's influence is in general most clearly noticeable as it 
distinguishes one generation from the next.  
 
In your personal life, Pluto's significance is found in its house position and the aspects it 
makes to other planets in your chart. Pluto rules intense energy, signifying the areas in 
which you consciously or subconsciously seek to exercise power or control. Pluto, linked to 
your karmic responsibility, also indicates those areas where you need to gain deepest level 
of understanding. the 
 
The outermost known planet in our system, Pluto completes its journey through all twelve 
signs in around 248 years. The period Pluto spends in each sign can vary from twelve years 
to thirty-two years, due to the eccentricity of its orbit.

Planet in Houses 

 
The Sun  
 
In the First ` Ambition and a love of power tend to be well 
supported by good health and vital ity. Add to these courage 
and strength of wil l which may contribute much to success. 
Pride and a keen sense of honour are normally well-developed 
and the disposit ion is l ikely to be masterful with a learning 
towards egotism. Practical capabil it ies, however, usually 
accelerates advancement, bringing recognition and the 
goodwil l of superiors, while cheerfulness and an optimistic 
temperament help to ensure popularity. 
 
In the Second House: Extravagance and a love of ostentation and splendor 
fortunately tend to be counterbalanced by the ability to acquire money easily. 
Another important factor  often is the power to arouse the  interest of those in 
influential positions who consequently may help considerable to further material 
prosperity. 
 
In the Third House: Keen observation and eagerness for investigation increase 
the capacity for educational progress. Science and literature usually have a strong 
appeal. Occupational interests tend to come well to the fore and play a large part in 
the development of the personality. Love of change and travel also often help to 
widen the interests. Relatives may contribute to material prosperity. 
 
In the Fourth House: Filial sentiments and family ties are strong and inheritance 
through the parent is probable. Occupations connected with land or property have 
normally a strong appeal and ability for this kind of thing is marked. Constitutional 
weakness may be a feature of early life and there may be an uphill struggle against 
adverse circumstances. These difficulties tend to disappear in later life. Some 
tendency towards secrecy and a highly reserved temperament. 
 
In the Fifth House: Love of pageantry and social occasions is usually well 
marked, with consequent attention to amusement and pleasure. Charm of 
personality tends to arouse the interest of the opposite sex. Music and drama have a 
strong appeal. It is likely that the family will be limited. 
 
In the Sixth House: Considerable administrative efficiency usually brings well-
paid positions well within reach and success is promised in responsible posts,

T H E  P L A N E T S  T H E I R  A S P E C T S  &  T H E  D E C A N A T E S  

preferably under the direction of others. Liability to frequent changes of 
occupation owing to a feeling of not being sufficiently appreciated. There may be 
some constitutional delicacy and proneness to disease, with slow powers of 
recuperation. 
 
In the Seventh House: Marriage tends to assume considerable importance, usually 
bringing improvement of social status. The marriage partner is likely to be a person 
of exceptional loyalty and magnanimity. Popularity, especially with superiors, is 
another feature which may contribute to early success. Litigation tends to produce 
favourable results, possibly through the kindly interest of the judge. 
 
In the Eighth House : Probability of financial benefit by marriage, although this 
may be dissipated by the extravagance or generosity of the marriage partner. Gain 
by inheritance is likely. The chances of a long life tend to be reduced and in the 
case of a woman there is some likelihood of widowhood. A possibility of 
posthumous fame. 
 
In the Ninth House : High ideals and lofty ambitions go hand in hand as a general 
rule with tolerance and depth of understanding. There is a love of travel and 
probably much attention to matters of a highly enterprising nature. Intellectual and 
scientific pursuits have a strong attraction and there is usually much ability for the 
professions, such as university work, the law, the church the civil service.  
 
In the Tenth House : Success and the ability to hold positions of trust are 
probable, but the benevolent interest of superiors is likely to be another important 
factor. Public recognition may result in election to public office. Or a state 
appointment with considerable responsibility may be made. 
 
In the Eleventh House : Friends and acquaintances, especially those in positions 
of responsibility, may contribute largely to early success and the realisation of the 
ambitions. Social prestige is likely to be enhanced by progress in business, for 
ability to hold executive posts in public companies or societies is probable.   
 
In the Twelfth House : Possibility of conflict with those in authority or 
incompatibility in family life strengthen the inclination for seclusion and a quiet, 
retired life. Those in a superior position are likely to give assistance if necessary. 
Ability for hospital or prison work, or laboratory research is highly probable. There 
may be setbacks during early life and a possibility of estrangement from family 
and friends.

THE MOON 
 
In the First House : Considerable restlessness is usually tempered by n easy-going 
disposition, but love of travel is likely to be strongly marked. A roving existence is 
by no means unlikely. Sociability tends to be a strong feature and there is likely to 
be considerable ability in all those occupations which bring the person into close 
contact with the general public. Thrift may play an important part in the 
accumulation of wealth. 
 
In the Second House : There is likely to be considerable fluctuation in finances, 
although they tend to be on a satisfactory basis. The chief danger appears to reside 
in a marked love of opulence and general extravagance. These tendencies, 
however, are counterbalanced by spasmodic spells of great thrift and devotion to 
the simple life. 
 
In the Third House : Love of change and variety is likely to encourage travel and 
stimulate interest in those occupations, such as newspaper work, in which novelty 
is the dominant element. Publicity may extra strong appeal. Mental activity widens 
the range of the interests, possibly at the price of superficiality. Assimilative 
capacity makes for an easily educated person, but the driving force tends to come 
from imagination rather than intellect. 
In the Fourth House : Family life tends to be an important factor in the 
development of personality and the major interest are usually centered round 
domestic questions. Frequent removals may occur, but gain ca normally be 
expected from houses and land. Financial benefit may also come from inheritance. 
 
In the Fifth House : Inconstancy and unusually fickle affections are linked up 
with a love of gambling and speculation. There may be a rather exaggerated 
interest in amusement and social activities. Fondness for children is usually 
strongly marked and it is highly probable that marriage will result in a large family. 
 
In the Sixth House : Service is likely to be the key to success and the greatest 
benefits tend to come from work in a subordinate capacity. A possibility of some 
material gain from inferiors, although it is for initiative and responsibility likely to 
be limited and the best results will tend to come from work performed under 
direction.  
 
In the Seventh House : Popularity tend to confer success in all dealings with the 
public at large and contributes to social success. Money or property may result 
from marriage and partnerships are likely to prove profitable. Probable interest in 
public life and the ability to hold official positions. Some liability to loss through 
litigation.

T H E  P L A N E T S  T H E I R  A S P E C T S  &  T H E  D E C A N A T E S  

 
In Eighth House : Possibility of money by legacy, or through mother, wife, or 
partner. Several children are likely, though there is a chance that some of them 
may die. There may be some financial losses after marriage or litigation greatly 
reducing the benefits derived from legacies. Considerable respect likely to be 
accorded after death. 
 
In the Ninth House : Strong interest in religious and philosophical questions is 
likely, with a learning towards mysticism. Imagination is usually strong and tends 
to encourage mental changeability. The person often experiences dreams of 
unusual vividness. Much travel, especially by sea, is probable and is likely to be 
productive of gains. Publicity may be centred on the person, possibly in connexion 
with a change of religious opinion which attracts grave censure. Impulse and over-
hasty conclusions may create difficulties in travel. 
 
In the Tenth House : Popularity and prosperity are likely to come from success in 
public ventures. Feminine interest is likely to be aroused and success usually 
comes from occupations in connection with  the public at large. Thrift helps 
considerably in the accumulation of property although there may be some gains 
from external sources. Reversals of fortune, scandal and public censure may result 
from unfavourable conditions.  
 
In the Eleventh House : A wide range of friends brings popularity and success in 
connection with societies, associations and clubs. Women tend to play a large part 
in the life. There is a possibility of danger, however, from self-seeking friends who 
presume on friendship to further their own ambitions. 
 
In the Twelfth House : Home life tends to be favoured or an occupation involving 
seclusion, such as nursing, prison work, or charitable work. There is a liability to 
indulge in clandestine love affairs although these need not necessarily be 
disastrous. The major danger would appear to be deceit, secret enmity and 
treachery.

MERCURY  
 
In the First House : Quickness of wit and mental ingenuity 
tend o be strongly marked making for an argumentative 
disposit ion with considerable resourcefulness and probably 
abil ity as a public speaker. There is l ikely to be vital love of 
knowledge, devotion to study and interest in l iterary pursuits. 
Adaptabil ity is a striking feature, but there is some danger fits 
degenerating into vacil lation and diff idence.  
 
In the Second House : Gain is likeliest to come from Mercurial occupations and 
some form of agency or an occupation in which the person acts as messenger often 
proves highly lucrative. Considerable skill in the handling of money is normally 
another interesting feature Books tend to exercise an inordinate fascination and 
there will probably be considerable expenditure in this direction. Financial loss, 
when it occurs, is likely to come from defective reasoning or unwise speculation at 
the instigation of a friend. 
 
In the Third House : Serenity and an optimistic outlook tend to enhance the 
mental faculties and encourage a love of study. There is likely to be considerable 
practical ability and success is probable in such occupations as journalism, 
teaching, or clerical work. Also in all occupations in which the handling of 
messages figures, such as work as a postman or telegraph clerk. Harmony usually 
characterises dealings with others member of the family and considerable benefit 
may be derive from their assistance. 
 
In the Fourth House : Home conditions are likely to assume undue importance 
and environment may cause much mental disturbance. Instability and frequent 
changes of residence may result. Benefit tends to accrue from occupations such as 
publishing, newspaper work, scholastic work, or the running of registry offices or 
estate agencies. Gain may also arise from study or literary work pursued at home. 
 
In the Fifth House : Refinement tends to be an important characteristic, but 
interests usually centre more around mental activities than sensual pleasures. 
Ability for drama or acting ma be conferred. All occupations, in fact, connected 
with entertainments, theatres, or singing tend to be productive of gain. Children 
usually play a large part in the life and have a special fascination. Where losses 
arise  they may be due to speculation or come through children.

T H E  P L A N E T S  T H E I R  A S P E C T S  &  T H E  D E C A N A T E S  

In Sixth House : Too much mental activity is likely to be the chief source of 
difficulties. There is a liability, under the spur of ambition, to over-tax the physical 
resources and create health troubles. In particular, disarrangement of the nervous 
system may result in digestive disorders. Trouble arising from dealings with 
servants or subordinates also t ends to induce worry. In the main, success is 
likeliest to come from work in a subordinate capacity, such as clerk or assistant. 
Keen interest in dietetics, however, may produce success along these lines. 
 
In the Seventh House : Popularity in literary and scientific circles and 
considerable ability as a public speaker contribute largely to success. Partnership is 
likely to be an important factor in connection with the occupation, especially an 
alliance with a younger person. there is a possibility of marriage to a relative or 
employee, prefaced by much correspondence or travel. Intellect tends to be a 
stronger force than the emotions. There may be much hostile criticism at some 
period of the life an this may result in litigation based upon a libel action.  
 
In the Eighth House : Mercurial occupations in partnership, or some form of 
literary or scientific agency, are the most promising sources of gain. Financial 
benefits may also come by marriage or by a legacy. In the case of the latter, 
litigation is likely to ensue. Questions of finance tend to exercise the mind and 
there may be periodic difficulties n connexion with money. 
   
 
In Ninth House : Travel is likely to be an important factor and the occupation may 
be linked up with it in some way. The power of self-expression is strong, 
bestowing ability for such things as literary or philosophical work, the law, or the 
diplomatic service. Instability is likely to constitute the gravest obstacle to success 
and there is a liability to make frequent drastic changes of opinion with consequent 
re-orientation of the endeavours. This inconstancy is likely to be an element in the 
difficulties which may arise with superiors and legal troubles also are by no means 
unlikely.  
 
In the Tenth House : Resourcefulness and great mental activity are conductive to 
the necessary ability for coping with the contingencies of life. Success in 
publishing, lecturing, or writing and similar pursuits dependent upon the power of 
vivid self-expression is highly probable. In general, however, the maximum 
success results from efforts in a subordinate capacity. Business ability is usually 
strong, with the necessary qualities for public office or posts of responsibility 
under superiors.

IN the Eleventh House : The literary and scientific worlds tend to assume great 
importance in the development of personality and friends drawn from these circles 
usually help considerably in the attainment of success. Intellectual keenness and 
oratorical fervour tend to enhance the reputation in connexion with societies and 
associations, but there is a liability to drift into a hypercritical attitude and to 
indulge too freely in cynicism. Some danger  may arise from slander or treacherous 
friends. 
 
In the Twelfth House : Literary work or scientific research are likely to constitute 
the major interests. Worry and over-attention to trifles are the gravest menace to 
peace of mind and latent mental ability may fail to be developed owing to lack of 
suitable practical opportunities. Travel may be productive of difficulties or slander 
and loss may airse from the family or acquaintances.  
 
VENUS  
 
In the First House : Amiability and a cheerful temperament help popularity and 
there is usually great love of companionship and social life. There may be a 
craving for pleasure and with this is likely to be lined much devotion to the arts, 
especially music and drama. The power of attracting others may be an important 
factor n achieving success. 
 
In the Second House : To natural ability in handling finance is usually added the 
necessary magnetism of personality which ensures the good-will and assistance of 
others. Frinds and associates tend to offer lavish attention and may render possible 
the attainment of lucrative positions. There may be some tendency towards 
extravagance, probably arising from the inordinate interest in clothes, jewellery 
and amusements. Excessive generosity may result in the squandering of money on 
the objects of the affections, but fortunately in most instances inherent prudence 
curbs this tendency. 
 
In the Third House : Interest in literature, music and painting is likely to be 
marked and gain may arise from these sources. Travel is another potential source 
of profit and pleasure. A sunny disposition attracts the interest and affection of 
others and most contacts will tend to be characterised by harmonious relationships. 
This is likely to be particularly marked in the case of brothers and sisters. 
 
In the Fourth House : Domestic environment tends to play a large part in 
enriching the personality and there will be intense love of beautiful furniture and 
home surroundings. Home life usually creates much happiness, especially in later 
years. Gain is possible through  the parents.

In the Fifth House : Social intercourse,  pleasure and amusements tend to be the 
chief centre of interest. Contact with others on terms affection will contribute much 
to happiness and popularity is likely to be an extremely important feature. Interest 
in the arts and practical ability in those branches which encourage social 
intercourse is likely and much gain will probably result.  Another source of benefit 
would be teaching or publishing. Some ability for the successful manipulation of 
stocks and shares is also possible. Happiness in married life and deep attachment to 
children are likely to be other important features. 
 
In the Sixth House : Harmony tends to prevail in occupational matters and smooth 
co-operation with others is likely to facilitate the achievement of success. The 
good-will of both servants and superiors and popularity with fellow workers are 
highly significant and most relationships will consequently tend to be beneficial. 
Health is likely to be good but abuse of the physical resources would be likely to 
result in chronic invalidism.  
 
In the Seventh House : Marriage tends to play an important part, being productive 
of both personal happiness and material benefit, and may take place at an early 
age. Popularity helps in the achievement of success in public life, but successful 
partnership is likely to be an important element. Artistic ability is likely to be 
above the average and there is the necessary charm of personality to gain the good-
will of the public. 
 
 
In the Eighth House : Marriage, partnership and inheritance are likely to be the 
vital issues, being productive either of great benefits or of heavy losses. Personal 
happiness is probable in marriage in spite of the possibility of some 
disappointment in love. Estrangement is likely to be the greatest obstacle. 
 
In the Ninth House : Idealism and sensitiveness to the poetry of life help to 
enhance the charm of personality. Good taste in artistic matters and an intense love 
of beauty tend to have as their complements sympathetic understanding for others 
and great generosity. Religion, particularly the devotional aspect, is likely to 
exercise a strong appeal but it is probable that the practical angle along the lines of 
charitable work will also receive attention. There will probably be a love of travel 
and foreign countries, resulting in both pleasure and pecuniary gain. There is a 
possibility of marriage to a foreigner or in a strange land.

T H E  P L A N E T S  T H E I R  A S P E C T S  &  T H E  D E C A N A T E S  

  
 
In the Tenth House : Popularity, especially with the opposite sex, and a wide 
circle of acquaintances are usually indicative of harmonious contacts in both public 
and private life. Success is likely to be accelerated as a result of the benevolent 
interest of superiors. Marriage tends to improve the social status, but gain may also 
come through the parents. Comfortable financial circumstances permit the 
cultivation of a cheerful and optimistic outlook and the extraction of the maximum 
enjoyment from the pleasure of life. In unfavourable conditions there is likely to be 
frustration in the social life arising from the contempt of superiors, possibly 
enhanced by the consequence of a hasty marriage. The absence of favourable 
opportunities for the full development of natural talent is likely to be the gravest 
obstacles to advancement.  
 
In the Eleventh House : Friends tend to assume great importance and interest 
centres round social contacts. The interest and assistance of others is usually 
present in the endeavours and there is little likelihood of efforts being made in 
isolation. The danger lies in the treachery or insufficient ability of associates and 
the possibility of being used for other ends. 
 
In the twelfth House : Some secluded occupation is l ikely to 
suffer the maximum possibi l it ies of gain, or work of a rather 
commonplace nature. There is a tendency to indulge in 
clandestine love affairs, with the consequent dangers of 
scandal and estrangement. Social ostracism may be the 
outcome of malicious slander on the part of secret enemies. 
Love affairs tend to reach an unhappy cl imax and there is a 
tendency to marry someone of inferior social standing.    
 
MARS  
 
In the first house – courage, confidence , enterprise and industriousness are 
usually the salient attributes. Marked administrative ability and speedy execution 
of projects tend to ensure early success. In favourable circumstances strong 
passions are kept in hand by a firm will. Natural energy and physical endurance  
may have to brought into play to counteract the effects of an inherent tendency to 
rashness and foolhardy recklessness. Trouble may arise from careless neglect of 
ordinary health precautions or abuse of physical resources. There is a proneness to 
feverish disorders and accidents are likely to be precipitated by impulsive actions.

T H E  P L A N E T S  T H E I R  A S P E C T S  &  T H E  D E C A N A T E S  

 
 
 
In the Second House : Individual effort is likely to be the greatest  factor in the 
acquisition of wealth and money tends to be a big incentive to endeavour. 
Occupations connected with the use of fire or machinery are likely to be productive 
of the maximum pecuniary benefit. Generosity may be carried to the point of 
extravagance and there will be a strong liability to squander the earnings. Money 
may also come through inheritance, but expenditure will always tend to be heavy 
and although much money may pass through the hands little of it will remain. 
Frequent financial disaster is possible, but recovery will tend to be swift and losses 
rarely depress. 
 
In the Third House : Mental alertness and executive ability, backed by initiative 
and resourcefulness, facilitate early success. A critical, even carping, disposition, 
however, may alienate the sympathies of others and create a state of isolated 
endeavour. An argumentative disposition and violent dogmatism tend to be 
productive of frequent quarrels, especially with relatives or neighbours. 
Correspondence is often the medium for disputes. There may be a possibility of 
accidents during short journeys. 
 
In the Fourth House : Aggressive acquisitiveness is likely to stimulate efforts to 
accumulate wealth and possessions, but personal endeavour may be supplemented 
by inheritance or gain by marriage. Domestic disturbances are highly probably and 
home  life may be marred by frequent quarrels. There is some danger of accidents 
or fire in the home. Possibly, theft. Land or property may tend to be a constant 
source of annoyance and worry. An unruly disposition tends to create nervous 
disorders, especially in the shape of digestive trouble. 
 
In the Fifth House : Love of sport is likely to be well developed and there will be 
much attention to pleasure. Interest in the opposite sex will tend to be strong, but is 
balanced by a capacity for loyal companionship. Leadership is likely to be the 
dominant principle, well supported by excellent disciplarian capabilities. Gain may 
come through speculation, amusements, sport, or by the exercise of the power of 
leadership, especially in connexion with teaching. Inconstancy tends to be the most 
blatant fault. Children would probably be unruly, causing disappointment and 
anxiety.

In the Sixth House : Energy and industriousness facilitate promotion to 
responsible positions, but efforts should be in connexion with some large concern 
where they are under the control of a superior. Individual effort tends to have less 
chance of success. There is a liability to trouble and quarrels with the employer or 
with fellow workers. The major successes tend to be in occupations of a 
mechanical nature, dealing with metals, or connected with medicine. Exceptional 
vitality tends to strengthen the powers of recuperation, but there is a liability to 
feverish disorders, inflammation and accidents sustained in the curse of the 
occupation. 
 
In the Seventh House : An impetuous temperament tends to precipate an early 
marriage but benefit usually results. The marriage partner often is a person of 
strong and forceful character, with great energy and a love of domination. Unless 
mutual tolerance is exercised there may be consequent friction and considerable 
incompatibility of temperament. There is frequently a liability to arouse the  
opposition and criticism of others, thus creating unnecessary friction which may 
mar social relationships.   
 
In Eighth House : Pecuniary gain by marriage, legacy, or partnership is highly 
probable. Litigation would tend to result in benefit. In unfavourable conditions, 
however, these things are equally liable to be productive of loss. There may also be 
unusual susceptibility to accidents and health may be endangered by feverish 
troubles. 
 
In the Ninth House : Religion is likely to be a focusing point of attention either in 
the shape of zealous support or philosophical antagonism. Mental alertness is 
stimulated by a love of change and there is likely to be considerable fondness for a 
roving existence. Excellent capacity for propaganda work tends to ensure success 
in political life, in legal work, or in missionary activities. A somewhat contentious 
nature may degenerate into fanaticism. Religious apostasy and general inconstancy 
of purpose may result from indifference and scepticism. Disagreements with 
relatives are possible. Travel may be marred by frequent mishaps or a hostile 
reception may be encountered when in strange surroundings.

In the Tenth House : Driving ambition is fortunately usually backed by 
inexhaustible energy and vitality. A masterful temperament in alliance with 
exceptional executive ability permits the surmounting of  obstacles in the way of 
success. Courage and independence may result in social prominence or activity in 
the political sphere. All occupations using sharp tools (and this includes such 
things as surgery and dentistry), engineering and work in connexion with fire and 
the metals are conductive to success. There is a possibility of inheritance from the 
father, but there is some danger of friction due to a domineering attitude which 
resents authority or restraint. Undue assertiveness and an autocratic manner may 
rouse the enmity of others and introduce and element of strife into social contacts. 
 
In the Eleventh House : Capacity for social leadership and enthusiastic pursuit of 
pleasure usually help to attract a wide circle of friends, particularly among people 
interested in sports and energetic activities. There may be some tendency to undue 
sensitiveness or touchiness likely to produce frequent disputes or over-
ambitiousness may lead to disagreements and frustration. 
 
In the Twelfth House : Considerable administrative ability usually produces 
success in institutional employment or in estate management. There is some 
possibility of persecution or slander at the instigation of secret enemies, with 
conseque4nt loss of reputation. Disagreements with subordinates may be another 
unwelcome feature and there is a liability to suffer imprisonment or restraint. 
 
JUPITER  
 
In the First House :  Urbanity and a generous, honourable disposition inspire 
respect, but there may be a tendency to self-righteousness. There is likely to be 
considerable love of pleasure, especially travel and outdoor pursuits. Executive 
ability normally bestows the power to hold positions of responsibility and 
administrative importance. Occupations connected with banking, the law, shipping, 
medicine and the civil service are likely to bring success. Self-indulgence, 
especially in the shape of gluttony, ma lead to blood disorders. 
 
In the Second House : Financial talent and the ability to accumulate wealth are 
frequent marked characteristics and there is a possibility of amassing great wealth. 
Considerable power may be exercised through financial influence.

T H E  P L A N E T S  T H E I R  A S P E C T S  &  T H E  D E C A N A T E S  

 
In the Third House : An optimistic temperament and philosophical turn of mind 
often enable the maximum benefit to be derived from educational facilities. 
Popularity, especially with members of the family and neighbours, may also result. 
Travel and correspondence may be important factors in the development of 
personality and publications are likely to enhance the reputation. 
 
In the Fourth House : Domestic environment is frequently of great importance 
and home conditions will play an important part in shaping the character. Parents 
often contribute much to success and there is a possibility of inheritance through 
them. Business affairs will tend to evolve on a sound basis with the prospect of 
material prosperity as life advances. Gain through land or property is highly 
probable. Extravagance or ostentation may be the greatest factors in sapping the 
resources. Where home conditions are adverse, success may only be possible in a 
flesh environment. 
 
In the Fifth House : Social success is highly probable and friends may bring not 
only pleasure, but material benefits. Gain by speculation is possible and there will 
probably be keen interest in horse-racing and betting. Success in teaching or by 
publishing activities frequently occurs. Children tend to confer much happiness 
and there is a strong possibility of a large family. Dangers are likeliest to arise 
from excessive gambling, over-attention to pleasure at the expense of occupation, 
and friction with children. 
 
In the Sixth House : The ability to inspire respect and the willing co-operation of 
subordinates and fellow workers is an important factor in ensuring success. A 
capacity for loyal service is another invaluable attribute. Health is normally good. 
Success may come through work in connexion with medicine or dietetics. 
 
In the Seventh House : Marriage and partnership are likely to confer great 
benefits and result in material gain. The assistance of friends and acquaintances is 
usually of great importance and co-operation is frequently rendered easy by unique 
ability in conciliating opponents. Success in the: Natural benevolence and a 
philosophical outlook professions, especially law and the church, is probable. 
There may be some delay in marriage, or friction resulting from it, or difficulties 
may be created by misplaced confidence in an associate. 
 
In the Eighth House : Gains are most probable through marriage, legacy, or 
partnerships although the occupations will also produce material benefits. 
Litigation is often unsuccessful and tends to result in losses.

In the Ninth House strengthen the tendency towards religious interests. Mysticism 
is often a characteristic, but the general inclination is towards orthodoxy and 
established principles. Tolerance and broadmindedness, however, in doctrinal 
issues tend to inspire general respect. Travel is conductive to gain. There is usually 
the ability to hold high office in church or state. Arrogance and extremism are the 
faults most likely to be indulged. 
 
In the Tenth House : Public office, possibly a sinecure, is likely and the 
occupation will tend to bring material prosperity and social prestige. Gain is also 
probable through inheritance. Great nobility of character tends to inspire universal 
esteem. Certainly, the ability to hold a position of considerable responsibility tends 
to be a normal feature. Unreliability, however, may produce reversals of fortune 
and the diminution of prestige. 
 
In the Eleventh House : Wealth and influential friends tend to facilitate  the 
realisation of the ambitions. There is likely to be much love of social life and 
consequent popularity. Successful children may be a gratifying feature. The chief 
danger, however, lies in the attraction of undesirable parasites as friends. 
 
In the Twelfth House : A philanthropic disposition and kindly interest in schemes 
for the amelioration of others often result in success in institutional work. Lavish 
donations to relieve indigence may be a feature. Willingness to help others is often 
reciprocated by willingness on the part of others to offer assistance if required. 
Indolence or poor health may result in improvidence necessitating the acceptance 
of shelter in some charitable institution. 
 
SATURN  
 
In the First House : Industriousness allied with patient persistence and self-
control is usually sufficiently marked to ensure success. Self-confidence is 
normally justified by sound, practical ability. A penetrating mind makes for 
shrewdness, while moral stability guarantees steadfast loyalty to a cause. There 
may be some aversion for responsibility, possibly due to timidity generated by self 
repression. 
 
A tendency to secretiveness and suspicion may result in unpopularity. Gloominess 
and frustration are often the outcome of a perpetual struggle against adverse 
circumstances. The early loss of one of the parents may react  badly on childhood. 
 
In the Second House : Business acumen, thrift and prudence contribute largely to 
the accumulation fo wealth, but the process of acquisition may be slow. There is a 
possibility also of gain by inheritance. Parsimony may result from what is often a

bitter struggle to gain money and there may be inability to take full advantage of 
the material benefits presented. Losses by bad investment, speculation, or business 
failure are by no means unlikely. 
 
In the Third House : A serious and penetrating mind, well capable of 
concentration usually induces the qualities of tact, justice and honesty. These 
attributes may, however, be vitiated by thwarted education in youth, resulting in 
indifference and indolence. Misunderstandings with members of the family and 
neighbours are likely to be common. There may also be trouble or loss through 
travel or correspondence. Frequent disappointments may inculcate a habit of 
gloomy foreboding and despondency. 
 
In the Fourth House : There may be some gain through land or houses, but in the 
main home life tends produce cares, deprivations, and a need for the imposition of 
strict discipline. Domestic trouble is likely to be a marked feature. Parents may 
occasion sorrow or there may be difficulties attendant upon inheritance. A craving 
for seclusion is likely to characterise the later years. 
 
IN the Fifth House : Speculation, especially in houses, lands and mines, tends to 
be favoured and there is a possibility of holding public office, preferably in the 
educational sphere. Trouble in connexion with a love affair, or an attachment to an 
older person, is possible. Children may occasion sorrow. 
 
In the Sixth House : Success is likely to come in a managerial capacity for there is 
usually considerable ability for the tactful handling of people. Quiet discipline is 
normally  marked characteristic. There may, however, be some friction at times 
with subordinates and trouble arising from them. There may even be difficulty in 
obtaining employment. The powers of recuperation tend to be slight and ill-health 
may degenerate into chronic invalidism, there being a liability in particular to 
rheumatism and colds. 
 
In the Seventh House : Marriage is likely to be delayed and will probably be to 
someone of more advanced years, possibly a widow or widower. Loyal co-
operation is likely to characterise the union and material benefit may ensue. There 
is a possibility of surviving the marriage partner. Trouble and loss may arise 
through litigation or treachery on the part of associates. 
 
In the Eighth House : Marriage plays an important part in improving or reducing 
the chances of prosperity. The major gains, however, are likely to come from hard 
work and sustained effort. Some danger to reputation and the disfavour of 
superiors may be threatened. Where health is good, long life is usually likely.

In the Ninth House : Strong orthodox opinions on religious and philosophic 
questions usually make for the right temperament to hold an official position at the 
head of a college or institution. There is also likely to be strong ability in a judicial 
capacity. Narrow-minded bigotry and self-deception tend to be the commonest 
faults. Trouble is likely to arise from travel, foreign countries, or litigation. 
 
In the Tenth House : Self-reliance and ambition, backed by determination and 
perseverance tend to characterise the self-made man. Strong moral qualities and 
sound business capacity encourage the holding of prominent posts with great 
responsibility. Organising ability is likely to be strong and is often spurred on by a 
desire for social prestige. The grave danger is likely to come from the use of social 
prestige. The grave danger likely to come from the use of questionable methods, 
overstepping the ambitions, and dishonourable conduct, resulting in exposure and 
ignominious downfall.      
 
In the Eleventh House : A few and faithful friends are likely to give valuable 
assistance in the shape of sound advice based on experience. Older friends, 
possibly wealth people, will materially assist misplaced, bring trouble and scandal 
and there is some danger of being used as a tool by self-seeking acquaintances. 
 
In the Twelfth House : A secluded existence is likely to be the outstanding 
characteristic and life may be connected with some official post in an institution 
removed from contact  with the public. There is some danger from prolonged 
illness or imprisonment may be threatened. By temperament there is likely to be a 
craving for solitude and seclusion. 
 
URANUS  
 
In the First House : Originality and independence of spirit are often the 
outstanding characteristics, even to the point of eccentricity. 
 
There is a strong love of freedom and hatred of control. Willfulness is usually well 
marked and the manner may be brusque. Intellectual interests exercise a strong 
fascination and there is a strong interest in new ideas. Self-satisfaction and a 
hypercritical superciliousness towards others are likely to be the most common 
faults. Restlessness strengthens a natural strengthens a natural love of risk and 
adventure. Inventive ability to be highly developed and there is usually, 
considerable skill in occupations connected in any way with electricity or radio. 
There is likely to be some proneness to nervous disorders and colds. 
 
In the Second House : Restlessness and instability are perhaps the most striking 
characteristics. Fantastic expenditure and extravagance are likely to imperil the

finances. The unexpected will always tend to enter in, and there is some danger of 
unforeseen losses. There may also be some difficulties created by tactlessness. 
 
In the Third House : Intellectual and intuitional faculties tend to be good and to 
bestow ability for dealing with new ideas and inventions. Eccentricity may be a 
feature. Erratic conduct often interferes with stable education. A love of movement 
and travel is often also connected with a liability to strange mishaps and adventures 
when travelling. There may be a breaking of family ties and quarrels with other 
members. Possibly estrangement. 
 
In the Fourth House : Frequent changes of residence are likely and there may be 
a strong love of unconventional methods of living. An antagonistic environment in 
early life may retard progress. There may be a danger of disinheritance. The 
occupation may bring worries, arising from trouble with employers and superiors. 
Domestic life will tend to be perpetually marred by disputes and disturbances. 
 
In the Fifth House : Unconventional views on social relationships and interest in 
progressive ideas are likely to be strongly marked characteristics. Utopian idealism 
and altruistic love of humanity end to be distinguishing features. Inconstancy in 
matters of the affections and unconventionality in conduct may produce social 
vexations. Gain would tend to come through publications or speculation.  Conflict 
with authority is by no means unlikely. Children tend to be few and may cause 
considerable anxiety. 
 
In the Sixth House : Irritability and brusqueness of manner may account for 
difficulties with superiors and fellow workers. There may be a disposition to 
obscure occupational diseases and not infrequently trouble from nervous disorders. 
The temperament is highly-strung and there may be some susceptibility to psychic 
experiences.  
 
In the Seventh House : Incompatibility of temperament and inconstancy in 
matters of the affections are likely to create difficulties in marriage with 
consequent estrangement. In any event, marriage tends to be hasty and the 
romantic element is often well to the fore. Eccentricity and erratic conduct are 
likely to be strongly marked, with danger of scandal if in a public position. 
 
In the Eighth House : Sudden and unexpected gains are probable, through 
marriage or partnership. There may be, however, worry and anxiety in connection 
with a legacy, and probably litigation. Death often tends to be sudden. 
 
In the Ninth House : Independence of mind is well developed, but may tend to be 
somewhat iconoclastic. There is some liability to crankiness, especially in the

direction of fanaticism or anarchism. Religious apostasy may be a feature. There 
are likely to be long journeys, probably with trouble in some form or another. 
Exploration and pioneering in connection with the development of new countries 
are likely to have a strong appeal. 
 
In the Tenth House : A vital love of freedom and abhorrence of restraint intensify 
the independence and unconventionality of  the personality, but often create 
difficulties with those in authority. Considerable ability, however, on original lines. 
Best results are obtained by work unfettered by external supervision. Inconstancy 
gives a love of change and there will be little  likelihood of permanency of 
occupation. A rather revolutionary outlook and contempt for the conventions may 
result in estrangement from family and intimates. Some danger of incurring public 
disfavour by the advocacy of advanced ideas. 
 
In the Eleventh House : Friends are likely to belong to advanced circles and their 
originality and creative thought will often help considerably in moulding the 
personality. The danger is that friends may be too eccentric to be reliable and 
treachery is by no means unlikely. 
 
In the Twelfth House  : Research work and private endeavour are likely to be their 
most productive lines of action. Treachery on the part of others, however, is likely 
to endanger the reputation and may result in exile or confinement. Sudden and 
unexpected misfortunes tend to occur and nervous troubles may be intensified by 
psychic experiences. 
 
NEPTUNE  
 
In the first House : Aesthetic and psychic powers are likely to be well developed 
and the temperament may tend to be rather visionary and unpractical. Extreme 
sensitiveness tends to intensify latent mysticism. There is likely to be much 
devotion to the arts, especially poetry and music but the character t ends to be 
weakened by natural indolence and inconstancy. Instability, sensuality and 
deceitfulness may vitiate conduct. 
 
 In the Second House : A love of luxury tends to produce financial extravagance 
and there is often little practical ability in the handling of money matters. There is 
some danger of loss through fraud. All occupations associated with the sea, 
hospitals, institutions and diplomacy usually led to success and there is normally 
considerable ability in these directions.  
 
In the Third House : The world of illusion and dreams tends to exercise an 
inordinate fascination and there is a liability to live very much in the imagination.

Fiction has a strong appeal and there may be some ability on the creative side in 
this field. There is often a strong sense of companionship and possibilities of 
success in public contacts, especially through public speaking. Frequent journeys 
by sea may be undertaken. There may be some susceptibility to hallucinations, 
obsessions and morbidity which tend to be reflected in the use of low cunning in 
action. 
 
In the Fourth House : Harmony tends to prevail in domestic matters and the 
spiritual ties liking the family are likely to be strong. Deception and unhappiness, 
however, are possible and the home circle may be broken up. Frequent changes of 
residence may take place and there will probably be considerable travel. House s 
and land tend in the main to be productive of gain. 
 
In the Fifth House : Love of luxury and entertainment is likely to be a strong 
characteristic and there is a possibility of over-indulgence in pleasure. There are 
likely to be good returns from investments, especially in shipping, oil, or anything 
with aquatic affinities. Business losses are usually occasioned by fraud or 
deception. Faithlessness in  matters of the affections is by no means improbable. 
 
In the Sixth House : There tends to be a love of solitude and a secluded existence. 
Indolence or deceit on the part of servants may create difficulties. There will 
probably be considerable capacity for the service of humanity, but efforts will be 
limited by a liability to ill-health, possibly arising from sensuality and self-
indulgence. 
 
In the Seventh House : Companionship is an important factor in marriage, but 
there is likely to be some danger from fickleness and inconstancy. Domestic 
relationships may be marred by deceit and there is a liability to suffer scandal. 
Moral laxity may damage the reputation. Two engagements or marriages are a 
possibility. 
 
In the Eighth House : There tends to be considerable fluctuation in financial 
prospects, but marriage usually brings gain. Money often comes from totally 
unexpected sources. Losses will tend to result from fraud or deception. Some 
susceptibility to swooning or trances and abnormal sensitiveness to the action of 
drugs and anesthetics. 
 
In the Ninth House : Mysticism often has a strong attraction and the aesthetic 
sensibilities are exceptionally keen. Intuition and imagination are strong factors in 
the personality. There is usually a love of travel and much of it, but it may be 
productive of difficulties and legal complications.

T H E  P L A N E T S  T H E I R  A S P E C T S  &  T H E  D E C A N A T E S  

In the Tenth House : High aspirations coupled with capacity for leadership may 
bring fame. Irresponsibility, however, and lack of method may make it difficult to 
secure permanency in any occupation. There may be inheritance through the 
parents, but there is some danger of the home being broken up with subsequent 
estrangement. Fraud, deception and dishonesty may result in public scandal and 
dishonour. 
 
In the Eleventh House : An attractive disposition tends to create a wide circle of 
friends, but many of these are often unstable and may even be actively treacherous. 
Too much susceptibility to the attractions of others may lead to deception and 
fraud. Friends not infrequently are the cause of financial loss or damage to the 
reputation. 
 
In the Twelfth House : Success in quiet occupations such as private agencies, 
institutional work, or investigational activities is frequent. A love of seclusion, 
however, tends to encourage clandestine friendships. There is some danger of 
unpopularity and scandal arising from deceit or secret enmity.

General Notes on the Group:  
 
Posses strong convictions coupled with great physical courage. 
Audacity is the keynote of their whole personality and they are 
supremely ambitious and keenly enterprising.     
  
The inevitable complements of their qualities are a tendency to 
reckless and extravagances of ideas and actions. They tend to 
give too free expression to their impatience of those slower than 
themselves and to become irritable on slight provocation. 
Obvious egotists,  they are inclined to boast of their own 
capabilities at times.  
 
They have sufficient confidence and aggressiveness to make them 
exceptionally successful in executive positions where their 
independence of outlook is a strong asset.  Speaking generally, 
they do best when in competition with others.  
 
Physical dangers center round the head and there is some 
liability for them to suffer from such complaints as neuralgia, 
insomnia, and eye troubles.  
As a general rule,  their occupation should be connected in some 
way with the use of fire or meals.  Engineering or mechanical 
work involving the use of tools (and this may include even such 
things as surgery) are eminently suitable. But they also do well 
as pioneers in such activities as retail  business organization.  
 
Represented Mars - the ancient god of war & aggression. An 
afflicted Mars influence /  fosters tension and accidents. It rules 
over fire and danger.

THE DECANATES OF ARIES 
 

 
Decanate I: ( 00 – 100) 
 
These are people with strong characters and very clear ideas of 
what they want in life,  backed up by excellent administrative 
ability and considerable fertility of ideas. Highly competent 
people, they find their ideal occupation in the public service and 
often shine in such professions as teaching, the law, medicine, 
and literature. Friends usually contribute much to the 
development of their personality and they gain a great deal from 
the free exchange of ideas. 
 
Decanate 2: (110 - 200) 
 
Highly ambitious people with excellent organizing ability, these 
are nevertheless the type of individual who tends to be carried 
away by impulse. Although generous to a fault they love to 
domineer over those in contact with them and their masterful 
personality may at times limit their sympathy for others. In their 
case the choice of an occupation should make allowance for the 
development of the wide range of their interests and their 
marked creative ability. Certainly, they are conspicuous by 
virtue of their vitality and remarkable powers of recuperation, 
but they need to be on their guard against the force of their 
emotions that may exert too much sway at times. 
 
Decanate 3 : (210 - 300) 
 
Success is easy for this group of people if  only they make full  use 
of their outstanding intellectual capacity. Danger for them lies in 
the fact that emotional issues tend to clog their mental processes 
and consequently they definitely need to concentrate on rational 
and logical thought. Great successes could be theirs in the 
service of some worthy ideal and it is essential for them to get 
their efforts rightly directed. Once mental discipline has been 
attained they make rapid strides.

Each year, when the Sun passes into Aries, it is known as vernal equinox. The Sun 
enters Aries at the vernal equinox, as he crosses the equator on his northern 
journey from out of the tomb of winter. 
In the fall, or autumnal equinox, the sun enters Libra and begins his southward 
journey. Equinoxes – Equinoctial points in the zodiac is when the sun enters the 
sign Aries and Libra. The planetary aspects and configurations at these times are 
very important in the consideration of disease and health as they are very sensitive 
points in the Zodiac. 
 
The planets in this sign will be coloured by the  qualities of self-will, urge for 
action and self assertion.

Transit of Sun: 21th. April – 20th.May 
 
General Notes on the Group:  
 
Represented by Venus-Roman goddess of Beauty and art, pleasure, emotions. 
 
Stabil ity and constructiveness are the dominant features of the 
personality. Highly methodical and persevering, great rel iance 
can be placed upon members of this group and they are 
usually characterized by honorable dealings, especial ly in al l 
money matters.  
 
The danger is that stabil ity may drift into stagnation and 
strength of character become mere obstinacy. Love of 
conservative ideas tends to mar their vision and to discourage 
init iative. 
 
Thoroughness is a marked characteristic of al l their work but 
there may be some deficiency of discrimination and an 
undeveloped crit ical faulty. There is great danger of estimating 
solely on a material ist ic basis, but where sheer doggedness 
and solidity are desirable these folks are supreme. 
 
Physically there is a tendency to put on too much weight and 
there my also be some trouble connected with the throat. 
 
In occupational matters their constructive abil ity should be 
given free play. They do well in al l types of building and also 
in such things as business connected with clothing, 
confectionery, or jewellery. As might be expected, agriculture 
also often offers them excellent prospects of success.

THE DECANATES OF TAURUS 
 
Decanate I : ( 00 – 100 )  
 
Highly practical, these are the people who can always be rel ied 
upon. In fact, they are if anything too conscientious and 
steady. They do possess, however, the abil ity to get on with 
others easily and when it comes to a question of tackling a 
problem on sound l ines and planning the details of a scheme 
they come into their own. It takes a great deal to distract their 
attention from their goal and they achieve results by sheer 
dogged persistence. 
 
Decanate 2 : (110 – 200 ) 
 
Complexity of personality is very marked in these folks but 
usually their ideas manifest themselves in a logical sequence 
and in spite of the many elements in their make-up they 
manage to achieve a scientif ic outlook. Highly sensit ive 
intel lectually, they have l itt le diff iculty in evolving a practical 
philosophy of l ife and are particularly good at handling the 
large issues involved in dealing with the public as a whole. 
Advertising, business, and the general satisfaction of public 
needs give them the best scope of the development of their 
special talents. 
 
Decanate 3 : (210-300 )  
 
This group possesses both creative and administrative abil ity 
of a high order and is capable of development on many sides. 
The best results are obtained by keeping the personality on the 
broadest possible basis and avoiding special ization in any 
particular groove. In spite of conspicuous clarity of vision in 
external questions, they tend to under-estimate their own 
abil ity and there is consequent need to guard against a 
tendency towards an Inferiority Complex. Coupled with this is a 
l iabil ity to take the l ine of lest resistance and, speaking 
generally, wil l-power needs strengthening.

General Notes on the Group:- 
 
Versati l ity and quickness of perception are the outstanding 
characteristics of these markedly ingenious and resourceful 
people. They possess a highly developed crit ical faculty  wel l 
grounded on a sense of proportion. Both mentally and 
physically they are remarkable for their sensit iveness to 
external phenomena and their ready understanding of people 
ideas engenders in them a charm of manner which endears 
them to al l with whom they have contact. 
 
Their very versati l ity and bri l l iance, however, tend to make 
them somewhat inconsistent and unstable and they are lacking 
in the more solid virtues of concentration and determination. 
The multipl icity of their interests may lay them open to he 
charge of disloyalty and certainly them  are rarely constant to 
an single deal. 
 
Their adaptabil ity holds promise of success in a variety of 
interests and provided they seek to avoid the fatal tendency to 
superficial ity which besets them they are capable of developing 
a highly selective and analytical intel lect. 
 
Lung troubles and affl ict ions connected with the muscles and 
bones appear to be their chief physical dangers. 
 
In occupational matters they are obviously happiest in careers 
which give scope for the display of their versati l ity. Literature 
may bring them success. Linguistical ly they are highly gifted . 
teaching , travel, and the less pedestrian form of salesmanship 
offer imagination and give opportunity for the exercising of 
mental dexterity.

THE DECANATES OF GEMINI 
 
Decante I (0-10) 
 
The crit ical faculty which characterizes Gemini folks as a whole 
is particularly marked in the case of these people and they 
tend to develop a rather legal cast of mind. Keen appreciation 
of the needs of their fel lows helps them to cope with almost 
any kind of situation of their fel lows helps them to cope with 
almost any kind of situation and the few fai lures they meet 
with are more l ikely to be due to laziness than to any lack of 
abil ity. Independence is the keynote of their character and 
their efforts should be as free as possible from external 
supervision. Thoughtless extravagance is somewhat 
counteracted by real genius in making money, but f luctuation 
tends to be the predominant feature of their f inancial 
arrangements. 
 
Decanate 2 (110-200) 
 
A certain instabil ity of temperament marks these people who 
are far too easily swayed by the impulse of the moment. Much 
depends upon environment and wise choice of fr iends in the 
development of the personality as their peculiar sensit iveness 
makes them highly susceptible to outside influences and 
control. When not under the domination of their feelings or 
prejudices they have a keen appreciation of the importance of 
facts and a rather scientif ic cast of mind. By temperament they 
are particularly f itted to caster for the needs of the public and 
their power to estimate the qualit ies of others brings them 
success by the right choice of associates.

Decanate 3: (210 – 300) 
 
Friends and associates play an important part in the lives of these people for they 
are essentially intensely sociable and hospitable souls. Contacts should, however, 
be on a basis of equality for they tend to resent supervision and do far better when 
directing their own efforts without control. Both mentally and mechanically highly 
gifted, they are capable of tacking most kinds of work with success but their real 
field lies in creative effort. For instance, scientific invention and the Arts owe 
much to members of this group. Travel satisfies a fundamental need of their nature 
but they need to curb the feeling of restlessness of which they are often the victims. 
Success will depend upon their ability to concentrate on their principal objectives.

Danger: Prone towards accidents while traveling , especially by air. Their fickle 
nature also tends to arouse unexpected anger in others, the depth of which 
Geminians are misjudged. A Gemini weakness is superficiality; too quick to grasp 
an idea or size up a situation – tendency to skin its surface, not bothering to explore 
it in any depth., but can make marvellous initial impression with little preparation.

Transit of the Sun  : The Sun enters this sign at the summer solstice 21st June – 
20TH. July 
 
The moons govern emotions and intuitive behavior. Ruled by Moon and Water as 
its elements - like the shifting of the tides of the ocean,- the sign of powerful forces 
moving under the surface which is quite difficult to penetrate - the array of 
defenses that hide their true and deep feelings. Like the hard outer shell that 
protects the soft, vulnerable flesh underneath, Cancerians are crusty, gruff and 
grumpy, but possess a proverbial heart of gold – a sentimental softie that makes 
sacrifice for someone in need.  
 
General Note on the Group: 
   
Imaginativeness and sensit ive understanding lead to wide 
sympathies in the l ives of these people who often become 
social reformers in the van of humanitarian progress. Generous 
and patient in contact with others, they are noted for their 
devotion to their ideals.    
 
The danger is that idealism may remain only a fair dream 
unsupported by active effort in the realism of practical affairs. 
Over sensit iveness may produce morbidity in them leading to 
procrastination and timidity in the face of realit ies.  
 
In spite of sympathy and a wil l ingness for self-sacrif ice for the 
common good, their attitude may be marred by rather negative 
outlook based upon disl ike of radical change. Although 
persistent in pursuit of their ideals they tend to prefer a rather 
conservative l ine of action and innovations often fai l to appeal 
to them.  
 
Of rather delicate constitution, they tend to suffer form 
nervous exhaustion, but specif ic troubles are usually localized 
in the stomach or kidneys.

The sea has a great attraction for them and any profession 
connected with it wil l naturally have a deep appeal for them. 
Many find success in those professions which are based upon 
the handling of l iquids in some form or another. Their chief 
sphere, however, is probably social activity either in the form 
of entertainment or in institutional work, for contact with 
others in a vital necessity in al l their undertakings.      
 
THE DECANATES OF CANCER 
 
Decante 1: ( 00 – 100) 
 
Love of organization dominates these people and polit ical 
activity often attracts them with excellent results. They are 
capable of great personal devotion to a cause and their 
intel lectual abil ity makes them invaluable in the guidance of 
great movements. Discouragement born of lack of appreciation 
of their efforts is their great drawback and they are l iable to 
indulge too much in unjustif ied self-pity. Co-operation with 
other active personalit ies in the service of - an ideal is the 
best road to personal satisfaction. When efforts are not 
harnessed to some specif ic cause, the people display 
considerable talent for l iving by their wits and invariably they 
are outstanding by their strong and clearly-defined 
individuality.  
 
Decanate 2: ( 110 – 20)  
  
The dramatic instinct is strong in these people and they have 
remarkably good power of self-expression, both in speech and 
writ ing. Highly inventive, their deals are usually on a sound 
and constructive basis and once they have accepted the 
necessity for a l ine of action achievement is easy for them. 
Attention should be given to the development of latent talents 
and the creative urge needs to be indulged wherever possible. 
Music, drama, l iterature, or the many branches of invention, 
have a strong appeal for them and in these thing they have the 
power to excel.

counteract the voracity of their intel lect and prevent 
dissipation of their energies over too wide a field it is essential 
for them to cult ivate the habit of concentration on one thing at 
a time.  attention to trivial ideas and activit ies may produce 
superficial ity and cynicism and it is of supreme important that 
their effort should be direct to worth-while ends.

General Notes on the Group: 
 
Leo is under the ruler ship of the Sun. the ambitiousness of 
this type is well justif ied by their natural abil it ies. Sound and 
practical in their ideas, they have supreme administrative 
abil ity. The optimism of their general outlook and the 
magnanimity of their whole personality lead them to a tolerant 
and humanitarian view of things. 
Their own innate abil ity may produce in them a desire to 
dominate over others and despotism becomes fatal ly easy for 
them. With love of posit ion comes love of the trappings of 
posit ion, and ostentation is often one of their weaknesses. 
Rather pompous at t imes, they cl ing to established ideas and 
tend to revere the past at the expense of the present.  
 
Bold and magnanimous, however, they are characterized in the 
main by a generous outlook and tolerance of the ideas of 
others. Frankness is the breath of their being and they abhor 
intrigue, always performing to fight in the open. The strength 
of their personality invariably commands the respect of those 
about them.        
 
The heart is usually the center of any physical disabil ity they 
may have and they tend to suffer when in i l l  health from such 
things as palpitation or feverishness.  
 
Obviously cut out for leadership, they do best in executive 
posit ion, particularly in the civi l service. The financial world 
attracts many of them and here; also, they have the abil ity to 
achieve success. The law is another valuable field for their 
endeavors.

THE DECANATES OF LEO 
 
Decanate 1 : ( 00-100) 
 
A strong sense of responsibi l ity in conjunction with real 
organizing abil ity makes these people invaluable in al l f ields of 
practical activity. They have sound creative capacity coupled 
with a good intel lectual sense of values which spurs them on 
to improvements on the existing state of affairs. Advertising, 
publishing, travel, buying and sell ing, control of business , 
come well within their capacity and if scope is given for their 
sense of the dramatic they make rapid progress. 
 
Decanate 2 : (II-20) 
 
Personal effort counts for much in the success of these people 
who are usually prepared to throw their whole personality into 
the realization of their ambitions. Actuated by high ideals, they 
have a strong sense of public service and excel at handling 
people in the mass especial ly when their creative abil ity can be 
brought into action. Of a rather philosophical cast of mind, 
they have a strong realization - of the l inks which bind them to 
other and their efforts are best directed over a wide range of 
people. 
 
Decanate 3 : ( 21-30) 
 
Natural force of character in these people is heightened by a 
strong sense of the dramatic coupled with real practical abil ity. 
They also do best in public service especial ly in the spheres of 
entertainment, showmanship, or publicity. Their own high 
standard constantly drives them on to further effort and desire 
for perfection is always a powerful motive with them. The urge 
of personal ambition, however , is usually the predominant 
force and they are always ful ly conscious of their own 
superiority and capabil it ies.

General notes on the group: 
 
Virgo is under the ruler ship of the planet Mercury. 
These are the crit ics who shine by their powers of acute 
discrimination and insight. Their intel lectual dexterity and the 
versati l ity of their whole personality, in which intuit ive 
faculties play no small part, bestow upon them the abil ity to do 
well in most f ields of activity. The speed of their reactions 
both mentally and physically gives them an advantage and in 
their case quickness of brain is al l ied with cleverness of hand. 
Their intense love of activity makes for industriousness in 
practical effort while the alertness of their interests leads to 
charm and understanding in their contacts with others.    
 
Egotism is their chief danger and self ishness may cut them off 
from sympathy with others and cool their affections, if not 
controlled by high principles their crit ical faculty may 
degenerate into mere hypercrit ical officiousness and there is 
always the danger that the richness of their mind may be 
productive of a rather tortuous subtlety. 
 
Intense love of detail and a healthy skepticism are the 
distinguishing features of this type of mind which prefers to 
concentrate on the world of ideas rather than of action. To 
some extent this preoccupation is necessitated by the physical 
fragil ity which characterizes them and there is constant need 
for the analysis of which it is so eminently f itted.  
 
Digestive and nerve troubles are l ikely to demand attention 
and are closely l inked up with the general characteristics of 
the whole personality. 
 
Science, l iterature, psychology, and all activit ies dependent 
upon the power of discrimination – from craftsmanship to 
statistical analysis – are suitable fro these people but, 
generally speaking, in spite of their remarkable mechanical 
ski l ls they do best in intel lectual pursuits.

THE DECANATES OF VIRGO 
 
Decanate I:  ( 00 – 100) 
Their sound sense of values is happily al l ied in these people 
with the necessary ski l l  to achieve them and there are few 
ambitious that fal l outside the range of their capacity. 
Intel lectual discrimination renders them particularly f itted for 
such professions as l iterature, science, or high finance but the 
tendency is for them to succumb to a rather material istic form 
of appeal. Right direction of the abil it ies is for them of 
supreme importance for they have immense potential it ies.  
 
Decanate 2 : (110-200)   
Highly creative pursuits with an intel lectual basis appeal to 
these people but the emotions play a large part in colouring 
their ideas. There may be some tendency for feelings to warp 
the naturally excellent judgment and there is consequent need 
for them to aim constantly at a strictly objective viewpoint. 
Movement and variety is an essential need of their nature and 
this is a desire which should be gratif ied. 
 
Decanate 3 : (210-300)   
Again the intel lectual angle is strongly marked, but in this case 
the stress l ies on executive abil ity rather than creative effort. 
The sound crit ical faculty makes for success in such things as 
study, teaching, banking, or statistical work. There is some 
need, however, for the general quickness of reaction to be 
tempered by mature judgment and these people need to be on 
their guard against acting on the impulse of the moment. 
 
Key Concept: Spontaneous , Helpful , Humility and need to serve. 
Key Concept: spontaneous helpfulness, humility, and need to serve. 
Parts of the body: the nervous system and the intestine. Virgoans are prone to 
illness caused by stress nervous tension; particularly susceptible to ulcers. 
 
Maladies:  Colic obstruction, Coldness, Worms, Cholera, Constipation, 
Malnutrition, Slender in youth but there is a tendency towards corpulence of body, 
particularly that part ruled by Virgo- abdomen.

put themselves first and selfishness in one of their negative traits. 
 
Like its opposite sign; it is a Cardinal and Positive Sign so it has the outgoing 
activity and self-expressiveness which would be expected of this Quadruplicity. It 
is also the Second of the Air signs, so this combines with the moving 
communicativeness (Gemini) and the intelligence (Aquarius) connected with that 
Triplicity . Air is the medium of connection between all people, and on it are 
carried the words of speech. 
 
Lord/ Ruler: Venus - Goddess of love & beauty, when rising in libra gives artistic 
ability. Venus rules pleasure, social pursuits, art & adornment. influences and 
inclines forward to self-indulgence and love of luxury.

General Notes on the Group:  
 
Libra is under the ruler ship of the planet Venus. 
 
A judicial mind backed up by a keen and inquiring intel lect is 
the primary characteristic of these people who are remarkable 
for their impartial ity and love of justice. Essential ly seekers 
after Truth they strive constantly to bring order out of chaos. 
In spite of a find loyalty to their ideals there is nothing rigid 
about their views although they do insist upon methodical 
treatment of facts. 
 
Impartial ity and suspended judgment may procure occasional 
hesitation bordering on actual cowardice and this is their chief 
disadvantage. Faced with an important issue they tend to 
prevaricate and inaction often becomes their greatest vice. To 
this is al l ied a measure of sensuality which manifests itself 
either in love of ostentation or in excessive sentimentality. 
 
Tact is essential ly strongly marked in these people and they 
are highly persuasive, having the abil ity to present the many 
sides of a problem in al l their complexity. Obsession with the 
material factors of a situation may tend, however, to bl ind 
them a t t imes to the wider issues and they suffer from the 
l imitations commonly associated with the judicial type of mind. 
 
Physically, their weak point is l ikely to be some form of kidney 
trouble or diabetic trouble, but they very quickly respond to 
correct treatment.

In occupational matters, the Law obviously offers them 
excellent prospects of success. Their sense of form and design, 
however, gives them power to excel in the arts, especial ly 
wherever these qualit ies are predominant. Diplomacy, 
government activit ies, and the financial world are other 
suitable spheres. 
  
 
 
THE DECANATES OF LIBRA 
 
Decanate I :  ( 00-10  ) 
 
Immense adaptabil ity and the abil ity to get on easily with 
other people is a great asset to these folks who can often 
attain their ends by tract and persuasion when other methods 
fai l. They have the power to think in terms of large groupings 
of people so that if not actually engaged in the Law as a 
profession they should certainly enter public service in some 
capacity or another. The creative instincts should not be 
neglected, however, and if actively developed, these people 
have the abil ity to do well in artistic work such as decoration 
or catering for the needs of the public at large. 
 
Decanate 2 : (110-200) 
 
The soundness of their judgment makes these people 
invaluable when in control affairs. A good many of their talents 
may, however, sti l l  be latent and it is important that dormant 
abil it ies should be cultivated. Financial abil ity and staying 
power make for success, particularly when their natural 
quickness of perception and apprehension is rightly directed. 
The emotions tend to suffer by the excessive development of 
the intel lect and there is a consequent l iabil ity to inhibit ions 
which needs to be counteracted.

SCORPIO 
 
IT IS THE EIGHT SIGN OF THE ZODIAC 
 
The Sign of the Investigator 

 
Symbol : Scorpio is symbolized by the scorpion and the eagle. 
The scorpion – secretive, deadly creature that can poison its 
enemies and its string is often fatal. Scorpio gives the death 
sting and then the soul soars away l ike an eagle to its airy 
home. The scorpion is the symbol of the lower mind and the 
eagle of the higher mind. hence it is the house of 
transformation. 
 
    glyph : The pictograph is the stinger of the scorpion 
connection to a representation of the human reproductive 
organ. In ancient time it was the symbol of the phoenix, a bird 
of immortality and regeneration. the curved l ines and the 
arrow represent strong emotions tied to practical ity and aiming 
towards higher consciousness. 
 
Classification: Fixed / Water / Even / Feminine / Of Long Ascension / Rising by 
the Head 
 
Principal: Transformation , Sex Force , “ I DESIRE “ 
 
Opposite Sign: Taurus - is a sign of possession and owning 
and the native wants of possess, collect and do not let go what 
belongs to them. 
 
Scorpio sign of Inheritance & legacies has a sense of purpose 
and destiny. f inds truest happiness in dispensing their l i fe-
force to others.

Like its opposite sign, this is a f ixed and negative sign, so in it 
seem to have the same desire to remain f irm in conviction and 
set ways ; but this is second of water signs, so the 
combination of such fixity is with the emotionality of this 
tripl icity. Water has been described as unstable. Hence a 
Scorpio person is often at war with himself in this utterly 
contrary mixing of two trends in his very deep nature. His 
negativity appears as depth of character and reserve of force. 
Lord/ Ruler: Pluto – ancient god of the nether world and of 
the dead. Mars : same energy and init iatory force of Aries and 
emphasizes the “war within himself” which is the most 
unavoidable matter in l ife. Pluto rules regenerative forces and 
the beginnings and ends of the phases of l ife. 
 
Exaltation  : Uranus 
Fall   : The moon 
Detriment : Venus 
 
Transit of Sun: 21st. October – 20th.November  
 
General Notes on the Group: 
 
Scorpio is under the ruler ship of the planet Mars. 
Fixity of purpose all ied with thoroughness of execution makes 
of these people highly efficient individuals capable of tackling 
even the most formidable problems. The intensity of their 
courage is fortunately tempered by a wise measure of caution 
which saves them from the extremes to which their r igid 
determination might otherwise bring them. Great responsibi l ity 
can safely be laid upon them for the are thoroughly l iable in al l 
their undertakings. 
 
The very strength of their character makes for certain 
weakness chief among them being a certain degree of 
callousness towards the feelings of others. There may be a 
corresponding tendency towards suspiciousness in most 
relationships and they tend to be rather indifferent too the 
normal human feelings and reactions.

Their thoroughness bestows upon them a rather scientif ic turn 
of mind which is, however, capable of being led thoroughly 
astray by faulty judgment. Rather reserved, they easily fal l 
into the danger of secrecy while their native caution tends to 
cramp their init iative considerably. 
 
In connection with health they need to guard against ulcers 
and nasal catarrh. 
 
By temperament they are primari ly f itted fro work of an 
investigational nature, from research work to police detection. 
Surgery, chemistry, statistical work, and even a mil itary career 
are all suitable. 

 
THE DECANATES OF SCORPIO 
 
Decanates I : ( 00–I00)  
 
Strong well-power in their case is at once an asset and a 
l iabil ity for there is a strong tendency to fly to extremes and 
determination degenerates into sheer obstinacy. They have 
considerable powers of leadership, although not of a 
spectacular nature, and complete confidence can safely be 
placed in them. Their logical mind approximates to infal l ibi l ity 
when dealing with concrete values and they have marked 
administrative capacity on rather conventional l ines. 
 
Decanate 2 : ( II0-200) 
 
Service is the ideal of this folks who have remarkably keen 
perception of the needs of their fel lows. They succeed best in 
the professions, such as medicine, law, teaching, where they 
often display a very appealing originality in their method of 
approach. Highly observant, they are keenly assimilative of 
experience and travel and study are vital ly important in the 
development of their personality. Certainly, their efforts should 
never be isolated and they succeed best when working with 
others for a common end.

their emotions. When not swayed by feeling they have 
considerable intel lectual force and clarity of vision which

Transit of the Sun 21st. November – 20th.December  
 General Notes on the Group : 
 
Sagittarius is under the ruler ship of the planet Jupiter. 
Vital ity is the dominant characteristic of these people who 
figure largely in the ranks of sportsmen. Their independence of 
outlook based on unshakeable honesty endears them to others, 
while their own mental vigour and frank enthusiasms inculcate 
in them unquenchable optimism. 
 
Over-confidence is their principal danger and they tend to be 
led astray far too easily by intemperate enthusiasms. Volati l ity 
of spirit makes them somewhat undependable and they tend to 
be in constant revolt against accepted ideas and practices. 
Over-indulgence in sporting interests is possible and there is a 
danger of engendering a rather quarrelsome spirit, constantly 
on the offensive. 
 
To counterbalance these faults, they can plead their 
imperturbable good-nature and the general kindliness of their 
intentions. Highly colourful, the flamboyant note in their 
personality is well sustained by a keen intel l igence, often 
spurred on by ambition. 
 
All outdoor occupations are eminently suitable for them, but 
their rather philosophical cast of mind also promises success in 
the teaching profession, the Law, the ministry, and all 
professions connected with oratory. Banking is another suitable 
occupation for, strangely enough, they have marked financial 
abil ity.

THE DECANATES OF SAGGITARIUS 

 
Decanate I : ( 00-100) 
 
Few things escape the attention of these people whose 
curiosity is constantly on the alert.  Diversity of interests is, in 
fact, perhaps their most striking feature. Fortunately, they 
have real intel lectual strength and extraordinari ly acute powers 
of perception which enable them to escape the superficial ity 
which usually results from diffusion of interests. Once their 
somewhat intemperate exuberance is curbed  they make good 
leaders and certainly they do well in professional work on 
markedly intel lectual l ines. 
 
Decanate 2 : ( 110-200) 
 
Hatred of restraint and routine is the animating force in these 
people. Perpetually in search of the new, they tend to be 
rather too easily satisfied with the external diversity of things 
and to become  dangerously di lettante in their efforts. Their 
vital curiosity is often null if ied by lack of sufficient 
concentration to pursue an interest to a conclusion. To offset 
this, they have considerable artistic sensibi l ity al l ied with 
manual dexterity which permits them to produce results with a 
minimum of effort. They have a real sense of service in many 
cases and their greatest asset is their abil ity to understand 
others and get the best out of them.

Emotion plays a large part in the l ives of these people and 
sensationalism has a very strong appeal for them. There may 
be a tendency to nurture inhibit ions.  This emotional 
sensit iveness is balanced by really sound intel lectual keenness 
and these people usually do well in such things as advertising, 
l iterature, sell ing and creative work. The best results in every 
case come from stressing the highly individualist ic angle. Like 
others of this group, they have much skil l  in handling people 
and usually gain much from their contacts with others. In fact, 
the stimulation of others. In fact, the stimulation of other 
personalit ies is vital ly essential for the ful l development of 
their character and potential it ies.

CAPRICORN 
 
Capricorn is the tenth sign of the zodiac and is affiliated 
to the tenth house. 
 
The Sign of the Achiever 
 
Symbol : The mountain goat- a sure footed animal who is able 
to ascend the heights by taking advantage of every foothold. 
     
 
 Glyph : the pictograph represents the v shaped beard of 

the goat and the curved tai l of f ish(sea goat). it also 
pictures the human knee and the circular knee cap. In symbolic 
terms: two straight l ines meeting one another, connected by a 
circle and a crescent. this represents the welding of authority 
and responsibi l ity that is strength both by energy and passion. 
 
Principal: Responsibi l ity , Caution, - “ I USE “ 
 
Opposite Sign: Cancer - the sign of domesticity and home 
l ife. They derive security from the love and closeness and 
mates of family members. 
 
Capricorn governs reputation, career, standing in the 
community. its natives seek honour, praise and approval in the 
world at large, but tend to be emotionally reserved in personal 
relationship. 
 
In Cancer, the cardinality is combined with water, but now it is 
combined with earth. hence , as with Taurus and Virgo, there 
is a practical application and concrete applications to  
everyday necessit ies of l i fe. The negativity shows itself as an 
abil ity to withdraw from the rush of l ife and wait for the right 
t ime.

General Notes on the Group:  
 
Capricorn is under the ruler ship of the planet Saturn. Ambition 
is often the driving force in the personality of these folks 
whose l ives are usually directed on well-discipl ined l ines. They 
possess the power of concentration to a marked degree and 
usually attain their ends by virtue of sheer persistence and 
dogged industriousness. Thrifty, tactful, loyal, they possess 
essential ly stable personalit ies. 
 
Introspection, with its attendant gloom and probable bigotry, 
is their gravest danger. Strong in their own convictions, they 
tend to be intolerant of opposit ion and utterly ruthless when 
human claims confl ict with the attainment of a specif ic end. 
They are l ikely to be somewhat narrow-minded in outlook and 
to be singularly lacking in sympathy for al l outside the l imited 
range of their interests.

The power of concentration bestows upon them terrif ic driving 
force along set l ines and they are capable of meticulous 
attention to detail. They make excellent organisers although 
their cautiousness tends to l imit the range of their enterprises. 
Violently egotistical, they tend to build their l ives on a 
fatal istic conception of the order t\of things. 
 
Cramp, particular rheumatism, toothache, and skin or hair 
diseases are the usual forms in which physical troubles beset 
them. 
 
All types of routine work and organisation give them scope for 
the exercise of their talents. They do well in any kind of work 
demanding discipl ine and also in such things as agriculture, 
mining and state management. 
 
THE DECANATES OF CAPRICON 
 
Decante I : ( 00-10) 
 
Strength of character is rendered more noticeable on account 
of considerable power of self-expression. Outstanding talent 
permit them to rise above the level of their original 
environment and eminence in some direction or another is 
almost inevitable. They tend to have rather too much 
veneration for the established hierarchy and to accept material 
value as the self criterion in estimating worth. Public work on 
strictly practical l ines is their best f ields and they have 
considerable administrative abil ity which is invaluable in the 
furtherance of constructive proposals.

Decanate 2 : ( 110-200) 
These people fortunately have the complexity of their 
personality balanced by a good sense of proportion which 
serves to keep their activit ies on fair ly steady l ines. They do 
best when in co-operation with others, and  partnership in 
some form is desirable for them so as to establish some form 
of control over the vagaries of their impulse. Personal feeling 
predominates far too much with them as a motive for action 
and there is need for an intel lectual check. They have 
considerable abil ity in handling others with efficiency and they 
do best when their efforts are directed towards the common 
good. 
 
Decanate 3 : ( 210-300) 
 
Absolute devotion to the work on hand makes these people 
singularly forceful in action. Their career usually means a great 
deal to them and they are always anxious to figure in the 
public eye. Fortunately, their ambition is usually based on 
service to the public well- being and they make excellent 
public servants. Public welfare, health, and community 
development have a special appeal for them and good 
cit izenship ideal behind their activit ies.

unexpected, innovation and modern science. the awakener and 
the rebel, it brings a fight within the self  
 
Uranian independence and conventionality seem completely at 
variance with the Saturnian caution and steadfastness. but on 
closer examination, who is more set in his ideas and 
determined that no one shall deflect him from his purpose that 
the typical revolutionary.

Fixity, as before, betokens a firm resolute Nature, insistent on 
keeping to its own way of decided self-expression (posit ive). 
as with other fixed sign, it is hard to move from its pre-
conceived ideas. a persons with the predominance wil l be 
fateful to his commitments and to his friends. 
 
this is now the third of the air tripl icity, so the 
communicativeness of air is dividend. this special 
communicativeness of the Aquarian is by way of bringing a 
carrier of information and ideas and a disseminator of such 
ideas through groups of people rather than mainly through 
writ ing and teaching, as with Gemini or through personal 
contact, as with Libra.     
 

Exaltation   : Uranus   
Fall    : 
Detriment   : The Sun  

 
Opposite Sign : Leo the sign of pleasure, affection and love 
affairs. they look for fun and good times to make themselves 
happy. they need close ties with others and need to dominate 
in love affairs. 
 
Aquarius is the sign of hopes and dreams, friends and wishes. 
they tend to be idealistic, humanitarians who are friends with 
the larger issues of the world. but remain personally detached 
in their own relationships. It is the sign of the future, of the 
visionary, some say of astrology itself.  
 
The planet Uranus is strong in this sign and Aquarius is 
considered the most spiritual sign - the sign of “the son of 
man” symbolized by the water pouring - pouring out blessings 
and alleviation upon humanity.”  
 
Combination of f ixed element (persistence) and air element 
(intel lect and communication) under the influence of the planet 
of change.. Hence Aquarians are l iberal and progressive. yet 
f ixed in opinion.

Transit of the Sun: 21st. January – 20th.February  
 
General Notes on the Group : 
 
Aquarius is under the rulership of the planet Uranus. 
Humanitarianism in the ful lest sense actuates these people and 
their stabil ity of character is well founded on scientif ic and 
tolerant view of people and things. Complete sincerity, patient 
understanding, and easy friendliness ensure harmonious 
contacts for them and help them to maintain their tranquil ity in 
the face of even the most adverse circumstances. 
Their calmness occasionally sinks into mere dreaminess, 
however, and spirituality may rob them of decisiveness and the 
abil ity to cope practical ly with a concert situation. Over-
conscientiousness may result in worry over tr if les and also in 
too heavy taxing of the energy in an attempt  to cope with 
widely diffused interest. Emotionally, they tend to alternate 
between skepticism and sentimentality and thus to destroy the 
stabil ity which should be the foundation of their personality. 
 
They are highly inventive with excellent reasoning faculties, 
and in fact, typify the scientif ic mind at its best. Their 
tolerance and generous outlook al low them to adopt a 
supremely optimistic view point and harmonious relationship 
are invariably their goal. Speed of decision and rushed 
activit ies are total ly antagonistic to their temperament so that 
they do best when functioning in a tranquil atmosphere. 
 
Over-sensit iveness generally is their chief physical drawback 
and they tend to suffer from nervous trouble or blood 
disorders arising from faulty circulation. 
 
Intricate scientif ic work or humanitarian enterprises have an 
overwhelming appeal for them, but al l activit ies based on the 
use of electricity and such things as aviation and radio come 
well within their range and they often find their maximum 
satisfaction in one or other of these branches.

THE DECANATES OF AQUARIUS  

 
Decanate I : ( 00-100) 
 
The power of leadership together with creative talent in a high 
degree characterizes these people whose enthusiasm for 
constructive ends carries them far. The only major obstacle to 
their success would appear to be their tendency to self-
indulgence but once this is curbed they have terrif ic driving-
force, based largely on a sense of superb showmanship. 
Literary and scientif ic pursuits constitute their major interests. 
 
Decanates 2 : (110-200) 
 
Exceptional intel lectual talents mark these people off from the 
crowd for they are special ly gifted in the understanding of 
history, polit ics and the handling of human affairs generally. 
They have a high standard of personal rectitude and sufficient 
magnetism of personality to elevate them into natural leaders. 
They love to engage in a variety of interests but are always 
prepared to devote time and energy to the thorough 
comprehension of any subject which appeals to them. They 
have a remarkable gift of teaching others easi ly which makes 
of them active disseminators of ideas well to the fore in 
intel lectual circles. 
 
Decanate 3 : (210-300) 
 
Love of learning coupled with sensit ive reactions to 
environment makes these people remarkably rich in 
personality. They would benefit by cult ivating concentration as 
a means to soundness of judgment as they tend to suffer 
somewhat from diffusion of their interests which distracts 
attention from essentials. They are particularly ski l lful in 
conveying ideas and sensations to others and usually 
contribute largely to the widening of common human 
experience. Their marked artistic sensit iveness to which is 
al l ied considerable administrative abil ity enables them to exert 
much influence on the development of affairs.

related to the 12th house. 
  
The Sign of the Dreamer  
 
Symbol: Two fishes tied together, swimming in opposite 
directions, signifying hidden depths, shift ing emotional 
currents, complimenting desires and extremes of temperament. 
 
  Glyph: pictograph represents two fishes tied together.  crescent moons 

connected by a straight line  representing emotion and higher consciousness tied to 
and limited by the material world.

Mutable indicates an abil ity to make changes without feeling 
annoyed and  to adapt to circumstances. the mixture is with 
water, with its instabil ity, makes this most f luid of al l signs. 
 
The negative ness gives an inwardness, which is more marked 
than in the others. It has a hidden ness and a depth, which are 
hard to fathom. This water is the water of the sea, boundless, 
infinitely deep, clam at times on the surface, yet capable of 
sudden changes to the wildest of storms. It is inoffensive at 
the first sight, but with undercurrents which are subversive 
and dangerous.

It is sign of drinks, dissipation, debauchery and self-undoing. 
 
Ruler / Lordship : is jointly rules by Jupiter and Neptune. 
Neptune is strong in this sign, as Pisces and Neptune rule the 
sea .Neptune is the ancient god of the sea, discovered in 1846. 
it is a planet of i l lusion, glamour, mystery, deception, etc.  
 
Jupiter brings expansion and jovial ity. Neptune, the dreamer 
and researcher for intangible brings an emotional and idealist ic 
side of nature. the expansion is noticeable as an extremism, a 
bountifulness, a lack of putting l imits to anything. the clouds 
of mists of Neptune are as a veil. hence the jovial ity of Jupiter 
is often a veiled to hide the ready tears of Pisces.

These are the idealists who are fired by the power of 
imagination. Their warmth of heart and supreme magnanimity 
widen their sympathies and noble principles have a special 
appeal for them. They love to l ive on a romantic scale and are 
particularly susceptible to colour and movement. Inspiration 
and intuit ion play a great part in directing their actions with 
the result that they tend to l ive on a sl ightly more exalted

The price they pay for their idealism is a certain 
imperviousness to ordinary standards of value which tends to 
render them hopelessly impractical in the conduct of normal 
affairs. Their ideas often lack coherence and they have a 
violent antipathy to concrete action which may in practice have 
all the appearance of sheer laziness.  
 
Their hypersensit iveness tends to cause them an unnecessary 
amount of worry with resultant timidity and diff idence in 
contacts.  
 
Their imagination and sensibi l ity, however, make of them an 
essential ly artistic type and they have not only great creative 
gifts but the abil ity to fire others.  
 
They are the romantics constantly striving to escape from 
sordid reality into the blessed land of their of their dreams. 
 
They are particularly addicted to heart or l iver trouble and may 
be worried by cold and influenza more than is usual. 
 
They inevitably do their best work in occupations giving scope 
for imagination such as l iterature, philosophy and rel igion. 
Marit ime pursuits also appeal to them and many find 
expression for their romanticism in the entertainment  world. 
 
THE DECANATES OF PISCES 
 
Decanate I : (00-10) 
 
Self-consciousness may be a great stumbling-block for these 
folks The tend to be over-awed by reverence for tradit ion and 
this may l imit the expression of their own original ideas. The 
full use of their very keen intel lectual faculties and vital 
emotional reactions tends to be inhibited by an inferiority 
complex, but if the can escape this they have the power to 
produce more than normally good results, particularly in 
artistic matters.

Decanate 2 : (11-200) 
 
These people tend to be animated by a vital desire for 
expansion and they  usually explore  many avenues before 
settl ing on the goal towards which all their energies are to be 
directed. The search for perfection may produce considerable 
restlessness and instabil ity of ideas, but fortunately they 
possess the power to devote their attention to routine 
activit ies on grounds of expediency while sti l l  searching for the 
elusive ideal. Once their goal is clearly defined, they have the 
necessary abil ity for rapid success. 
 
 
Decanate 3 : ( 210-300)  
 
Complexity of personality is the most vital characteristic in 
these people and they indulge in much emotional activity 
below the surface of their normal activit ies. Any career for 
them must satisfy both the spiritual and the material needs of 
their nature and they usually discover the best outlet for their 
talents in such pursuits as philosophy, psychology, travel, 
publishing, or the arts. 
 
They are intensely interested in human nature and in the social 
and economic developments of the past. There is a need for 
impulse to be tempered by logic but when they have gained 
mastery of their emotions, they usually have terrif ic driving 
power. 
 
Parts of the body: The feet and the toes  
 
Maladies: They have beautiful shaped yet sensit ive feet but 
are unfortunately prone to aches, bunions, corns, etc. 
Addiction to drinks, improper blood circulation, Careless 
personal hygiene
