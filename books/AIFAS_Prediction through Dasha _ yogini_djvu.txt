FOREWORD 


Prediction is the chief objective of Predictive Astrology. A learned astrologer has to 
make study of the three different parts of a horoscope - 1.Yoga, the combination of 
planets and Lords, 2. Period-sub-period i.e. dasha, 3. Gochar thatis, transit. All the 
three parts are the supplements of each other. Yoga is the most important among all 
the three parts. Period-sub-period i.e. dasha may prove to be futile if there is no Yoga 
in a horoscope. For example, Period-sub-period cannot bless a native with a child if 
there is no Santan Yoga in his horoscope. Dasha might be of Lord of fifth house or of 
Karaka planet. Likewise, Gochar too cannot do anything if there is no Yoga in a 
horoscope. So, all the three parts are essential to have the result. 


Inthe book, | have tried to put what | have learnt by experience. My views might not be 
approved of the scriptures, but it does not mean that the scriptures are wrong of 
erroneous. | do respect all the rules mentioned in the scriptures. But experience has 
got its own importance. For example, according to the scriptures, exalted planets 
render benefic results. But in practical life, it has been experienced that the said planets 
prove to be unable in rendering favorable results. Take one more example. In winter, 
Sun proves to be pleasing, whereas the same Sun is scorching in summer when itis 
exalted. It is the need of the hourto ponder over the matter afresh. Learned astrologers 
should express their views in black and white, which will be beneficial for the society 
we live in. 


In the book a study of only one of the said three parts has been mentioned and that is 
vimshottari dasha. Maharshi Parashar has mentioned 43 Dashas in his "Brahat 
Parashar Hora Shasira.” But here in this book the Vimshottari Dasha has been 
mentione elaborately in particular, which is used extensively. Besides, the Ashtottari 
and Yogini Dashas have also been narrated briefly. 


The book has been composed keeping in view the problems of the students of All 
India Federation of Astrologers’ Societies on the inspiration of Mr. Arun Kumar Bansal, 
President of the Federation. Ithas also been kept in view that the book may prove to 
be useful for the other students of Astrology. Itis up to the students to decide how for | 
have been successful in composing the same.

Chapter-1 


Period: An analysis 


The soul is immortal. It moves on from body to body and thus the cycle of life and death 
keeps going on. The soul becomes active despite being inactive, dependent despite 
being indepent and limited despite being omnipresent soon after it enters into a new 
body. It also feels happiness and sorrow though it is passionless and immutable. All 
these deformations are indicated in the horoscope of a native at the time of his birth. 
The bondages resulting from one's deeds (Karmaanubandhans) are shown by the 
Yogas in a horoscope. The Period shows as to when the results of Yogas will come 
out. The Vimshottari Dasha is the main among all the dashas. 


The main Period of a planet is called Major period. In Major period its division is 
called Sub period. Division of Sub-period is called Pratyantardasha, Updasha or 
Vidasha. Further the division of Pratyantardasha is called Sdokshmadasha or 
Faldasha. The division of Sookshmadasha is called Pranadasha. Thus the Major period 
can be divided up to Pranadasha with which the time can be calculated up to 
Pranadasha. The lord of Major period is called Mahadashanath. The lord of sub-period 
is called Antardasha nath. 


Vimshottari Dasha : It is also known as Nakshatra dasha. 


The maximum limit of life is 120 years in this Dasha. This period of 120 years has 
been divided into Period years of the planets and they (the planets) have been kept in 
the following order. 

Period of Sun 6 years 

Period of Moon 10 years 

Period of Mars 7 years 

Period of Rahu 18 years 

Period of Jupiter 16 years 

Period of Saturn 19 years 

Period of Mercury 17 years 

Period of Ketu 7 years 

Period of Venus 20 years 


Dasha Prediction 1 


This Period can be calculated according to the birth star of a native in the following 
manner. 


Method of Period processing (Sadhana): 


The constellation in which the Moon happens to be posited at the time of birth of a 
native, is called birth star i.e. Janma Nakshatra. First, a counting from Krittika 
constellation to birth star is made and then the sum total is divided by 9. Remainder is 
kept as shown in the above table. Major period happens to be of the planet, which 
comes to be known after counting. 


For example, a native was born in Anuradha constellation. ‘It comes to be 15 after 
counting from krittika. (If counted from krittika, Anuradha falls on 15). Now, if 15 is 
divided by 9, 6is the remainder. Saturn falls on the sixth place from Sun after counting. 
So, it is Major period of Saturn. 


Drawing out the Bhukti and Bhogya period 


Planets are moving, so each planet has its own degrees i.e. longitude. To calculate the 
remaining period of a planet i.e. Bhogya Dasha, we take the longitude of Moon and 
see on which nakshtra she is posited and. It is also observed that how many degrees it 
has gone ahead in the constellation (calculation of a planet is made according to the 
placement and transit of it on a constellation by degrees). The measure of a constellation 
is 13°20' i.e. 800 minute. An example can be cited to make it clear. Suppose that the ' 
Moon is at 3 Rashi 9°00. According to constellation calculation, the Moon is in Pushya 

- constellation and Saturn is the lord of Pushya constellation. Therefore, it will be the Saturn 
Period of the native at the time of his birth. Pushya constellation starts from 3°-20 and 

“ remains upto 16°-40. 


Longitude of Moon = 9.00 Cancer Pushya Nakshatra starts from 3°-20 the Moon has 
travelled in Pushya Nakshatra 9°-0-3 °-20=5-40 ! 


p \ Dasha Prediction 


To calculate the remaining period of a planeti.e. Bhogya dasha, we take the period of 
the Janma nakshatra planet in our case it is Saturn whose period is 19 years. The 
measure of each nakshatra is 13° 20 i.e. 800 minutes. Suppose at the time of birth 
Moon is in Cancer sign, Pushya nakshatra at 9° longitute. 


The Moon has transited 5°-40' of Pushya constellation. The remaining saricd of Saturn 
can be learnt by these Bhogya degrees. ; 


Example: 

Ifthe phase of constellation is 13°-20'/800 minutes, then the Period of Saturn =19 
19 

| 200 
Ifitis 5°-40' i.e. 340 minutes then the Period +2 = = 8.075 

.. the Moon has travelled = 8 yr. 00 m. 27 days 


Ifitis 1 minute 


Remaining period to be trvelled = 19 yrs /8 hrs- Om 27day = 10yr-11M- 3 Day. 


The remaining part thus drawn is added to the date of birth and thus the termination- 
period of Dasha nath is brought in. After this the Period of planets is added turn by turn. 


Sub period: 


Every planet has the Sub period of all the nine planets in its Major period. The first Sub 
period is that of lord of Major period. For example, the first Sub period in the Major 
period of the Sun will be of its own. Rest of the Sub periods will be there placed serial 
wise. Take an example of the Sun. Inthe Major period of Sun the first Sub period will 
be of its own, the second of Moon, third of Mars, fourth of Rahu, fifth of Jupiter, sixth of 
Saturn, seventh of Mercury, eighth of Ketu and ninth will be that of Venus. The placement 
of Sub periods of all the other planets in their Major periods will be the same way. 


Measurement of Sub period 


It is very easy to draw out the measurement of an Sub period. We know that how many 
_years have been provided to a planet in 120 years. The Sub period of a planet is 
drawn out by unit method. Let us take an example of Saturn who has been provided 
19 years in 120 years. 


In 120 years Saturnhas =19 


19 
19 years Saturn has — 
120 


Dasha Prediction — 3

i.e. = 3 years - 00 Month - 03 Days. 
=.008 x 12 month = .096 x 12 month =00 month 
= .096 x 30 days = 2.880 days 
=3 days

We can draw out the Pratyantardasha of planets on the basis of the above rules. 
Pratyantardasha Sadhan 

Every planet has Pratyantardasha of nine planets in its Sub period like that it has Sub 
periods of the planets in its Period. The first Pratyantardasha in the Sub period ofa 
planet is that of Antardasha nath. The rest of the Pratyantardashas move on serially. 
Suppose that we have to draw out the measurement of the Pratyantardasha of Saturn 
Measure of Saturn in 120 years =19 


3.008 (Measure of Sub period) 


__ 19 x 3.008 
~ 420 
= 0.4763 
i.e. 0 year 5 months 21 days 11.4 hours

4 Dasha Prediction 


Chapter-2 


Horoscope 


There are three elements in a horoscope 


1. House 
2. Signs 
3. Planets 


We suppose that the native knows the elements of the house and sign if he wants to 
study the period-sub-period. The period-sub-period happens to be of i.e. dasha planets. 
We shall, therefore, be making a study primarily of period-sub-period. 


Benefic and malefic planets 


Planets generally give two types of results - benefic and malefic. The planets giving 
benefic results are naturally considered to be benefic ones whereas those giving malefic 
results are malefic planets. We shall have to study both the benefic and malefic ones. 
Benefic planets are those who make our mind happy & peaceful whereas malefic 
ones cause distress. Suppose, | am getting my daughter married. | have to spend 
much in it but fam happy. ! am happy and peaceful despite spending my money so the 
occasion is auspicious for me. 


On the other hand, my father died and | got an amount of Rupees 10lacs from insurance 
as its outcome. | am sad though fam getting money from somewhere. So, this is an 
inauspicious occasion for me. According to the Parashar rules, good and evil effects 
of a planet depend on the happy or sad stage of mind. Jupiter and Venus are the 
natural benefic planets. The Moon in Paksha Bala and Mercury conjoined with or 
aspected by a benefic planet are also benefic planets. 


Moon remains strong from Shukla Paksha Ekadashi to Krishna Paksha Panchami. 
This strong Moon is considered to be benefic. Moon remains weak from Krishna Paksha 
Ekadashi to Shukla Paksha Panchami. This weak Moon is said to be malefic. Again, 
the Moon remains some what strong between Shukla Paksha Shashthi to Dashmi of 
Shukla Paksh and the Moon is weak between Krishna Paksha Shashthi to Shukla 
paksh Panchami. This Moon is said to be mean strong and gives mixed results. The 


Dasha Prediction 5 


Moon is not considered to be malefic if it is debilitated i.e. it is situated in Scorpio. 


Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are said to be malefic planets in descending order. 
Apart from these, debilitated strong Moon and Mercury conjoined with or aspected by 
a malefic planet, also and posited in between malefic planets. 


Lagna Kundali Navamsha Horoscope 


Take an example. A native was born on 3-01-1951 at 15-01 in Delhi. Major period of, 
mercury started in his horoscope on 09-28-1992. Mercury is situated in exalted sign 
and posited in trine. By that time the family of the native was prosperous. The native 
was happy with his elder brother. Mother of the native died in Period of Mercuy. He 
became separated from his elder brother and started business on his own. He started 
suffering from asthma. 


It now became almost impossible for him to start his own business because Mercury 
became malefic being conjoined with Sun and Saturn. 


Result: Every event has two elements: 
1. Quantitative result that is how much amount he will get. 
Qualitative result that is benefic and malefic effécts. 


3. Quantitative result depends upon the strength of the planet concerned. An 
astrologer must keep both the elements in his mind. 


Maharshi Parashar has mentioned different states to guess the ability of a planet for 
rendering results. Main among these are as follows:

Deeptadi Avastha 
Baladi Avastha 
Jagratadi Avastha. 


Deeptadi Avastha 


These are nine in number: 


SEO Os (On OL Bs 


A planet becomes Deept while posited in its sign of exaltation. 
Swastha when it is posited in its own sign. 

Mudita when it is posited in its friendly quarter i.e. in the sign of Atimitra. 
Shanta when it is posited in its friendly sign i.e. Mitra Rashi. 

Deen when it is posited the sign of a Sam i.e. neutral planet. 

Duhkhi when it is posited in the sign of an inimical planet i.e. Shatrugrah. 
Vikal when it is posited conjoined with a malefic planet. 

Khal when itis posited in the sign of an Atipapagraha and 

Kopi when it is posited situated with the Sun. 


A planet in Deept Avastha gives benefit from ruler, power, wealth, vehicle, 
happiness and respect from wife and children etc. in its period/sub-period of the 
planet. 


A planet in Swastha Avastha gives good health, wealth, happiness, knowledge, 
name, wife, vehicle, land etc. in its period-sub-period. 


A planet situated in Mudita Avastha gives cloth, ornaments, bliss of son, wealth, 
vehicle etc. in its period-sub-period. 


A planet in Shanta Avastha gives happiness, land, son, wife, vehicle and honour 
during its period-sub-period. 

A planet in a Deen Avastha brings some changes in the life of a person in its 
period-sub-period. It also causes difference with his brothers. He might be 
condemned in the society and his friends may leave him. He might suffer from 
inferiority complex and diseases as well. 

A planet in Duhkhavastha causes distress to the native in its period-sub-period. 
Loss is also caused due to theft, fire or diseases in his family. 

A planet in Vikala Avastha makes a person suffer from inferiority complex in its 
period-sub-period. His friends and the members of his family may die. He suffers 
from loss of wife, son, vehicle, land, cloth etc. 


Dasha Prediction 7 


8. Aplanet in Khala Avastha causes dispute in the family and bereavement due to 
the death of brother, mother or father of the native in its period-sub-period. 


9. Aplanet in Kopi Avastha causes boundless sufferings to a native in its period- 
sub-period. The native may be deprived of wealth, land, vehicle, son, wife and his 
relatives may cause him distress. 


Baladi Avastha: 
In Deeptadi states, results can be had according to the longitude of planets in signs. In 


a Baladi state, prediction is made according to the degrees of a planet. This state is 
of 6°-6°. The different states in odd signs at the degrees of planets are as follows: 


0° to 6° Balaavastha 

6° + to12° Kumaryaavastha 
12°+to 8° Yuvavaastha 
18°+to 24° Vriddhaavastha 
24°+ to 30° Mritavaastha 


Similarly, in even signs it is Mritavastha if a planet is at 0° to 6°, Vriddhavastha if at 
6°+-12°, Yuvavastha if at 12°+-18° , Kumaryavastha 18°+-24° and Balavastha if it is at 
somewhere between 24°+30°. 


A planet gives one-fourth of its result in Balaavastha, halfin Kumaraavastha, full in 
Yuvaavastha, little in Vruddhaavastha and it gives no result if it is in Mritaavastha. 


Jagratadi Avastha: 


This state falls at 0° to 10°. In odd signs, it is Jagrataavastha from 0° to 10°, 
Swapnaavastha 10°+to 20° and Sushuptaavastha from 20°+ to 30°. 


In even signs, it is Sushuptavastha from 0° to 10°, Swapnavastha from 10° to 20° and 
Jagratavastha from 20°+ to 30°. 


A planet renders its full result in Jagratavastha and half in swapnavastha. It gives no 
result if is in Sushuptavastha. 


The quantitative Phal Vichar has been mentioned elaborately in Brahat Parashar Hora 
Shastra. Parashar has made a study of quantitative Bala of a planet on the basis of 
strength of planet and house (Shashtha Bal) and Shashthavargiya Bal. Here, this has 
to be made clear that the Bala of a planet is as important as any other Bala is. Therefore, 


Dasha Prediction 


the quantitative Phala should be looked into by keeping the states and degrees in 
mind before making a prediction. It is wise to make a prediction by entering both the 
elements in period-sub-period. 


Qualitative strength (Gunatmaka Bala) 


By qualitative strength (Gunatmaka bala) one can know about whether a planet will 
give benefic or malefic result. There are two methods for studying qualitative strength. 


1. 


Natural benefic or malefic Grahaphala. 


We know well the natural benefic or malefic planets. Jupiter, Venus, Paksha Bali 
Moon and Mercury conjoined with or aspected by a planet are natural benefic planets. 


Temporal benefic or malefic results. 


Every horoscope has some benefic, malefic and neutral house. Lords of benefic 
houses render benefic results. The lord of a malefic house gives unfavourable 
results. The lord of a neutral house gives result according to the planet situated in 
the house or according to conjunction or aspect or to its another sign. This rule is 
used for Vimshothari dasha whereas natural benefic and malefic are used in other 
periods. 


Maharshi Mantreshwar has also made predictions in his "Phaladeepika” on natural 
benefic and malefic results of the planets before drawing out the period-sub- 
period. He has made prediction in his subsequent Shlokas for Vimshottari Dasha. 
So, here we shall first of all make a brief study of different periods of the planets 
according to their natural effects.

Chapters 
Natural results of period of Sun 


Inthe Major period of Sun, a native can go abroad and may dwell there. He may have 
benefit or loss from land, ruler, a Brahmin, fire, weapon and medicine. Interest in Yantra- 
Mantra grows in him. He may have friendship with the rulers, politicians and officers. 
He may have enmity with his relatives and he may be bereaved of wife, son or father or 
worried about them. He may suffer from eye, tooth and digestive problems. The Sun 
causes him loss of Godhana and disturbances in service. 


According to Late Katawe the Major period of the Sun is basically inauspicious. But 
the Major period of the Sun situated in Lagna (Ascendant), fifth, tenth and twelfth houses 
is auspicious. The same Period of the Sun situated in rest of the house, proves to be 
malefic. The Sub periods of Saturn, Mars and Moon in the Major period of the Sun are 
malefic. The effects of the Sun situated in fiery signs prove to be inauspicious. It gives 
much malefic results if situated in Aries, medium or mixed in Leo but comparatively 
better results if situated in Sagittarius. It renders some ordinary (neither good nor bad) 
results if situated in earthy signs such as Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. 


The Sun situated in Airy signs (Gemini, Libra and Aquarius) gives comparatively good 
results whereas in watery signs it gives ordinary results. We should make prediction 
keeping in view the position of the Sun - whether it is exalted or debilitated, in its own 
house or in the house of its enemy or friend or in vargas. We should also keep in mind 
whether it is conjoined with or aspected by other planets. The strength of the Sun 
should also be noted. 


Period prediction of the Sun situated in different houses : 


Lagna : If posited in lagna causes tooth and eye problems and loss of wealth. The 
native may have to face wrath of the rulers (Raja Koap). 


Second house: It causes birth of a child, loss of son, dispute, loss of wife, wealth, 
land and vehicle. 


Third house: The Sun in third house earns the native honour from the rulers, gives 
him wealth and happiness and enhances velour in him. 


In fourth house: Loss of wife, children, friends and brothers, land, vehicle, etc. The 
native becomes afraid of fire, poison, weapon and thief. 


In fifth and ninth houses: The native remains dejected. His father dies and he gets 
insulted in the society. 


Dasha Prediction 25 


In sixth house: The native gets wealth from enemy but may suffer from tuberculosis, 
painful discharge of urine - strangury, indigestion and problems in genitals. 


In seventh house: Wife of the native suffers from diseases and her death is also 
feared. He has to face hurdles in getting food and many other inconveniences. 


In eighth house: The native might go on overseas trip. He might suffer from fever, 
eye and tooth problems, indigestion and other diseases. 


In ninth house: Death of father, insult from rulers, deterioration, futile traveling, 
aversion from religious activities. 


In tenth house: The native gets honour and power from the rulers and success in his 
undertakings. 


In eleventh house: Renders wealth. The native can have a position. He may have 
interest in auspicious activities. He will remain free from diseases and will have the 
pleasure of conjugal life son, vehicle, land etc. 


In twelfth house: The native can go on overseas trips. He might have loss of wealth, 
son, parents, land etc. and he might suffer from fear of poison, thief, fire, weapon or 
arms and problems in eyes and legs. 


Thus we see that the Sun situated in 3rd, 6th, 10thand 11 th houses gives good results. 
But the position as well as the conjunction of the Sun with the other planets should be 
kept in view. Similarly, aspects of other planets on the Sun should also be kept in mind. 


The parents of a native might suffer from diseases, mental agony etc. in the period- 
sub-period of the Sun. He hasto bear much expenses. He might have loss of cattle in 
the middle of the Period. He might suffer from mental agony. But he might have progress 
in education and prosperity during the last partof the Dhasha. 


Sun/Sun (period 0 year, 03 month 18 days). 


The native may get honour from the rulers and gain of wealth. He might be residing in 
hills or in forests. However, he might suffer from bile problem and fever. Separation 
from father is also possible. The Sun is the Karaka of father beside being the Karaka 
of ruler, administration and government. The Sun gives benefic results if it is benefic 
(in Angle/trines, exaltation, own house, Moolatrine and friendly sign). The Sun will give 
malefic results if it is debilitated or is situated in a debilitated sign (in sixth, eighth and 
twelfth houses). 


Sun/Moon (Period 6 months) 


The native wins over his enemies. He overcomes his hardships and agonies and 


26 Dasha Prediction 


gains wealth. He may earn profit from agriculture and horticulture. He may have a 
beautiful house. He may have opportunity to have association with his friends. Loss of 
wealth, mental agony and fear of water and fire is possible if the Moon is malefic. 


Sun/Mars 


The native might suffer from diseases. Demotion in sen/ice and fear and anguish from 
enemy are possible. Dispute in family and protest from the members of the family and 
fear from rulers are also possible. He may some times suffer from wound and injury. 
There might be loss of wealth. This must be noted that the Sun and Mars become 
malefic if they are cruel. But both the planets give good results if they are in a benefic 
sign (Angle/Trine) and the native emerges victorious all over and he might have all 
round success and honour. 


Sun/Rahu 


The enemies of the native may rise in revolt. Hostility is possible. Theft or loss of 
wealth is also possible. There might come hurdles in the way of the native. He might 
suffer from eye and head problems. Interest in voluptuousness is possible. The Sun is 
a benefic planet, but Rahu is malefic and enemy of the Sun. So the result will be like 
that of a king who has lost his reign and has been entrapped by his enemy. 


Sun/Jupiter 


The enemy of the native will be ruined and will turn tails. There might be all round 
benefit and gain of wealth. The native will have prosperity by worshiping the deities 
and serving and helping Brahmins. Affection from Guru and respect from relatives are 
possible. Jupiter may cause ear problem, tuberculosis and asthma. 


Sun/Saturn 


Wife of the native might suffer from diseases. Separation from son and death of any of 
the Gurujanas (Guru, father or uncle) are possible. There might be much expenditure 
and loss of wealth. Saturn is a great enemy and opponent of the Sun though it is the 
son of the Sun. The Sun is the king whereas Saturn is a slave. He is behefic whereas 
Saturn is malefic and dirt loving, The native likes to live in a dirty place during this 
period. He might suffer from ailments caused by disorder of the wind and bile. 


Sun/Mercury 


Mercury is a gentle planet but the Sun is a cruel one. Therefore, the native might suffer 
from skin diseases, eruptions, leprosy and jaundice. Problems in digestive system 
and waist are possible. Ailments caused by disorder of the wind, bile and cough is 
also possible. 


Dasha Prediction 27 


Sun/Ketu 


Separation from friends, difference of opinion with colleagues and the members of 
family, fear from enemy and loss of wealth are possible. There might be problem in 
head and foot. Gurujanas might suffer from diseases. Ketu is also malefic and enemy 
of the Sun like Rahu. Which may cause much unfavourable results. 


Sun/Venus 


The native might suffer from problem in head, indigestion or piles. He may have loss in 
cultivation, land, house, food grains and pleasure of progeny. His wife and children 
may suffer from some diseases. Despite being a Daitya and Rajoguni (with attribute 
of merry - making) planet and Bhogapradayaka, Venus is also the enemy of Sun. Loss 
of wealth and ailments to kith and kin are very common during the Sub period of en- 
emy. 


Note: Despite being cruel, the Sun is not malefic. It is a benefic planet and full of 
energy around whom revolve all the other planets. The sun, the life-giver, is the soul of 
the native which changes bodies. In Sudarshana Paddhati, Janma and Chandra 
Lagnas have also been mentioned as important along with the Sun. So, this should be 
kept in mind that all his feelings and sufferings-his health, pleasure and pains, working 
capacity, conduct, glory and disrepute and gains and losses are influenced by the 
Sun. A native, influenced greatly by the Sun, makes study of soul introvert. This is why 
the soul gets revolutionized in the Period of the Sun that becomes benefic. The en- 
emies of the native may rise in revolt. Hostility is possible. Theft or loss of wealth is 
also possible. There might come hurdles in the way of the native. He might suffer from 
eye and head problems. Interest in voluptuousness is possible. The Sun is a benefic 
planet, but Rahu is malefic and enemy of the Sun. So the result will be like that of a king 
who has lost his reign and has been entrapped by his enemy.

Chapter-4 


Natural results of Moon 


A native can acquire wealth, land, cloth and ornaments in the Major period of the 
Moon. He can have association with young women. He becomes interested in Mantra, 
Vedas and Brahmins. Gains and honour are possible from the government. He can 
have a post also in the government. The native likes traveling. He may adopt the 
business of electrical goods, medicines, patent medicines, grocery, dairy, rice, cotton, 
white clothes etc. whereas in service, he might be a railway officer or a pilot. 


According to late Katve, the Moon situated in the signs of Aries, Libra, Scorpio and 
Pisces, gives best results. Results bestowed by the Moon situated in Gemini, Leo and 
Sagittarius, are medium whereas results rendered by it are malefic if it is situated in 
the signs of Taurus, Cancer, Virgo and Capricorn. The Moon situated in Taurus gives 
the most malefic results whereas in Scorpio it gives the most favourable ones. The 
Moon is not benefic in Aquarius among the male signs whereas it is benefic in Pisces 
among female ones. 


This is the experience of late Katwe, which we should keep in our mind. But Maharshis 
like Parashara, Mantreshwar etc. have mentioned that predictions should be made 
according to the different states. So, the Paksha, house, planet and Vargeeya Balas 
and states of the Moon should be kept in view.

disorder in blood. He fears from enemy, thief orfire and suffers from mental affliction

the enemies might cause disturbances. His friends and relatives would be ailing. He 
fears from natural calamities (storms, electrocutions, flood). He suffers from diseases

The native would be kind and interested in charity and munificence. He would have 
honour from rulers, association with friends and bliss of clothes and ornaments. This 
makes him happy. Due to the mutual relation between the Moon and Jupiter, the Gaja 
Kesori Yoga is formed which represents honour, prosperity, happiness and success.

The native would suffer from physical problem and hardships. His son, friend and wife 
might also suffer from hardships. A great hardship is possible in his life. The Moon is

Gain of wealth in different forms such as land, house, vehicle, gems and.ornaments 
etc. Peace of mind enhances further. The native would be interested in virtuous activities.

Natural results of period of Rahu 


Rahu is a shadowy Planet. Our astrologers have recognised it as a planet since it puts 
its influence on mankind. According to some scholars Virgo is the own house of Rahu 
and its sign of exaltation is Gemini whereas the sign of debilitation is Sagittarius. 
Others say that Taurus is the sign of exaltation of Rahu, Aquarius is the Moola Trine 
sign and cancer is its favourite sign. Other qualities are like that of Saturn, Mars is the 
enemy of Rahu, Saturn is neutral and the other planets are its friends. Some say that 
Mars, Saturn and the Moon are its enemies. 


A person, who has an exalted Rahu, will be sensual and indulged in mundane affairs. 
He will perform altruistic acts but only after getting his own interest fulfilled. He will like 
fish and will be vainglorious and ambitious. He will not be talkative butwill be proficient 
in writing. He will not intervene in others affairs, nor will he like anyone intervene in his 
own. 


The native, having Rahu in a malefic house (in odd house in an odd sign), will be 
unintelligent, knave, selfish, untrustworthy, vainglorious, fraudulent, shameless and rude. 
He always thinks his opinions and views to be better than those of others, He gibes 
and causes harm to others. 


In terms of Rahu two, there is a point of difference among the astrologers. It has been 
established that Rahu has aspects of 5, 7, 9, 12. But its seventh and twelfth aspects 
only come to sight (are effective). It is a retrograde planet. 


Effect of Rahu Period on different houses. 


Ascendant: The native happens to be unintelligent and suffers from fear of poison, 
fire and enemies. He becomes hostile to his relatives. His enemies defeat him and he

38 Dasha Prediction 


Rahu/Jupiter

and free from diseases and enjoys the company of beautiful women. He spends his 
time happily, enjoying scholarly thinking and interest in spirituality. 


Rahu/Saturn 


A native having this combination remains hostile with his wife, sons and brothers. In 
service, he has to face demotion (transfer). His servant causes him distress/loss. 
Hurdles/losses are caused in service also. He receives hurt and injury and suffers 
from disorder caused by the excess of wind and bile within the system. Saturn hap- 
pens to be debilitated in Ascendant (Lagna) of a horoscope (Kala Purusha). So, it is 
natural for it, to be malefic. If Rahu is posited in the third, the native becomes hostile 
with his brothers, sons and wife. It also causes him anguish, affliction and physical 
ailments. 


Rahu/Mercury 


During this Period the native enjoys the bliss of sons, association with friends and 
happiness in mind. He gets his jobs accomplished and gains benefit since he be- 
comes efficient and sagacious during this Period. Rahu and Mercury are friends of 
each other. Mercury represents tactfulness, trade wisdom and efficiency in business.

suffers from fever and fear of fire, weapons and enemies during this Period. He suf- 
fers from ailment in head and trembling in body and pains caused by poison, boils and 
eruptions. He remains at odds with his friends and elderly people (Gurujans) become 
indifferent with him and this indifference enhances his mental agony. 


Rahu/Venus 


This Period creates a situation to have the company of women. The native enjoys the 
bliss of land, building, vehicle and glory. He becomes hostile with his dear and near 
ones and suffers from diseases caused by the excess of cough in the system. An 
exalted Venus is posited in the tenth (in the fourth according to Vipareeta calculation)

from enemies. He may suffer from pain caused by poison, fire and weapons. Eye 
problems are also possible. He might have to suffer from fear of ruler and government. 
The Period causes distress and agony to his wife and Sons. Rahu and the sun are 
enemies of each other. The Sun represents soul, king or ruler and government. If the 
Sun is in the Natal chart of Kala Purusha and Rahu is in third then it makes a 3-11 
situation which is malefic. So, this Period renders unfavorable result.

ones who cause him hurdles and anguish. He remains worried and aggrieved and 
suffers from hydrophobia. His friends may have to face distress. The Period tells of

and mental peace and happiness; but Rahu being cruel, is posited in the second 
house (Maraka house) from the Moon in the Natal chart of Kalapurusha. So Rahu will 
act like a Maraka planet for friends and mental peace and happiness.

The native in this Period suffers from fear of ruler (governmeni), fire, thief and weap- 
ons. He also suffers from physical or mental ailments. The Period tells also of heart 
diseases, eye-problem and demotion in service.

planet Rahu is posited in the tenth house in the Natal chart of Kala Purusha and can 
cause diseases in private parts since it is posited in the sixth house from Mars. So, 
the native needs extra precaution and affectionate cooperation.

ministerial post & other desired things. The native devotes time in worship and performs 
religious rites. Attainment of vehicle, landed property and clothes is possible and 
company of nice people is slated. The native is likely to look after his or her relation 
and acquaintances. 


According to late Katave, Jupiter augurs excellent result in signs of Aries, Gemini, 
Leo, Sagittarius and Pisces. It bears average result in Libra, Scorpio, Capricorn & 
Aquarius signs whereas in Taurus, Virgo an Cancer it is inauspicious. Such natives 
earn name at advanced stage of their life. If Jupiter is in a female sign or is battered 
then the native takes up a job initially while switch over to his own business in a later 
phase. But if itis in 10th house the native does job lifelong. Such people may found 
institutions like schools, colleges, inns etc. They can contest elections for civic bodies, 
legislative council, etc. 


A bruised Jupiter becomes a host of false ego and instability regarding business. 
Having such Jupiter, people look down upon others. They keep on nitpickings. They 
can't stay calm in company of wife even for a while. But they do make excellent company 
of other women. Such people consider themselves highly educated and try to impress 
others.

in society. Body and face-lift are possible. Development and enlightenment of character 
is inevitable. Company of guru and saints and fulfillment of wishes are possible. Honour 
from govt. and consequently all round accolades and rewards are on the card. 


Jupiter/Saturn 


Indulgence in liquor, company of women of easy virtue and other earthly pleasures are 
possible. Extravagance on such activities is natural. On the other hand relatives and 
pets may suffer. The eyes & sons of the native may suffer. He may be fearful inwardly 
all the time (in fact fear & suffering are the characters of Saturn. Jupiter is Bhogesh for 
Kala Purusha whereas Saturn is Labhesh. Therefore increase in earthly pleasure is 
possible. Atthe same time, if Saturn is in 7th house then company of beautiful women 
of easy virtue is also possible. 


Jupiter/Mercury 
Indulgence in liquor, company of women of easy virtue and gambling and suffering 
42 Dasha Prediction 


from disorder caused by excess of cough, bile and wind is possible. In fact Mercury is 
the soft spoken prince who is quite practical and tactful and can adopt dubious means 
to achieve the desired goal. So, the native can go for gambling and booze to have lust 
in life. On the other hand, according to scholars and saints, Jupiter is virtuous and a 
Brahmin conversant with the Vedas. He, in fact, symbolises knowledge, conscience 
and wisdom whereas Mercury stands for intelligence and tactfulness. Therefore in this 
Sub period, one can achieve and round prosperity and pleasure of Son, wealth and 
happy family life. 


Jupiter/Ketu 


The native may receive injury/wound on body and suffer opposition from servants and 
his wife/son may be in trouble. He may have some mental problem. He may suffer 
separation from Gurujans (elderly people) or near & dear ones. The native may have 
deadly pain or even death is possible. It is in fact a paradox that in the Janmang of 
Kala Purusha Ketu is sitting in ninth house in the sign of Jupiter but it is sixth from 
Jupiter. Periodnath and Sub periodnath are considered inauspicious or fatal if they 
are sixth or eighth from each other. The native may suffer physically or at the hands of 
enemy. Injury or wound is also possible. 


Jupiter/Venus 


Various types of wealth, clothes, and comfort items are sure to come or increase. 
Enjoyment of life with wife and son is likely. Best food and beverages are on the card. 
The native remains interested in worship of lords and Brahmins. Venus, being exalted 
in Bhogasthan, is posited in the sign of Jupiter in Natal chart of Kalapurusha. Jupiter is 
the lord of ninth house. So, It is natural for the native to lead a life full of luxuries. 


Jupiter/Sun 


Win over enemy, honour from state, increase in reputation and gain of wealth and 
vehicle are possible. Sphere of influence and manly prowess will increase. The native 
is likely to be a metro-citizen with all tyoes of comforts. Jupiter is in fourth house in 
Janmang of Kala Purusha and the Sun is exalted in Lagna. For fourth house, Lagna is 
10th. So, promotion injob/business, enhancement of prestige and mental peace are 
sure tocome. 


Jupiter/Moon 


May have company of women and gain of wealth. Enhancement in prestige is possible. 
Cultivation may prove to be fruitful. Profit in trade is likely. Lord and Brahmin both must 
be worshipped. If Jupiter is exalted in Moon sign it will definitely bear fruit, but aversion 
from religion and saints may bring dishonour and mental agony. In such circumstances 
friction with wife, trouble in conjugal life, and loss of wealth are possible. Therefore the 
learned persons should suggest religious rites and worship so that Gajkesari Yoga 
may become meaningful. 


Dasha Prediction 43 


Jupiter/Mars 


Relatives of the native get benefited by him and he himself gets benefit from his enemy. 
Land and building are promised. Increase in sphere of influence. Some Gurujans (elderly 
people) may suffer injury. Even native can face some eye problems but he is sure to 
reap comfort from his pious deeds. Mars tells of struggle with enemy and affection 
from fellows while Jupiter tells of profit. Jupiter is in 4th house in Janmang of the Kala 
Purusa whereas Mars is in 10th. Hence under influence of 10th house by his deeds 
the native can get all sorts of comforts and other benefits. 


Jupiter/Rahu 


Relatives may be in trouble or may cause 'trouble and distress to the native. Mental 
agony, worry and restlessness are also possible. The native may become 
hypochondriac and may be fearful of thieves. His/her Gurujans (elderly people) may 
suffer. The native himself can have stomach disorder. He or she can be tortured or 
penalised by king i.e. state. May be dogged by enemies. Loss of wealth is possible. 
Jupiter is saviour of gods and he gives Mantras whereas Rahu is the arch - enemy. 
Naturally, outcome will be inauspicious. In the horoscope of Kala Purusha, Rahu is ina 
friendly house, being 12th from Jupiter. In such a circumstance loss of happiness, 
dispute in family and mental agony due to fellow parsons are possible.

Natural results of period 
of Mercury 


Mercury gives the results according to the planet it is situated with. That's why Mercury 
is considered to be neutral (or impotent) by some scholars. Mercury in fact represents 
students who follow Brahmacharya and laws of abstinence. This too hints about its 
impotence. But if Mercury is powerful, aspecting auspiciously and is exalted then gain 
of wealth, comforts and respect are there for sure. The native enjoys altruism and 
acquires land, clothes etc. He adopts writing and publishing as his profession. But if it 
is weak, subdued and bruised, the native may seek company of other women. May be 
ata cross with near and dear ones. Other negative aspects are troubled relation with 
mother and brother and brain disorder. He or she is supposedly ill - educated. He may 
suffer loss in business. But if it is with the Sun and is not combust then Buddhaditya 
Yoga takes place. In this case the native becomes a learned person or astronomer. 
But if it is combust, the native has mental agony and family tension. Indulgence in back 
biting is another feature of the native. If itis associated with an auspicious planet, all 
things are bright and beautiful. Name and fame come along with other worldly pleasure. 
Conversely, every thing goes wrong if Mercury is with an inauspicious planet. In this 
stage of Mercury, the native indulges in sinful acts, backbiting, tall - taking etc. Loss of 
land is possible and he might be deprived of bliss of wife and son. Lots of other 
problems are possible like parting with near and dear ones and retrenchment from 
post.

gets honour from the government. He has a keen interest in religious activities and 
spirituality. (Jupiter is a Vedic Scholar and well-versed in Shastras where as Mercury

name and fame, happiness etc. He will have enthusiasm and Zeal in him. He will have

will definitely give inauspicious results as mentioned earlier. According to scholars, 
destiny depends on the base of religion and virtuous deeds. So, it is better to give up 
the sinful way of life and adopt one of virtue to have the auspicious results bestowed 
by Ketu. Ketu is the destroyer of religion and faith. It got the strong demon like Rahu 
beheaded right at the time of its very birth. Ifevident, a thing does not need any proof.

Venus/Sun 


This combination of Venus and the Sun causes problem in eyes, cheeks and armpits. 
The native suffers from fear of the state. The Gurujanas and the relatives of the native 
may face anguish and they may cause distress to him. The Sun and Venus are enemies 
of each others. The Sun is the king whereas Venus represents happiness. So, fear 
and distress from the king, Gurujanas (elderly people) or officials is possible. Venus is 
posited in the tenth house from the Sun in Natal chart of Kala Purusha. This too is a 
situation that might lessens the happiness.) 


Venus/Moon

suffer from disorder caused by the excess of wind and bile in the system. The 
combination ruins the wealth of the native. He suffers from diseases like diarrhoea, 
tuberculosis or Gulma. (Moon is also the enemy of Venus like the Sun. Moon is the lord 
of fourth house (Sukhesha)) of Kala Purush and Venus is the lord of the second. So,

wealth.

acquires land and metals like gold and silver. Illicit relation with a women is possible.

the tenth whereas Venus being lord of second is posited in twelfth house. The relation 
between the two is that of 3 to 11 which is said to be inauspicious. Mars helps the 
native acquire land but it might cause disorder in blood and blood pressure also. 
Likewise, the combination of Venus and Mars enhances sensuality making the native 
indiscrete, and he might start behaving like an animal.

acquires wealth and enjoys prosperity. His property enhances further. (Venus and Saturn 
are friends of each other. Venus is in Bhoga Sthan in the Natal chart of Kala Purusha.

fear of fire and physical problems. Separation from son is possible. The combination 
will create a situation for the native to have company of the women of easy virtue. 
(Venus is the Guru of Demon. Itis pleasure - seeking also. Ketu is a great enemy of 
the deities. So, it is natural for the native to face the unfavorable result caused due to

Chapter-12 


Period of the lord of a house: 
An analysis 


Lord of the sign of the house under consideration in Natal chart is called Bhavesha i.e. 
lord of the house. As described earlier, a planet gives results according to the house it 
is posited in. Apart from this, it gives results according to the sign in which it is posited. 
Lastly, it gives results according to the influence of the planets it is aspected by or of 
the planets aspecting the dasha. In this chapter, it has been described what result of 
the house dasha will give in its Period Sub-period of which it is the lord or significator. 


Period of Lagnesha: Usually shows health, happiness and distress of the native. 
Physical discomfort or even death is possible in the Sub-period of the enemy of Lagna 
(Lord of sixth house or an inimical planet) in Period of Lagna. Lagna is related with 
longevity and body, therefore health gets affected. 


Second house: Second house is related with wealth, relatives and primary education. 
According to another view depth of knowledge and its acquisition etc. can be inferred 
from Dhanbhava. The house is also a Karak (Significator) of vision and voice. Dhanesh 
in its own Period/Sub-period renders wealth, pleasure of own people and education. 
The native enjoys tasty food and is good at oration. If Dnanesh is conjoined with the 
Sun, native turns altruist. He becomes rich and a scholar as well. With Jupiter, Dhanesh 
creates an inclination towards knowledge, conscience and academics. But with Saturn 
it hampers education or makes ill educated. 


If the Sun/Moon is weak, debilitated, conjoined with an inimical planet or posited in its 
enemy quarter and also aspected by Mars and Ketu then the native suffers from 
blindness or may even lose his sight. Such accident takes place probably during 
Period/Sub-period of Dhanesh. Ifthe Moon is in sixth, the Sun in eighth, Saturn in 
twelfth and Mars is in second house then both the Moon and the Sun become Karaka 
of eye sight and create Andhatva Yoga being posited and debilitated in Trika Bhava 
(6, 8, 12). Similarly if a malefic Mars is posited in 2nd house and is being aspected by 
Saturn and Sun then eye - sight of the native falls in danger. The native loses it in most 
of the cases. 


Third house: It represents brothers, sisters, courage, valour, labour, etc. It also reflects 
love, cooperation, helping attitude etc. of the native. But if lord of 12th house is in 3rd 
house of Natal chart, it will affect the 3rd house. The native gets deprived of pleasure 


Dasha Prediction 59 


of siblings. Relation turns hell. He/she wouldn't look beyond own physical comforts. 
Lord of 3rd house also signifies ego of the native. Probably due to this reason, the 
native commits suicide in case the said lord is conjoined with 8th house and its lord. 


Sub-period of the lord of eighth house in the Period of the lord of the 3rd may instigate 
the native commit suicide. 


Fourth house: Usually reflects land, building and relation with mother and mental 
peace. Many learned astrologers make prediction of peace and happiness in the 
family welfare and friends on the basis of fourth house. This is also known as house of 
happiness. According to some ancient scholars, 10th house is the symbol of king and 
Ath of his subject. Sub-period of Moon in Chaturthesh makes one popular and gives 
political success. But ifthe fourth house is afflicted or Chaturthes is sinful then native 
may face consequences of treason or he might be neglected by mass. Moon is also 
said to be the significator of subject/citizen. 


Fifth house: By fifth house, different points such as progeny, retentivity, sagacity, 
happiness, lover and beloved (friendship) etc. are considered. Some scholars try to 
find out the fate (success/progress) of the father of a native by considering ninth house 
to be the house of father. Some others make prediction about enemies and remedies 
to diseases by fifth house (due to its being sixth from 12th). The same fifth house gives 
clue about speculation, lottery, etc. Sudden windfall (in race, lottery, speculation etc.) 
is likely in Period/Sub-period of the lord of 5th house if Rahu/Ketu is posited in fifth 
house and if the lord of fifth house is strong, conjoined with or aspected by a benefic 
planet. According to Shri Masin a Yokaraka planet gives wealth in its Period/Sub- 
period if it is conjoined with Rahu or Ketu. 


Sixth house: By sixth house, points such as ailment, loan, enemy and struggle are 
considered. In its Period-Sub period, the lord of sixth house tells of fear of diseases 
and enemy. Unfavourable and inauspicious results are likely even in the Sub period of 
a planet posited in sixth from Periodnatha or in the Sub-period of a natural enemy of 
Periodnatha. 


A native has to face much loss and distress if Sub-period Nath (planet with Sub period) 
happens to be the enemy of Periodnatha and Lagnesha and is situated in sixth or 
eighth house from Periodnatha. In short, enemy of Periodnatha, or a planet posited in 
sixth from Periodnatha or lord of sixth house from Lagna causes fear of disease and 
enemy and demotion or retrenchment from post. Even most affectionate ones and 
friends turn enemy. 


Seventh house: By seventh house a consideration of marriage, business ties, foreign 
trip or other relations can be done. itis with this house that feature-complexion of wife/ 
husband, character, nature, social status, time of marriage, in laws, conjugal life etc. 
can be forecast. Sign of Satum or its position in or aspect on 7th house, delays marriage. 
But sign of Mercury (Gemini and Virgo) prompts marriage. Marriage is possible also 


60 Dasha Prediction 


in Period/bhukti of the lord of 7th house, Karaka (significator) of seventh house, and in 
Period/Sub-period of Venus. According to some scholar, marriage is possible also in 
Period/Sub-period of Venus and Jupiter or in case transit Jupiter is in seventh house 
or conjoined with or aspected by the lord of 7th house. 


Eighth house: 8th house tells of completeness of life, death, dishonour and gain of 
wealth of a dead person. Period of the lord of eighth house can cause death. According 
to some scholars, lord of 8th house from Lagna, Sun or Moon can spell death in its 
own Period/Sub-period. According to Deva Keralakar, the Period/Sub-period of the 
lord of eighth house can cause death in all the three Lagnas if there is Gochar Saturn 
also being posited in the sign of Navamsha Swami of the lord of eighth house or even 
aspected by it. But contrary to this if lord of eighth house is strong and conjoined with 
or aspected by an auspicious planet then the native will live long. If the lords of Lagna 
and eighth house are strong, the native will lead along and healthy life. 


Ninth house: Ninth house is said to be the house of fortune. In ancient scriptures it 
has been mentioned only as the house of religion. It is said that fortune depends on the 
pious deeds of a person. Profession, occupation, business and livelihood are predicted 
by the house of fortune. Besides, blessings from deities, luck, hopes and results 
according to one's qualifications are also determined on the basis of this house. The 
Period/Sub-period of the lord of ninth house tells of advent of good luck, promotion, 
wealth, status, happiness and prosperity. The lord of ninth house causes misfortune, 
poverty, distress and disgrace to a person if it is malefic or a malefic Sub-periodnath 
falls in the ninth house from Periodnatha. The native has to face slur and disrepute. 
The house also tells of the son or grandson and sagacity of progeny of the native. 


Tenth house: Ancient scholars have showered unreserved praises upon this house. 
Saint Tulsidas has said in a couplet "Karma Pradhan Vishwa Kari Rakha, Jo Jas 
Karahi So Tas Fal Chakha". The implied meaning of this coupletis that the world is the 
field of work where one reaps what one sows. And who else could know this better 
than an astrological horoscope? Ina horoscope, ninth house is the house of religion, 
10th of duty and right after that 11th house is of gains and benefits. It appears as if 
there is clear declaration that welfare of people and altruism based on religious tenets 
render true benefits. That is the true earning of a living being who keeps wandering life 
after life in this universe. 


As mentioned by the ancient sages, malefic planets like Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and 
Ketu too instigate a person perform acts of social welfare (Yajna Karma) if they are 
strong and posited in tenth house (being aspected by or conjoined with a benefic 
planet in own or in a friendly by quarter). The native proves to be a saviour of people 
and provides food to them. Ifthe lord of tenth house is benefic and aspected by or 
conjoined with a benefic planet, it creates a situation for the native to earn promotion, 
dignity, prestige and grandeur. 


Dasha Prediction 61 


Labha Sthana (Eleventh house): Eleventh house from Lagna is known as house of 
gain and income. This house is also called Trishadaya (3,6, 11) and considered to be 
malefic. It has been experienced that the Period/Sub-period of the lord of 11 th house 
gives auspicious result. In this Period/Sub-period gain of wealth from various sources 
is possible but physical and mental problem gets added up. This Period is considered 
to be malefic only because it causes mental tension, animosity, tension in family, loss 
of peace etc. 


Eleventh house: Probably brings physical discomfort. Period/Sub-period of the lord 
of eleventh house causes physical problem and deterioration in health though it may 
give lots of wealth also. Periodnatha and Sub-period (Sub period) of the enemy of the 
lord of Lagna cause distress and affliction if they fall in the Period of the lord of eleventh 
house (Labhesha). Eleventh house is the house of death of mother (since it is eighth 
from fourth house). Therefore, the Period/Sub-period of the lord of eleventh house 
(Labhesha) can cause distress or even death to the mother. Death of the mother is 
possible if Gochar Saturn is conjoined or aspected in the eleventh house in the Period 
and Sub-period of the lord of eleventh house (Labhesha). 


Twelfth house: By this house, things like expenses, loss, destruction etc. are 
considered. It is considered to be malefic because it is a part of Trik Bhava (6, 8, 12). 
But there is a difference of opinions. Some scholars consider it to be the house of 
wealth and grandeur. According to Maharshi Parashar the lords of 2nd and 12th houses 
are even (Sam) and so give results according to the auspicious strength (aspected or 
conjoined) of their other signs. The lord of twelfth house also gives result of the house 
it is posited in or of the planet it is conjoined with or aspected by in its Period/Sub- 
period. 


It can be said without any hesitation that a person may lead a life full of happiness and 
grandeur and the sphere of prosperity gets enhanced in the Sub-period of a benefic/ 
Yogakaraka planet in the Period of the lord of twelfth house. 


A benefic planet in Gochar, being posited in twelfth house and conjoined or aspected, 
makes a native generous. He or she spends on religious activities, charity and altruism. 


Period/Sub-period of different planets in different houses: 


The Period of a planet posited in Lagna tells of physical comfort and disease-free 
health of a native. He becomes enthusiast, full of fervour and content. He gets wealth 
and grandeur also. 


The Period of a planet posited in the house of wealth tells of nice food. In this Period a 
person may lead a happy family life with wife and sons. The Period also tells of good 
education and speaking skill. The sphere of wealth of the native gets enhanced. He 
enjoys pleasure of wealth and grandeur. Auspicious celebrations in the family are 
slated. 


52 Dasha Prediction 


The Period of a planet in third house tells of affection of brother, courage, valour and

Some Rules for making prediction 


We have studied the general natural results of the planets. Following are the rules to 
make prediction. 


1. A planet gives good results in its period-sub-period if it is situated in its own 
house, own Navamsha, in a friendly house (Mitragrahi), in an exalted sign and in 
its own Dreshkana (Decanate). Italso gives good results if it is posited in Angle 
(Quadrant) and trine (Trikaona) and the lord of the sign (the lord of the house in 
which the planet is situated) and the lord of Navamsha (the lord of Navamsha 
sign) are conjoined with Shadbal. 


2. Aplanet, situated in an inimical house, inimical Novamsha and inimical Dreshkana 
orin 6th, 8th or 12th house, gives unfavorable results in its PeriodntraPeriod. 


3. The Period Swami gives favourable results in the Sub period of its friendly planets 
if it is benefic and strong. 


4. Unfavourable result is bestowed in the Major period or Sub period of a debilitated 
orweak planet. 


5. A natural malefic planet gives inauspicious result if it is posited in an inimical 
sign. 


6. Anatural benefic planet gives less auspicious result if it is posited in an inimical 
sign. 


7. The result of a house, in which the planet is situated in its Ashtaka Varga, gets 
ruined if there are bindhu less than benefic bindu. 


8. (a) Subdashanath renders unfavourable result if it is posited in 6th, 8th or 12th 
house from Major dashanath 


(b) A planet gives favourable result if it is situated in Angle ortrine and 2nd, and 
11+h houses. 


(c) Aplanet gives unfavourable result if it is situated in seventh house.

The natural friendship between dashanath and Sub period nath should also be 
kept in view. For example, Saturn in Major period of the Sun or the Sun in Major 
period of Saturn gives unfavourable result because both are natural enemies of 
each other. 


Prediction can also be made according to the order of Sub dashanath from 
dashanath. Order of 3, 5 and 7 gives unfavourable result. For example, Sub period 
of Venus in Major period of Jupiter gives unfavourable result since it is 5th from 
Jupiter according to the order. Sub period of Saturn in Major period of Rahu gives 
inauspicious result since Period of Satur is third from Period of Rahu according 
to the order. 


The Sun, Saturn, Rahu and lords of their signs (Rasheesh) and constellation and 
lord of Navamsha (Navamshesha) bear their influence. 


The Sun, Saturn, Rahu and the lord of 12th house get the house and planet 
separated from Karakatva on whom they put their influence. 


A sign house or planet always has the influence of the planet posited in the tenth 
house from it. 


First, fifth and ninth houses represent Agni Tatwa (fire) in a horoscope. Second, 
seventh and eleventh houses represent Vayu Tatwa (air), third, sixth and tenth 
represent Prithvi Tatwa (Earth) whereas fourth, eighth and twelfth houses represent 
Jala Tatwa (water). 


A planet gives result according to the element of the house itis posited in. For 
example, the Sun is the planet of the house representing Agni Tatwa (fire). But if it 
is posited in fourth, eight or twelfth house, it will give result related to Jala Tatwa 
(water) also. 


The lord of a sign will give result related to the planet situated in that sign. Suppose 
the Sun is situated in Libra. So, Venus will give result dissimilar to that of the Sun. 


A planet, being lord of a benefic house, cannot give good result if it is posited in or 
conjoined with or aspected by a malefic planet. But it does not mean that it gives 
unfavourable result. 


Lords of malefic houses prove to be auspicious for the metals of their houses but 
inauspicious for the native if they are strong. Ifthey are weak, they cause harm to 
the metals but give auspicious result to the native. 


Dasha Prediction 65 


Every house has got two sides -1 .Native and 2. Metal. A malefic planet gives materials 
(wealth, vehicle, land, clothes etc.) if it is strong. But it keeps the native afflicted. It 
makes him go on trips and tours to earn money but causes him diseases and accidents. 
He suffers from mental disease. He remains deprived of everything if the malefic of a 
house is weak. But in this case he remains gratified psychologically. 


Horoscope (Lagna Kundali) 


NINA 


Sy 


NOLIN 


This is the horoscope of the former prime Minister of India late Indira Gandhi. 


Sub-period of Venus started in the Major period of Saturn in December 1976. Saturn 
is the lord of seventh and eighth houses and is situated in Lagna in an inimical sign. 


So, itis the enemy of Lagna. Venus is posited in sixth house. It is the lord of fourth and 
seventh houses. Lagnesha is the enemy of Moon. It is posited with Rahu. She was 
defeated in election when the Sub-period of Saturn and Venus started in her horoscope. 
Her colleagues left her and she was sent to jail also. Saturn and Venus are 6 to 8 from 
each other. Sub-period of the Sun started in January 1980. The Sun is the friend of 
Lagnesha and is posited in trine. So, she emerged as the prime minister again. But 
the lord of twelfth house is situated in the fifth. Itis conjoined with the Sun, so she was 
bereaved of her son. 


17. Sub-periodnath gives unfavorable result if it is the enemy of Periodnath or Lagnesh 
and is situated in a malefic house and conjoined with or aspected by a malefic 
planet. 


So Sub-period of Mercury in Mars and Sub-period of Saturn in the Sun give 
unfavourable result.

Periodnath and Sub-periodnath give the same result that is common between the 
two. 


Saturn is the lord of seventh and eighth houses in the horoscope of Smt. Indira 
Gandhi. Saturn as lord of eighth house deprives a person of power. Venus being 
lord of the second house from tenth makes him acquire power. Power is common 
between the two. So, she was deprived of power due to the combination of Saturn 
and Venus. 


If Saturn and the lords of 6th, 8th and 12thhouses are debilitated or combust and 
Lagnesh is strong, no unfavourable result is rendered in the Period of Lagnesha 
and in the Sub-period of Saturn and 6th, 8th and 12th houses. 


If Periodnath is a natural benefic planet (Venus, Jupiter) and is also the lord ofa 
fatal (Maraka) house then death is possible in the Sub-period of the lord of the 
eights house. 


The lord of eighth house does not cause death even if itis fatal. 


Rahu and Ketu do not have their own influence. They give result according to a 
planet they are conjoined with or aspected by. Similarly they give result according 
to the lord of the house they are posited in even if they are not conjoined with a 
planet. They also render result according to the lord of the Navamsha they are 
situated in. 


A benefic planet gives result according to its strength. A natural malefic planet will 
not be able to cause any harm to the native if it is weak. (But it will not give him 
wealth as well). 


A planet will give most unfavourable result in its period-sub-period if it is debilitated 
or weak. 


A planet cannot give any result if it is posited on the junction of two houses (Bhava 
Sandhi). 


The native suffers from fear of the government, thieves, fire, accident, enemies 
etc. if Sub-period of the lord of third, fifth, seventh, eighth or Lagna is in the Major 
period of a malefic planet.

Vimshottari Dasha 


Vimshottari Dasha system is based on constellation. This system is used throughout 
India. The system is recognised by all. 


It is based on the lordship of a planet. The native can have result according to the 
house of which the planet is the lord. So, it is essential to know the Karakatva of the 
house and the merit of the lord of it.

Prediction on the basis of Karkatva of the houses. 


According to Maharshis and scholars there are twelve parts of a horoscope. There 
may be any sign in a house, but the Karakatva of the house remains constant. A planet 
situated in a house enhances its Karakatva. But the Karkatva of a house does not 
change in any case. For example, the first house is said to be Tanu Bhava. It signifies 
the physical health of a person. It will show physical condition even if there might be 
any sign or a planet posited in it. So, the house has got its own importance something 
different from that of the other things.

2. Anugunaja: Result rendered by the planet according to be posited in the house 
or by the association of other planets or by their aspect is called Anugunaja result 
of the planet or planets. 


3. Yogaja result: Result rendered due to mutual relation of the planets is said to be 
Yogaja result. In Astrology there are four types of relation: 


(a) Relationship due Exchange house: If the planets are posited in the signs 
of each other is called relation with the house. 


(b) Relationship due to aspect: Aspect of the planets on each other is called 
Drishti Sambandha,

Chapter-15 


Prediction of Vimshottari Dasha 


It is essential to follow the rules ordained by Maharshi Parashar to study Vimshottari 
Dasha. Maharshi Parashar has classified the lords of the houses in a horoscope in 
the following manner. 


1. 


Lords of trine (1,5,9) give auspicious results. Jupiter, Venus, Shukla Pakshiya 
(moonlit night of a lunar month) Moon and Mercury conjoined with a benefic planet 
are considered to be natural benefic planets whereas Saturn, Mars, Rahu, Ketu, 
Moon between Tithi 5 of Krishan Paksh to Awavasya (last day of a dark fortnight) 
and Mercury conjoined with a malefic planet are considered to be natural malefic 
ones. According to the Acharyas of Hora Shastra natural benefic planets give 
favourable result whereas natural malefic ones give unfavourable in their period 
and Sub-period. But the lords of trine - whether benefic or malefic planets- give 
favourable results. 


Lords of 3rd, 6th and 11 th houses (Trishadaya) always give unfavourable result - 
in both the cases whether they are natural benefic or malefic planet. 


(a) Natural benefic planets do not give auspicious result if they are the lords of 
Kendra. 


(b) Natural malefic planets do not give inauspicious result if they are the lords of 
Kendra. 


According to the writer of Hora Shastra, as the lord of a Kendra, a planet does not 
give its natural benefic result. Likewise a natural malefic planet does not give its 
natural malefic result if it is the lord of a Kendra. But it does not mean that the 
benefic planets being the lords of Kendra always give inauspicious result. They 
do not give favourable result and become neutral. Same is the case with the natural 
malefic planets also. We shall now study the result given by a neutral planet in its 
Period and Sub-period. 


Dasha Prediction 73 


4. 


74 


The lords of the twelth and second house gives neutral results. How a neutral 
planet gives results 


a. Each planet has been allotted two signs except Sun and Moon. Therefore neutral 
planet gives results according to the other house it has been allotted.Ifthe other 
sign is in 3rd, 6th or 11th house the neutral planet will give malefic results. If the 
other sign is in trine houses, it will give benefic results. 


b. Ifthe lord of twelth or 2nd house is Sun or Moon, how they will render their 
results? They will give result according to the association or aspect or position 
(PAC). If they are conjuncted with or aspected by or posited in benefic house they 
will give benefic results. If they are associated or aspected by malefic planet or 
posited in 6th 8th or 12th house, they will give malefic results. 


These rules are also applicable to the lords of kendras and 2nd & 12th house. But 
the signs of Jupiter and Mercury are in Kendras from each other. Ifthe lagna is of 
Jupiter or Mercury sign, they become the lords of kendras. In such cases two 
benefic planets becomes neutral. It is called Kendradhipati dosh. Venus suffers 
from maximum effect of Kendradhipati dosha. Next comes Jupiter and then 
Mercury. 


According to the rules one who is Lord of lagna gives benefic results and one who 
is lord of 7th house, maraka house gives malefic results. The lagna lord is also 
free from the dosha of being lord of 8th or 6th. 


The lord of 8th house gives malefic results. 


If Jupiter becomes the lord of trine (5th or 9th), it will be also lord of 6th or 8th 
house, malefic house. In such cases the rule is that the Jupiter being natural benefic 
and also the lord of benefic house, will give benefic results. 


But experience says that it will become neutral and results will be decided by its 
position, association or aspect (PAC). In case of Saturn, itis lord of 5th & 6th or 
8th and 9th or 10th & 11 th, what type of results it will give? According to rules, the 
Saturn is a natural malefic planet and also lord of a malefic house. It will give 
malefic results only. 


Same is the case with the Sun or the Moon posited in Cancer or Leo in its own 
sign. What result will the Moon or the Sun give as the lord of the second or twelth 
house and is situated in any of the two houses without any other planet? The 
Moon orthe Sun will give favourable result if it is situated in the second house in 
its own sign because none of them is malefic despite being the lords of second 


Dasha Prediction 


and twelth houses. The two planets will act as Maraka because Marakesh is formed 
if the Period of the two planets exists at the end of the Ayurday Khand. On the 
contrary, both the planets will give malefic result if they are posited in the twelfth 
house in their own signs. Twelfth house is also the Vyay Bhava. Some scholars 
call it Maraka Bhava also. The Moon is mind and the Sun is soul. Each of them is 
a Lagna. So, the position of any of the two in the Vyaya Bhava will be malefic for 
Lagna, as | suppose. 


5. According to the writer of Laghuparashari 


"Bhagyavyayadhipatyen Randhresho Na Shubhapradah". This means that the lord 
of the eighth house being Vyayadheesh (i.e. 12th house) does not give auspicious 
result 


Here too it is said that it does not give good result. It has not been said that it gives 
bad result. Same thing has been said about the lords of a Kendras and we have 
acknowledged it. So, the lord of the eighth house too should be acknowledged as 
a neutral planet as even Dr. B.V. Raman does. But according to some other writers 
of Horashastra, it is malefic since the writer of Laghuparashari has himself 
mentioned lord of eighth house as Rajayoga Bhangakaraka. 


In practice too it has been noticed that the lord of eighth house causes trouble to 
the house it is posited in or to the Bhavadhipati posited in eighth house. So, we 
shall make prediction of Period-sub Period by considering lord of eighth house 
as malefic. 


6. If Lagnesha is the lord of 8th, it does not give malefic results. Lagnesha does not 
bear the inauspiciousness of lordship of eighth house. So it gives auspicious 
result. 


Same is the case when Lagnesh is lord of 6th also as it is lord of kendra and trine 
it always gives benefic results. 


When lagna is Libra, Venus is the lord of lagna and 8th house. Similarly, Mars and 
Venus are the lords of Lagna and sixth house in Scorpio and Taurus. They are 
Rajayoga Bhangakarak and do not bear the inauspiciousness of the lords and of 
eighth and sixth houses. So, they give good result. 


But it has been noticed that in this situation the planets turn neutral and render 
result according to association and position in the house (PAC). This situation 
emerges due to the position of Venus and Mars in the Lagnas of Rashis. Mars is 


Dasha Prediction 75 


7g 


a natural malefic planet and Venus bear the inauspiciousness most of 
Kendradhipati dosha. So, it is better to consider both the planets as neutral. 


Lagna is both Kendra and Trine. So, Lagnesh lord of Kendra & trine is both 
Kendresha and lord of trine. Itbecomes Rajayogakarak. 


So, Lagna gives good result particularly in its period-sub-period. That is why it 
does not bear the inauspiciousness of the lords of sixth and eighth houses. But 
according to the Jataka classics bad result is caused by the position of Lagnesha 
in eighth house, lord of the eighth in eighth house or Lagnesha in eighth house 
being the lord of eighth. 


So, Lagnesha being lord of eighth house gives unfavourable result if it is posited 
in the first or eighth house. If it cannot render good result being posited in its own 
sign then how can it give good result being situated in any other house? Therefore, 
the students are advised to consider Lagnesha and the lord of eighth house to be 
neutral to have better result. 


Jupiter and Venus give unfavourable result if they are the lords of second or seventh 
house. 


Jupiter and Venus are natural benefic planets. They give unfavourable result if 
they happen to be the lords of second or seventh house. Mercury and the Moon 
become malefic if they are the lords of the said houses, however they are benefic. 
These planets do not give auspicious result in their period-sub-period. According 
to the Jataka authors this demerit is found only with thebenefic planets. The malefic 
planets will become much malefic if they are the lords of a house that makes 
benefic planet malefic. Their period-sub-period will be very much inauspicious. 
According to some scholars the malefic planets do not have this demerit. But the 
Marakatva of the malefic planets becomes strong if they happen to be the lords of 
the second or the seventh house. 


The Marakatva of a planet becomes powerful if it is posited in its own sign in the 
second or seventh houses. 


Itis better to contemplate Rahu and Ketu to be neutral. 


Rahu and Ketu give result in their Sub period according to the house they are 
posited in or according to the lord of the house they are conjoined with. They give 
favourable result if they are in Trine, whereas in Trishadaya they give unfavourable 
result. But this result is possible only when they are not conjoined or aspected by 
with any other planets. They give result according to the lord of the house also with 


Dasha Prediction 


10. 


whom they are posited. So, in this situation the prediction should be made on the 
basis of benefic and malefic nature of both the house and the lord of the house. 
They give result as a Yogakaraka planet if they are posited in a Kendra with the 
lord of a Trine or in a Trine with the lord of a Kendra. 


Rahu and Ketu give unfavourable result if they are posited in Trishadaya with the 
lord of Trishadaya whereas if posited in the second or seventh house with the lord 
of a Kendra, they give mixed result. 


Rahu and Ketu give mixed result according to the strength and weakness if they 
are posited in Trine with the lord of Trishadaya or in a Trishadaya with the lord of 
aTrine. 


The lords or Kendra and Trine give auspicious result if they are not conjoined with 
the lord of any other house. 


Every planet has two signs excepting the Sun and the Moon. So, their being the 
lord of Trikona or Kendra, the other sign might be in third or eighth house. In this 
situation the lord of Kendra or Trine becomes faulty. Auspicious result is likely, if 
the lords of Kendra, and Trine are conjoined with each other and are posited in a 
friendly sign, Exalted sign and a benefic house. To make it more clear, it can be 
said that if conjoined with each other, the strong lords of Kendra and Trine give 
auspicious result, even when they are not conjoined with the lord of any other 
house. 


According to Shri Shukdeva Chaturvedi only the faulty lords of the tenth and ninth 
houses alone can give favourable result if they are conjoined, but not of any other 
lord of Kendra or lord of trine. 


In nutshell Maharshi Parashar has categorised the planets into five categories. 
1. Marak planets: Lords of the second and seventh houses. 

Malefic planets: Lords of Trishadaya and eighth houses. 
” Benefic planets: Lords of Trine and Lagna. 


Neutral planets: Lords of Kendra and second and twelfth houses.

Yogakaraka planets: A planet is called Yogakarak if it is the lord of both the 
Kendra and Trine, for example Mars in the Lagna of Cancer and Leo, Saturn 
in the Lagna of Libra and Taurus, Venus in the Lagna of Capricorn and 
Aquarius. 


Which type of results will accrue during the major period of Rajayogakaraka planet 
and related (a) maraka planet (b) malefic planet (c) benefic planet.

Sub-period of the related Maraka planet enhances Rajayoga, though very short, 
during the Period of Rajayogakaraka. Sub-period of a malefic planet renders 
Rajayoga-though not to a great deal. But the Sub-period of the concernedbenefic 
planet gives Rajayoga to a great extent. 


The major period and sub-period of the Yogakaraka planets gives good result. 
The Antardasha and prtyantar sub periods of the benefic planets (benefic according 
to horoscope) give auspicious result in the major Period or Sub period of 
Yogakaraka planets though they are not related with them. 


A Yogakaraka planet gives auspicious result if it is associated with the lord of 
Trine. It gives auspicious result even if it is associated with the blemished lord of 
Kendra but not with the lord of any other house. 


The Yogagakaraka planets do not give Yogaja result if they are associated with 
the lord of the eighth house or eleventh house. 


Ithas been said above that Yogaja result is more or less possible ifthe blemished 
lords of Kendra and Trine are conjoined with each other and lord of Kenda 
blemished or lord of trine becomes if its second sign falls in the third or sixih 
house. tn this situation too the lords of Kendra and Trine give auspicious result if 
they are conjoined with each other and no other planet has any relationship. 


it means that the other sign of Kendresha or Tikonesha does not give auspicious 
result if it falls in the eighth or the eleventh house. 


. Aplanet does not give result either favourable or unfavourable, Karaka or Maraka- 


inthe Sub period of its own in its own Major period. 


A planet gives result in the Sub period of the planet with which it is associated 
with or in the Sub period of a Sadharmi planet during the periods of related planet 
or his planet having the same qualities. 


There are four kinds of association i.e. conjunction that have been mentioned 
earlier. A planet having the same qualities of some other planet is called 
Sahadharmi of the other, for example Kendresha-Kendresha, lord of trine-lord of 
trine Trishadayadhisha or the lords of the second and twelfth houses. All these 
planets are Sahadharmi. Likewise Lagnesha-lord of seventh house, lord of fourth 
house-lord of tenth house, lord of third house-lord of eleventh house, lord of ninth 
house-lord of fifth house, lord of sixth house-lord of eighth house - all are 
Sahadharmi planet. 


Mixed result is rendered in the Sub period of a planet that is Vipareetdharmi or 
the planet have opposite qualities. So, it is advised to make prediction carefully. 


Dasha Prediction 


18. 


20. 


A planet having opposite qualities other planet is called Viruddhadharni of the 
other, as Karaka-Maraka, benefic-malefic, Karaka-malefic. All these are 
Viruddhadharni of each other. 


. It is known that the Sub period of the lord of Trine gives good result if it is in or 


conjoined with the Major period of Kendra. Similarly, the Sub period of the lord of 
Kendra renders favourable result if it is associated with the Major period of the 
lord of Trine. But if there is no relation between the lords of the two then no 
auspicious result is rendered in the Major period of Kendresha and in the Sub 
period of lord of trine or in the Major period of lord of trine and in the Sub period of 
Kendresha. The Sub period of Kendresha or lord of trine does not give favourable 
result if there is no relation between the lords of the two. 


The Sub period of a benefic planet, whether conjoined or not, gives favourable 
result if it is in the Major period of a Yogakaraka planet. 


. Rahu/Ketu posited in a benefic house (5th and 9th), give good result in the Sub 


period of a Yogakaraka planet whether they are conjoined with it or not. 


According to some scholars Rahu/Ketu give favourable result in the Sub period of 
a Yogakaraka planet if they are situated in a Kendra (particularly in fourth and 
tenth houses) no maiter, they are conjoined with some other planet or not. (A 
planet gives unfavourable result if it is situated in the seventh house since itis a 
Maraka house). 


ifthe major period is of a malefic planet : 


(a) During the major period of a malefic planet and sub-period of non related 
benefic planet, there will be malefic results. 


(b) If the ord of sub period is related benefic planet, there will be mixed results. 


(c) An extremely unfavourable result is rendered in the Sub period of a 
Yogakaraka planet non-related. 


(d) Aplanet gives mixed results in the Sub period of a related Yogakaraka planet 
related. According to some scholars, favourable results are rendered in this 
situation. 


Lord of Trishadaya and the lord of the eighth house and malefic Marakesha 
and Kendresh having their second signs posited in Trishadaya or in the eighth 
house are considered to be malefic. Trikonesh is considered to be benefic if 
its second sign is not posited in Trishadaya or in the eighth house.

Kendresha and lord of trine, that are conjoined with each other but not 
conjoined with any other planet, are considered to be the Yogakaraka planets. 


(e) Unfavourable result are rendered in the Sub period of a neutral (even) planet 
whether it is conjoined or not. But the result is lesser than that rendered in the 
Sub period of benefic/Yogakaraka planet. 


(f) The Sub period of a malefic planet gives unfavourable result whether the 
planet is conjoined or not. 


The Sub period of a benefic planet does not cause death to a native in the Major 
period of a Maraka planet it is related with. 


It means that only the Sub period of a malefic planet causes death in the Major 
period of a Maraka planet, no matter whether it is related with it or not of course. 
A related malefic planet causes death. 


(a) Venus gives good and evil results of Saturn if its Sub period falls in the Major 
period of Saturn. 


(b) Saturn gives good and evil results of Venus if its Sub period falls in the Major 
period of Venus. It is not important for them to be related with or be 
Sahadharmi. There is a natural relation between Saturn and Venus. If the 
sign of Saturn is as lagna i.e. Capricorn or Aquarius Venus become 
yogakarak. in the sign of Venus as lagna i.e. Taurus or Libra, Saturn is 
yogakaraka planet. So there is natural relationship between Saturn and Venus. 


(c) The major period-sub-period gives inauspicious result if Venus and Saturn 
are strong. 


(d) Auspicious result is rendered if one is strong and the other is weak. 


(e) Boththe planets, though being weak, give good result if they are the lords of 
6th, 8th or 12th, or are conjoined with the lords of 6th, 8th and 12th. 


(f) Both give good results even if one is benefic and the other malefic. 
The following major period-sub-period also gives unfavourable results. 


(a) The major periods of the lords of constellations that are 3rd, 5th and 7th from 
birth star give unfavourable result. 


(b) Major Period-sub-period of the lord of the eighth house and of the lord of the 
sign in which the Moon is posited. 


(c) The Period of Saturn if it is the fourth Period i.e. the Bhogya Period of Mars.

The period of a planet posited on the degree either of the beginning or of the 
end 


(g) The period of the lords of 6th, 8th and 12th houses. 


(h) Anatural malefic planet posited in a debilitated or inimical sign or in the sixth 
or eleventh house (Phaldeepika) gives malefic results. 


(i) During the major period of malefic second lord & sub-period a natural malefic 
planet, malefic results are obtained. 


(j) lf anatural malefic planet is posited in the second house and is conjoined 
with some other natural malefic planet then in that case, period-sub-periods 
of both the planets give unfavourable result. (Sarvartha Chintamani). 


(k) Marriage of a native takes place during the Sub period of the lord of the 
second or the seventh house. 


() Birth of achild takes place during the major period-sub-period of lord of trine 
orin Sub period lord of trine. 


So, itis advised to make prediction on the basis of the good and evil results of major 
period-sub-period and by going through the strength of the planet on the basis of 
Shadbal. Shadbal shows the strength only and does not reflect the good and evil results. 
The results can be predicted only on the P.A.C. of the planets in the houses of a 
horoscope alongwith their lordship. By Shadbal, only the quantity of the strength is 
determined. 


By it, we know as to how much wealth a native will get. But whether he will get wealth or 
not is determined by the results given by period-sub-period. So, to examine the major 
period-sub-period is also very important. Here, the results in major period-sub-period 
according to the Vimshottari system have been explained in brief. 


Swochche Swagehe Yadi Va Trikone Varge Swakeeyetha Chatushtaye Va. 
Nastangato Noshubha Drishtiyukto Janmadhipah Shyachchhubhadah Swapake. 


A planet gives auspicious result in its major period-sub-period if it is situated in its 
exalted sign, in its own sign or Moola Trine, or in own house in Shadvarga or in Kendra 
oris not combusted from the Sun and is not aspected by a malefic planet. 


Benefic planets posited in Trishadaya give good result during their early stage whereas 


Dasha Prediction 81 


malefic ones posited in 3rd, 6th and 11th houses render bliss of wealth, wife and 
children during the later stage of their life. 


Baladhivastha also denotes some different stage of life and that is Baladi Avastha or 
Vriddhavastha according to the degrees of planets. 


A weak or malefic planet gives mixed result if it becomes benefic in Navamsha Kundali. 
Conversely a planet situated in an exalted sign gives mixed result if it becomes weak 
in Navamsha Kundali. 


Period of a planet heading from debilitated sign towards an exalted one happens to 
be auspicious whereas that of a planet coming down from an exalted sign towards 
debilitated becomes inauspicious as stated by the scholars.

Prediction of Yogini Dasha 


In this age of time, a man has not much time to spare. He wants to get ahead fast as 

-much as he can. Possibilities of accidents have grown high in this fast moving world. 
Life has become very much risky and its span has lessened. So, the use of Yogini 
Dasha has proved to be accurate more than the other systems. 


According to Maharshi Parashar there are eight Yogini Dashas and there order is 
fixed as that of the planets in Vimshottari Dasha. 


Mangala 
Pingala 
Dhanya Jupiter 


Bhramari Mars 


Bhadrika Mercury 


Ulka Saturn 


Siddha Venus 


Sankata Rahu 


No body can save a native if he falls prey to the adverse Period of Yogini. So, it is 
advised to adopt the remedies prescribed against the planet concerned to save oneself 
from the evil effects of the Period. 


Yogini Dasha Sadhana 


Digit 3 should be added to the number of the constellation in which the Moon is posited 
at the time of birth of a native and cIleey by 8 thereafter. The remainder will be the 
seg Dasha.

The Abhijit constellation has not been given place in this cycle. The Period Varsha of 
these periods are 1,2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively. One recurrence of it is of 36 
years. 


The Vimshottari Dasha method is adopted to know the Bhukta Bhogya Kala of the 
Period. Suppose that we have to find out the Bhramari Yogini Dasha of a native. The 
Moon is in Ashwini constellation at 10° 


13°-20'=800' Number of years at minute =4 yrs. 


10° = 10 x 60 = 600 = 


=3 years 


These three years are Bhukta years and the remainder 4-3=1 year which is Bhogya 
year. Thus the native has to bear the effect of Bhramari Yogini Daya for one more year. 
Take one more example. Suppose that the Chandra Spashta is 11 R 20°-55". So, the 
number of Moon in Rewati constellation is 27. 


84 Dasha Prediction 


. 27+3=30+ 8 =6 (Remainder). 


This shows that the Ulka Yogini Dasha is going on. The measure (Man) of Rewati 
constellation in the sign of Pisces is 11R and from 16-40 to 30°. 


Longitude of Moon (Chandra Spashta) is 11 R. 20° - 55'. So, the Moon is Bukta in 
Rewati constellation. , 


(11/20-55) - (11/16-40) = 4° - 15'= 255 Minute 


Bhukta Period year = 6, if the measure 13° - 20' = 800'

In Yogini Dasha also there are eight Sub periods like that of Vimshottari Dasha. Same 
rule is applied here also.

Suppose, we have to find out the time of Sub period of the Sankata Yogini Dasha in 
the Ulka Yogini Dasha. 


So, 6x8

Krishna Paksha. According to some others, Period begins from Krittika. But it is not 
accepted by all. These days almost all astrologers make prediction of Ashtottari Period

the result of Bhavachipati. At the outset of the book, results of natural Period and Sub 
period have been mentioned. Those results should be kept in view while making
