PREFATORY REMARKS

TO THE CANDID READER.

“ My Bookseller tells vie the demandfor those my papers increases daily."

Addison.

In again reverting to the interesting subject of planetary influence, I

cannot but express my warmest and most grateful acknowledgments, for

the kind support (and I might, without vanity, subjoin applause,) which
my writings have uniformly received, from the liberal and enlightened
of almost every class of readers.

Scarcely has the Sun rolled thrice through the vaulted heaven, since
the author first boldly adventured his writings upon the ocean of public
opinion ; but securing them in the bark of truth, they have had the
proud satisfaction of stemming the torrent and weathering the gale,

with calm and placid serenity : while hundreds of their more dazzling
and adventurous contemporaries, who set sail with them, crowded with
the full canvass of favourable criticism, and swelled with the fair wind
of ephemeral applause, have been engulphed in the lethe of public con-
tempt ; or after striking against the rocks of candid and impartial (but
to them fatal) enquiry, have at last, wearied with the perils of their dis-
astrous voyage, perchance, arrived at the desired haven of particular
patronage—merely to be consigned to “the tomb of all the Capulets,”
where “ their names are no more remembered,” and their merits are
blotted for ever from the world of standard literature.'—Neither has the
success of the author’s writings been confined to England, nor to the
British dominions ; but “ the Astrologer” has reached the burning
plains of fertile India ; and has even set at defiance the mighty waters
of the vast Atlantic, reaching even the shores of the new world ;—where
the phalanx of prejudice, so usually arrayed against every thing meri-
torious out of “ the track of custom,” has failed to stop its extraordinary
career.—For these victorious exertions in “ the science of the stars,”
the author himself claims nothing praiseworthy.—Truth only, invincible
truth, has been the magic talisman, at whose display these grand advan-
tages have been gained

In the present volume, I have studiously avoided recording any thing
which might be deemed superfluous, and at the same time, have been
equally carefui to refrain from omitting any thing of real utility in a sci-
entific way. This the reader will at once perceive, in the Perpetual
Tables of the Sun’s right ascension ; by which a “ Theme of Heaven,”



;

vi PREFATORY REMARKS.

or horoscope, may be cast, for any time, either past, present, or future,
with singular facility, and without any reference to the celestial globe,
the planisphere, or even the Ephemeris. The table of the “ Planetary
Dignities,” will at once evince the superiority of my system, over the sys-
tems of former sidereal authors ; in which the brevity and consequent
facility in becoming acquainted therewith, is only to be equalled by its

experimental certainty. The nature and properties of “ the Planetary
Orbs,” the “Celestial Signs,” and of “the Houses of Heaven,” are the
result of a most sedulous enquiry for a series of years, into this part of
nature’s secrets ; added to which, they are enriched with many valuable
discoveries from original and costly manuscripts ; but at the same time
they are entirely divested of the superstitions and absurdities of the dark
ages.—Those absurdities which have hitherto been the reproach of As-
trology, but for which the ancients may be well excused, without im-
peaching their candour ; since the vacuum in the system, which the dis-

covery of Herschel supplies, might well be supposed to lead to the
adoption of many erroneous rules, by those persons who found the sci-
ence itself to stand the united test of reason and demonstration.
Enough of Astronomy is given to render the Newtonian system of the

universe intelligible to general readers, which, being described in as popu-
lar a manner as the subject would permit, it is presumed will be an extra
attraction to the work, and may cause it to become a source of scientific

information, even to the most casual enquirer ; clearness and precision
herein having been most particularly the author’s chief aim, in which
he trusts he has succeeded sufficiently to merit notice.

In the latter part of the work, where the author has treated of “ the
Doctrine of Nativities,” &c. his rules for ascertaining the particulars of in-
dividual fate, are, he presumes, superior to what any other author has
given ; being founded on a true philosophical attention to cause and
effect, the result of actual observation, and therefore far more valuable
than if they were the mere assertions of a former writer. The author
likewise requests particular attention to his important discovery relative
to the method of foreknowing those particular times of life, which are
likely to prove more fortunate, or more remarkable than others, by the
theory of “ Celestial Periods a discovery which, after years of unre-
mitting and patient labor, he feels proud in submitting to the notice even
of the most erudite student in the art ; as thereby may be perceived
many hidden beauties in this sublime science, which would otherwise
have escaped observation, while the peculiar simplicity, yet elegance, of
the theory, and the demonstration it affords, will amply repay the stu-
dent for the trifling pains he may take in acquiring it.

Next to the foregoing, may be mentioned, the easy rules which the
author has laid down for finding and equating the various Celestial Arcs
of Direction, in nativities, whether primary or progressive—the method
of solving Horary Questions and the brevity but perspicuity of the
theory he has given, for foreseeing the destinies and revolutions of king-
doms, thrones, and empires, which constitute what is termed State Astro-
logy. Being deduced from the actual position of the heavenly bodies at
the instant of any eclipse, comet, solar ingress, or other celestial pheno-
mena. These, with various other subjects of importance, will be found
to render the principal part of the book most peculiarly interesting,
and replete with select instruction in the different branches of the As-
tral science.

PREFATORY REMARKS. VII

and when we come to examine that miraculous sympathy in nature, so
admirably manifested between the heavenly bodies and the amazing
body of water surrounding our earth, which is incessantly agitated by
sympathetic influence, we are involuntarily brought to think of the doc-
trine of this ancient sage. No fact in philosophy is more indisputable,
than that which assures us of the influence of the Sun, Moon, Flanets,
and Stars, on the Earth and its inhabitants. The continual and pe-
riodical change in the weather—the constant and the variable winds to
which particular climates are subject—the phenomena peculiar to the
several seasons, and many other effects that might, were it necessary, be
pointed out ; are proofs which render the existence of such planetary
influence unquestionable. There is, however, one means more visible

than either of those before mentioned, by which the reality of Astro-
logical influence may be exemplified, and pretty well estimated ; and
that is, the alternate ebbing and flowing of the sea, or the theory of the

tides which, even the greatest incredulist in celestial philosophy, is

compelled unequivocally to allow, is produced entirely by the Solar and
hunar agency. The phenomena exhibited in this department of nature,
is so analogous to those operations on which Astrological doctrines rest,

that it cannot be too closely examined into ; and the more scrupulously
it is brought into comparison with atmospheric fluctuations, the more
these will be understood, and (it is presumed) the science of Astrology
venerated.—Those persons who have taken the trouble to examine with
attention the immediate influence of the luminaries upon the waters of
the ocean, will, no doubt, come to this inference ; namely, if those bo-
dies do thus compel so gross a mass of matter as the ocean, to periodi-

cally toss and roll in a manner contrary to its own nature, which is inert

repose so must their respective influences operate to disturb and alter

the state of every sort of matter whatsoever, sensible and insensible,

that is connected with the earth.—For it is a conspicuous axiom in the
Newtonian theory, “ That every particle of matter in the universe is

endued with a sympathetic energy or influence, by which it is capable
of communicating imperceptibly with every other particle throughout
the system of nature/*
The whole surface of the human body, when moderately corpulent, is

about fourteen feet square ; and the pressage which occasions the rise

and fall of the mercury in the thermometer shews, by. its variation, that
at one time, when the air is most heavy, such a body sustains a pressure
externally of 33,905tb,* while, when the pressure is the lightest, the
pressure on the same body is not more than 30,624lb ; and consequently
an increase or decrease of weight equal to 3,28 lib may be externally
acting on the body of a person ; and which change he may suffer every
few hours, as the fluctuations of the mercury evidently proves.
Now we well know that this vast external pressure, could not be sus-

tained unless it were properly counterbalanced by some adequate means
of resistance within the said body ; and some internal means of accom-
modating itself to these fluctuations of the atmosphere, which are sup-
plied by the Author of Nature to every animal body. Yet that equili-

brium which is necessary to ease, is constantly being disturbed ; and
agitations, which may be compared to the ebbing and flowing of the sea,

are constantly being experienced by every living animal. In a body
that is robust, and has all its members perfect, pulsation or the natural
vibration of its organs will soon effect composure but where any mem-

;

ber or organ is out of order, the free and necessarily rapid citQulatio^

^ Hi PREFATORY REMARKS.

of the internal matter is obstructed, and pain, or unpleasant sensations,
are the consequence, nor will these cease until a perfect equilibrium be-
tween the internal resistance, and external force, has been restored.
Now the human body cannot be materially affected, without the mind
partaking at the same time of those effects, whether agreeable or pain-
ful, from which it is plainly demonstrated, that the combined or con-
trary influences of the planets are constantly operating, to produce cer-
tain effects on the body and mind of every living being on the face of
the earth, in a manner comparatively similar to the phenomena of the
tides of the ocean ; and that the lives and actions of men, and the fate
of individuals and nations, are thus subject in a greater or lesser measure
to planetary control.

Therefore (in the words of Ptolemy, that “ Prince of Philosophers”)
“ what therefore hinders, but that he who exquisitely knows the mo-
tions of the stars, and of the Sun and Moon, and is not ignorant of the
times, nor the place, nor any of the aspects, and is further well skilled
in their natures, and their efficient powers.—What I say, hinders any
man thus furnished from knowing, both naturally, and suitably, the
effects of all these mixed together, so that he may be able to foretel, in
every season, the proper state of the air ; as that it will be hotter or
moister, which he may foreknow by a manifest aspect or ray of the stars
and Moon to the Sun ?—and as it is possible for him that is very well
skilled in these matters before mentioned, to foretel the qualities of the
seasons, what hinders but he may likewise predict concerning every man ?
for, from the state of the ambient at the time of the constitution of each,
it is easy to know in general the quality and temperament of each person
born ; that such he shall be in body, and such in mind, and the future
events, advantageous or disadvantageous, foreknown by the state of the
ambient.—Therefore it is apparent that a presage is possible to be de-
duced from these, and such like, of the heavenly causes.”
As to the absurd and foolish idea that it is superstitious, unlawful, or

sinful, to study Astrology, a moment’s reflection will convince to the con-
trary

; since it will be manifest, from the perusal of this volume, that
every problem is calculated merely by an arithmetical process, devoid of
any thing resembling divinations. Likewise the consequent prediction
is deduced therefrom in a demonstrative and strict mathematical way,
according to a certain chain of causes, which for ages past have been
found uniformly to produce a correspondent train of effects.—Where
then consists its sinfulness or its superstition ? since the whole system
is founded on the result of actual observation.—If Astrology, which
foretels future events by the courses of the stars, is sinful or unlawful,
so were the labors of the late celebrated astronomer Herschel, who nightly
pored over the starry heavens with his optic instruments, “ guaging the
firmament” as he expresses it, in search of discoveries.—And alike un-
lawful are the present labors of the astronomer royal. For be it re-

membered, that the Astrologer s horoscope is nothing more than a celes-

tial map, chart, or picture, of the heavens, for a certain hour of the day,
erected on paper, judged according to long established rules, which can-
not be of itself either meritorious or unlawful since the map or picture
of the heavens so cast and erected, as well as the stars and planets placed
therein, does certainly exist in the heavens at that time, whether the
Astrologer erects his horoscope or not.—And by predicting from the said
configuration of the heavenly bodies, the Astrologer does but verify and
fulfil that passage of the sacred scriptures, which positively declares.



”

PREFATORY REMARKS. IX

that the stars and planets were created expressly for the benefit of man,
the terrestrial lord of the creation

; and that they were placed in the
firmament for “ Signs of that which afterwards should come to pass.*
Therefore, the same vindictive and bigotted spirit which would perse-
cute or contemn the Astrologer for contemplating the heavens, and de-
claring, in deference to the actual conviction of his mind that the stars have

,

power over all sublunary affairs, would, in the dark ages, have sentenced
Galileo to the stake, or banished the immortal Newton from the dwel-
lings of civilized man !

To those persons, whether critics or otherwise, who judging from mere
hearsay, and following the base track of slavish custom, would proceed
to pronounce the condemnation of Astrology, without investigating its

theory, or hearing aught in its defence, (contrary to the inimitable policy
of British jurisprudence, which in every case wisely endeavours to sound
the mysteries, and hear the merits of whatever is brought before the
public tribunal,) the author would just ask, were an illiterate plough-
man, or an ignorant cobbler, each of whom were ignorant of the theory
of letters, to deny in toto, the laws of vision, the problems of longitude,
parallax, refraction, or any of the more intricate theories of modern
science, would they not instantly laugh him to scorn, for declaring his
absurd denial, of that which his ignorant understanding would not lead
him to comprehend ? Certainly they would ; and therefore let me im-
press on the minds of these gentlemen, that however learned they may
be in other respects, yet if they deliver their unqualified veto against
the doctrines of Astrology, without having first analysed and well ex-
amined its truth or falsehood experimentally, without proving by the ap-
plication of its rules to their own horoscopes, that the influence of Saturn
was not evil, nor that of Jupiter benevolent or in a similar way, de-

;

monstrating by facts, the actual fallacy of the science, they are acting
equally as absurd and ridiculous, as the ploughman or cobbler aforesaid,
which must be self-evident to every one.—Therefore, let those who wish
to explode our system, first remember the saying of Plato.

OYAEIE ATEfiMETPHTOS EISITO.

And until they have cast their own horoscopes, or proved from some
nativity, or theme of heaven, that there is no truth in Astrology, the
author can easily bear with their reproaches ; and whatever pompous
assertions they may bring forward, upon perusing this work, the author
thereof, as a believer in the system he vindicates, from experience, will still
have the best of the argument, in the opinion of every unprejudiced
person.

Neither should the occasional failures of its professors, afford any
argument against the science itself ; since men do not condemn the scrip-
tures, merely because heresies, and heretical schisms, have arisen there-

* I aru well aware that it is quite unfashionable, at present, to quote scripture in

support of my theory, but for the better proof of what I have advanced as above,
let the candid and impartial reader consult Gen. i. 14, 15. Deut. xxxiii. 14.

Psalm xix. 1. and xix. 3. Judges v. 20. Job xxxviii. 31. Amos v. 8. JoBix.9»10.
Wisdom of Sol. vi. 22. Ecclesiasticus xliii. 6 , and numerous other passages of

holy writ, where the influences of the stars is recorded.

X PREFATORY REMARKS.

from ; nor do they deny the art of the physician, through his own ineffi-

ciency, nor explode the whole science of chymistry, merely because the
chymist fails in some of his analytical experiments.—Why then should
Astrology alone, which of all other sciences, claims the most serious
and undivided attention, become the butt of incredulity, through the
sins of its professors ?

In looking deeply into the sympathies of nature, which we are con-
stantly experiencing, we can hardly quarrel with those who have ascribed
to them an agency more than we can comprehend. We see a gift of
foreknowledge strongly implanted in the badger, the hedgehog, the fox,
the hare, and almost every animal with which we are acquainted.—We
see also that birds and reptiles have a surprising forecast : and who can
fail to perceive effects constantly working between the heavenly bodies,
and the bodies and souls of mankind—whether their exists an etherial
effluvium that is communicated from one body to another, and which
produces those strange sympathies we are witnessing, is not to be de-
clared :

“ Nil sine magno
Vita labore dedit mortalibus.”

Horace.

we know they are produced ; and being able to connect them with what
we term “planetary influence” is sufficient to show, we have sound and
sufficient ground-work for forecasting the effects incident to known
causes—and this is all the Astrologer contends for in the “BOOK OF
THE STARS ”

Throughout the whole of the present treatise, the utmost care has
been taken to faciliate the student in the knowledge of each Astrological
problem. No obsolete or difficult tables are inserted therein, (merely to
puzzle the reader, as too many writers have heretofore been guilty of,)

and when to these considerations, are joined, the important diagrams—
the judiciously selected horoscopes—and the elegant engravings which
adorn, while they illustrate the work—the author confidently trusts it

will appear evident, that neither labor, pains, nor expense has been
spared to render the present volume the most valuable treatise on Astro-
logy, that the English nation has yet produced—and more worthy of
popular support than any work of the kind that has preceded it.

A MANUAL
OP

ASTROLOGY.



In the newspapers of February 1820, the death of a Mr. Samuel
Hemmings was noticed. It was stated, that he had been an ironmonger
and prosperous in trade—that he was born on the 4th of June 1738, at

nearly the same moment as his late majesty George III. and in the same pa-
rish of St. Martin’s in the fields ;—that he went into business for him-
self in October 1760, when his late jnajesty came to the throne j—that he
married on (the 8th of September 1761,) the same day as the king ; and
finally, after other events of his life had resembled those which happened
to the late king, that he died on Saturday, January 29th 1820, on the same
day, and nearly at the same hour as his late majesty !

Query. After such an authenticated and luminous instance as the

foregoing, where the lives of two individuals born at the same moment,
corresponded in every remarkable particular, even in life and death j can

the Astrologer be justly accused of superstition or absurdity, should he
pronounce the fates of mankind to be subject to planetary influence ?

Or can any rational mind, upon mature and sober reflection, attribute the

foregoing most pointed agreement in their destinies—to mere chance ?

HISTORICAL AND INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

on the ANTIQUITY, VERITY, and UTILITY of the SCIENCE.

THE celestial science termed Astrology, or the doctrine of

the stars, may be properly defined the art of foreknowing and
predicting future events, by the motions, positions, configura-

tions, and influences of the planetary orbs, and various celestial

phenomena; as eclipses, comets, and peculiar aspects of the

most powerful stars : deduced from various experimental obser-

vations of the philosophical enquirer, through a series of ages,

while in former times it might be compared to a mighty
Colossus that overstrode all other sciences, commanding the

submissive homage of kings and princes or, like “ the bright

lightening the way to knowledge : In modern times, it has
not unfrequently, in its etherial circuit, asserted its supremacy
above other perishable arts by some remarkable prediction

term it) that could not have been founded on any natural con-
jecture, but which like “ a meteoric flash” has so enlightened
the gloomy atmosphere of incredulity, that the thinking part
of mankind, who are not content with judging these myste-
rious matters upon mere hearsay, have been half inclined to

believe in the possibility of prescience by the etherial orbs.

The antiquity of the Astrological Science, and of Celestial
Observations, may be fairly inferred from what was spoken by
the all wise Creator of the universe who

; is said in the sub-
lime language of the sacred scriptures, to have “ prepared the
light ;” to have formed the celestial orbs, and appointed them
by the Almighty fiat, “ to befor signs andfor seasons, andfor
days and for years.” Whence it is probable that the human
reason never existed, without some portion of this heavenly
knowledge being diffused amongst mankind

; because, inde-
pendent of motives of curiosity, which may of themselves ex-
cited the wisest of the ancient philosophers, to contemplate the
splendors of the celestial canopy—It is easy to perceive that
some parts of the science answer such essential purposes to man-
kind, that they could not be dispensed with. Instance, the
rising and setting of the planetary orbs and the constellations

peculiar to the seasons—whereby the antediluvians, no doubt,
were enabled to order their most important transactions

to cultivate the auspices of favourable periods and apply the
;

benevolent influences of the “ Starry orbs” to the arts and cus-

toms of life. Indeed, the pastoral way of living-, the serene
unclouded sky and the longevity, not only of the antediluvians,

but of the patriarchs of the first ages, were extremely favour-

able to astronomical observations and hence
; we may trace the

causes of the symbolically terrestrial signs, which mankind
have by common consent placed to occupy the heavens. But
those were probably not “ exalted to the skies,” until mankind
had made some progress in poetry ; which also is of great an-
tiquity, having been practised in the very first ages of the
world, whilst they “ tended their flocks.” Hence, also poetry
and astrology should be combined together, as accompanying
each other from the earliest ages even in the

; antediluvian sera.

This will not derogate from the dignity of these sciences, when
it is remembered, that the ancient shepherds were not merely
the vulgar, or illiterate of mankind, for in those times even
princes did not think it beneath themselves to act as shepherds,
and to " watch their flocks,” or attend to pastoral affairs ;

which can be proved from many instances of the sacred history,

of Laban, Jacob, David, Job, &c : nay, we know that several

ages afterwards, many of the chief magistrates of ancient

Rome, had been husbandmen themselves. Thus Lucius Cin-
cinnatus was found at the plough, when he was called to be
dictator: and Fabricius Curius and Camillus were no less

skilled in the science of husbandry, than in the art of war.
Indeed it appears that husbandmen were in such esteem

among the Romans, that they highly resented the least affront

offered to any of them, of which Scipio Nasica was an in-

stance, for he being a candidate for the place of Edile, meeting
a plain countryman, took him by the hand, and jesting with
him on “ the hardness of his hands,” the Romans so resented

it that he lost the Edileship.

In the unrivalled poems of Virgil, particularly the “ Geor-
gies,” the poet has enriched his work, in almost every page,

with an astrological regard to the months, seasons, the ascend-

ing and descending signs and constellations as though he
had himself traced effects to their first cause ; and by thus

availing' himself of the accumulated wisdom of past ages, re-

specting- the extensive sciences on which he wrote, he produced

the most beautiful poem on the subject of husbandry that the

world has ever beheld. While so just, are the greater part of

his observations, and so extensively useful, that the principal

part of them are put in practice in many places of the world,

even at this very day. Amongst other beautiful references to

the magnificent machinery of the heavenly host, the following,

Georg. I. 335. beginning “ Hoc metuens coeli menses et

sidera serva, <Sfc.” is very appropriate.

“ In fear of this, observe the starry signs,

Where Saturn’s houses and where Hermes join.

The sovereign of the heav’ns has set on high,

The moon, to mark the changes of the sky,

When southern blasts should cease.”

It is also reported by the poet Lucan (observes Dr. Johnson
with “ historical veracity”) that Caesar, the imperial “ Lord of

the world” “ noted the revolutions of the stars, in the midst of
preparations for battle

According to Josephus, the celebrated Jewish historian, ** our

first father Adam, was instructed in Astrology by divine inspi-

ration.” Adam taught it to his posterity for it appears that

Seth was so excellent a proficient therein, “ that foreseeing the

flood, and the destruction of the world thereby, he engraved
the fundamental principles of his art, in hieroglyphical em-

stone.” Josephus affirms, that “ he saw himself that of stone

to remain in Syria in his own time and in the 3rd chapter
of his first book, he says, that “ man lived so long before the
flood, to learn the arts and sciences, especially naming Astro-

journed into Egypt, he taught the Egyptians the knowledge

was set on foot for the use of navigation, and the Egyptians,
by the heliacal risings and settings of the stars, had determined
the length of the solar year, and by other observations had
fixed the solstices, and formed the fixed stars into asterisms, all

which was done in the reigns of Ammon, Sesac, Orus, and
Memnon, about a thousand years before Christ Nicepsos,

king of Sais, by the assistance of a priest of Egypt, invented

Astrology grounding it on the aspects of the planets, and
;

after the Ethiopians had invaded Egypt, those Egyptians who
fled from him to Babylon, carried thither the study of Astronomy
and Astrology. And so says Diodorus, “ the Chaldeans in

Babylon, being colonies of the Egyptians, became famous for

Astrology, having learnt it from the priests of Egypt.”
The eastern nations have ever been famous for their skill in

these abstruse sciences, which in those countries have always
served as a ruling principle for the public administration of the

state. It is true that as Astrology is practised in those despotic

countries, it is liable to very great abuse and in too many in-
;

stances has led the way to fanaticism and imposition. But
these considerations should have no real weight with the cha-
racter of the science in general, since the most meritorious of

discoveries, the most pure theories of an abstract nature, are

liable to the same objection which in
; fact will always be the

case, where the fallibility of human nature is concerned. Ac-
cording to the oriental records, the birth of Astrology is con-
founded with the epocha, of the creation of the world. We
are informed by their historians, that the son of Misraim,
Nacrawousch, was the first Egyptian prince, and the first of the

magicians who excelled in Astrology and (as they never fail to

add) enchantment. Retiring into Egypt with his family, con-

sisting of eighty persons, he settled on the banks of the hill,

built Essous, the most ancient of the Egyptian cities, and com-
menced the first dynasty of the Missraimian princes, who
were stated to be cabalists, diviners, and eminently skilful in

the mystic arts. The most celebrated of these were Naerasch,
who according to oriental mythology, was the first who repre-

sented in figures and images, the twelve signs of the zodiac.

crets, till then concealed by his family. Khasslim, author of
the nilometer. Hersall, who devoted himself to the worship
of idols. Sehlouk, who worshipped fire Sourid,

; his son,
who erected the first pyramids, and who is also considered as
the inventor of that wonderful mirror, which the ancient ori-

ental poets have so much celebrated in their verses : and
Firawnn, or Pharoah, the last prince of that dynasty, whose
name was afterwards attributed to the most iniquitous kings of

Egypt
Terrified by the predictions and menaces of Noah, this prince

endeavoured to destroy that prophet, believing that he should
prevent, by his death, the threatened deluge. It, however,
destroyed him and his whole family. Efilimoun alone, chief

Astrologer of his time, had the good fortune to save himself

from that general desolation. Admonished in a dream, to seek
refuge in the ark of Noak, he flew to Babylon, where he ac-

knowledged the divine mission of that prophet, embraced the

dogma of the unity of God, and was admitted into the ark with
all his family. Forming an alliance with Noah’s family, he
became the ancestor of twenty-six kings of the second dynasty,

and built the city of Memphis.
Misraim, his descendant, was the depositary of all the ma-

gical and Astrological secrets of the first ages of the world. All

his descendants are said also to have excelled in these sciences,

and in others which the enemies of Astrology have endeavoured

to link with the science of the stars. From that prince was
descended the celebrated Elboud-Schir, who surpassed all

his ancestors in the great art of Cabal and Adine, his
;

son, under whose reign the noted magicians Harouth and

Marouth filled the east with their reputation : they were consi-

dered (t as two demons escaped from hell.” Under this reign

the celebrated magician Nedoure, established the worship of

the great idol of the sun. This person, to whom tradition

attributes a thousand astonishing and incredible events, was the

author of that inexhaustible vase which is mentioned by all
,

the oriental poets.

Of his successors, they who were most distinguished in these

mysterious sciences, were Schedad, whom the orientals con-

skier as the first astronomer, and the father of the signs and
celestial themes, or houses of heaven, which he formed from
viewing1 the stars and constellations. Menncawousch, the
first who published these mysteries, and who is said to have
circulated throughout Egypt several thousand copies of his

work. He was said also to have been the inventor of warm
baths the institutor of the twelve religious feasts, in honor

; of

the twelve signs of the zodiac ; and is said, by his own single

genius, to have discovered the secrets of the philosopher's

stone : whereby the orientals affirm he acquired “ an immense
treasure," by converting simple metals into gold and silver.

Menawousch, who is said to have made an ox, the object of

his adoration. When afflicted by a severe malady, he heard a

voice announcing his death, except he should have recourse to

the benign influence of that animal. Under his reign, Egypt
was desolated by the Arabians, who took this opportunity of
learningfrom the Egyptians the Theurgic sciences by which
they afterwards acquired such distinguished reputation.

To the unfortunate view of these sciences, Mythology attri-

butes much of the cruelties of the Pharoah of Moses. Terrified

by the alarming predictions of his Astrologers, who announced
his death by the hand of a young Israelite, he commanded, in

the weakness of his mind, that all the male children of that

chosen people should be thrown into the Nile, The hand of

omnipotence, which never fails even from the most unexpected
and discordant causes, to produce the desired effect, if such be
his divine will, ordained that this event should operate for the

deliverance of the Israelites, and the ruin of the tyrant, who
with his nobles and his whole army, were overwhelmed in the
depths of the Red Sea. Amidst this general desolation, there

being no male surviving on whom the widows could bestow
the throne, the oriental writers affirm, that they chose Deluke,
the most aged amongst themselves, concerning whom they re-

count the following tradition, which is perhaps as wild and
singular as any to be found in the oriental records.

“ To preserve the state from foreign invasion, this queen
had recourse to the enchantments of Nedoure, the greatest

female magician of the country. In the centre of the capital.

she erected a superb edifice of stone, whose four doors fronting

the four cardinal points , were decorated with figures and
images representing numerous armies. Several thousand per-

,

sons were day and night employed in the most active exertions.

“Now” said she to the queen, “ you may enjoy tranquillity,

your capital and empire are exempt from danger. If an enemy
should have the temerity to approach you, combat him , by
attacking the figures, which are on that side of the edifice, to

which he directs his march ; cut off their heads, break their

arms and legs, beat out their eyes: the destiny of thesefigures
shall be that of your enemies ” The virtue of this magic edi-

fice, says the historian, kept in awe all the neighbouring people
;

and Egypt continued in prosperity during four centuries, till

the epocha of the destruction of that miraculous building,

which began under the reign of Licass, and fell down entirely

under that of Cawmess. It is strange, that the event verified

the baneful prediction of the fall and ruin of that monarchy.
In consequence of Cawmess having afforded an asylum to the

melancholy remnant of the Israelites, who were subjected and
led into captivity by Nabuchodonosor that savage conque-

;

ror, irritated by the contemptuous refusal of the Egyptian king,

made war against him, and killed him in battle: this was fol-

lowed by the massacre of one part of the nation, the captivity

of the other, and the entire ruin of Egypt. This remarkable
desolation, which the Astrologers had predicted, fortified more
strongly the popular opinion of these occult sciences. They
were perpetuated in the nation, notwithstanding the political

revolutions which it successively experienced under the Baby-
lonians, Macedonians, Romans, Persians, Greeks, and Maho-
metan Arabs.
Amidst the u crash of empires,’V the vicissitudes of ages, and

the revolutions of public opinion, (which in no other instance
had evinced such firmness) these sciences, but more especially
Astrology, were preserved in Egypt from one generation to
another; with various degrees of power and enthusiasm now

ent Arabian tribes, by whom they were as much respected as

in Egypt : indeed the respect entertained for them by the Ara-

bians in general, contributed in a great degree to the success

of Mohammed. In his life we see the favourable predictions

of many very celebrated Astrologers of his time and among
;

others, that of a priest of Eukeaz, who told the uncle of the
“ Prophet/’ that all circumstances in his infancy conspired to

announce that he would be an extraordinary man, and that his

life should be guarded with the most vigilant attention. As
also the prediction of another, no less famous in the art, who
on being presented to him at Bassora, took Mohammed by the
hand, and exclaimed with transport, “ Behold the Lord of the

World, the Mercy of the Universe,” &c. These predictions are

said to have been corroborated by a remarkable vision, which
Mohammed made known at the beginning of his enterprise.

He declared, that in a dream he saw the two hemispheres re-

cede in such a manner, as to show him distinctly the utmost
extremities of the east and west. This he explained to his

disciples, as expressive of the extensive territories and immense
dominion which, by the decrees of heaven, were reserved for

those, who in obedience to the Cour’ann, combated for his

religion.

The annals of the Othoman empire, and the history of Mo-
hammedanism, are replete with marvellous events, predictions,

supernatural warnings, and ominous details no less wonderful
;

than the foregoing recitals some few of which shall be re-
;

lated, since they will not only prove interesting to the curious

reader, but will serve to give an idea of the spirit of that nation

and the extraordinary events which have sprung from their

wild enthusiasm.
Osman I. experienced happy presages, respecting the future

prosperity of his family. A Scheykh, who was an Astrologer,

who passed a solitary life in the study of the occult sciences,

came to him, and declared with enthusiastic rapture, that the

prophet Elijah had appeared to him, and commanded him to

announce, by his authority, the successful enterprises of Osman
;

that he should be the brightest sun of the east, and that his pos-

terity should reign over seven climates ; that is, over all the

habitable regions of our globe. Osman loaded the old man
with caresses he offered him a rich sabre, and a costly

; vase.

He accepted only the latter, and left the young prince with many
blessings. The prediction became fulfilled, so far as success

and enterprise were concerned and at the height of his sove-
;

reign power, Osman recollected the Scheykh, sent him valuable

presents, and ordered an ample convent to be built in the city

where he resided, with a considerable fund, which subsists even

to decide for war. He was at first impelled by terror, to pre-

pare the means* of avoiding a rupture with the Othomans, when
he consulted Abdullah Lissan, at that time the most skilful

Astrologer of the east, and desired his opinion respecting the
tendency of the comet. The Astrologer declared that this

phenomenon having appeared to the west of his dominions, and
of the constellation Aries, could only have an evil influence in

regard to his enemies, and that it presaged the utmost disasters

to the Othoman empire. Relying on this 'prediction , Timour
determined immediately upon war, refused every kind of accom-
modation, and entered at the head of a powerful army the do-
minions of the empire. The consequences of this war between
the two heroes of the east, are well known as also

; the disas-
ters which befel the Othoman monarchy, after the fatal battle
of Angora.
The death of Mourad II. justified a strange prediction.

This sultan was hunting in the vicinity of Adrinople at
; the

close of day, as he entered the city, a Derwisch placed himself
on the bridge over which Mourad was obliged to pass as soon

;

as he perceived him, he fixed his eyes upon the sultan, and as
he approached, exclaimed in an inspired tone, “ You have no
time, august monarch, to spare, to impede the progress of that
abyss, which is the effect of our sins and prevarications against
the divine law you are just approaching

; the limit of your
reign, and the last moment of your life ! The angel of death is
already at your door open your arms, and receive with entire
resignation, this messenger from heaven.” These words made a

strong* impression upon the monarch and his retinue he imme-
;

diately expressed his profession of the faith, and performed

several acts of contrition. Convinced that this prediction was
the decrees of heaven, from hearing that this Derwisch was the

disciple of a profound Astrologer, he prepared for death, made
his will, settled the succession to the throne, and died on the

third day notwithstanding (says the annals,) all the aid of
medicine, and every exertion of his ministers, officers, and cour-

tiers, to prevent the catastrophe.

The most favourable prognostics accompanied the accession

of Mohammed II. The Astrologers foretold that his reign
should become illustrious by the glories of conquest he de-

pended also on the circumstance of his proclamation, which
happened on a Thursday, the 5th day of the week ; and on his

being the seventh sultan of his family. The following words
of the Cour’ann were quoted “

: God hath blessed the fifth and
1

the seventh.* These predictions had a powerful effect on the

projects of this monarch, who became the conqueror of Con-
stantinople, the destroyer of the Greek empire ; and one of the

most illustrious princes of his family for genius, talents, and
taste for learning.

Selim I. previous to his turning his arms against Egypt,
consulted a celebrated Astrologer, who resided at Damas, and
living like a hermit, had the reputation almost of a saint. He
assured the sultan that victory should attend his steps and
that the kingdom of Egypt should be subject to his power. In
the transports of his joy, Selim loaded him with kindness and
honor he would not however depart from him, till he

; had
learned the fate and duration of his reign. The sage refused
for some time to comply with his request, but at length obliged
to yield to his earnest solicitation, he informed him “ his reign
would conclude before the expiration of nine years ; but that
from its glorious events, he would hold a distinguished rank in

the history of nations.” At these words, Selim observed a
melancholy silence, which was only interrupted by deep sighs
and accents of grief. After a gloomy pause, he desired to know
the horoscope of prince Suleyman, his son. “ He shall be
happy,” replied the hermit. “ He shall reign near half a cen-



28 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

tury, and be equally distinguished by his splendid actions and
warlike virtues.” The above observation determined the
sultan to march against his enemies, and the event having cor-

responded with the prediction, he from that moment became a

prey to fatal melancholy, and died in the ninth year of his

reign.

As the hermit had foretold, hia son, Suleyman I. ascended
the throne, attended by a thousand presages respecting the
future splendor of his reign, and the prosperity of his empire.
These favourable predictions were chiefly founded on the good
fortune which the Arabians attribute to whole numbers, since

this sultan was born in the 900th year of the Hegira, and was
the tenth monarch of his family. Prompted by these circum-
stances, Suleyman undertook those enterprises which rendered
his reign so illustrious. He extended the limits of his empire
on our continent in three directions, and his reign was indeed
the most prosperous period of the monarchy.

In the reign of Selim II. (1572) there appeared a Comet,
which had the brightness and magnitude of Venus. This ex-
cited his apprehensions, which were augmented by the predic-
tions of his Astrologers, who declared that this phenomenon
announced the calamities which excessive rain would inflict

upon the empire. Forty days afterwards, says the historian.

“ they imagined themselves threatened with an universal de-

luge : incessant rains overflowed his dominions in Europe and
Asia; laid waste three of his chief cities swept away

; on all

sides, men, cattle, houses, and rendered impassable, during se-

veral weeks, the bridges and public roads ! This 'prediction,

which is well authenticated by historians, affords a striking

instance of the singular skill possessed by the Arabian Astro-

logers, and how astonishingly correct those rules must have
been on which their presages were founded.

The death of Mohammed III. was likewise extremely sin-

gular and remarkable. On entering the seraglio, he met one
day a Derwisch, who exclaimed in the following terms “

: O
august monarch ! do not slumber over your situation. I an-
nounce to you a melancholy event, which will happen in fifty-

six days from the present time. The sultan was agitated by

tins address. He soon after sickened, and really died on the

fifty-sixth day.

Some months previous to the death of Mourad IV. an Eclipse
of the Sun, alarming- this monarch, he wished to consult a mys-
terious volume, which Selim I. the conqueror of Eg-ypt, had
brought from that kingdom, with many other curiosities, which
are still carefully preserved in the seraglio. It is believed that
this volume, written in cyphers and magic characters, mentions
the name and destiny of every sultan, and of every sovereign,

who will reign over Egypt to the end of the world. After
long and studied diligence, he fancied that he had discovered
his own name, and his approaching death. In the anguish of

grief he shut the volume, and denounced a thousand anathemas
against whoever should hereafter presume to open it. His agi-

tation was still further increased, on hearing that a Scheykh
from Mecca, who was considered at Constantinople as a most
skilful Astrologer, had privately predicted that the month of

Schewal, in which the sultan was born, would produce in that

year ( 1640 ) something unpropitious , and that alms should be
speedily delivered to avert the impending evil. Mourad IV.

ordered these preventives to be profusely used he
; even opened

the public prisons, and set all at liberty except assassins but
; a

prey to his fate, he fell sick and died the 16th day of the month
of Schewal.
“ The arcana of Astrology/' as a judicious writer observes,

“ constituted a main feature in the doctrines of the Persian

magic," to which the following extract from the “ Ancient
Universal History," is appropriate. “ In the reign of Darius

Hystaspis, king of Persia, flourished a celebrated Astrologer
,

whose name was Gjamasp, surnamed Alhakim, or “ the wise."

The most credible writers say that he was the brother of the

king, and his confidant or chief minister. He is said, by the

most credible historians, to have predicted the coming of the

Messiah ; and some treatises under his name are yet current in

the east. Dr. Thomas Hyde, in speaking of this philosopher,

cites a passage from a very ancient author, (having before told

us that this author asserted there had been among the Persians

ten doctors of such consummate wisdom, as the whole world



;

30 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

could not boast the like. He then gives the author’s words.)
Of these the sixth was Gjamasp, an Astrologer who was coun-
sel lor in Hystaspis. He is the author of a book intitled Judicia
Gjmaspis, in which is contained his judgment on the Planetary
Conjunctions : and therein he predicted that Jesus should ap-
pear ; that Mohammed should be born

; that the Magian reli-

gion should be abolished, &c. Nor did any Astrologer ever
come up to him. “ But of all the provinces of Persia, Choras-
san is the most famous for producing great men in that art

and in Chorassan, there is a little town called Genabed, and in

that town a certain family, which for six or seven hundred
years past, has produced the most famous Astrologers in Persia.

And the king’s Astrologer is always either a native of that

place, or one brought up there.”

By the foregoing historical researches into the records of the
Oriental Nations, we have given their account of the origin

and beginning of the Celestial Science but the
; ancient Greek

and Roman historians affirm, (particularly Diodorus Siculus)
that Hercules first brought Astrology into Greece and Plutarch

;

reports, that Hesiod practised the art. But another ancient
writer (Philostratus) states, that Palamedes, before the siege of
Troy, was esteemed skilful in Astrology and was the first

; that

limited the course of the seasons, and the order of the months
by the solar motion. Anaximander, and his scholar Anaxi-
menes, were learned in the art of Geometry and Astrology, if

we may believe the ancient historians as the one is said to
; have

discovered Geometrical Astronomy, the other the obliquity of

the zodiac. Thales and Democritus also gained a singular

name in the annals of ancient history, by their foreseeing, the

one a dearth, the other a plentiful crop, of olives, whereby they
not only enriched themselves, but are said to have confounded
the despisers of their art. Hippocrates, the father of medicine,

is said to have foretold the plague, which took place long
before it happened and relying on the verity of his foresight,

;

it is stated by historians, that he sent his scholars abroad into

different cities, to be prepared for the dreadful calamity. In
consequence of this, it is said that “all Greece looked up to

him as a God, and decreed to his name the sacrifices of Her-

cules.” Anaxagoras is said to have been so addicted to Astro-
logy* and the contemplation of the heavenly bodies, that he
“ accounted not the earth, but the heavens to be his country.”
Affirming- himself born for no other purpose than to contem-
plate and behold the Sun, the Moon, and the rest of the celestial
orbs. Thales is known also to have predicted that great Eclipse
of the Sun, in the time of Astyag-es, which presaged those mu-
tations in Asia that afterwards took place. Apollonius Tyaneus
is said to have travelled over the greater part of Egypt, India,
Persia, and Chaldea, growing to that admirable perfection in
the celestial art, that for his oracular presages, he was by the
persons of those times, “ reputed almost as a God, in the shape
of man.” He is said to have written four books of Astrology,
which were lost in the confusion of those dark ages. These,
with numerous others of the ancient worthies, are on record as
delighting in the astral art. The poet Virgil, who has been
before quoted, and who was a great mathematician, which in the
sense of those times, always included Astrology, and skill in

the Chaldean mysteries, describes his hero Eneas, as being born
under the favourable influence of Jupiter, Venus, and the Sun.
Horace, Persius, and even Augustus himself, thought highly
of Astrology. In latter times, we have on record the famous
prediction relative to Picus, earl of Mirandola, who from his

antipathy to the art, was surnamed the Scourge of Astrology,

who being foretold by three different Astrologers, that he should
not live above the age of thirty-three years flattering himself

that the art and its predictions were false and groundless, as if

he could (as Sir Christopher Heydon observes) “ wrangle away
death, by writing- against Astrology.” Lo, while he sought to

prove the art vain, his own death, concurring exactly with the

time foretold by the Astrologers confirmed it to be true and
;

more actually confuted that which he had written against it,

than if all the world besides had conspired to answer him. This
is perhaps the most striking instance on record as to the truth

of the art.

In the writings of Nostradamus the Gallic Astrologer, are

to be found almost every important event, that for centuries

past has taken place. A writer in the Gentleman's Magazine



32 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

(in December 1824) has pointed out to its readers the truth of

two remarkable prophecies one regarding the death of Henry
;

II. of France, who wTas killed at a tournament, by an unlucky

thrust in the eye, through the gilt bars of his royal helmet
;

which event was prophecied and printed full three years before

it happened. The other, a more remarkable one still, of the

French revolution, wherein Nostradamus predicts “that the

Christian religion would be abolished in France, and many of

the nobles and clergy put to death This prophecy was like-

wise in print so early as the year 1556, or near 242 years before

the event, which was certainly an instance of singular skill in

this great Astrologer.

No less extraordinary to those who are ignorant of the firm

principles on which this art is founded, was the prediction of

Guido Bonatus, an Italian Astrologer who being at a city in
;

Italy when it was closely besieged, he elected a proper time
for the earl of Montserrat to make a sally, predicting that the

earl would rout his enemies and obtain a complete victory, but

not without receiving a slight wound in the knee and that the
;

earl might be more assured, Bonatus marched out with him,
carrying every necessary to dress the wound ! The event cor-

responded accurately and fully with the prediction for
; the

enemy was vanquished totally, and the earl wounded, punctu-
ally as he foretold.

Valentine Naibod, a celebrated Astrologer of Padua, from
the rules of Astrology, predicted his own death in the follow-
ing singular manner. Living at Padua, he spent his time in

study, and having considered his own nativity, he found some
directions approaching, that gave him ground to fear he should
“ be killed or wounded with a sword to prevent which, and
to shun the fate he apprehended, he took in all sorts of provi-
sions from abroad, to serve him for some months to come; shut
and barred all his gates, doors, and windows : and resolved to
continue there to avoid the mischief. In the mean time, it hap-
pened that some thieves went by, and seeing the house made
so secure, supposed, no doubt, that there must be some great
wealth therein and in the

; night time, breaking into the house

and meeting with the master thereof, they barbarously mur-
dered him, as his horoscope foretold.

Michael Scot, a mathematician and Astrologer of the thir-

teenth century, was much esteemed by the emperor Frederic II.

He predicted that the emperor should die at Florence ; which
prediction was answered by the event. He likewise foretold

that himself should die with the fall of a stone ; which hap-
pened accordingly for being

; in a church at his devotions, a
stonefellfrom the roof, which gave him a mortal wound. His
singular predictions caused him to be accused by the vulgar for

a magician, although his contemporaries report him as a man of

learning, and a great divine.

Antiochus Tiberius was one of the most famous Astrologers

of the fifteenth century and although his death was very un-
;

happy, yet his singular predictions render his name immortal.

He was a native of a town in Romagna : a certain officer

carried him to Paris, where he studied and where following
; the

bent of his genius, he applied himself to the occult sciences, or

rather to all the branches of that secret and curious art, called

natural magic.
Considering in his own mind that this science had been de-

cryed from its having been mostly in the hands of bold, igno-

rant, and profligate persons, he thought to restore it to its

former credit and repute, by giving it all the advantages that

could possibly be derived from physic, mathematics, natural

philosophy, history, and the fine arts of which he was a
; per-

fect master. The pains he took in this respect, were attended

with rather more success than he anticipated : so much indeed,

that before he quitted France, he had attained a very high re-

putation, and was considered as the cleverest Astrologer of the

day.

Upon his return to his native country, where that sort of

knowledge was in the highest repute, he found it necessary,

for his own security, to ingratiate himself with some of the

petty tyrants, or little princes, that were possessed of the

several cities and territories in Italy. Nor was it long be-

fore he gained the confidence of Pandolfo Malatesta, at that

time sovereign of Remini, with whom he lived in the greatest

C

ease and credit. His reputation was quickly raised to such a
height, (as well by the curious books he published, as by the
happy verification of many of his predictions) that his house
was continually thronged, either with visitors, who were per-
sons of distinction, or clients who came to him for advice so

;

that in a very short time, he amassed a competent fortune : and
as he was esteemed, courted, and beloved by persons of the
highest rank, he might, according to appearances, have pro-

mised himself a comfortable journey through life, and a peace-

able passage out of it, in his old age. But fate, (to whose de-

crees Antiochus Tibertus was no stranger) had it seems willed

otherwise. In a word, he has established his fame to posterity

by three incontestible predictions one with respect to his most
;

intimate friend another in regard to himself and the third,
; ;

relating to the prince his patron. Each of them wholly im-
probable at the time they were delivered all of them

; inscru-

table, by the rules of human policy or prudence ; and yet all

exactly accomplished.

This friend of his was Guido de Bogni, one of the greatest

captains of his time, as well as one of the bravest and boldest

men that ever lived. He was very earnest with Tibertus to

reveal to him the secret of his destiny. After considerable re-

luctance, this great master of his art declared that Guido would
certainly lose his life by the hands of one of his best friends,
upon an ill-grounded suspicion. Some time after this, Tibertus

calculated his own nativity ,* and made no scruple of declaring

that himself was fated to lose his head upon the scaffold.

Pandolfo, his patron, would likewise have his horoscope cal-

culated, which Tibertus would willingly have declined but
;

finding it impossible, he would not hazard the credit of his art

by telling a falsity and therefore, although he was at that
;

time the richest person in all Italy, Tibertus ventured to ac-

quaint him, that after suffering great want , he would die in
the common hospital at Bologna.
Not long after this Guido was made commander-in-chief of the

army of Pandolfo, the aforesaid prince, and patron of Tibertus,
upon which the count de Beulivoglio, who was father-in-law
to that prince, wrote him a letter, in which he assured him.



—

HISTORICAL REMARKS. 35

*' that he had made a shepherd of a wolf/’ and that Guido
“ was actively intriguing* with the pope, and had promised to

deliver up the city of Remini, whenever he desired it.” The
tyrants of Italy were never men of much discernment, and
therefore the prince Pandolfo, as soon as he had this informa-
tion, made a great entertainment, to which he invited all his

favourites, and among the rest Guido, and Tibertus the Astro-
loger. At this supper Guido was stabbed, (exactly as the for-

mer predicted) and as it was suspected that Tibertus, from his

great intimacy with him, might have some share in the conspi-
racy, He was thrown into a dungeon , and loaded with irons.

It may easily be imagined that Tibertus passed his time very
unpleasantly in this dismal situation, and therefore it will not
be deemed surprising, when it is stated, that he endeavoured
to seize the first opportunity of escaping which offered. It

seems the gaoler to whose care Tibertus was committed, had a
daughter of singularly mild and gentle manners, whom he at

length persuaded to furnish him with the means of breaking

out of his dungeon into the castle ditch, from whence he might
easily escape.

In the interim, count Bentivoglio had discovered that the

information he gave his relation was ill-founded and
; of this

he sent him an account, as soon as it was in his power at
;

which news Pandolfo was infinitely affected, and grieved at his

late rash and cruel measures.

It was however impossible to recall his unfortunate general

Guido, from the grave but he gave instant orders that Tiber-
;

tus should be set at liberty. The persons who brought these

orders, came just at the fall of night, and strange to say, pre-

cisely at the time that the Astrologer had forced his passage

into the ditch, where, after a slight search they found him.

When this was reported to the tyrant, his former suspicions

returned upon him with redoubled vigour and recollecting at
;

the same time, the prediction of Tibertus, that he should be

deprived of his patrimony before his death, he concluded that

the first information could not be groundless : but that, without

doubt, the Astrologer must be concerned in some such perni-

cious design. To free himselt therefore from these apprehen*



36 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

sions, he gave orders that the next morning Tibertus should b$

beheaded, before the prison gate : and thus the second predic-

tion was verified, in a manner equally strange, and out of the

reach of human foresight to penetrate unassisted by the rules

of art. Let us now proceed to the third prediction, which

really took place not long after.

It is to be observed that though the intelligence of the count

proved false, with respect to the persons concerned, which
very probably was the effects of his own suspicions, yet his

information was right enough in the main for a conspiracy was
;

actually carrying on, to place the city of Remini into the hands

of the pope : and it was accordingly seized by the Duc-de-
Valentinois, not long after but in the confusion which this

;

occasioned, Pandolfo made his escape. He fled for some time

from place to place, vigorously pursued by his enemies, and
meeting (as is generally the case of tyrants) with very few
friends at length, having endeavoured to sow dissension among

;

his own children, he was abandoned by them, and every one
else inasmuch, that falling ill of a languishing disease at Bo-

;

logna, where nobody cared to take him in, he was at last car-

ried to the hospital, where he dragged out the remainder of his

days in penury and pain, and at last died there, as the Astro-

loger had foretold.

At the birth of Louis XIV. the king of France, the gentlemen
of the Royal Academy of Inscriptions, caused a splendid medal
to be struck to commemorate the event. Around this medal
was placed the twelve signs of the zodiac, forming the twelve
houses of heaven. The planets were placed in the same degrees
as they then occupied in the heavens. The following was
given as the interpretation of the celestial theme. “ The sun,

who gives perfection to the other planets, is in the mid-heaven
;

Mars, lord of the ascendant, in reception with Jupiter, the pro-
tector of life Saturn, the enemy of nature, is in his

; dignities,

which makes him less malevolent. The moon is in conjunction
with Venus; and Mercury, in his house of predilection to the
sun, but out of combustion, giving a superiority of genius in

the most difficult enterprises which his being in square to
;

Mars, is not able to abate.’" Such was the interpretation of

this monarch’s horoscope, which was figured in the midst of
this medal, by a rising sun. The king was placed in the cha-
riot of this glorious planet, of which Ovid has given us a de-
scription. This chariot was drawn by four horses, guided by
victory. The inscription was in these words : " Ortus Solis
Gallici.” " The rising of the Gallic Sun,” and the exergue
thereof, contained this other inscription. “ Septembris Quinto
Minutis 38 Ante Meridian, 1638.” This curious medal ex-
hibits a remarkable instance of the high reputation in which
Astrology was held at the period of its formation. Neither
were the predictions of the Astrologers, relative to the cele-

brity of the future “ Grand Monarque” unfulfilled, as history is

sufficient to prove.

In the reign of the Stuarts, we have many striking ac-
counts of remarkable predictions and celebrated Astrologers

;

but the chief amongst these (and indeed in the History of
England) was the renowned Astrologer WilliamLilly amongst
a series of Astrological Hieroglyphics, relative to the fate of

the English nation, and to last for several centuries Published
;

by him in 1651, were two immediately succeeding each other
the first of which represented several dead bodies in winding
sheets, a church-yard with sextons employed, and cart-loads of

dead emptying into the graves. The second was a view of

London Bridge, on both sides the water, and the city of London
in flames. Nothing could have more unequivocally predicted
the Plague and dreadful fire, (which really succeeded each
other, as did these hieroglyphics) than the above forewarnings.

After the fire, and when Lilly had for some time retired from
business, and lived at Richmond, the House of Commons sent

him an order to attend at their bar when appearing, the
;

speaker informed him, that “ as he had fifteen years before pre-
dicted the Plague and dreadful fire, the House wished to ask
him, if he could give any intelligence concerning the causes or

authors thereof?” Lilly answered, “that the House might
readily believe, that having predicted it, he had spared no pains
to investigate the cause, but that all his endeavours had been
ineffectual; from whence he was led to attribute the confla-

gration, to the immediate finger of God.” It is singular, that



38 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

what this profound Astrologer was unable to discover, every

one else has failed in, even the usual lights which the revolu-

tion of ages generally throw on subjects which, at the period

of their transaction, may be enveloped in casual gloom, in this

instance have totally failed to give any real information as to

the actual perpetrators of the above calamity.

No less singular was this distinguished Astrologer’s presage

respecting Charles I. In a volume of “ Lilly’s Astrology,” pur-

chased at the sale of the Duke of Marlborough’s library, there

is the following curious note. “ The immediate use which

Charles I. made of one thousand pounds, which was sent to him

at Hampton Court, was to consult Lilly the Astrologer.” iC I

advised him,” says the sage, " to travel eastward, whereas he

travelled westward, and all the world knows the consequence.”

The death of William, earl of Pembroke, was foretold by

lady Davy’s, to happen on his birth day in the year 1630 (which
is mentioned in Rushworth’s collections). When evening
came, the earl cheerfully took notice “ how well he was,”
saying “ he would for lady Davy’s sake, never trust a female

prophetess again.” He was notwithstanding found dead in

his bed next morning !

In still more recent times, we have the instance of a remark-
able prediction relative to the late fallen emperor Napoleon,
by a celebrated French Astrologer. Observing that in Napo-
leon’s horoscope " the planet Saturn was in the house of honor,

he declared, without hesitation, that ** at the moment when the

meridian altitude of his power should be obtained : from that

period he should meet with a decline, as rapid as his elevation

and be finally deserted by his friends.” After the fall of Napo-
leon, this circumstance was noticed publicly in the French
journals. And if Napoleon’s horoscope were correct, the above
configuration of the “ evil orb” was quite sufficient to authorise

the aforesaid prediction, on the most rational grounds.

Numerous other instances are on record, which we could
readily adduce in support of the astonishing verity of this art,

in judicious hands but let those suffice. The Sacred Scrip-
,

tures abound with the most beautiful imagery, derived from
the heavenly host thus we are told by the inspired

; writers,



:

HISTORICAL REMARKS. 39

that “ they fought from heaven, the stars in their coursesfought
against Sisera.” Again, “ so let all thine enemies perish but

;

let them that love him, be as the sun, when he goeth forth of
his might and according to the most ancient and approved
Astrology, “ the person who shall have the sun for his signi-

ficator, well dignified, will be invincible in battle/' In another
place, the sacred writer declares, “ the sun shall not smite thee
by day, nor the moon by night,” which plainly refers to the
office of Hyleg or what is termed by Astrologers, “

, the Lord
of life," which is always chosen from “ the sun by day, and the
moon by night" Also it is declared, that “ to every thing
there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven,"
&c. which plainly relates to the doctrine of “ Astrological
Elections,” or the choice of appropriate “ times and seasons,"
for the most important purposes wherein it is observed,

; that
“ there are times so peculiarly propitious to the spirit of enter-

prise, that if a man were to go out to battle, although assisted

by a comparatively small force, yet he shall obtain the victory

while there are other times, when with a mighty army, more
completely equipped, instead of laurels, he shall acquire no-
thing but disappointment and disgrace." The sacred writers

also speak of the “ sweet influences of the Pleiades," and the
“ bands of Orion." In short, wherever we search, whether
amongst sacred or profane historians, numerous instances are

to be found, which set forth the astonishing presages of this

formerly resplendent science which even in the ruins that
;

time and the revolutions of public opinion have brought upon
it, is grand and magnificent, and like the starry host, from
which its principles are derived, continues wherever its stu-

pendous footsteps are traced, to soar above all other arts, even
by the lofty and dignified nature of its pretensions but when

;

these pretensions are backed by truth, and demonstrated by the
light of philosophic research, it may be asserted, without fear

of contradiction, that there exists not a science more truly sub-

lime, or more generally interesting, than the celestial science

of the stars.

“ These are thy glorious works, parent of good

Unspeakable ! who sitt’st above the heavens,

WERE a disbeliever in the " celestial influences” to be told

that it could be proved by facts of the clearest demonstration

that all mankind are (more or less) believers in Astrology, he

would probably be inclined to dispute the veracity of the speaker.

Such, however, is really the case since all men are subject
; to

the change of seasons, the periodical returns of heat and cold,

light and darkness, which as well as the ebbing and flowing of

the tides, are the most prominent parts of judicial Astrology.

Planetary influence being in these universally felt and ad-
mitted ; and thus all men are Astrologers , though it is appa-
rent that but very few have either the candour or sense to

acknowledge it. Changes in the weather, and all the various

phenomena which affect the atmosphere, proceed from the
same cause, which is neither more nor less than the various

positions and configurations of the stars.

It is justly observed by an erudite writer, that " every sub-
lunary event has its origin in planetary influx/’ and as Locke



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE. 4-1

observes, “ the change or removal of any orb, although incom-

prehensibly distant, would cause things to put on a very differ-

ent appearance/’ The dispositions, habits, and fortunes, not

only of men, but of every organized being that does or can

exist, are derived from the same source and the infinite va-
;

riety of action and counteraction, arise from the infinite variety

of causes, operating against each other, in which the less is of

course overcome by the greater. Nothing can be a stronger

proof of Siderial influence, than the strange succession of for-

tunate and unfortunate events experienced by many individuals.

The whole lives of some are a succession of disasters, and all

their exertions terminate in disappointment. Injudicious con-

duct, no doubt, will produce misfortunes but there are thou-
;

sands to whom no blame can be attached, who are injured and
ruined by a strange coincidence of circumstances, which no
human prudence could foresee or prevent. Certain times are

peculiarly disastrous to certain people and in families, num-
;

bers will frequently die nearly together. This is probably
owing to some resemblance in their horoscopes , a thing very

common amongst relatives.

It was only in latter times that the sciences termed Astronomy
and Astrology were divided. Until the end of the sixteenth

century they had reference to one and the same object and
; as

the discoveries in Astronomy, if not the foundation of the whole
system, with very few exceptions, are wholly attributable to

Astrologers, so far as dividing the heavens into appropriate

constellations, and discovering the laws and natures of the pri-

mary planets, which have been known for several thousand
years.—We think proper, even at this day, to cull the whole
principles of this science, (including the principia of Astrono-
mical knowledge) by the name of Astrology, which it formerly

justly maintained.

The certain principles upon which the science rests, even in

its elementaryform , are proved by the calculations of eclipses,

as we can hereby determine, not only that the luminaries of

day and night will be obscured, but we can pronounce with
certainty, at what particular point of time, and to what parti-

cular extent such obscurations will happen, and exactly how

long they will continue. By its assistance, geographers are

enabled to ascertain the true figure and size of the earth, and

the situation and extent of countries chronologists can com-
;

pute the measure of the year, and navigators can determine the

longitude of places, and direct their courses through the track-

less and stormy ocean, with correctness and safety. As it is

our intention in the present treatise to give as much instruction

in as small a compass as can possibly be done, we shall not

detain our readers with any further preliminaries, but proceed

to a view of the

SOLAR SYSTEM.

“ O Sun !

Soul of surrounding worlds ! in whom best seen

Shines out thy Maker !

’Tis by thy secret, strong, attractive force,

As with a chain, indissoluble bound,

Thy system rolls entire.

Informer of the planetary train !

Without whose quick’ning glance their ponderous orbs

Were brute unlovely mass, inert and dead,

And not, as now, the green abodes of life.”

The solar system, which the moderns have adopted, was
taught by Pythagoras , revived by Copernicus, confirmed by
Galileo, Kepler, and Descartes, and finally established by the

great sir Isaac Newton yet it is not generally known that Sir
;

Isaac Newton began to study astronomy, solelyfor Astrological

pursuits so that even here, the world are indebted to what
the ignorant and prejudiced term “ a superstitious science,” for

the beautiful system, which this great philosopher established,

on laws probably as immutable as those of the universe.

According to this system, the sun is placed in the centre, from
which it never moves : but from observations, made upon its

spots by our modern Astronomers, it is found to turn round its

own axis, from west to east, in about twenty-five days. The
planets called primary revolve round the

, sun at unequal dis-



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE. 43

tances. Their names are Mercury , Venus, the Earth, Mars,
Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus or

Herschel. They also move in the order in which they are here

mentioned. To this system, belong* other spherical bodies,

which move round their respective primary planets in the same
manner as the primary planets move round the sun, from the

west to east except those of Herschel, which appear to move
;

in a contrary direction. These are called secondary planets or

Satellites. The most conspicuous is the moon, which moves
round the earth, in something less than twenty-eight days

;

four revolve round Jupiter, seven round Saturn, and six round
the Georgium Sidus or Herschel.

It is important to remark the distance of the primary pla-

nets from the sun, and of the secondary planets from their pri-

maries, and also the times of their revolutions because we
; are

hence led to see more clearly the excellence of the Copernican
system, according to which the motion of all the planets are

regulated by one universal law ; viz. the squares of the perio-

dical tines of the planets are to each other, as the cubes of their

mean distances from the sun : and the same law is established

with respect to the secondaries, in revolving round their pri-

maries.

The planets are retained in their orbits by the united opera-
tion of the centripetal force, by which a body is attracted to the
centre of gravity, and the centrifugal force, by which it en-
deavours to persevere in a straight line. These two powers
mutually balancing each other, like action and re-action, retain

the planets in their orbits, and compel them to make their re-

spective revolutions through the azure fields of space.

“ With what an awful world revolving power,

Here first the unwieldy planets launch’d along

The illimitable void ! there to remain
Amid the flux of many thousand years,

That oft have swept the toiling race of men
And all their labour’d monuments away.

Firm, unremitting, matchless in their course.

To the kind temper’d change of night and day,

And of the seasons ever stealing round
Minutely faithful : such the all perfect hand
That poised, impels, and clearly rules the whole.”

Young.

ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE. 45

The mean distance of the moon from the earth is about thirty

of the earth’s diameters, or 240,000 miles and their respective
;

quantities of matter, nearly as l to 39. The surface of the

moon, is to that of the earth, nearly as 1 to 13£. The sun is

about a million times larger than the earth.

The planets, both primary and secondary, are opaque bodies,

and receive all their light from the sun, and make their revo-

lutions round that luminary. From the appearance of the

bounds of light and shadow upon their surface, they are con-

cluded to be spherical, which is confirmed by many of them,
being found to turn periodically on their axis.

The planet Jupiter , is surrounded by thin substances, called

Belts , in which there appear so many changes, that they are

generally thought to be clouds, for some of them have ap-
peared broken, and then have become entirely invisible. Saturn
is surrounded by a thin broad ring, which appears double
through a good telescope.

There is reason to believe that it turns round its axis, because
when its edge only is visible to us, it appears somewhat thicker

on one side of the planet than on the other and the thickest
;

edge has been seen on different sides at different times.

Each of the primary planets moves round the sun in a curve
line, which forms an Ellipsis. The sun is placed in one of
thefoci. The point of the line in which the planet approaches
nearest to the sun, is called the Perihelion

; the point at which
it is most remote, is called the Aphelion.

PHASES OF THE MOON.

4 ‘ The neighbouring moon her monthly round

Still waning, still renewing, through mid heaven,

With borrowed light her countenance triform.

Hence fills and empties to enlighten the earth,

And in her pale dominion checks the night.”

The phases of the moon are among the most wonderful part

of the celestial phenomena but on account of the frequency
;

and regularity of the changes in the appearances and situation



;

40 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY

of this beautiful object, the cause of these appearances are per-

haps not so much thought of as they would be, were they less

frequent. The moon is an opaque spherical body, which ap-

pears luminous, only in consequence of reflecting the light of

the sun, and consequently can only have that side illuminated

which is turned towards the sun, the other side remaining in

darkness therefore it is evident that we must perceive differ-
;

ent portions of her illuminated, according to her various posi-

tions, with respect to the earth and sun.

At the time of conjunction, or when she is between the earth

and the sun, or the new moon, she is then invisible to the earth,

because her enlightened side is then turned towards the sun,

and her dark side towards the earth. In a short time after the

conjunction, she appears like a fine crescent, soon after the sun

sets, which crescent begins to fill up, and the illuminated part

to increase, as she advances in her orbit and when she
; has

performed a fourth part of her revolution, she appears to be

half-illumined, being then in her first quarter. After describ-

ing the second quadrant of her orbit, she is then opposite to

the Sun, and shines with a round illuminated disc, which is

called the full moon. After the full, she begins to decrease

gradually, as she moves through the other half of her orbit

and when the eastern half of her only is enlightened, she is

said to be in her third quarter ,* thence she continues to de-

crease, until she again disappears at the conjunction, as before.

These various phases plainly show that the moon does not

shine by any light of her own for if she did, being globular,
;

she would always present a fully illuminated disc, like the sun.

That the moon is an opaque body is proved by her occultation

of the stars ; for her body often comes between the earth and
a star, and while she is passing it, the star is lost to view.

OF COMETS
Comets are supposed to to be solid opaque bodies of various

magnitudes, with long transparent tails, resembling a pale

flame, and issuing from the part of the comet farthest from the

sun. They move round the sun in very elliptic orbits, and cross

the orbits of the planets in all directions. From the curved



direction of their paths, Newton concludes that when they dis-

appear they go much beyond the orbit of Jupiter, and that in

their Perihelion , they frequently descend within the orbits of

Mars, and the* inferior planets. He computed the heat of the

comet which appeared in 1680 , when nearest the sun, to be
two thousand times hotter than red hot iron, and that it must
retain its heat until it comes round again, even if its period

should be more than twenty thousand years, and it is computed
at only five hundred and seventy-five.

Mr. Whislon has conjectured that the deluge, of which in

the sacred writings we have the only authentic record, but of

which the annals of most nations have traditionary accounts,
was produced by the near approach of a comet, whose atmos-
phere had been attracted by the earth and he further sur-

;

mises, that the final catastrophe foretold in the scriptures, may
be produced by the approach of a comet prodigiously heated in

its perihelion. We pretend not, however, on such subjects as

these, to penetrate the secrets of Almighty wisdom, which can
produce its own ends, by means of which we have no con-
ception.

Such is the solar system , and the basis upon which it rests

is, that the sun, and not the earth, is the centre of it and that
;

the earth is not fixed, but revolves round the sun like the other

planets. That this system is true, and agreeable to the consti-

tution of nktute, is certain, from the observations which have
been made by the greatest philosophers aided by telescopes,

;

and all the assistance of mathematical and physical knowledge.
When the heavens are beheld from the surface of the earth, or

even from its centre, the motions of the planets appear to be

very unequal, and not to observe any regular course and
; there-

fore we may certainly conclude, that the earth is not the centre

of their motions. He, therefore, who would observe the real

motions of the planets, must place himself in the centre of the

sun, or not far distant from it, and then all the various pheno-

mena would be perfectly regular, and exactly such as they

would be if the earth was the centre, round which the sun and

planets revolved.

Another proof of the motion of the earth, is drawn from



48 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

physical causes. Sir Isaac Newton has proved, that all the pla-

nets gravitate to the sun that is, are attracted by it and that
; ;

when two bodies gravitate to each other, without directly ap-
proaching to each other in right lines, they must both turn

round their common centre of gravity. The sun and the earth

therefore both turn round their common centre of gravity but
;

the sun is a body so much larger than the earth, viz. a million

times, that the common centre of gravity of the earth and sun,

must be within the body of the sun itself, and not far from
its centre. The earth therefore turns round a point which is

within the body of the sun, and therefore turns round the sun.

OF THE FIXED STARS.

No part of the universe affords such exalted ideas of the

structure and magnificence of the heavens, as the considerations

of the number, magnitude, nature, and distance, of the fixed

stars. We admire indeed, with propriety, the vast bulk of our
own globe but when we consider how much it is

; surpassed
by most of the heavenly bodies, what a point it degenerates
into, and how little more, even the vast orbit in which it re-

volves, would appear, when seen from some of the fixed stars,

we begin to conceive more just ideas of the extent of the uni-

verse, and the boundless infinity of creation.

“ How many bright

And splendid lamps, shine in heaven’s temple high.

Day hath his golden sun, her moon the night,

Her fix’d and wandering stars, the azure sky.”

Fairfax.
The fixed stars comprehend all the celestial objects, except-

ing the sun, the moon, the planets, and those comets, that occa-
sionally appear. The stars, on account of their apparently
various magnitudes, have been distributed into several classes

or orders. Those which appear largest are called stars, of the

first, magnitude the next to them in lustre, stars of the
;

second magnitude, and so on to the sixth, which are the small-
est that are visible to the naked eye. This distribution having
been made long before the invention of telescopes, the stars



ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE. 49

which cannot be seen without the assistance of thoie instru-

ments, are disting uished by the name of telescopic stars.

Astronomers have supposed “ the innumerable multitude of

fixed stars to be so many suns, each of which is attended by a

certain number of planets or habitable worlds like our own, as

well as visited by comets. The strongest argument for this

hypothesis is, that the stars cannot be magnified by a telescope,

on account of their immense distance whence it is concluded,
;

that they shine by their own light, and are therefore so many
suns each of which we may suppose to be equal, if not supe-

;

rior, in lustre and magnitude to our own. They are not sup-

posed to be at equal distances from us, but to be more remote,

in proportion to their apparent smallness. This supposition is

necessary to prevent any interference of their planets, and thus

there may be as great a distance between a star of the first

magnitude, and one of the second, apparently close to it, as be-

tween the earth and the fixed stars.

Others object, that the disappearance of some of the fixed

stars is a demonstration that they cannot be suns, as it would
be in the highest degree absurd, to think that God would create

a sun, which might disappear of a sudden, and leave its planets

and their inhabitants in endless night. But this argument will

have no weight with those who believe in the doctrines of Re-
velation which assures us, that our world will come to an end,

;

and that our sun will be deprived of his light, and, conse-
quently, that all the planets which circulate around him, will

be involved in darkness. In short, there is nothing inconsistent

with either scripture or reason, in supposing, that while infi-

nite space is universally filled with illuminating suns and cir-

culating planets, each world, or rather each solar system of
worlds, has its own periods of creation, duration, and final con-
summation as we

; are assured ours has had, and will have.

And the discoveries of Astronomers respecting old stars disap-

pearing, and new stars being observed, are perfectly consistent

with the doctrines of creation and dissolution wr hich all Chris-
;

tians profess to believe, with regard to our own solar system,
and the globe we inhabit.

OF THE GALAXY, OR “ MILKY WAY.”

“ A broad and ample road whose dust is gold

And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,

Seen in the galaxy , that milky way,

Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest

Powder’d with stars.”

The Galaxy, or “ milky way,” is a light coloured irregular

circle or band, which encompasses the heavens, and is distin-

guishable from the “ etherial blue," by its brilliancy. It ap-

pears like a shining zone, which owes its splendour to the in-

numerable stars of which it is formed, and which passes through

many of the constellations in its ample range.

Dr. Herschel surveyed this peculiar part of the heavens with

a powerful telescope, twenty feet in length, and with an aper-

ture of eighteen inches. With this powerful instrument lie

found that it completely resolved the whitish appearances into

stars. The portion he first observed was about the hand and
club of Orion, in which he found an astonishing multitude of

stars, whose number he endeavoured to estimate, by counting
many fields (or apparent spaces of the heavens, which he could
see at once through his telescope) and computing from a me-
dium of these, how many might be contained in a given portion

of the “ milky way.” In the most vacant place he found 63
stars the other six fields contained 110,

; 60, 70, 90, 70, and 74
stars, a medium of all, which gave 79 for the number of stars

in each field. Thus he found, that by allowing 15' for the dia-

meter of his field of view, a belt of 15? long and 2° broad, which
he had often seen pass before his telescope in an hour's time,

could not contain less than 50,000 stars, large enough to be
distinctly numbered besides which, he suspected twice as many
more, which could not for want of light be scarcely perceived.

Dr. Herschel also remarks, ** that the milky way, is a most
extensive stratum of stars, of various sizes, admits no long-
er of real doubt and that our sun is one of the heavenly

;

bodies belonging to it, is as evident. I have now viewed and
guaged this shining zone in almost every direction, and find it

composed of shining- stars, whose number constantly increases

and decreases, in proportion to its apparent brig-htness to the

naked eye/’

REVOLUTIONS AMONG THE FIXED STARS.

The fixed stars are liable to chang-es several stars
; observed

in former times by the ancients, are now no long-er seen, and
new ones have appeared, unknown to the ancients. Some of

them have disappeared for a time, and then become ag-ain vi-

sible. Some have been observed to increase in superlative

lustre; then decreasing-, have, by degrees, vanished from the
sight even of the best telescope.

Hipparchus observing’ an unknown star, in order that pos-
terity should learn whether any of the stars perish, composed
a catalogue of the stars. Tycho Brahe , after several ages, ob-
served another new star, and in the philosophical transactions,

we have accounts of several.

The first new star in the chair of Cassiopeia was not seen
by Cornelius Gemmo, on the 8th of November 1572, although
he that night considered the heavens in a very serene sky, and
saw it not but the next night

; it appeared, with a splendour
surpassing all the fixed stars, and scarcely less bright than
Venus. Tycho Brahe observed it on the 11th of the month

;

but from thence he assures us, that it gradually decreased and
died away , so that in March 1574, after sixteen months, it was
no longer visible, and at this day no signs of it remain.

September 30, O. S. 1604, such another star was seen and
observed by the scholars of Kepler, in the constellation Ser-
pentarius. It broke out at once with a lustre surpassing that

of Jupiter ; and like the former, in nearly the same time, died

away gradually, and of this, there are no footsteps to be now
seen.

Between these, in 1596, we have the first account of the

wonderful star in Collo Ceti, seen by Fabricius on the 3rd of

August, as bright as a star of the 3rd magnitude, which has

been since found to appear and disappear periodically . Its

period being precisely seven revolutions in six years, though



;

52 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY

it returns not always with the same lustre, nor is it ever totally

extinguished, but may at all times be seen with a six feet tube.

Another new star was discovered by Hevelius, July 15,

1600, as a star of the third magnitude, but so waned in lustre,

that by the beginning of October it was scarce to be seen. In

April following, it was brighter than before, yet wholly disap-
peared about the middle of August. The next year in March
1602, it was seen again, but not exceeding the sixth magni-
tude since then, it has been no further visible, though fre-

;

quently sought after by Astronomers.

Mr. G. Kirch in 1686 discovered another, whose period was

404J days. In August this star is visible to the naked eye, but

in December scarcely to be seen. It is brightest in the month
of September. Independently of these, may be mentioned a

star, well known to Astrologers, Caput Algol, a variable star
;

its period is 2 days 21 hours. It remains for 2 days 14 hours,

as a star of the second magnitude in about three hours and
; a

half it declines to a star of thefourth magnitude and in
; three

hours and a half more, it resumes its second magnitude, which
it retains for 2 days 14 hours, as before. 0 in Lyra likewise

has a period of 12 days 19 hours, during which time it appears

of different magnitudes, from the third to the fifth
; n in Anti-

nous, has a period of 7d. 4h. 38m. and ^ in Cepheus,
; of 5d.

8h. 37m. No doubt all these changes have a manifest effect on

the earth, which may probably produce some of those strange

vicissitudes that baffle the wisest to determine, and for which,
even the Astrologer may be at a loss to account.

OF THE DISTANCES OF THE FIXED STARS.

As to the distances of the stars, no method of ascertaining
them has yet been discovered. They are so extremely remote,
that we have no distances in the planetary system wherewith
to compare them. The distance of the star Draconis, appears,
by Dr. Bradley’s observations, to be at least 400,000 times that of
the sun and the distance of the nearest fixed star, not less than
40,000 diameters of the earth’s annual orbit, that is, the true
distance from the earth of the former star is 38,000,000,000,000



! , ! ; :

ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE. 53

miles; and of the latter (the nearest star) not less than
7,600,000,000,000 miles. As these distances are immensely
great, it may both be amusing, and help to a clearer and more
familiar idea, to compare them with the velocity of some moving
body, by which they may be measured.
The swiftest motion we know of, is that of light which

passes from the sun to the earth in about eight minutes and
yet this would be above six years traversing the first space,
and near a year and a quarter, in passing from the nearest star

to the earth but
; a cannon ball, moving on a medium at the

rate of about twenty miles in a minute, would be three million

eight hundred thousand years in passing from Draconis to the

earth, and seven hundred and sixty thousand years passing
from the nearest fixed star. Sound, which moves at the rate of

about thirteen miles in a minute, would be five million six hun-
dred thousand years traversing the former distance, and one
million one hundred and twenty-eight thousand years in pas-

sing through the latter. The profound Astrologer Huygens,
pursued speculations of this kind so far, as to believe it not

impossible that there may be stars at such inconceivable dis-

tances, that their light has not yet reached the earth since the

creation

“ How distant some of these nocturnal suns

So distant, says the sage, ’twere not absurd

To doubt, if beams set out at nature's birth

Are yet arrived at this so foreign world,

Though nothing half so rapid as their flight,

An eye of awe and wonder let me roll,

And roll for ever ! Who can satiate sight

In such a scene—in such an ocean wide

Of deep astonishment ? where depth, height, breadth,

Are lost in their extremes ; and where to count

The thick-sown glories in this field of tire,

Perhaps a seraph’s computation fails,”

Young.
The recent discoveries of the late Dr. Herschel (to whose

labours the Royal Astronomical Society of London are adding



;

54 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

" stores of richest science”) were singularly remarkable ;—they

prove the fixed stars to be immense, their regions unbounded,

and perhaps infinite. As the stars, contrary to the planets,

shine like our sun by their ovm native light, philosophers sup-

pose, that each of them is the centre of a system of inhabited

worlds, which revolve around it. A judicious writer observes,

“Under this idea or persuasion, of how innumerable a family

do we seem to make a part ! the immensity of the universe be-

comes peopled with fellow beings, and we feel an interest at

what appears to be going on at distances so vast, that what we
see, as in time present, we have reason to believe (swift, incon-

ceivably swift as is the progress of light, darting from the

spheres) must have happened ages ago. Under the idea of the

universe being replenished with human beings, how magnifi-

cent, how awful, are the spectacles that present themselves to

the observer of the heavens ! the creature of a day, of a few
fleeting moments, seems to obtain a glimpse of a new creation,

a glimpse of the end of time in the passing away of a system.”

What an amazing conception, if human imagination can
conceive it, does this give of the works of the Creator ! thou-
sands of thousands of suns, multiplied without end, and ranged
all around us, at immense distances from each other, attended
by ten thousand times ten thousand worlds, revolving in bound-
less space, upheld by nothing, confined by nothing, yet pre-

served in their rapid course, calm, regular and harmonious, in-

variably keeping the path assigned to them by the mighty arti-

ficer of the universe !

OF THE DIVISIONS OF THE STARRY HEAVENS.
“ As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night

O'er heav’ns clear azure, spreads her sacred light

When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,

And not a cloud o’ercasts the solemn scene :

Around her throne the vivid planets roll,

And stars unnumbered gild the glowing pole.

The ancient shepherds, during the silent watches of the
night, (as they slept in the open air) having no other objects
to contemplate, than the view which the heavens above pre-

sented, soon began to divide “ the firmament of stars into par-
ticular constellations, according as they adjoined each other,

till the heavens were filled with symbolical objects, and those
which could not be formed into those clusters of stars, which
they brought together, were denominated “ unformed stars.”

By this division, the stars were easily distinguished from each
other

; and by help of a celestial globe, on which the constel-

lations are delineated, any particular star may be easily found
in the heavens, the most remarkable stars being placed in such
parts of the asterisms or constellations, as are most readily dis-

tinguished.

The heavens are thus divided into three parts. 1.—The zo-

diac, which is a great circle extending quite round the hea-

vens, nearly sixteen degrees broad, so as to take in the different

orbits of the planets, as well as that of the earth’s satellite,

the moon in the middle of which is the Ecliptic, or the path
;

of the sun. 2 .—All that region of the heavens which is on the

north side of the zodiac, containing twenty-one constellations
;

and 3.—The whole region on the south side, which contains

fifteen constellations.

With these constellations, Astrologers confine their observa-

tions to twelve only, which are denominated the twelve signs

of the zodiac.

Independent of other Astrological symbols, these twelve signs
answer to the twelve months in the year some have indeed

;

imagined that the figures under which they are represented,

are descriptive of the different seasons, according to the path
of the greater luminary thus the first sign Aries, “

; denotes
that about the time when Sol enters into that part of the ecliptic

the lambs begin to follow the sheep : that on the sun’s approach
to the second asterism, Taurus, the cows usually bring forth

their young. The third sign, now Gemini, was in former times

represented by two kids, and signified the time of the goats

bringing forth their young, which are usually two at a birth
;

while the former, the sheep and the cow, commonly produce
only one. The fourth sign. Cancer, denoting the crab, an ani-

mal that goes sideways and backwards, was placed at the

northern solstice, where the sun begins to return back again
from the north to the southward this answers to the time

; of

our longest days, after which the day gradually decreases, as the

sun has left his greatest northern declination. The fifth sign Leo,
denoting the lion, a furious animal, was thought to represent the
heat and fury of the tropical sun, when he enters this sign. The
succeeding sign, the sixth in order, Virgo, the maid, received the
sun at the time of the ripening corn, and the approaching har-
vest and in former times, the sign

; was expressed by a maid at-

tired as a female reaper, with an ear of corn in her hand. The
ancients gave to the next sign, both Libra and Scorpio, two of
the twelve divisions of the zodiac as autumn, which

; affords
fruits in great abundance, affords the means and causes of dis-

eases : and the succeeding time, being in general the most un-
healthy of the year, was expressed by this venomous animal,
here, spreading out his long claws into one sign, as if threaten-
ing mischief, and in the other, brandishing his tail to denote
the completion of it. The next sign, Sagittarius , denoted the
fall of the leaf, and the season for ancient hunting; for which
reason, the stars which marked this constellation, were repre-
sented by a huntsman, with his arrows and his club, the wea-
pons of destruction for the large creatures he pursued. The
reasons of the wild goat’s being chosen to mark (the sign
Capricorn) the southern solstice, when the sun has attained

his greatest southern declination, and begins again to mount
northward, lengthening the days, is obvious enough; the cha-
racter of that animal being, that it is mostly climbing, and
ascending some mountain as it browses. There yet remains
two signs of the zodiac to be accounted for, with regard to

their origin, viz. Aquarius and Pisces.—As to the former, it is

to be considered, that the winter is a wet and uncomfortable
season this therefore was shown by Aquarius

, the figure
; of a

man pouring out water from an urn. The last of the zodiacal

constellations, Pisces , was represented by a couple of fishes

tied together, that had been caught the lesson
; was, “ The

;

the seas and rivers are open, and there you may take fish in

abundance/’

THE DIVISIONS OF THE TWELVE SIGNS.

The zodiac being a great circle of the sphere, is divided into

three hundred and sixty degrees, every degree is subdivided

into sixty other divisions, called minutes, and every minute into

sixty seconds, thirds, fourths, and farther, if necessary.

from the equator towards the north pole and the latter six are

the contrary, or unfortunate : these nodes are termed the Dra-

rejects their use, deeming them as useless appendages to his

system of celestial philosophy, unless the moon should be in the

very degree of her nodes, when it may be allowed, that corres-

pondent effects in good or evil will follow, as there would cer-

tainly be some cause for the presumed effects, which otherwise
there cannot be they are characterised thus,

(from the experience of centuries of ages) to produce certain

effects and being built on a basis, which is thus consonant

persons, whose ipsedixit alone, seems as the standard for the
faith of thousands, that they have scarcely a clear idea of the
real or assumed principles of that art, which they generally

abusing that which the wisest of them have no conception of,

THE SIGNIFICATION OF THE TWELVE CELESTIAL
SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC.

“Now, came still evening on ; and twilight grey

Had in her sober livery all things clad
;

Silence was pleased : now glow’d the firmament

With livid sapphires : Hesperus, that led

The starry host, rode brightest
; till the moon

Rising in clouded majesty, at length,

Apparent queen, unveil’d her peerless light,

And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.”

Aries, the house of Mars and exaltation of the Sun, or the
first sign of the zodiac, is a vernal, dry, fiery, masculine, cardi-

nal, equinoctial, diurnal, moveable, commanding, eastern, chole-

ric, violent, and quadrupedian sign. Persons born solely under
this constellation, (if unmixed with the rays of either of the pla-

nets) are in stature rather tall, of a strong and spare bodily con-

formation dry constitution, long face and neck, thick shoulders,
;

piercing eyes, black eye-brows, sandy or red hair, and sallow or

swarthy complexion. In disposition resembling Mars, by the

ancients termed the lord of this sign, viz. hasty, passionate, vio-

lent, and intemperate. These are the natural qualities of this

sign but a good aspect of Mercury, or the moon, to benevolent
;

planets, will materially alter the judgment for the better, and 1o

ill planets for the worse. This must invariably be remembered
by the student for in Astrology, the majority of astral causes,

;

and not general or universal principles, must be considered,

judiciously combining the various testimonies for good and evil

together, as a skilful chymist would arrange the materials on
which he operates and after well weighing each aspect, un-

of each sign and aspect will be plainly discovered. (The same
remarks will hold good in every other sign they will there-

This sign governs the head and face. Its diseases are the

small pox, ring worms, eruptions, measles, fevers, convulsions,

epilepsy, apoplexy, palsy, baldness, and all diseases peculiar to

the head and face, and which proceed from heat, choler, and
aridity, or a dry constitution. It is generally considered as

a barren sign.

Every sign in Astrology is said to govern or reign over cer-

tain regions, countries, and cities and those under
; Aries are

England, France, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Lesser Po-
land, Syria and Palestine, Naples, Capua, Verona, Florence,

Padua, Marseilles, Saragossa, Burgundy, Cracow, &c. Its

colours are white and red. In horary questions, it denotes

pasture grounds, where cattle frequent, dry sandy soils, and
hilly grounds, the cieling or covering of houses, stables, kilns,

hiding places for thieves, and places not generally known or

frequented also warrens, preserves for game, or places for
;

small cattle, lands recently enclosed or ploughed, and such like.

It is generally thought to be a fortunate sign although in
;

that particular this description is too general and vague to be

depended on, without other testimonials.

Taurus is a cold, dry, melancholy, feminine, nocturnal,

southern sign, of short ascension the house of Venus, and the

markably stout and athletic, broad forehead, thick lips, dark
curly hair, short neck, dull and apathetic, slow to anger, but if

once provoked, exceedingly cruel and malicious. It governs
the neck and throat. Its diseases are melancholy, a consump-

Libra is the sign of the autumnal equinox a hot,
; moist,

airy, sanguine, western, diurnal, cardinal, equinoctial, move-

able, masculine, human?, obeying sign, of long ascension in

European climates. It is the house of Venus, and exaltation of

Saturn. Under this sign, generally, the native is tall and well

made, rather elegant in person, a round beautiful face, ruddy in

youth, but very plain featured and inclined to eruptions, that

disfigure the face when old, and consequently, in years, the re-

verse of being handsome generally, the Libra person has blue
;

eyes, and yellow or auburn hair. Authors state the disposition

to be sweet, and the dealings and character just and upright

but this depends almost wholly on the good aspects of the moon
and mercury ; for instance, if the moon or mercury is in square
aspect to Jupiter, Saturn, or Mars, although born under Libra,

the native is usually dishonest, untrue, and far from virtuous,

whether male or female. It is rather a fruitful sign. It governs
the reins, loins, and all that region of the body, internal or

external. Its diseases are weakness, debility, tabes dorsalis,

syphilis, and imposthumes of various descriptions.

bladder, fyc. Its diseases are confirmed lues, and the worst
kind of syphilis, all secret and virulent diseases, fistulas, rup-

tures, scurvy, and obstructions of the urethra, or intestinal

Herschel, or (as some Astrologers term this planet) Uranus,
having been so recently discovered, that no one living has seen
more than one half his celestial revolution through the fields

of space, it cannot be expected that a complete system of his

Astrological effects could possibly be given but from the au-
;

thor’s own experience, aided by what other observations he
could gather from men of skill and science in celestial philo-

sophy, this planet is peculiarly unfortunate in his nature, and of

course his influence, when brought into action by aspecting the
various significators in a nativity, is replete with evil, also. He
may be compared to the combined effects of Saturn and Mer-
cury. He is in nature extremely frigid, cold, dry, and void of
any cheering influence.



CELESTIAL INFLUENCES OF THE PLANETS. 71

“ I.ast, Herschcl walks his frontier round

The boundary of Worlds ; with his pale Moons
Faint glimmering through the darkness night has thrown,

Deep dyed and dead : o’er this chill globe forlorn

An endless desart, where extreme of cold

Eternal sits, as in his native seat,

On wintry hills of never thawing ice ;

Such Herschel’s earth !”

UftANIA.

He was discovered on the 13th March 1781, by the late Dr.
Herschel, (under singularly ominous positions, which will be
noticed in the latter part of this work, where we treat of mun-
dane Astrology). His effects are truly malefic but

; what he
does of evil, is always in a peculiarly strange, unaccountable,
and totally unexpected manner : he causes the native bom
under his influence, to be of a very eccentric and original dis-

position. Those persons are generally unusually romantic, un-
settled, addicted to change, and searchers after novelty. If the
Moon or Mercury, and Herschel be well aspected, they are

searchers after nature’s secrets, excellent chymists, and usually

profound in the more secret sciences. He gives the most ex-
traordinary magnanimity and loftiness of mind, mixed with an
uncontrollable and intense desire, for pursuits or discoveries out

of the “ track of custom.”
In Marriage, if in the seventh house, or afflicting the Moon,

he causes every thing but happiness, want of order and socia-

lity in domestic concerns, listlessness and coldness between
man and wife, discord from the most entire, strange, and unu-
sual causes, death of relatives, &c. He is equally evil in love,

and peculiarly inimical to the fair sex : his evil aspects to the

Hyleg have also a tendency to materially lessen the space of life.

As yet there are no peculiar houses assigned him, but we have
reason to think (from several thousand observations) that the

sign Aquarius, is one wherein he much delights that
; he is

fortunate in the airy trigon, Gemini, Libra, and Aquaries and
;

unfortunate in fiery, earthy, or watery signs. It is impossible,

from the long period of his revolution, to have formed any

thing’ like a system, as to the bodily confirmation of those he
governs but they may probably resemble those whom

; Saturn
and Mercury are said to govern, if the student can judiciously

combine the effects of each, which is difficult. When we con-

sider how much this planet must have baffled the judgment of

the ancient Astrologers and when we reflect also, that there
;

may be other planets equally powerful, beyond his orbit, as yet

undiscovered, we cannot help remarking the extreme ignorance

and folly of those persons, who require from the Astrologer

what they expect from no one else, infallibility.

The anticipated existence, and subsequent discovery of this

planet, forms a singular instance on what correct principles the

moderns have prosecuted their studies. Drs. Halley, Bradley,

and others, had frequently observed that Saturn was disturbed
in his motion by some force, which they concluded must ori-

ginate beyond its orbit as they could not account for it
; on the

known principles of gravitation, they pursued the speculative

theory, till at length the discovery of this hitherto unknown
planet, crowned their labours with success, and has enabled us

to enlarge our present solar system to nearly double its bounds.

Herschel shines with a fine bluish white light, something be-

tween that of Venus and the Moon, and usually appears only

as a star of the eighth magnitude.

©f Saturn.

Saturn is by universal experience acknowledged to be the

most powerful, evil, and malignant of all the planets. In Na-
tivities he is most destructive : if placed in the mid-heaven, he
causes infinite trouble in business, credit, and honor. The per-

son is generally unfortunate in his principal undertakings and
;

when Saturn arrives at the cusp of the angle by direction , is

generally ruined. There is scarcely any aspect, however pow-
erful/can counteract this position. In the fourth house, he is

not so evil, but still unfortunate, and so of other places in the

horoscope but it must always be observed in these cases, whe-
;

ther Saturn is in aspect with other planets because if in good
;



CELESTIAL INFLUENCES OF THE PLANETS. 73

aspect to Jupiter, the evil is materially diminished, and even
Venus assists herein most powerfully.

Saturn is of a dull, whitish, leaden colour he is considered a
;

cold, dry, earthy, melancholy, masculine, malignant, solitary

star. When the body and mind are formed by Saturn, authors

describe the native as of middle stature, dark or pale com-
plexion, small black leering- eyes, thick lips and nostrils, large

ears, thin face, lowering looks, cloudy aspect, and seemingly
melancholy and unhappy, broad shoulders, small legs, and thin

beard. If well dignified by house, exaltation, or aspect , the

native will be acute, active, and penetrating but austere, slow,
;

and reserved, grave, close, and ungenerous, covetous, laborious,

patient, and mindful of injuries careful of what he gets, and
;

constant both in attachment and hatred. The beams of Saturn
and Herschel constitute the most decided Misers.

If ill dignified, or ill aspected, (for either are the same) the

native will be sordid, base, cowardly and suspicious, envious,

treacherous, malicious, and frowardly stubborn to a fault. The
real nature of Saturn is repining and gloominess : persons under
his immediate influence, generally see every thing through the

worst possible medium this generally breeds fear and mistrust.
;

An old author observes, “ The Saturnine man will never look

thee in the face” Another old author declares, that “if they
take to love any one, they love most constantly and if they

;

hate, they hate to the death.” They are generally solitary,

and fond of retirement from the busy ways of men, delighting
in solemn spectacles, deep mysteries, mournful music, tolling

of bells, and spectacles of horror as executions, and such like.
;

If Saturn be much afflicted, they become a prey to the most
gloomy misanthropy, and frequently commit suicide, especially

if Venus join in the malignancy of the operating directions :

this so true, that even at the present time, we have the epithet
“ Saturnine” as prefixed to one whose habits are gloomy and
morose, even by those who profess not to believe in Astrology.

He is said to govern the bones, spleen, teeth, joints, and
right ear, and those born under him are always said to have
bad teeth, and to be very much afflicted with disorders of the

teeth and gums, tooth-ache, &c he is also presumed to govern

the retentive faculties, of the mind, as the memory, &c. In

diseases, he denotes those which proceed from colds and ob-

structions, as agues, melancholy, all nervous diseases, fits, epi-

lepsy, black jaundice, cold humours and defluxions, fierce ca-

tarrhs, pthisis, atrophy, fistula, leprosy, apoplexy, palsy, and
dropsy. The ancient Astrologers record, that he is friendly
(according to natural sympathy and antipathy) with the 0 7/

and ^ , and at enmity or disagreeing with g $ and the D .

In horary questions, Saturn signifies (symbolically) sires,

grandfathers, ancient men, day labourers, paupers, beggars,

clowns, monks, husbandmen, the meaner sort of agriculturists,

sextons, grave diggers, &c. Of animals, &c, Saturn (accord-,

ing to the ancient Astrologers) rules the ass, cat, hare, mouse,

mole, dog, wolf, bear, elephant, basilisk, crocodile, scorpion,

serpent, adder, toad, hog, tortoise, eel, shell fish, and all crea-

tures delighting in filth, and breeding from putrefaction.

Of herbs, trees, &c. He rules the hemlock, starwort, bears-

foot, wolf-bane, fern, hellebore, henbane, burdock, dragon,
parsnip, poppy, pulse, mandrake, vervain, nightshade, moss, an-

gelica, box, borage, sage, spinach, cummin, fumitory, shep-
herd’s purse, horse tail, tamarisk, capers, polipody, senna, hemp,
savin, rue, willow, pine, yew, and cypress tree.

In the (tfeathered creation,” are subject to him, the crow,
owl, crane, thrush, ostrich, lapwing, peacock, bat, blackbird,

cuckoo, &c.
Amongst stones and minerals, he rules the sapphire, lapis

lazuli, all unpolished black and bluish stones, lead, the mag-
net, and the dross of all metals.

Of places, he delights in deserts, woods, obscure vallies,

dens, caves, holes, sepulchres, church-yards, ruinous buildings,

coal-pits, sinks, muddy dirty stinking places, wells and nui-

sances of every description. He delighteth in the east quarter

of the heavens, and rules the east wind and cold weather, with
frost or snow. His place in the Nativity is unfortunate to the
native as long as he lives and, therefore, if it can

; be ascer-
tained what part of the world he governs, when accounted
from the Horoscope, the native should never travel in that
direction.

In a word, Saturn is the greater infortune, the worst of all

the planets and were an Astrologer to forget himself so far,
;

as to desire some serious evil might befal his enemies, ordespi-
sers, he could not express himself more effectually to the pur-

pose, than by wishing' his adversary exposed to the hostile rays

of the sly, pernicious, and malignant old Saturn.

©f 3Jupitet\

“ Jupiter is hot and moist, temperate, modest, honest, adventurous, liberal, mer-

ciful, loving, and faithful ; i. e. giving these inclinations and therefore those an-

cient kings, beautified with these conditions, might be called thereafter Jupiter.”

ItaLeigh’s History of the World.

“ Beyond the sphere of Mars, in distant skies,

Itevolves the mighty magnitude of Jove,

With kingly state, the rival of the Sun.

About him round, four planetary Moons,

On earth with wonder, all night long beheld.

Moon above Moon, his fair attendants dance.”

Jupiter is the brightest of all the planets, except Venus,

which on some occasions, exceeds him in splendor. He is

considered the largest, and next to Saturn, the most powerful

planet in the system. He is found to be a planet in nature hot

and moist, sanguine and diurnal, the author next under divine

providence, of every earthly good, and “ every perfect gift

as also of temperance, justice, moderation and fortitude. He
is equally as powerful in good, as Saturn was before described

to be in evil the cause of riches, honors, and the greatest
;

success in life. When a native is born under his influence, he

will be tall and fair, handsome, portly, erect, and free in his

carriage, robust, ruddy, oval face, high forehead, full grey or

light eyes, soft thick brown hair, wide chest, long feet alto-

mous, mild and temperate in manners, moderate and moral, or

religious. If ill dignified or ill fortified and afflicted, by aspects

of Saturn, Mars, or Herschel, he will be a squanderer of his

wealth, a prodigal, reckless of shame, of shallow abilities, easily

led astray by fools, a bigot in religion, and a great epicure, or

given to intoxication, luxury, immoderately lascivious and lust-

ful, and honest only in appearances yet even then, he will be
;

esteemed as a “ hairbrained boon companion,” giving up to

every ones humour, never given to quarrels, but bearing injuries

without much repining, and a general, but not a firm friend.

The real nature of Jupiter is freedom, confidence, generosity,

frankness, benevolence, charity, good will, and nobleness of

disposition, being the exact reverse of the mistrust and cunning
of Saturn. Persons born under his favourable influences, are

useful and happy members of society, and almost universally

beloved.

This planet rules the lungs, blood, and internal viscera his

which arise from a plethoric habit and corrupt blood, He is

"When weak, he denotes mountebanks, quacks, empirics, knaves,

Mars, the next planet in order to Jupiter, is of a peculiar

colour,appearing like a bright flame or spark in the heavens,

especially when in Perigee, and thus readily distinguished from

other stars. He is a hot, dry, fiery, choleric, nocturnal, malig-

nant, and violent planet, the Astrological cause of anger, quar-

rels, contention, violence, war, slaughter and bloodshed. In

other respects far from fortunate, but not so evil as Saturn, as

his influence is by no means so lasting in which respect, the
;

influence of Saturn may be compared to a lingering but fatal

consumption and that of Mars to a burning fever, slakeing
;

its thirst in the life blood of the patient. He denotes a strong

well set, but short body, bony, lean, muscular, and strong red,

or ruddy complexion, sharp hazle eyes, light, or red hair, and a

rough violent countenance, furrowed by significant lines : when
he is fortunate by aspect with the leading significators, and
well dignified, he is said to produce a fearless, violent, irascible,

and unsubmitting person, naturally delighting in war, battle, or

contention, but in other respects prudent, rational, and even
generous or magnanimous. If unfortunate in configurations

and ill dignified, the native is wholly destitute of any virtue,

prone to violence, quarrels, treachery, robbery, murder, treason,

and every species of cruelty and wickedness. The real nature

of Mars is anger, and an eager wish to be in quarrels and mis-

chief of all sorts the countenance of those born under his in-
;

fluence, appears to be extremely vicious and unbending, rude,

unkind, and ferocious.—It may be truly said of them, that " the

bitterness of their wrath is cruel/’ They expect and exact
universal submission and although often magnanimous,

; they
are seldom kind or sociable. Such evil dispositions, however,
are seldom seen, (except in the cruelties of a Nero, or an Ali

Pacha and in a few such instances, where the same cruel fate
;

they had brought on others, generally overtakes themselves)
as the aspects of other planets alter it materially: but in low
life, the gallows generally ends the career of the “ ill starred”

child of Mars.

Mars is said by the ancients to govern the gall, left ear,
head, face, smell, imagination, reins, genitals, 8?c and the
diseases peculiar to this planet, are the small pox, jaundice,
fevers, measles, hot eruptions, carbuncles, diabetes, strangury,
burns, scalds, wounds and bruises, with all inflammatory dis-

eases. He is friendly, sympathetically, with J?
1J. @ $ and

£ , and has no enemy but the D .

In horary questions, he denotes symbolically, generals and
commanders of armies, soldiers, military men, surgeons, chy-
mists, physicians, apothecaries, druggists, armourers, watch
makers, barbers, all such as use implements of a sharp nature,
all trades wherein fire is used also curriers,

; smiths, carpenters,
bricklayers, sculptors, cooks, taylors, bakers, & c. When ill

placed, he denotes thieves, highwaymen, hangmen, jailors, and
“ all cut throat people.” An old author likewise observes,

ceed in height, or to be at the most above a yard and a half

high !”

Of animals, &c. Mars denotes the mastiff, wolf, tiger, pan-

ther, and all such beasts as are ravenous and bold
; also the

shark, pike, barbel, fork fish, all stinging water serpents, and
hurtful fish. Of birds, the hawk, kite, raven, vulture, owl,

cormorant, crow, magpie, and all ravenous birds of prey.

In the vegetable world, he rules all such herbs that are hot

and dry, or have sharp pointed leaves, or that are red, and usu-

ally in barren high stony places, as the thistle, brambles, briars,

nettles, onions, lingwort, radish, mustard seed, ginger, pepper,

garlick, hemlock, horehound, tamarinds, &c. and all trees
;

that are thorny or prickly.

In the mineral world, he governs blood stone, load stone,

jasper, touch stone, asbestos, amethyst, and the adamant also
;

iron, steel, arsenic, antimony, brimstone, and pungent minerals,

of a fiery or inflammable nature (likewise the different inflam-
;

mable gases, as a judicious modern Astrologer has observed.)

Of places, he denotes all those that are appertaining to fire

or blood, as laboratories, furnaces, distilleries, bake houses,

ovens, smiths or cutlers, butchers shops, and such like. He
delights in the Western quarter of the heavens, and causes

western winds, with thunder, lightning, fiery meteors, and a

dry pestilential air.

of Ptolemy although incorrect, according to Astronomical prin-

ciples, does not in the remotest degree affect the system of As-
trology which the ancients founded for the stars act universally

;

upon the earth and its inhabitants, according to their geocen-
tric or apparent position, without any regard to their true or

heliocentric places. He is considered as temperately hot and
dry, of his own nature scarcely good or evil, but a most pow-
erful source of ill fortune where afflicted by the other planets,

and placed in his debilities, or signs contrary to his nature as
;

on the contrary, when strongly aspected or placed in a geneth-
liacal scheme in signs of dignity, which are those of his own
nature, he is the source of much prosperity. The Sun is the
natural significator of credit, honour, and dignity or respectabi-

lity in life in every horoscope, and although he by no means mo-
nopolises the supreme or chief signification herein, (as some
writers have for lack of proper experience simply imagined) yet
it is most assuredly of the utmost consequence in every nativi-

ty , that the sun should be strong and unafflicted, both accord-
ing to the nature of the sign he occupies, and his different fa-

miliarities with adjuvant or hurtful stars. Some writers imagine
that Planets near the Sun, are rendered thereby, weak and
unfortunate this is, as far as the authors experience leads

; him
to judge, by no means the case, unless other causes should give
testimony thereto : indeed it is quite evident that many planets

within 60 zodiacal degrees of the Sun, are typical of an emi-
nent name and when in opposition to that luminary, the

; re-

verse, and peculiarly unfortunate, although this requires some
qualification, for should the satellitium of stars near the Sun, be
themselves weak, malignant by nature, or afflicted by aspect,

public notoriety in infamy alone, would ensue. In these, as in

all other cases, the student must well examine the different tes-

timonies, and carefully (not hastily) form his judgment thereon,

by which means he will doubtless be enabled to read the hea-
vens with far more exactness, than the greater part of those

who affect to disbelieve Astrology, can read their primer ! And

gained, and thoroughly understood, the rest will be compara-

tively facile and easy although at first sight they may be
; con-

sidered by the casual reader, as intricate and abstruse, which is

the case with every mathematical science, under the heavens.
Indeed it may well be expected that a science which dives so

deep intofuturity , and which approaches above all others so

near to celestial wisdom, should be somewhat more than others,

abstruse in the elements thereof but through the manifold
;

experience, and the united indefatigable labors of the “ philo-

sophic wise and great in all ages,” the Author can safely af-

firm that the art may be attained even in a far shorter time than
the common routine of mathematics, or even than the know-
ledge of the assumed science of Phrenology, which is by no
means to be compared with Astrological learning.

From this digression, which we thought proper to make, in

order to guard the student from being astounded at the (appa-
rently lengthened) descriptions of the heavenly bodies, which,
like the quantities of algebras, or the first rules of arithmetic,

are essential to be well remembered as the primum mobile of

the art.—We hasten to describe the description of person the

Sun gives, when principal significator, viz. a large bony ath-

letic strong body, broad high forehead, light sandy curling

hair, quick piercing eye, and well made person, but one who
will soon become bald. If well dignified or favourably aspect-

ed, the disposition is noble, magnanimous, proud and lofty, but
humane a faithful friend, and a generous enemy, scorning to use

;

advantages which may be given him over his opponents; gene-
rally of few words, but very pompous and magnificent fond

; of

dress, ornaments, and decorations of all sorts, extremely partial

to costly jewels, and splendid attire.

If ill dignified, and ill aspected, the native is both proud and
mean, arrogant and submissive, a tyrant, and yet a sycophant;
empty, vain, a great talker, restless, vain boasting, uncharitable,

despotical, unfeeling, and always seeking to serve himself be-

fore his friends, rarely generous but on the whole particularly
;

unamiable, and generally disliked on account of his arrogance
and ignorant pomposity.

cording to the sign he occupies, which experience leads the

author most positively to affirm (notwithstanding- late writers

have affirmed the contrary) thus in the watery signs
; s and

^ , he is not by far so fortunate as in V Q t , or even in ^ or

n. This, the student will bear in mind.

He is said by the ancients to govern the heart, back, arteries,

right eye of a man, and left eye of a woman ; as also to preside

over the retentive faculty, or memory. His diseases, are

faintings, palpitation of the heart, weak sight, fever, disordered

brain, cramp, foul breath, catarrhs, defluxions, disorders of the

mouth, throat, &c. He is by sympathy friendly to all the Pla-

nets except T? .

In horary Astrology he denotes, when well placed, kings,

emperors, monarchs, princes, dukes, marquisses, and indeed all

noble and high born people, and in general all “ of gentle

blood,” persons in high offices, or superiority in city, town, or

country, coiners, goldsmiths, workers in gold or silver, and

costly lapidaries or jewellers. When ill dignified and afflicted

by aspect, he signifies all persons in usurped authority. An
old author writes “ the Sun is under Mars, placed in the midst

of all the planets, being the chief light and president of them
all, sitting as a judge or king, amongst his nobles wherefore

;

some of the ancients have ascribed to him chief rule, and made
him as it were, an emperor amongst the stars.”

Of the brute and feathered creation, he rules all such beasts

as are stately, furious, bold, strong, and invincible, as the lion,

wolf, ram, boar, bull, horse, &c., as well as the phoenix, swan,

cock, hawk, nightingale, lark, &c and of fishes, the sea-calf,
;

shell-fish, star-fish, and the prodigies of the vast and mighty

ocean. In the vegetable world, he rules saffron, peony, marygold,

palm, ginger, dittany, celandine, vervain, amber, rosemary, St.

John’s wort, musk, rosa solis, cinnamon, eye bright, cinquefoil,

lignum aloes, lavender, sweet marjoram, pepper, honey, frank-

incense and all aromatic herbs. In minerals, &c. he rules

gold, and costly jewels, etites, the carbuncle, chrysolite, iris,

heliotropion, jacinth, pyrophilus, topas, ruby and diamond.
Of places, he denotes princes palaces, magnificent buildings,

dining rooms, towers, splendid apartments, and costly houses.

He causes Eastern winds, and delights in the Eastern part of

the heavens. His celestial path is always in the ecliptic
, and

he never has any latitude, in which respect he differs from
every other planet in the heavens even

; as in his splendor he
is more beauteous than the fairest of the “ wandering- orbs,”

“ Hail, amiable vision ! every eye

Looks up and loves thee ! every tongue proclaims

’Tis pleasant to behold thee !”

Venus is the next in order to the central Sun, a beauteous and
a brilliant planet, she is the only planet mentioned by the most
ancient poets, as Homer and Hesiod. Her Astrological charac-
ter $ , which to the present day is maintained by the Astrono-
mers is supposed to be “ a rude representation of a

; female fi-

gure with a trailing or flowing robe.” She is in poetry per-
sonified as the patron and friend of the softer passions an

; old
Astrologer writes, “ Venus, fair Venus, is the queen of love.”
The author of Waverley views her effects in the same poetical
light in his celebrated novel of “ Guy Mannering :

— “ Love’s world, his home, his birth-place ;

Delightfully dwells he ’mong fays and talismans,

And spirits, and delightedly believes

Divinities, being himself divine,

The intelligible forms of ancient poets,

The fair humanities of old religion,

The power, the beauty, and the majesty,

That had their haunts in dale or piny mountains,

Or forest by slow stream or

Or chasms and watery depths. All these have vanish’d
;

But still the heart doth need a language, still

Doth the old instinct bring back the old names
;

And to yon starry •world they now are gone,

Spirits or Gods, that used to share this earth

With man as with their friend and to the lover

Venus shines with a beautiful clear pellucid light, sufficient even

at times to cast a sensible shadow. Placidus, a celebrated As-
trologer of former times, thinks her “ bluish lustre denotes

heat at which rate this planet must be warmer than Jupiter.

She is a feminine, nocturnal, temperate planet, and considered

as next to Jupiter in benevolent influence : her beautiful bright-

ness may well denote an auspicious star, which she certainly is,

and those who have the happy fortune to be born with this

planet in the superior angles , are without fail noted for eminence
in the polite annals, or scientific arts of the day leaving a last-

;

ing name to posterity, as well as being the general favorites of

the fairer sex : and addicted to poetry, song, and music. Our
present beloved monarch, and most gracious majesty, George
IV. was born just as the benevolent “star of Venus” arose in

the horizon, or Eastern angle, termed by Astrologers the as-

cendant or “ House of life,” and prime significator of manners
now it is well known to all Europe what a refined and polished
genius, and what exquisite taste, the King of England posses-

ses, which, therefore may be cited as a most illustrious proof of
the celestial science a proof likewise which

monstrable, even to the most casual observer, since the time
of his nativity is taken from the public journals of the period

;

and cannot be gainsayed.

less, and lascivious : she denotes a peculiarly handsome confor-
mation of body, generally very beautiful sparkling hazle or
black eyes, round smooth face, light or chesnut hair, dimples in

the cheek or chin, an amorous look, but sweet voice. An old
author says, “ having a love dimple in the chin, a lovely mouth,
cherry lips, and a right merry countenance in short the real

nature of Venus (Astrologically speaking) is mildness and good-
ness, and those under her influence are generally the most ac-
complished in the haut-ton, or sphere of fashion; and votaries
of the song, the dance, and music’s enchanting fascinations

They are usually merry, “ even to a fault.”

Venus is said (by the old authors on the sideral art) to rule

the reins , spine generative system , the neck,
, throat and breasts

;

her diseases are those of the back, loins, and of the aforesaid
parts as also priapism, syphilis, heartburn, and

; secret fashion-
able diseases, or disorders peculiar to luxury and free living.

She is by sympathy found to be friendly to every planet except
the leaden star of T? •

In the horary system of stellar science, Venus denotes musi-
cians, embroiderers, perfumers, artists, painters, classic model-
lers or sculptors, dealers in the dresses or ornaments of the rich

and wealthy, and all who work in elegant attire, or administer
to the luxuries of the great, when strong and well dignified

but whfen weak in these respects, she represents gamesters, and
the lower orders of the votaries of pleasure and voluptuousness.
Venus rules all such animals as are amorous in nature, and

also the dog, sheep, goat, bull, Calf, panther, and hart : amongst
birds, the swan, kingfisher, swallow, pelican, pigeon,sparrow,
turtle dove, stock dove, crow, eagle, partridge, thrush, black-
bird, pye, wren, &c. and amongst fishes, the pilchard, crab,

lobster, whiting, salmon, and dolphin. In the vegetable crea-

tion, there sire subject to her influence, all such plants as are

odoriferous, pleasant .sweet, and delectable, as satyrion, daffodil,

maiden-hair, the violet, valerian, vervain,thyme roots, the rose,

lilly, &c., with every kind of fragrant spice : and of trees, the
fig tree cypress, pomegranate, apple tree, pear tree,

; myrtle,

tree, and all delightful perfumes, as ambergrease, musk, civet,

and fragrant gums of all kinds.

also copper, brass, and their different ores. Of places, she de-

fountains, wardrobes, banqueting houses, theatres, & c. She is

“ We, tho’ from heaven remote, to heaven will move

With strength of mind, and tread the abyss above ;

And penetrate with an interior light,

Those upper depths which nature hid from sight.

Pleas’d will we be to walk along the sphere

Of shining stars, and travel with the year

To leave this heavy earth, and scale the height

Of Atlas, who supports the heavenly weight

To look from azure clouds, and thence survey

Mistaken mortals wand’ring from the way.”

Ovid’s Metamorphosis.

The planet Mercury is the smallest of all the primary pla-

nets, and moves the quickest in his celestial orbit; he is so near
the central sun, as rarely to be seen except a little

; before

sun-rise in the morning, and a little after sun-set in the even-
ing; but even then, his motion is so rapid towards the sun, that

he can only be discerned for a short space of time. When ob-
served through a telescope, he appears of a bright white glis-

tening color, but to the naked eye he appears more of a dull

leaden color : the ancient Grecian Astrologers, (in their un-
rivalled classical delineations of both celestial and terrestrial

objects) assigned to this planet the celestial office of being “the
swift messenger of the Gods,” and represented him by the fi-

gure of “ a youth with wings at his head and feet,” whence
the character $ , is symbolically derived. The singular cir-

cumstance of Mercury forming so conspicuous a feature in the



CELESTIAL INFLUENCES OF THE PLANETS. §7

doctrines of judicial Astrology, (since he is said to rule the

whole of the rational and intellectual faculties), is perhaps a

stronger proof of the verity of this art than could well be ima-
gined for were those precepts and judgments, “ founded on

;

whim and fancy” (as some say), the ancients never would have
constituted an almost invisible planet, as the chief ruler of the

mental powers but would doubtless have chosen some other
,

more visible and ponderous star, for that important office. The
student, and judicious reader will be probably led to notice this

remarkable fact, in the course of perusing our writings, on si-

deral subjects, a fact which to the unprejudiced enquirer is

worth more than an hundred syllogistical arguments, pro and
con, on the matter in hand.

Mercury is the Astrological source of wit, ingenuity, inven-

tion, discovery, and eminent skill in science, art, and almost

every important branch of human knowledge. He is consi-

dered as a cold, dry, earthy, melancholy star when well dig-
;

nified or free from hostile aspects of afflicting stars, the mind is

strong, vigorous, active, “ searching and exhausting both
worlds, and imagining new;” the memory retentive, tenacious,

inheriting a natural thirst for knowledge, which all the wells

of discovered science cannot slake, but still does the intellectual

soul wish, ‘"ardent and aspiring,” for store after store of philo-

sophic, classic, or celestial learning generally the most elo-
:

quent orators, the most skilful philosophers, the most eminent
mathematicians, and the most rare and curious of mankind are

under “
his selectest influence;” no one can become distin-

guished or eminent in life, for real abilities, unless Mercury in

their horoscope be free from evil configurations.

George Bidder, the calculating youth, whose nativity the

reader may see in “ the Astrologer of the nineteenth century,” was
born decidedly under the auspicious influence of £ > having the

sign Gemini for his horoscope, with Mercury
, therein, in zo-

diacal parallel to the Moon, which not only confirms what is

before laid down, but (as there can be no evasion as to the time

of his birth being correct) proves the theory of the ancients to

be unquestionable but when Mercury is afflicted or ill digni-
;

fied by aspect, configuration, or discordancy of sign, the native

will be a mean, shuffling-, unprincipled character, a voucher of

falsehoods, and void of real understanding.

The real Mercurial person is of a tall, upright, spare body,

long nose, dark eyes, long visage, dark hair, long slender hands
and fingers, which last is a peculiar mark of Mercury. The
color varies as he is aspected by other Stars, but generally he
is any thing but of fair complexion, and often quite dark co-

lored, or very sallow. He governs the brain, tongue, hands,
and feet his diseases are madness, apoplexy, vertigo, head-
aches, stammering, dumbness, stoppage or humour in the head,
coughs, and rheumatic or gouty disorders. His enemies are

In the queslionary art he denotes, when well placed, Astro-

logers, philosophers, mathematicians, secretaries, officers of

state, merchants, travellers, sculptors, poets, lawyers, teachers,

orators, ambassadors, commissioners, artificers, and all inge-

nious clever persons. When weak, he represents scriveners,

clerks, pettifoggers, vile persons, cunning in acting mischief,

thieves, carriers, messengers, footmen, servants, &c.

Of beasts, he rules all such as are of quick sense, ingenious,

inconstant, and swift also such as are easily taught by man, as
;

the dog, ape, fox, weasle, hart, mule, hare, civet cat, squirrels,

the hyaena, spider, &c. and of fishes, the mullet, and all swift
;

reptiles likewise of birds, all those that are naturally witty
;

and inconstant, as the nightingale, linnet, ibis, blackbird,

thrush, parrot, swallow, jay, crane, cockatoo, the lark, and the

jackdaw. Of herbs and plants, he rules cinquefoil, marjoram,

fumitory, pimpernel, parsley, and such “ as are of divers colors,

and mixed natures,” or those which in medicine have chief re-

lation to the brain and tongue, or which remove obstructions,

and comfort the spirits, as adders tongue, lungwort, dragon-
wort, vervain, hiera, diambra, &c. Of trees, the walnut, filbert,

and hazel, &c.

In the mineral creation, he rules quicksilver, tin, marchasite,

aetates, red marble, topaz, millstone, granite, and all stones of

spotted colours.

Of places, Mercury represents symbolically academies, schools,

common halls, or public convened assemblies, places where
lively games are held, as tennis and racket courts, fairs, ordina-

ries, markets, bowling-greens, the hall, study, libraries, count-

ing houses, pulpits, &c. He delighteth in the northern quarter

of the heavens, and his influence over the weather is usually

according to the applying planet, to whose aspect he is has-

tening.

Beattie.

Cynthia, “ the queen of heaven,” as the ancients termed
her, or the Moon, the companion of the earth, and chief source

of our evening light, is a cold, moist, watery, phlegmatic pla-

net, variable to an extreme, in Astrological science, and par-

taking of good or evil, as she is aspected by good or evil stars.

When angular and unafflicted in a nativity, she is the promis-

sary pledge of great success in life, and continual good fortune.

She produces a full stature, fair pale complexion, round face,

grey eyes, short arms, thick hands and feet, smooth, corpulent,

and phlegmatic body. Blemishes in the eyes, or a peculiar

weakness in the sight, is the result of her being afflicted by the

Sun. Her conjunction, semisextile, sextile, or trine; to Jupiter,

is exceedingly fortunate and she is said by the old

birds, she rules the goose, swan, duck, dobchick, moor hen,

plants, she rules sea weed, lunaria, hyssop, rosemary, agnus
castus, pompion, melon, gourd, cucumber, colewort, cabbage,
endive, mushrooms, poppy, linseed, rapeseed, and all such herbs
which are said to follow the course of the moon, in her increase

and decrease. Of trees, she rules the palm tree, (which the
ancients say “ send forth a twig every time the moon rises/’)

and all plants, trees, and herbs, juicy and full of sap.

In the mineral kingdom, the ancients attribute to the moon
silver and silver ore; all stones that are white and green, as

duces such weather as her various aspects with the other stars

would naturally show, having of her own simple nature but
small influence either way, over the electric fluid of the atmos-
phere.

in mind, that, there are four cardinal points in the mundane
circle of the earth round her own axis, which is not only de-

monstrable to reason, but known to every one these are, the
;

exact line wherein the Sun (speaking- according- to the course

of custom) rises in the morning , where he comes to the meri-

dian or mid-day, where he sets in the evening of the same day,

and where he comes to the Nadir, twelve o’clock, or midnight
line . The first of these, that is, the line (or imaginary line)

which is level with the horizon when the sun rises, is the As-

trologer's first house, or first grand angle, termed the Horos-

cope or ascendant. The second point, or the degree, when he

is at his highest altitude, which invariably is in every latitude

at noon-day, is the Astrologer’s tenth house, or mid-heaven,

and most powerful angle, or house of honor. Pursuing the

same course, the apparent line level with the horizon, when
the sun sets, constitutes the seventh house in the sidereal

art, being the third grand angle, and setting horizon or de-
scendant. Again, at midnight, the Sun arrives to the cusp or

line of the lower heaven, or nadir, or as Astrologers term it,

the Imum Cceli andfourth house. These four cardinal points,

as before observed, all men are sensibly aware of, and the most
inveterate critic that may be fated to lash our present system,
will, we presume, allow us in this instance to hold our propo-
sition undisputed since, although we cannot in the

; “etherial
blue" discern these said lines or terminating divisions, both
reason and experience (leaving mathematical science out of the
question) assure us that they certainly exist; therefore the
Astrologer has certain grounds for the choice of his four an-
gular houses, which, resembling the palpable demonstration
they afford, (even to the most bigoted incredulist) are in the
Astral science esteemed the most powerful of the whole.
Now at the equator, where the sun is vertical, and all celes-

tial arcs are measured by rectangles, equal parts of the zodiac
pass through the great circle of the equator in equal times, or
in other words, every house of heaven would contain just thirty
degrees but in

; every other part of the globe, the oblique in-
clination of the earth in her orbit, (which causes the length
and shortness of our days) causes the Sun apparently to rise

earlier, and set later at one period of the year than another
and this causes his semi-diurnal arc, or the apparent space be-

tween sun rising and noon, to be greater or less, as the year
advances or decreases therefore, when

; the time of sun rising*

is obtained, and subtracted from noon-day, it is self-evident the
difference will give a certain space of time, which in hours and
minutes, constitutes half the day. This space of time the As-
trologer next turns into degrees and minutes, (by multiplying
each hour by fifteen degrees of the equator, and the minutes in

proportion) which measured on the tropic of Cancer, and di-

vided into two other equal parts, causes the space between Sun
rise and noon-day to have three equal divisions, thus constituting
two other houses of heaven, namely, the eleventh and twelfth
houses. The same method is pursued on the same principles,

with the remaining part of the great diurnal and nocturnal
circle, giving for the result, the whole of the twelve celestial

houses, which thus are proved to be neither visionary nor ima-
ginary, butfounded on truths, as solid and substantial, as the
course of the sun through thefirmament, (or in other words, of
the earth around that luminary) and defying the most acute
incredulist to deny their existence.

“ The western Sun withdraws ; meanwhile the Moon
Full orb’d, and breaking through the scatter’d clouds.

Shows her broad visage in the crimsoned east."

Thomson.

The four first of these houses, namely,the first, tenth, seventh,

and fourth, are termed angles, as being of the greatest strength

and power the next four are termed succeedents, as
; being of

less energy, but still next in sympathetic power, and are the
second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh houses. The weakest of all

in influence are the cadent, which are the third, ninth, sixth,

and twelfth houses and it is not without reason that
; these

divisions are made, which the attentive student, who wishes to

read the true language of the stars, will most readily discover
;

in which respect he will reap the benefit of the “ labours of

ages,’’ and from the rust of antiquity will distinguish the true

polish of substantial science.



1)4 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

There have been various opinions amongst Astrological wri-

ters, as to the nature and effect of certain aspects, familiarities,

and configurations of the active and passive stars or agents
;

but in the effects of the houses, they are nearly all (or quite

all) unanimous, both in the oriental and European regions;

which we will now proceed to illustrate, in a manner intelli-

gible to any one, that will but pursue the subject with a little

undivided and close attention.

ASTROLOGICAL EFFECTS

From the most renowned Authors and selectest manuscript

writings.

“ Thus measuring things in heav’n by things on earth

At thy request, and that thou may’st beware

By what is past, to the^ 1 have reveal’d

What might have else to human race been hid.”

Milton.

Astrologers in their descriptions usually commence with the

FIRST HOUSE,

or house of “ Life,” the point of the Eastern angle and horizon,

the celestial sign, ascending on which point, at the instant of

birth, and the stars or planets located therein, bears the most
powerful influence upon the life and destiny of the native (or

person whose horoscope it is). Saturn or Mars in this house
never fail to give accidents and illness, when directed to the

cusp of the ascendant, as also to be a perpetual trouble through-
out life while Jupiter or Venus therein, free from affliction, are

;

perpetual tokens of good fortune, eminent success, and lasting

credit. The sign ascending will also peculiarly mark the bodily

form and mental intellect. In horary questions, this house
relates to all questions of life, health, and appearance as sta-

;

ture, colour, shape, sickness, and accidents it also shows the
;

events of journeys, voyages, &c., with respect to the life and
health of the querent engaged in them : it is invariably the

chief significator when life and health are concerned. In State

questions, comets, eclipses, &c , as also at the annual ingress of

the Sun into Aries the first house signifies the people at large,
;

or the health and well being of the kingdom where it is erected,

and wherein the general mass of inhabitants are concerned. By
being considered as the symbolical ascendant of any other

person, either related or not related, near or absent, it will shew
the same to them, as if the figure had been erected at their own
request. According to a very old manuscript of the twelfth

century , it signifies u the money of private enemies, as being
- the second house in order from the twelfth the brethren of

;

friends, as being the third from the eleventh house it signifies
;

the fathers of kings, as being the fourth from the tenth house
also children of religious folks, for it is the fifth from the ninth

house also the sickness of his open (or public) enemies, as
;

being the sixth house from the seventh in order and upon the
;

wife of his open enemy, or of fellows, (or partners) for it is

opposed to the seventh house : it also signifies upon death of

servants, as it is the eighth, reckoning from the sixth house
it is the significator of religion and long journeys to the askers

children, being the ninth house from the fifth, and upon magis-
tery and dignity of his father, being the tenth to the fourth

house also friends to the askers brethren, being the eleventh
;

house from the third, and to the askers self it personates the

beginning and fate of every hazardous enterprise.-

It is a masculine house, and rules the head and face the

same as the sign r*

OF THE SECOND HOUSE.

The next house in order from the ascendant is the second

house, or house of “ Riches.” This signifies the estate, fortune

and property, riches, gain or loss in pecuniary affairs, poverty,

misfortune, and in fact every thing relating to (that plague of

the wise man, and that idol of the fool) gold, and “ the worlds
wide wealth” of him for whom the figure is cast. The ancient

Astrologers attribute the same effects to this house, both in

nativities and horary figures but this requires some explana-
;

tory developement, for if the nativity be afflicted other ways,
if the luminaries are evilly aspected by Saturn, Mars, or Hers*



THE TWELVE HOUSES OF HEAVEN. 97

cliel, even though Jupiter should be posited in the second
house, and in his most powerful dignities, the native would be
far more liable to misfortune and loss than fortunate. The at-

tentive student will at once perceive from this explanation, that

the genuine principles of the celestial science are founded on
philosophical axioms, which nothing can neutralise, and which
invariably point to the same steady objects.

In the questionary art, the second house denotes the money
of the querent, his loss or gain in speculations relating to busi-

ness or pecuniary affairs in general, or any question in particu-

lar also of loans, friends, and assistants in law-suits, and such
;

like. In State Astrology, it denotes allies, warlike officers, and
the pecuniary resources of the nation at large especially in

; the

scheme of the heavens, which is cast for the vernal ingress.

According to MSS. writers, the second house denotes “inhe-
ritance, lucre, and divers winning ; also it denotes the brethren

of private enemies, for it is the third house as accounted from

the twelfth and fathers, or grandsires of friends, for it is the
;

fourth from the eleventh house also king's sons, for it is the
;

fifth house from the mid-heaven also upon the death of wives,
;

familiars, fellows, (partners) and open or public enemies, as

being the eighth house from the seventh, in due order also
;

upon the religion and long journeys of servants, for it is the

ninth reckoned from the sixth house; also upon the trade,

(magistery) credit, profession, and honor of children, as being

the tenth house from the fifth also upon the friends and well-
;

wishers of fathers, being the eleventh reckoned from the fourth

house; and lastly, upon private enemies of brethren as being
the twelfth reckoned from the third house."

It is a feminize house, and similar in effect to the sign & ,

ruling the neck and shoulders.

OF THE THIRD HOUSE.

This is the house of brethren, kindred, neighbours, cousins ;

short inland journeys, letters, messages, rumours, and the re-

moval of trade or employment. From this house the ancient
Astrologers derived their judgment, relative to the kindred or

brethren of the native, born under any particular horoscope,

with the good or bad fate attending them ; and also of those

particular changes which were perpetually recurring throughout

life in which particular they were accustomed to judge by the
;

lords of the house, and triplicity, according to that sign or con-

stellation of heaven which was found on the cusp, great part

of which judgment can scarcely be relied upon but when ma-
;

lefic or unfortunate stars, are located in this house, or \n mun-
dane square, semisquare, or opposition thereto, the attentive

student will readily perceive appropriate evil effects, corres-

ponding to the significations of the house above described, thus

Saturn being there, is generally found to cause hatred and ill-

fortune through brethren, neighbours, and short journeys—
Herschel there, never permits the native to rest long in one
place, or to meet with mutual affection from his kindred but

;

Mars afflicted in the third house is said by the ancients to be
“ the very demon of discord and genius of ill luck in all things

to which the house has relation.” The good planets of course

have benign effects, most palpably visible.

In horary questions, every signification, of the house is al-

lowed in its full symbolical allusion, for in such cases the indi-

cation will no doubt be complete : hence all questions relative

to the aforesaid subjects, are judged as well by the lord of the

house, as the accidental positions and configurations thereto.

In addition to those descriptions, the following are manuscript
;

“ Zael,” an Arabian writer of great repute, sets forth the third

house as denoting “ sects, epistles, dreams, mutation, churches,

clerks, carols, changing of women from place to place, & c.

being the fourth house, as reckoned in order from the twelfth,

it signifies the fathers of private enemies, the sons of friends

being the fifth to the eleventh house also the sickness
; of

kings, for it is the sixth house from the tenth or mid-heaven
;

also the enemies of religious persons, for it is the seventh house,

or opposite to the ninth as well as the magistery (or trade)
; of

servants, as being the tenth house to the sixth and the
; friends

of children, being the eleventh house to the fifth and the
; pri-

vate enemies of the father, as being the twelfth house in order
from the fourth house/'



THE TWELVE HOUSES OF HEAVEN 99

It is a masculine house, and similar to n, ruling the arms,
hands, and shoulders.

OF THE FOURTH HOUSE.

The lower angle of heaven, or fourth house, whose line, or

cusp, the Sun touches at midnight, is the weakest in influence

of all the other angles throughout the celestial circle : it repre-

sents in nativities, most powerfully the parents of the native,

especially the father but the opposition of Saturn, Mars,
; or

Herschel to the mid-heaven, which is the same as coming to

the cusp of this house, not only frequently afflicts the father, but
as an evil aspect to one angle, is felt by all four, (each aspect-

ing the other) frequently causes death or severe misfortunes to

the native’s mother. Good planets in this house (even Jupiter)

lose much of their active influence, and are particularly weak,
even as promiltors in directions. The ancients gave this house
of heaven to represent the final end of all things, whether in

nativities or horary questions. In the latter it represents the
querent’s father, his patrimony all affairs relating to

; lands,

houses, cities, estates, towns, castles, hidden treasure, curious

secrets, and all things belonging to the earth as also
; old houses,

ruinous buildings, monuments of sepulchral arts or superstitious

rites antiquities, gardens, fields, orchards, vineyards,
; corn

fields, &c. : it is said to denote the house or residence of the
querent at the time he wishes a question resolved, and thefinal
issue of every undertaking, with its diversified or casual contin-
gencies. “ Alcabitius” an old Astrologer, and other manuscript
writers, say of this house, that it denotes “ dead men’s goods, and
all inheritances descending by a right line to the querent and

;

of all things immoveable, as cities, castles, and such other, and
of treasure hid, and of what shall befall the dead man in his

grave, and (after his burial) to his corpse and what
; shall fall

after death, as also to all questions touching the substance of
brethren, being the second to the third house and of the

; chil-

dren of private enemies, being the fifth house to the twelfth
;

and sickness of friends, as being the sixth house accounted from
the eleventh house also upon the king’s enemies, being the

;

seventh house from the tenth or mid-heaven and death
; of re-

ligious persons, being the eighth house accounted from the

ninth and upon the religion of the absent, as being
; the ninth

to the eighth house also upon the (trade or) magistery of
; ene-

mies, being the tenth from the seventh house also upon the
;

friends and fortune of servants, being the eleventh to the sixth

house and lastly, upon all questions relating
; to the private

enemies of children, being the twelfth or house of enemies to

the fifth house.”
It is a feminine house, and being represented by rules in

like manner the breast and lungs, as that sign does.

OF THE FIFTH HOUSE.

From the fifth house. Astrologers both ancient and modern,
deduce their judgments relative to the children or offspring of

the native Ptolemy joins with this the angle of the mid-hea-
;

ven, and also the eleventh house : it is said to be the house of
children and women, which in horary Astrology it certainly is

denoting also the father’s property, both personal and real ;

childrens health and welfare, whether present or absent also
;

all questions relating to pleasure, amusement, gaming, taverns,

theatres, banquets and merry-making of all sorts it is also the
;

house of pregnancy.
In State Astrology, it denotes ambassadors or messengers; as

well the strength or weakness of any besieged place. Ac-
cording to an ancient manuscript, Haly, and other Arabian
Astrologers of past times, set forth various other significations

of the fifth house, as denoting “ in the above art, the cheapness

or dearness of bread, wine, and victuals in general for that re-

gion to which the horoscope is erected.” In horary questions,

the same authors write, “ the fifth house signifies, upon chil-

dren, delectation, pleasure and legacies; also upon charters,

books and messages it also signifies the brethren of brethren,
;

for it is the third house accounted from the third; and the sub-

stance of father’s, being the second to the fourth house also
;

the sickness of private enemies, being the sixth house from the

twelfth and the enemies of friends, as being the seventh house
;



THE TWELVE HOUSES OF HEAVEN. 101

or opposite to the eleventh house and the death of kings or
;

monarchs as being the eighth house from the tenth, or medium
coeli and long journeys of religious persons, as being the ninth

;

house to the ninth and the magistery or dignity of the absent,
;

as being the tenth to the eighth house also
; the friends of the

askers or enquirers enemies, as being the eleventh to the se-

venth house and lastly, the private enemies of servants,
; as

being the twelfth house to the sixth.” It is a masculine house,

and like Q , rules the stomach, liver, heart, sides, and back.

OF THE SIXTH HOUSE.

Astrologers attribute to the sixth house an evil signification
;

it is the house of sickness, and partly of private enemies, being
in opposition to the twelfth house, and the parts of body which
is ruled by the signs on the cusp of this house, or accidentally

intercepted therein, are said to denote diseases. In horary ques-

tions, it represents different effects, being the house not only of

sickness, but of servants, dependants, uncles, aunts, and all kin-

dred by the father’s side small cattle, rabbits, sheep, goats and
;

hogs tenants, stewards, shepherds, farmers, &c. : all questions
;

relating to these subjects, are judged from the sixth house. In

State Astrology, it denotes the sickness or health, of the com-
munity at large.

Manuscript Arabian Astrologers
, represent the sixth house,

as being “ the house of vassals, beasts not ridden, also the sub-

stance of children, as being the second house to the fifth and
;

the brethren of fathers, for it is the third to the fourth house ;

and the fathers of brethren, as being fourth to the third house
;

and also enemies of enemies, being the seventh house from the

twelfth also the death of friends, as being the eighth house
;

to the eleventh : and long journeys, and religion of kings, be-

ing the ninth house to the tenth or medium coeli also magis-
;

tery and lay dignities, being the tenth or house of honor to the

ninth house and enemies of the absent, and private enemies of
;

wives (and fellows), being the twelfth house to the seventh.”

It is a feminine house, and similar to uj), ruling the abdomen
and intestines.



102 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

OF THE SEVENTH HOUSE.

The seventh house, the cusp of which is the western line of

the descending horizon, or point where the Sun sets is of great
;

significance in Astrology, being most powerful in marriage and
domestic happiness. If Saturn or Mars should happen to be
posited in this house, unaided by the assisting beams of Jupiter

or Venus; the native is certainly fated (from the malignant
aspects of hostile stars) to be unfortunate in the wedded state,

and born to lead a life of continual trouble therein. Unhappi-
ness in wedlock, arising from the most strange and unaccount-

able causes, are also the effects of Herschel, when found there-

in in which respects the seventh house is certainly more
;

powerful than the Moon or Venus, (which are the Ptolemian

Astrologers’ chief significators in marriage). In horary ques-

tions, the seventh house denotes love questions, contracts, spe-

culations in business, war, or public duels, encounters with

thieves, law-suits, public adversaries, partners in trade, and li-

tigation it is the ascendant of thieves, and describes their per-
;

sons and occupation.

In State Astrology, it is the house from whence the event of

war or peace is predicted. In a battle it denotes the victorious

party; it also denotes run-a-ways, outlaws, and the place to

which a person is going to remove or change their residence.

Alcabitius, iEdila, Morbecca, and various Arabian Astrolo-

gers, according to manuscripts, record the seventh house, as
“ the house of all contentions, oppositions, contrariences, and
things opposed upon battle, strife, and enmity fines,

; ; pleas,

laws, &c. and is the house of buying, selling, and nuptials
; ;

death of enemies, friends of brethren, sons of friends, and the

place of theft;” and in compound signification it is said to be

the house signifying the substance of servants, as being the

second house to the sixth, in due order and sisters of brethren,
;

being the third house to the fifth also the fathers of fathers,
;

being the fourth house to the fourth and the children of
; bre-

thren, being the fifth to the third house also it signifies
; the

death of private enemies, being the eighth to the twelfth house
;



;

THE TWELVE HOUSES OF HEAVEN. 103

as also for the same reason, the death of great beasts. Again it

signifies the religion and long journeys of friends, being the

ninth house to the eleventh also upon the honor or credit
; of

kings, being the tenth house to the mid-heaven and also
; the

friends and fortune of religious persons, being the eleventh
house to the ninth : as also the private dealings of the absent,

and their enemies, as being the twelfth house from the eighth.”
It is accounted a masculine house, similar to in its rule

over the bodily members, which the student can refer to.

OF THE EIGHTH HOUSE.

This is termed the house of death, wills, legacies, portions,

dowry of the wife and in law-suits it denotes
; the adversaries

means, friends, and success. In duels it is the adversaries se-

cond. It denotes the property and means of the querent’s part-

ner, and the strength of public enemies. Although, in nativi-

ties, the cause of death is not judged from this house of heaven,
yet whenever Jupiter is therein, or even Venus, unafflicted, it

is impossible the party should die violently.

Manuscript Astrologers “ of yore,” describe this house, as

symbolically representing “ labor, sorrow, battle, strife, slaugh-
ter, dower and inheritance of the dead, and money of public
enemies : it signifies also the brethren of servants, being the
third house to the sixth ; and fathers of children, being the
fourth house to the fifth and sickness of brethren,

; being the
sixth house to the third also religion,

; and journeys of private
enemies, being the ninth house to the twelfth and dignity

; and
magistery of friends, being the tenth house to the eleventh

;

and kings friends, being the eleventh house to the mid-heaven
also the private enemies of religious persons, being the twelfth
house to the ninth.” Haly, records the eighth house, as repre-
senting “ Persons wretched and miserable, and liable to bodily
deformities and whether the asker

; shall die in indigence or
abundance.”

It is a feminine house, similar to v\ in its rule over the parts
of the body



;

104 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

OF THE NINTH HOUSE

In Astrology, the ninth house, is called the house of religion,

science, learning, books, writings, voyages and distant travels.

It is peculiar to the church denoting all ecclesiastical matters,
;

and all church preferments clergymen of every degree. Dreams,
;

visions, and long journeys. In horary questions, the Arabian
Astrologers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, represent

the ninth house as being “ the house of faith, wisdom, and di-

vine worshipping.” Guido Bonatus calls it “ the house of

fame.” Haly, terms it the house of prophets and prophecies,

council, and prayers others write it, as being “ the house
; of the

wifes, or enemies brethren, being the third house to the seventh,

and fathers of servants, being the fourth house to the sixth

and children of children, as being the fifth bouse to the fifth.

Also sickness of fathers, being the sixth house to the fourth
;

and enemies of brethren, being the seventh house to the third
;

also friends of friends, being the eleventh house to the eleventh :

and private enemies of kings, being the twelfth house to the
tenth house in the order of the heavens.”

It is a masculine house, like f in bodily rule; denoting the
same parts of the body which that sign does.

OF THE TENTH HOUSE

The mid-heaven, medium cceli, or angle of the South, whose
line or cusp the sun touches at mid-day or noon, is termed the
tenth house in the Astral art, and is the chief or supreme angle
of the heavens

; denoting honor, credit, renown, authority,

trade, preferment, &c. In nativities, the planets here are most
powerful and while

; Jupiter, Venus, or Sol, herein, give great
eminence in life, Saturn never fails to give disgrace and ruin,

when alone or unaided by benevolent stars. In the former in-

stance, may be noticed the Duke of Wellington, who has the
goodfortune to be born with Jupiter in this “ house of honor
in the latter, the late emperor Napoleon, who born with Sa-
turn his evil-star

, in the tenth house, might well be expected



THE TWELVE HOUSES OF HEAVEN. 105

to have met with a downfal as rapid as his rise, and which se-

veral French Astrologers predicted.—These are two of the

most illustrious instances of modern times, and well worthy the

attention of those self-conceited but (in reality) simple persons,

who affect to deny the validity of Astrological presages, which
are probably far above their puny comprehension. Many other

instances could be given, but to the wise observer of nature,

who possesses aught of “ the milk of kind concession” where
his learning does not reach, and to the philosophic enquirer,

these will suffice. “ Utrum horum mavis accipe.” The tenth

house is therefore a principal feature in Astrological predictions,

as it is also in the arithmetical part of the science, or Astrono-
mical calculations, since all arcs of directions to the angles are

measured from the right ascension of the mid-heaven.
In horary questions it denotes the mother of the querist: and

in State Astrology, kings, emperors, nobles, dukes, empires,

kingdoms, and provinces, with “ the great” in general being-
;

the true ascendant of the mighty and powerful, and the house
of “ high” or illustrious “ life.”

Manuscript writers say it is the house “ of lordship, honor,
and dignity; and of all craft of which a man is master.”
Albateyzen, an ancient writer, further says, “it is the house of

judges, judgment, substance taken away by thieves, also the

substance or money of religious persons, being the second house
to the ninth and brethren of the servants of open

; enemies,
being the third to the eighth and fathers of

; enemies or fel-

lows (partners,) being the fourth house to the seventh also
;

children of servants, being the fifth to the sixth house and
;

sickness of sons, being the sixth to the fifth house and public
;

enemies, wives, and fellows of fathers, being the seventh or

opposite house to the fourth, in due order also death
; of bre-

thren, being the eighth house to the third and
; the religion of

the servants of the asker, being the ninth house to the second
;

also friends of private enemies, being the eleventh house to the
twelfth and lastly, private enemies of friends, being

; the twelfth
house to the eleventh.”

It is a feminine house, and being in order, similar to yf rules
;

the knees and hams.



IOC A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

OF THE ELEVENTH HOUSE.

Both the Oriental and European Astrologers are unanimous
in describing the eleventh house of heaven, as being the house
friends, wishes, hopes, desires, advisers, favourites, flatterers

and such like contingencies. Mr. Wilson thinks the eleventh

house of great power in nativities in a benevolent way. This,

however, is by no means the case for the author of this work
;

positively asserts from his own experience, that when evil

planets are on the cusp of this house, or located therein, they
are increased in evil, in a most remarkable proportion, and are

worse there than in the sixth or twelfth, and nearly as bad as

when angular. The student will soon perceive the truth of

this axiom, if he examines a few correct nativities.

In horary Astrology, according to every professor, if this

house of heaven be afflicted by evil position or aspect, in any
theme of heaven whatever, or upon any occasion, the querist,

or enquirer, will sutfer severe disappointment in the projected

affair; and in State Astrology, it represents the wealth and
money, or the “ exchequer” of the government, and the friends

or allies of the nation at large.

Zael, Haly, Abenragel, Adila, Gerald, and manuscript wri-

ters of the olden time,” state the eleventh house of heaven
as being “ the house of knights, esquires, ambassadors, and
servants of great princes.” Another author, Alcabitius, states

that “ if a watery sign be on the cusp of this house, it is fortu-

nate if an airy sign, it is typical of friends if an earthy sign,
; ;

it denotes legacies or property of ancestors if a fiery sign-, it
;

signifies honor and princely credit.” This of course requires

some limitation if evil planets should be there yet the Arabian
;

Astrologers, it must be confessed, were far more clever in the

art than the Europeans are, and in horary Astrology especially,

the student will do well to attend rather closely to their rules,

ere he rejects any part as superfluous. Other writers of the

private enemies of private enemies, being the twelfth house to

It is a masculine house, and like ss rules the legs and ancles,

as that sign does.

OF THE TWELFTH HOUSE.

The last house for us to describe is the twelfth house of the

celestial circle, or the house of private enemies imprisonment,
;

cares, anxieties, misery, and suffering. In horary questions, it

denotes every kind of grief, persecution, malice, secret toil of

mind, envy, incarceration, treason, sedition, assassination, and
suicide. It is also the house of cattle and great beasts. In na-
tivities, the rule above does not hold good, for the student in

celestial philosophy will soon perceive in the course of his

practice, that the evil planets therein, are far less evil and weaker
in mischief than when angular or even in the eleventh or fifth

;

houses. This axiom (the author’s own experience) no former

author has recorded it is nevertheless strictly true.
;

Manuscript observations on horary questions, state this house

as signifying “ deceivers, envious, bewailing, sorrowing, weep-
ing, lamenting, blaspheming, imprisoning, and malevolence.”

Others say, it is the house of horses, asses, and beasts that are

ridden also, according to Haly, “ it represents banished per-
;

sons, malefactors, lost goods never recovered, long hidden

wrath, vile persons, reproaches, disobedient; as also the foetus

of animals previous to birth. Adila and Zael, two very ancient

writers, have these curious remarks relative to the nature of

the twelfth house “
: It is the house of captives and imprison-

ment but note well that the wise men have different signifi-
;

cations of imprisonment, for the taking, and the cause thereof,

is signified by the eighth house, and the twelfth house, the

place of imprisonment and him that is imprisoned/’ Also

others relate “ that this house signifies the substance or money
of friends, being the second house to the eleventh; and bre-

thren of kings, being the third to the tenth, or mid-heaven
;

and fathers of religious persons, being the fourth house to the

ninth and sons of the absent, being the fifth house
; to the

eighth also it signifies as well, the sickness of wives, being
;

the sixth house to the seventh, or west angle and
; servants

enemies, being the seventh house, or opposite to the sixth ; and
the death of children, being the eighth house to the fifth and

;

religion and long journeys to fathers, being the ninth house to

the fourth also lastly, the magistery (or trade) of brethren,
;

as it is the tenth to the third house.”

It is a feminine house and like X rules the feet.

The student will bear in mind, that in the foregoing descrip-

tion, (which the diagram, at page, 91. will illustrate,) the

angular houses of heaven are first in power, strength, and
efficacy, whether in good or evil.

The succeedent houses are second in influence, but by far

more weak in strength and power and.
;

The cadent houses are, by the generality of Astrologers,

esteemed as the weakest of the whole. This order of the

houses, with few exceptions, the author admits also, in his

system but more especially as it relates to the four cardinal
;

houses, or angles, which certainly are by far the most powerful

whether in nativities, horary questions, or themes of heaven for

any occasion whatever.



In the above diagram, by referring* to any particular house
the student will easily perceive the various compound sig*nifi ca-

tions of its symbolical indication. As these are not to be found
in any author whatever, but are transcribed from a very ancient

and original manuscript, long before printing was invented, the

author presumes that they will be deemed very acceptable, even
by those who are skilled in these sciences while to the stu-

;

dent in Astrology, it will no doubt be a treasure, duly appre-

ciated, as it is well worthy attention.

“ Experience, next to thee I owe,

Best guide ; not following thee, I had remain’d

In ignorance ; thou open’st wisdom’s way,

And giv’st access, though secret she retire.

Heaven is high,

High, and remote to see from thence distinct

Each thing on earth.”

Milton.

“Well, rest be with him ! he instilled into me enough of knowledge for erecting

a scheme of nativity, and therefore I will presently go about it. So saying, and

having noted the positions of the principal planetary bodies, Guy Mannering re-

turned to the house.”

Author of Waverly.

The theme, orfigure of the heavens, (which like a celestial

map gives at one view the ascending, descending, and culmi-

nating constellations,) maybe erectedfour different ways viz.
;

by a celestial globe, by the zodiacal planisphere, by trigono-

metrical calculations, or by" Tables of Houses,” calculated for

the pole or latitude of birth. These are perpetual
; and the

latter method, which uses these tables, being by far the most
easy of the whole, (especially to those who dislike laborious

calculations,) we shall adopt it in the present instance.

The Astronomical day begins at noon and hence, it must
be remembered that when a figure is cast for any given time,

the hours and minutes must be accounted from the noon pre-
ceding the birth ; thus, were a figure of the heavens to be cal-

culated for 8 o’clock in the morning, the true way of expressing

it Astrologicaily, would be 20 hours P. M. or after noon, ac-

counting from the noon of the preceding day and thus
; in all

other cases, or schemes of the like nature whatever.



ART OF CASTING FIGURES. 119

In casting’ (or erecting1

) a figure of the heavens, which is

also termed “ a horoscope ;” the first thing to be done, is to

find the right ascension of the Sun, in hours and minutes,for

the noon of that day on which it is erected. This in cases of

great correctness must be done by referring to an Ephemeris,

of which White’s is the best, for that year, wherein the Sun’s

true longitudinal place in the zodiac is found in the second co-

lumn, headed “ © ’s longitude,” and by referring to the “ Tables

of Houses” in that column, which has marked over the top the

Sun in the same sign, as found in the Ephemeris in the co-
;

lumn to the left hand side, headed “ time from noon,” will be
found a certain number of hours and minutes, which invariably

are to be added to the hour and minute of the day for which
the figure is erected. When the result exceeds twenty-four
hours, that number is to be subtracted therefrom and

; with
the remainder again seek in the column of the Tables of Houses,

headed “ time from noon,” wherein having found the number you
sought, (or the nearest to it,) on a line with that number will

be found the degrees and minutes of the celestial signs, that

should occupy the first six houses of heaven namely, the 1st,
;

2nd, 3rd, 10th, 1 1th, and l*2th houses. The opposite houses to

these (which are always the same) are.

As the first six houses are opposite to the last six, so the same
degrees and minutes of the opposite signs, or constellations,

(which were given in a former part of this work, but which
we have repeated) must occupy the cusps of the opposite ce-

lestial houses.

In order to evade the difficulty of procuring an Ephemeris

for the year of birth, whereby many persons are entirely igno-

rant even of the sign under which they are born, or which in

other words, arose in the first house at the time of their birth,

the author has inserted a Perpetual Table of the Sun's right

ascension for every day in the year; which, in all cases where
an Ephemeris cannot be obtained, may be resorted to, and the

horoscope of a nativity cast thereby with accuracy quite suffi-

cient for ordinary purposes, where the person is not so certain

as to the exact minute of their birth. Hitherto no author has

given this desideratum, and we will now give an example of

casting a figure by the

Perpetual Table of the Sun’s right ascension.

As this table is calculated to answer an Astrological mean
(or average) for every year, either past, present or future

having acquired the day of birth, the student must enter the

table in that column answering to the day and month required,

overhead of which is a certain number of hours, minutes, and

seconds, marked “ h. m. s.” being the number answering to the

Sun's right ascension on the noon of that day let him take
;

out these, and thereto add the hours and minutes of the pre-

ceding noon, of the time to which he sets the figure.—This

being done, the sum in hours and minutes must next be found

in the Table of Houses, as before described in a line with
;

which are the requisite signs and degrees of each house in the

theme or figure.

Example.

Let it be required to cast the figure for the nativity of a

child, born April 17th, 1824, llh. 43m. in the morning mean-
;

time. As before observed, we enter the table of the Sun's right

ascension for the 16th day of April at noon, and level therewith

we find

Or 1 hour 21 minutes. Next, seek this in the Tables of Houses,
having1 “ timefrom noon” at top, and opposite to the right hand
of“H.M.” 1.. 21, there is the number 22, and by looking at the

head of the column there is on the head thereof, which de-
“V

notes that twenty-two degrees of T are on the cusp of the

tenth house. In the next column there is the number 2, and
two lines above it the sign n, on the top of which column is

the number which shows that two degrees of n are on the

cusp of the eleventh house (n having succeeded 0 ) in
; the

next column there is found the number 10, and by looking at

12
the top of the column is

^ found which as
; s is seen suc-

ceeding to n (by looking up the column) denotes that 10 deg.

of $ are on the cusp of the twelfth house. Pursuing the

same tract, in the next column headed ^ 'we find 11 deg.

12 min., and by looking up the column $ , will be found lower
down (or succeeding) s, which shows us that 11 deg. 12 min.

of & t0 be placed on the cusp of the Ascendant or first house.

Next, the student will perceive 28 deg. of $ in the column
headed 2, or the second house and lastly, on

; the third house,

he will observe 21 deg. of vjp, in the column headed 3, which
are found on the cusp of the third house. These are the whole
of the six oriental houses and in order to find

; the signs and
degrees on the cusps of the opposite, or occidental houses, the

student must again refer to the foregoing pages, where they
are set down : thus he will find, that the fourth house beinô
opposite to the tenth, and ^ opposite to r , there must conse-

quently be 22 deg. of di placed on the cusp of the fourth house.

Likewise the fifth house being opposite to the eleventh, and f
opposed to n, there must be placed 2 deg. of f on the cusp of

the fifth house. Again, the twelfth house is the opposite to the

sixth, and Yf is opposite to 25, consequently 10 deg. of Vj> must
occupy the cusp of the sixth house. Also the opposite house to

the ascendant or first, is the seventh house, and ss is opposed to

$ therefore 1 1 deg. 12 min. of ss must descend with the
, cusp of

the seventh house. On the second house we have 28 deg. of

irh:



122 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

Q and 22 still being1 opposite to that sign, 28 deg. of ss must

occupy the cusp of the eighth house. Lastly, the third house

and the ninth house are opposite to each other, so are n;> and
therefore by the same formula, as we have 21 deg. of lip

;

on the cusp of the third house, 21 deg. of X must take station

on that of the ninth by which means, and by a very simple
;

process, the whole theme of heaven, or figure of the nativity,

is formed and erected.

This constitutes what is termed the Radix or groundwork of

Astrologers, whereon they build their judgments and we
;

should presume that the foregoing example, which will hold

good in all cases, is sufficiently plain, for even the casual reader

of this “ Manual” to cast the Horoscope or figure of their birth,

provided the true day and hour thereof is known.

The following, is a view of the figure.

EXPLANATION OF WHITE’S EPHEMERIS.

“ If the matter be knotty, and the sense lies deep, the mind must stop and

buckle to it, and stick upon it with labor and thought and close consideration.”

Locke.

In former times the calculation of a nativity was esteemed a

very difficult process, since the Astrologer was either obliged to

take an actual observation of the heavenly bodies from some
place where he could well perceive them or in

; latter times, at

the least, to calculate their elements from those Astronomical

tables, which constitute the basis of our Ephemeris. The tedi-

ousness of such pursuits may be comparitively guessed at, when
it is stated on the authority of a celebrated modern wrriter, “ that

Kepler, (who was a clever Astrologer) in calculating only ten

oppositions of Tj and £ , filled a large folio volume with the re-

quisite figures and even at the present day, several hours at-

tention are requisite for the calculations (of the ten equations)

requisite to the D ’s place. But by an Ephemeris, the best of

which is that of White (published annually) the
, places of

every planet may be found in a few minutes only a most
; ex-

cellent consideration for our modern Astronomers, who gene-
rally dislike “ laborious computations,” and have taken the

liberty to decry and vilify Astrology, as “ a dry study” in con-
sequence, which is by no means the case rather

; let it be
thought (which it can be 'proved,) that the only dryness in the
science, is in dealing with stubborn and inflexible incredulists,

who first assume a set of principles utterly fallacious, and then,

120 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

DIRECTIONS
FOR

placing tfje planets tn tfjc f^oroscope.

In the right hand page of “ Whitens Ephemeras,” the exact
copy of which we have given, as the best mode of explanation,
the student will observe that the true places of the different

planets are calculated to each day throughout the month at noon,
or 12 o'clock in the day. Consequently, when a “ theme of
heaven" is erected precisely for noonday, their places in the
Ephemeris are to be taken out without any calculation. But
as the heavens and heavenly bodies are in perpetual motion, it

is obvious that if their places in the Ephemeris are calculated
for a given hour of the day (which in this instance is always
made for noon) to be correct, the proportional distance each
planet has moved since that period, must be added to, or sub-
tracted from the given time, according as they may be best taken
from the preceding or succeeding noon.

In the foregoing scheme of nativity, which is set for April

17, 1824, 1 1 h. 43m. morning, or seventeen minutes before noon
of that day we find, that on that day at noon, the O is

; in

27° 23' 52" T (see the second column headed ©'s longitude)

or rejecting the seconds, in 27° 24', and as the figure is set

before noon, we find the ©'s diurnal motion, by subtracting

his place on the 16th day from the 17th to be 58° 32" which in

every case, where the seconds exceed thirty, may be counted

as a minute instead we will therefore take his diurnal motion
;

as 59 minutes, which divided by 24 (the Astronomical hours

accounting from noon to noon) gives about 2' 30" for every

hour of his motion through the sign he is in, and consequently

we subtract about 40 seconds for the motion of the 17 minutes

in time which the figure wants of noon, which taken from his

place in the Ephemeris, leaves the ©'s true place in the hea-

vens, viz. 27**^3 t* Having thus found his place equated to

the hour of birth, the student must next refer to thefigure, and

place the planet therein, either near to, or far from that house



,

CALCULATIONS BY THE EPHEMERIS. 127

of heaven which has the sign the planet is in on its cusp thus
;

in the present instance, on the tenth house we observe r 22° O',

and consequently the O is in that house, where we place him,

and not far from the cusp, as he is within five degrees thereof

in the zodiac.

In the third column of the Ephemeris is found the ]) 's true

longitude, which at noon, on the 17th April, is 15° 19' $ , and

by subtracting her place on the 16th from her place on the 1 7th

day, thus,

]) on the 17th day at noon 15° 19' f

D on the 16th do. - 2 25

12 54 $

Shows us that in the twenty-four hours her motion in longitude

was 12° 54', which is about thirty-two minutes per hour; con-

sequently we have eight minutes longitude to subtract from

her place at noonday, (the equation for the seventeen minutes

which the figure is set before noon) and this gives her true

place in the horoscope, viz. 15° 1 1' £ and by reference to the
;

scheme, we place the ]) in the fifth house (as that sign is on the

cusp thereof,) and with the degrees and minutes before found,

not far from the cusp of the house in question, her distance

therefrom being about eight degrees.

In the fifth column of the Ephemeris is found the place of ,

which by the same mode of calculation is found to be 23° 20' Q ;

and as the sign Q is intercepted (in the figure) between the

tenth and eleventh houses, we place him in the middle of the

tenth house. In the next columns we have the places at noon
of If. , $ $ , and § > which by the very same process are found

to be, 1/ in 5° 1's 26° 37'^; ? 0° 9'r and $3°5'q
; ; ;

accordingly we find what houses in the horoscope they should

occupy, and place them accordingly. These are the whole of

the planetary places except ]jt[, and his place is found in another

part of the Ephemeris (on account of his extraordinary slow
motion) page 32 and in the present instance is in 15°

; 45'VT,

we place him therefore in the sixth house of the horoscope, as

that house has yp on the cusp.



128 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

The next thing- usually taug-ht by Astrologers is to place the

Moon’s nodes, or the dragon’s head and tail in the horoscope.

In the fifth column of the Ephemeris, “ PI. j) ’s node” is mark-
ed, which is the place of the north node or dragon’s head, the

opposite to which is the dragon’s tail, these are calculated in the

same way as all the planets but as these points,together with the
;

0 , are by the author of this work deemed as useless superfluities,

the relics of the superstitious absurdities of the dark ages, (in-

vented probably to serve the vacuum in the art, created by the

non-discovery of Ijl) and can be dispensed with; the author

deems it irrelevant to his present system of starry science, to

intrude on the reader’s time and patience by a useless and
unintelligible array of words and signs without meaning.—The
figure is therefore complete, except placing therein the principal

fixed star's which fall near the ecliptic; and consequently are

presumed to have certain influences in nativities (or genitures,)

according as they may be found within five degrees of the cusp

of any house, or within five degrees of the place of any planet

in the scheme.
The table subjoined contains a true calculation of their places

in the heavens, up to the year 1828, with their different mag-
nitudes and natures, according to the cleverest authors.

“ I’ll not believe that the Arch-Architect

With all these fires the heavenly arches deck’d

Only for show ; and with these glittering shields

To amaze poor shepherds watching in the fields.

I’ll not believe that the least flower which pranks

Our garden borders, or our common banks,

And the least stone that in her warning lap

Our mother Earth doth covetously wrap,

Hath some peculiar virtue of its own,

And that the stars of heaven have none /”

Du Baktas.

EFFECTS OF THE FIXED STARS. 131

In the foregoing1 table we have given the various significa-

tions of the fixed stars, according to the best authors who,
; as

well as several modern Astrologers of eminence, attribute great
virtue and efficacy to their configurations, with the active or

passive significators. A skilful amateur in the science, supposes

their influence to contribute more particularly to the destinies

of kingdoms and nations, than to individual fate.—The fixed

stars increase their longitude every year about 50". Thus
moving through one degree of the zodiac in seventy-two years,

and are two thousand one hundred and sixty years in passing

through one sign in the heavens, which, doubtless, may naturally

be expected to cause important revolutions, and manifest changes
in terrestrial affairs.

Having placed the ** fixed stars” in the horoscope by the fore-

going rules, the reader will observe the whole process at one
view as underneath, for which purpose we give the figure.

THE

ESSENTIAL FORTITUDES AND DEBILITIES

tfje planetar? 95otne3

As to Nature, Sign, and Aspect.

“ Anothir clerenesse is of the Sunne, anothir clerenesse of the Moone, and ano-

thir clerenesse of the Sterres, and a Sterre differith from a Sterre in clereness.”

Wiclif. 1 Cor. 15.

IN order to understand the following table, it must be ob-
served, that the ancients attributed certain signs of the zodiac,

as houses, to each of the seven planets, which is shown in the

second column of the table, where $ is placed, denoting his

house to be in the sign r • The next column contains the de-
gree of their exaltation, which for the 0 is found to be in Q

J

T- Next to this are shown the Triplicities, over which is

marked “ D. N.” denoting that t is the Triplicity of Q by
day, and ]/ by night. Adjoining this are the signs wherein
the planets were said to have their terms, and next to that their

celestial phases. These constituted the whole of the essential

dignities or fortitudes, according to the ancient system; in which
the Orientals and Europeans agree together, except that the

Persian Astrologers term the Houses of the Planets “ Towers
a reference to which seems to have been also made in the
sacred scriptures, where we read (in that beautiful poetic ima-
gery for which those writings are so unparalleled) of “ a strong
tower/’ a “ tower of might,” &c. Thus also Shakspeare, the
poet of nature, “ the king’s name is a tower of strength,” and
frequent allusions are made thereto by the oriental writers in

all ages which the attentive reader will readily observe.
; But

as the recent discovery of Herschel, the stupendous planet has
thrown new lights upon the science of the stars, it could never
have been expected that the ancients should have been perfect

to every rule they laid down, would be little short of bigotry

and credulity. Still, it must be acknowledged that the ancients

are entitled to our warmest gratitude, for the wonderful disco-

veries they made in the theory of celestial influence and
; it

would ill become the author of this work, or his candid read-

ers, to reject aught that they advanced, without repeated proofs
of its fallacy.

We have before observed that the planet Herschel was dis-

covered in consequence of a celebrated Astronomer, frequently

observing an irregularity in the motion of Saturn that he could
;

not account for by any known theory of the heavens. This

being the case, it would naturally be supposed, that the an-

cients in their observations, continually finding certain effects

to follow, the cause of which was unknown to them, would
frequently attribute partial effects to fallacious causes, when-
ever they found the known benevolent influence of Jupiter im-

peded in an unaccountable way. Hence the theory of the
“ Terms” and “ Phases,” which the experience of the present

day leads us to reject—as also the distinction between the day
and night houses of the planets and the attributing

; one sign

to a planet by day, and another by night, in the Triplicities,

which evidently is a relic of ancient superstition since reason
;

itself must tell us, that if a certain planet bears rule in a cer-

tain sign, (especially if posited therein) it must retain that rule,

whether by day or night. The author therefore rejects the

distinctions of diurnal and nocturnal rule in Houses or Tripli-

cities , as superfluous and void of truth.

The same objection may be made, although on different

grounds, to the theory of the Terms and Phases the
; author’s

present system of the “ essential dignities” therefore excludes

these, as well as the precise degree of exaltation although
; he

acknowledges the absolute truth of the ancient system, relative

to the signs of heaven, wherein the planets have their fortitude

or strength, by celestial (< House, Trigon, or Exaltation and
also of their consequents debility” or weakness by the oppo-
site signs, termed, their i( Detriment and Fall.” The following

table will best explain his theory, to the student or curious

reader.

is the Exaltation and the third essential fortitude is the Tri-
;

plicity, in which respect the ancients were perfectly correct in

their division of the zodiac after this manner and planets
;

being1 found in these signs of heaven, are eminently strong,

fortunate, and powerful while their being in those signs,
;

marked as their debilities, viz. their Detriment and Fall , ren-

ders them more peculiarly weak, evil, and unfortunate, than in

any other sign of the heavens.

m tf)e ^oUtacal Aperts.

The planetary orbs, in the course of their revolutions through
the etherial fields of boundless space, are perpetually forming
certain configurations or aspects with each other, by which their

influence is not only proportionally impeded or hastened, but

powerful aspects of a benevolent nature are in all cases equal

to the greatest essential dignity orfortitude ; and when malig-
nant configurations intervene, such aspects render them as weak,
as when they are found in their essential debilities. These are in

order, as follows :

THE SEMISEXTILE.

The Semisextile (for which as yet we have no Astronomical

character) consists of one sign, or 30 degrees in the zodiac, or

half the Sextile ; thus supposing % to be in 4 degrees of t>
and <$ in 4 degrees of Q or K , these planets would be in exact

Semisextile to each other. This aspect was unknown to the

ancients but is found to be moderately
; fortunate and benefi-

cial in influence.

THE SEMIQUARTILE.

The Semiquartile aspects consists of 45 degrees in the zo-

diac, being one half of the quartile or square thus if 1? were
;

posited in 18 degrees of Q , and the Q in 3 degrees of s , these

two planets are in semiquartile to each other. Experience
teaches us that this aspect is extremely powerful in evil, and

unfortunate in every respect whatever.



;

ASPECTS OF THE PLANETS. 137

THE SEXT1LE.

The
# -X- aspect consists of 60 degrees, or two signs of the

zodiac, and is found to be very beneficial in influence, in most
aspects equally powerful with the A-

THE QUINTILE.

The Quintile aspect consists of 72 degrees in the zodiac

thus supposing a star to be in 15 degrees of ss, and another in

27 degrees of r , these two are in quintile aspect to each other.

This configuration is found to befortunate in influence.
t

THE QUARTILE.

The or Quartile ray is 90 degrees, or one fourth part of

the zodiac stars, in quartile to each other, are peculiarly
; evil,

and no essential dignity can overcome the malignancy of such

an hostile ray. •

THE TRINE.

The A aspect consists of four signs, or 120 degrees in the

zodiac, and is found to be peculiarly powerful in goodfortune ;

a benevolent trine of Jupiter in most cases is sufficiently strong

to eradicate an evil position of Saturn.

THE SESQUIQUADRATE.

The Sesquiquadrate ray is 135 degrees in the zodiac thus
;

supposing a star to be in 15 degrees of yf , and another in 0

degrees of itj>, they are in sesquiquadrate to each other. This

aspect is singularly unfortunate, and equal in nearly all cases

to the evil effects of the g .

THE BI-QUINTILE.

The Bi-quintile aspect consists of 1 44 degrees in the zodiac
;

thus supposing £ to he 24 degrees of n, and the ]) in

18 degrees of t/^. These planets are in bi-quintile ray to each
other. It is found to producefortunate effects.



138 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

THE OPPOSITION.

The g aspect is one half the zodiac, or six whole signs, and
is deemed by Astrologers as the most malignant of the whole

;

it is peculiarly and eminently unfortunate.

THE CONJUNCTION.

The J , which although not properly an aspect, yet comes
under the denomination of configurative rays, is when two pla-

nets are in the same sign, degree, and minute of the zodiac.

This aspect is deemed good with good planets, and evil with

those of a contrary or malignant nature, as the dictates of rea-

son, even without experience, would lead us to judge. Its ef-

fects are eminent and peculiar in all cases.

THE ZODIACAL PARALLEL.

The zodiacal parallel resembles the conjunction in effects,

since it is formed when two planets have the same declination,

(or in other words are equi-distant from the great circle of the

equator) in number. Thus supposing a star or planet to be in

5°irt with 13° declination and another in 25°ts, they would
both be parallel to each other. In all cases, whether the sig-

nificators are either active or passive, this aspect is equal to the

conjunction.

In the use of the foregoing aspects, the student must bear in

mind, that the light planets apply only to the more ponderous ,

and unless when retrogade, the superior never can apply by
zodiacal aspect to the inferiors, the effect of which is very con-

siderable both in genethliacal and horary Astrology for both
;

reason and experience leads us to affirm, that if a certain force

exists in any configuration of the stars, when that configuration

ceases to exist the effects are no more and consequently, the
;

more nearer the aspect the greater are the presumed effects,

cither in good or evil, which as the aspect approaches must be

increasing in virtue, but as it goes off from the configurating

ray, it gradually becomes weaker and weaker till the aspect is

application.

Thus Herschel, who is placed at the top of the scheme, ap-
plies to no planet whatever except when retrograde Saturn
applies only to Herschel Jupiter, to Saturn

; and Herschel
and so of the rest in order as above exemplified, where it will

be seen that the moon, being last, applies to every other planet

in the heavens but no planet to her aspect unless
; retrograde.

The next thing to be observed and duly considered is the

mundane aspects, or those formed by the diurnal motion of the
earth round its axis, whereby every star is brought at stated

periods to the cusp of each house in due succession thus
; form-

ing various aspects or configurations, as well with each other

as with the angles of the ascending or descending horizon, the
zenith, nadir, &c. The ancient Astrologers were either unac-
quainted with these aspects, or forbore to mention them. Placidus,

an Italian Astrologer, is the first who has given any definition

of these configurations, which nevertheless are of greater im-
portance than any other part of the science. In order to ex-
plain them at one view to the attentive student, the following
diagram is inserted, which will contain a complete exemplifi-

cation of the mundane configurations or different aspects.

g)})ace of %ift.

Ptolemy, an ancient and renowned Astrologer, in his Qua-
dripartite, or four books on the influence of the stars, justly

observes, “ of all events whatsoever, which take place after

birth, the most essential is the continuance of life and as it is
;

of course useless to consider, in cases wherein the life of a child

does not extend to the period of one year, what other wants
contingent on its birth might otherwise subsequently have hap-
pened, the enquiry into the duration of life, takes precedence
of all other questions. The discussion of this enquiry is by no
means simple, nor easy of execution it is conducted in a di-

;

versified process, by means of the governance of the ruling

places. And the method now about to be laid down, seems,

of all others, the most consonant with reason and with nature I

because the influence of the aphetical (or hylegiacal) places, and
the anarctic stars, perform the whole operation of regulating

the duration of life.”

OF THE HYLEG, OR " GIVER OF LIFE,”

And the Prorogatory Places.

The aphetic, or vital places in every horoscope, are in num-

ber five, viz. the whole space of the first, seventh, ninth, and

tenth houses, computed by oblique ascension or descension, to

reach five degrees preceding the cusp of each house, and

twenty-fiVe degrees beneath it as also the half of the eleventh
;

house, or the half of the stars semidiurnal are above the cusp

of the horoscope. Consequently the “ lord of life,” as the

Arabian Astrologers term the Hyleg, cannot be chosen when in

either the limits of the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or

eighth houses, or in the first half ot the eleventh house.

If the ® be in either of these places by day, he must be cho-

sen in preference to all others, as the planet who shall assume

the important office of Hyleg (or apheta,) and if the birth be

by night, then the ]) must be chosen but if neither of these
;



,

GENETHLIACAL ASTROLOGY. 143

planets should be found in aphetical places, the horoscope or

ascendant must be chosen as Hyleg.
To determine the possibility of Life, the student (having- se-

lected the Hyleg-) must well observe, whether it be strong and
free from malig-nant configurations especially of Saturn, Mars,

or Herschel for according- to the strength and fortitude of the
;

“ Giver of life,” so will be the radical constitution, and the

concomitant effects. If the Hyleg- be much afflicted, the child

will not survive its infant state. If afflicted by aspect, and at

the same time assisted by powerful rays, life will be in dang-er

under operating- directions, but may be preserved by extreme
caution and peculiar medical aid. In all cases therefore the

duration of life is judged from the Hyleg, and when two pla-

nets, the@ and D (there cannot be more) contend, by being

both in proper places, for the Hylegiacal prerogative, both

must be chosen but the “ supreme” of the two, or that planet
;

who claims the most essential dominion must be elected as the

most powerful. The ancients besides the luminaries, attributed

the same effects to the 0 and planets having dominion in the

preceding lunations, but repeated experience warrants us in re-

jecting that theory, and affirming that there can be no other

Hyleg than what is before described. The Hyleg being chosen,

and the probable length or shortness of life deduced from its

position, or configurative rays, the next consideration will be of

that planet to which is attributed the office

OF THE ANARETA, OR “ DESTROYER OF LIFE.”

The Anaretic planets by nature are, T?

particular cases the @, D , and $ may be endowed with the

the planet with which they are configurated or joined. The

ing his hostile influence.

To occasion death the Hyleg must be afflicted either by the

conjunction or configurating evil rays of the Anaretical stars,

aspect when measured by the celestial arc of direction, and
equated by a certain measure of time, which the experience of
ages has determined for truth, will in every case point out, as

with the finger of fate, the true and precise period of death.

The manner and quality of death, is also taken from the
operating directions or celestial causes to which it

; must be re-

membered that as in a vital nativity one configuration alone will

seldom kill so when the benefic stars assist in
; the train, but

are too weak in influence to save life, they will assist in point-

ing out the cause and manner of death.

In these cases T? causes death by cold chronic, lingering dis-

eases, such as ague, dropsy, flux, consumption, illiac passion,

fear, melancholy, cough, asthma, rheumatism, disorders of the
spleen, and all diseases proceeding from a superabundance of

cold.

2/ joining his rays in the evil configuration, and being
, too

weak at the time to save, causes death to proceed from disorders

of the lungs, pleura, the morbid affections of the heart, spasms,
pains in the head, and by all diseases which arise from defect in

the organs of respiration, or defect in the vital faculties.

$ causes mortality, by burning and rapid fevers, sudden and
spontaneous wounds, disease of the kidneys, the stone or gravel,

expectoration of blood and hcemorrhages of all kinds, erysi-

pelas, measles, small pox, infectious diseases, abortion, miscar-

riage, surgical operations and, in short, by all hasty, acute, and
;

violent choleric complaints.

but not so violent and in this instance, the nature of the celes-

also dangerous fevers, affections of the eyes, and hot diseases.

death by disorders of the stomach and liver as wasting or

lancholy, epilepsy, fits, insanity, coughs, and obstructions, as

well as all diseases wherein the mind or intellect is affected.

The D by joining in the Anaretic rays, when she is not

In this respect the luminaries are generally much afflicted,

either by the , or g of 1? $ or ]jff, while the Hyleg is at

the same time replete with noxious influence. In this respect

certain signs of the zodiac are found to be far more violent

than others, whenever the Hyleg is found therein. The violent

signs are t, tt\, Vf , ss, wherein T? has the greatest significa-

tion of death, $ of the cause thereof. The following fixed

stars are also said to have great power therein, viz. Caput Algol

and poison.

Fiery signs r ft t are indicative of death by fire, thunder,

Airy signs n ^ ££ by falls from high places, beheading,
strangling, or hanging.

Watery signs $ n\ x by drowning, fluids, or superabundant
moisture.

Earthy signs Q Vf by casualties, falls, and suffocation.

Humane signs n ss denotes death by human means, but
still violent, when the luminaries are afflicted therein.

The houses are also said to have great power herein, thus.

The tenth house generally (where violent deaths are indi-

cated) denotes death by command of the magistrate.

The twelfth house by private assassinations, horses or great

beasts, and frequently perpetual imprisonment.

The sixth house by servants or neighbours.

If S ke joined to Tj , the effect is still more certain but the
;

peculiar nature of £ is to cause accidents, and a violent termi-

nation of existence by fire, iron, sharp weapons, gun-shot
wounds, explosions, combustibles, stroke of horses, falls and
active violence. If $ be in J or g to the @ and Hyleg,
fromfixed signs, it threatens the native with murder or suicide

;

if $ be joined with him, or with the aspect, it will partly hap-

pen through women, and if be thus configurated, by thieves.

If in mutilated signs, $ n\ ^ , or with Caput Algol, it threat-

ens beheading if from the tenth or fourth house, or near Ce-
;

pheus or Andromeda, it denotes hanging; if from the west
angle, death by fire is threatened, but should it be in a quadru-
pedian sign, it will happen by falls or four footed beasts, and
broken bones. If £ 1? and l£l are joined together in the evil

conflux, the consequence will be more dreadful, and the death

more terrible.

The @ being Hyleg, and joined with the following stars,

Caput Algol, Hercules, Bellatrix, Regulus, Antares, threatens

a violent death and extreme sickness with the Pleiades, Cas-
;

tor, Pollux, Presepe, or the Asselli, by blows, stabs, shooting,

beheading, or shipwreck; the bright star called the Eagle,

and Fomahaut, are said to cause bites from animals or reptiles,

as also the last star in Capricorn's back. Those who have the

luminaries with those stars are generally fearful of being bitten

by venemous reptiles. The Sun with the Pleiades frequently

causes total blindness.

The D with Caput Algol, Aldebaran, Pollux, or Bellatrix,

denotes a violent death ; with the Pleiades, Presepe, Antares or

Deneb, blindness or gutta serena; with Orion, injury to one
eye, at least. If it be a new moon near the Pleiades, and Tj or

$ be joined to Regulus, it generally causes total blindness
;

with Antares in g to Aldebaran, death by hanging or suffoca-

tion. If S be with Aldebaran, the native will die by a stab,

blow, or fall, more especially if from angles. If the Hyleg be

with Hercules, or Arcturus, death ensues by suffocation ; with

Cor Hydra in J or g of $ , death by drowning, or poison

ensues, especially if £ be angular. With Sirius and T? , or

with $ and Markab, death will happen by means of wild beasts

or soldiers. With Orion and Tj , or Caput, Hercules, and An-
tares, assassination or drowning ensues. $ with the Pleiades,

and with Regulus this configuration denotes danger of a
\i ;

violent death.

>2 in X, and the D in or Tj in a watery sign, and the

D in g to him, denotes death by drowning or excessive

drinking.

\ in in with , and the ]) in tip, making application

to them, denotes danger by drowning and intoxication.

T in the
2 seventh house, in g to the 0 and D, denotes

death by imprisonment, sluttishness, poison, poverty, fear, tor-

ments in a dungeon, violent falls, and death in exile or a far

distant land.

*2 in the tenth house, thus afflicting the Hyleg, declares

death by the fall of houses, stones, or ponderous masses but
;

if a watery sign be on the cusp of the fourth house, by water.

fatal conflux.

notes danger of burning to death in

$ $ , death by ruins, or falls of timber or houses, or falls from
horses or beasts

liquids.

As a proof of the foregoing rules being founded on truth, a
few instances may be noticed.—Thus the brave and lamented
Nelson, was born with the violent planet Mars, nearly on the
cusp of his “ House of life,” in the sign Scorpio, a violent sign ;

Mars being nearly in sesquiquadrate to Herschel in Pisces, each
in watery signs. The Sun, Hyleg in Libra, in sesquiquadrate

to Saturn, from a humane sign, and Mars in mundane quartile

to Saturn. As the time of his birth is undisputed, nothing

could more powerfully evince the truth of the foregoing rules

than his illustrious Horoscope.

The next instance which may be brought forward of violent

directions producing an untimely end, is in the nativity of Mrs.
Marr, and her ill-starred infant child, who was murdered at

Ratclifle Highway a few 7
j ears ago. In the mother's Horos-

cope, Mars and Herschel were angular, in conjunction in the

sign Cancer the Moon being hyleg, was afflicted by a precise
;

sesquiquadrate aspect of Saturn, and the Sun in the same ma-
lignant configuration to Mars and Herschel ! and in the infant's

Horoscope, both Saturn and Mars were in conjunction in the

House of Death, afflicting the principal angles and also the

hyleg ! The time of the above births was correctly taken, and
their Horoscopes have been already before the public, in a pe-
riodical publication, from whence we take them.

The last instance we shall bring forward before the subject



GENETHLIACAL ASTROLOGY. 149

is closed, is that of the late emperor Napoleon, who being-

born while the luminaries were befriended by the powerful

beams of the fortunate planets, throughout life escaped free

from violence of every description, although, according to his

historian, he was frequently in battle amidst the thunders of

war, when not only was death dealt around him on every side,

but so imminent was his personal danger, that the cannon balls

frequently tore up the ground under his horse’s feet ! Yet Ju-

piter, his kindly planet, preserved him even there, amidst a host

of dangers, and although a hopeless and forlorn exile, he was
fated to die a natural death, free from any violence whatever.

“ Most of our fellow subjects are guided either by the prejudice of education, or

by a deference to the judgment of those who, perhaps, in their own hearts, disap-

prove the opinions which they industriously spread among the multitude.”

Addison.

Nothing is more true in Astrology, than the above sentence

of the inimitable, accomplished, and devout Addison for
; the

student may rest assured, that out of a hundred persons who
openly disbelieve the art, there are at least ninety who believe

in it in secret : although such is the power and influence of

slavish custom, over the minds of those who dare not think for

themselves, that the fear “ of the world’s laugh,” as it is termed,
hinders them from avowing their opinion—by which means, a
noble science too frequently becomes neglected, and amongst
men of (probably great learning, but) small judgment, is set

down for an untruth.

all classes, whether learned or simple and as man is an animal

subject to the same mighty laws which govern the universe at

large, he must be also perpetually affected thereby. Hence,
the same cause which sets in motion the waters of the unfa-

the atmosphere wherein we live and breathe neither can the

human body be sensibly affected, without the mind partaking

at the same time of those effects which produce those corpo-

real sensations, as a celebrated poet expresses himself

“ Tempori cceli, corpusque, animusque mutatur.”

Hence, the perpetual tossing and rolling of the tide of life , is

referable to the self-same cause as the tossing and rolling of

the waters of the ocean, namely, planetary influence.

Tropical and equinoctial signs, r ^ S Yf, contribute to

render the mind active, sharp, ingenious, nimble, lively, ambi-

Bicorporeal and common signs, H ^ t K , contribute to

render men subtle, crafty, versatile, repining, regretting, un-

stable, volatile, deceitful, superficial characters but of intense,
;

acute, and powerful feelings.

Fixed signs (when occupied by the D and $ ) as Q Tif $ ,

firm, obstinate, patient, steady, laborious, contentious, malicious,

ambitious, and thrifty persons.

RELATING TO RICHES OR POVERTY.

The destiny throughout life, as conducing to poverty or

wealth, has, in 'particulars, been judged by the Orientals and
Europeans, by different rules yet, in generals they all agree.

;

Ptolemy recommends us to keep to the “ part of fortune” (which
in every Horoscope is the true mundane distance between the

O and D projected from the ascendant, on the path of the
, D ’s

declination.) The Arabians refer chiefly to “ the second house
and its lord but in general such as the strength or weak-
ness by majority of testimony, they all agree in the main point,

which is, that no perfect good can come from that which is by
nature contaminated therefore in every nativity, the student

;

must well observe the prevailing testimonies, and not hastily

form judgment without just reason for so doing.

The O and D are powerful significators in these particulars,

as receivers of good or evil by aspect
; 1/ and $ are the causes

or natural authors of good; T? S and Ip, are naturally evil

and unfortunate
; ^ is either way, as he may partake of the

beams of afflicting or assisting stars. This being considered the

SIGNS OF WEALTH, are

The © and D in d semisextile -)(•, quintile, A> bi-quintile or
,

parallel of 1/ and ? . The parallel may be either zodiacal or

mundane (the zodiacal parallel has been already described.)

The mundane parallel is, when a planet is at equal distances

from any of the four angles ,* thus a star in the ninth, and one



GENETHLIACAL ASTROLOGY. 153

in the eleventh, are in parallel, (if the same distance from the

relative cusps) and these are deemed of great efficacy.

The D strong by nature in a sign where she is dignified,
,

and free from evil aspects, is fortunate. The 0 so situated, is

the same, but the D is a more powerful significator of good
fortune than the 0.
The O or D angular, and free from evil configurations, even

if not dignified, is a testimony of great prosperity. The lumi-

naries with eminent fixed stars, are also prosperous.

The O and ]) in or A aspect, is sure to produce great

success in life as also the O or D in or A 1°
; $ •

In these cases, if the 0 and D are strong every way, both

by nature, sign, and aspect, the native will become rich and

extremely wealthy, at times to excess if the testimonies
; are

of a mixed nature, he will have but a moderate share of good
fortune, if either of the fortunes 1/ or $ be angular, and un-

afflicted, the same results will ensue therefore all that
; is re-

quisite in these cases, is fqr the student to pay a philosophical

attention to sidereal causes, and judge accordingly, always
remembering to leave prejudice and self entirely out of the

question.

SIGNS OF POVERTY.

Signs of poverty, and an unfortunate Horoscope, are the 0
and ]) in semiquartile, sesquiquadrate g or parallel of

Tj or l£l. These are the worst positions but even these are
;

increased by being in angles. © and D in the same aspects

to , is highly unfortunate but I? is the true author of trou-
;

ble, and the source (under Divine Providence) whence proceeds

the “ iron hand of griping poverty,” and the perpetual mishaps

of life, whereby the native is born to trouble iC even as the

sparks fly upwards.”

The © or D (but especially the j) ) in , semiquartile, ses-

quiquadrate, or g of 1/ causes misfortune through
, wasting,

and squandering money. He who has this aspect unassisted,

although possessed of thousands, will die poor. Imprisonment,
as well as poverty, is caused by the planet $$ being highly

afflicted, such as his ^ semiquartile, , sesquiquadrate, or g to

Tj or $ angular, is of itself evil, causing perpetual obstacles

in the way of advancement but I? is far worse than
; $ ; and

should 1/ or $ assist these by aspect, the native will advance
himself in life “per vi, et via,” by fighting, as it were, against

his evil star; when the fortunes 1/ or ? are hurt by aspect,

the native never can be rich but in all
; cases, as before ob-

served, let the majority of testimonies be carefully taken. It

must also be observed, that wherever a nativity is unafflicted by
aspect, the native will be negatively fortunate that is to say,

;

what he may procure, he will be able to retain. As also where
the planets 1/ ? © and ]) , are strong by aspect, and not
afflicted by position, the native will be positively fortunate, or

born to great wealth. But the best nativities are those wherein
are found testimonies of saving, or thrift and economy, and at

the same time, of fortuned favours. The real “ favourite of for-

tune, has the fortunate planets angular and unafflicted, with
the luminaries receiving their rays. The real “ child of misfor-

tune,M has the evil planets in the same position and every
;

planet is more or less vitiated by mal-configurations. That
there is this fate in nature, the sad history of thousands, both
of the past and present time, too plainly and sensibly proves.

especially Tj l£[ £ © and 1/ are angular; of course, although

publicity and notoriety are denoted by Tj I£I or £ , being angu-
lar, yet in the mid-heaven these stars, especially the two
former, are very malignant and mischievous, generally denoting

some sad catastrophe to finish the portents of such a scheme of

nativity. The more these planets are afflicted amongst them-
selves, or afflict the luminaries, the worse it is as

; also when
assisted by a good aspect, they are not so evil indeed,

; when
the evil planets are fortunated by configurations, they produce
good out of evil.

Three planets or more in the same sign of the heavens, cause

a public name at some particular period of life ; the time of

which depends entirely on the operating* directions.

O or D in the mid-heaven, near the cusp, are sure to pro-

duce great success in life, with a name known both far and near,

or if 1/ and $ be conjoined witlx these they give an extensive

fame, great honor, lasting credit, power, and eminence. The
native is sure to eclipse and outdo all his contemporaries, as

well as to be victorious in almost every controversy wherein

he may be engaged.
The sign n alone, is found to produce many persons of emi-

nence, on account of the great number of fixed stars it pos-

sesses. All the planets above the earth, (or the greater part

of all) indicates fame and 1/ or $ near the mid-heaven, is
;

another testimony of glory or renown and a name “ that must
live after death,” yet it gives numerous petty rivals, who, to

use the simile of an old author, like “ dogs haying the moon,”
are generally as presumptuous as they are imbecile and worth-
less.

they foreshow an eminent name, late in life, it is by no means
durable, but liable to strange interruptions while they

; who
have the fortunate planets, especially 1/ or $ in the tenth

house, have a durable celebrity. The cause for this may be
probably owing to the natural strength of the mid-heaven,
since every thing in the creation, seems to point to the zenith

;

and indeed were it not for the fructifying and genial beams of

the Sun, in his diurnal approach to that part of the heavens, not
only would all vegetation be annihilated, but all the earth

would become barren, bleak, and desolate. The mid-heaven
is thereforejustly accounted by Astrologers, the most powerful
angle in the whole celestial circle of the heavenly houses.

©f iFtarrtage.

The general significator of marriage, or that which is common
to both sexes, is the seventh house, or west angle. Invariably

the student will observe that when Tj J or Ip is therein, a

discordance in marriage will occur. If they are afflicted, a fatal

and unhappy union takes place, ending in misery or hate, or

mutual dislike if they are assisted by a fortunate aspect of
;

or £ , the marriage, though not prosperous, may not be un-
happy but the native will bury his or her, wedded

; partner.

As unhappiness in marriage is thus caused, so happiness therein,

is the result of If. or $ being found unafflicted in the seventh

house.

The particular significators of wedlock are different; thus

the Moon is the particular significator of marriage to the man,
so far as the marriage contract is concerned and to marry

; for-
tunate, the D should be (in the man’s horoscope) assisted by
the good aspects of 3/ or $ . To marry happy, the D in A to

the © may suffice but that would not ensure good fortune.

eminently fortunate therein, provided the seventh house is not

afflicted by the presence of evil stars. The planet either posited

in the seventh house, or to whom the D applies by aspect, will

describe the person of the wife, and her conditions.

In a female horoscope, the O is the prime significator, and
must be judged in every respect as the D in the male horos-

cope. In both sexes, 5 afflicted, shows an unhappiness in love

but in a female nativity, £ has great share therein, and many
females have late marriages solely through having d weak and
afflicted in their horoscope.

In a female nativity, if the ]) be in semiquartile
, g or ses-

quiquadrate to d , unchastity is greatly to be feared, unless 7/

or £ assist to avert the noxious configuration. Plurality of

husbands or wives is denoted by the significators being in bi-

corporeal signs, and having many configurations.

To determine as minutely as the science will allow, of fruit-

fulness or barrenness, (for it is absurdity itself, to attempt at

predicting the precise number, and none but a silly person would
attempt it) it must be observed, above all other things, what
sign the D is in for if in Q £. or ss, a moderate family

may be expected if the ]) is in

is the general result of marriage (in this instance the author
;

has always found n and f fruitful); if the D is in r & Vf,

she is less fruitful than in the other signs if the
; j) is in these

angular , in the tenth, first, or seventh houses, she increases

the probability of children. A fruitful sign on the cusp of the

tenth or eleventh houses, denotes offspring but the D in

& Vf in , or evil aspect to J? d q or Ijl, denotes barrenness

copes of both husband and wife should be inspected carefully,

and the majority of testimonies taken.

The contingencies relative to thefortune in life or death, of

children are taken from the good or ill aspects of the j) , for if

the ]) be afflicted by the d or ill aspects of Iff T? ^ or O,
the children will either die in youth, or be unfortunate, and a

great trouble to their parents. In these cases, % or $ assisting

in the configuration, will nullify the evil effects. The parti-

cular destiny of children can only be deduced from their own
individual horoscopes.

The Oriental and European Astrologers disagree in many
particulars relative to travelling and voyages but they all agree

;

in giving great power in these matters to the third and ninth

houses. The most approved testimonies of travelling, accord-

ing to the author's experience, are these :

Many planets in moveable signs, as t ^ s Vh especially

Tj £ and (above all others) the D in the ascendant, in tro-

pical, equinoctial, or common signs; such as t II s ^ t Vf

or x (but especially the two former) causes incessant jour-
,

neying by sea and land generally, those persons who visit dis-
;

tant countries, and naval persons in general have such positions.

The D in the tenth house, or in any angle, is also conducive of

travelling but in the ninth house, she is almost as sure to
;

cause these peregrinations, as when in the ascendant. The
Moon in any part of the figure, inn t K , causes frequent

changes of residence, but usually these changes happen very

unexpectedly, or in a strange and extraordinary way.
The late Queen Caroline, who visited so many strange coun-

tries, was born with the D in the first house or ascendant, in

quartile to Mars, but in trine to Jupiter, which denoted infinite

restlessness of mind, that produced a love for travelling and
variety and Sir Robert Kerr Porter, a great traveller, well

;

known to the world for the elegant and systematic account he
has given of his peregrinations who travelled over Egypt,

;

Persia, and various other regions, and married a Russian



GENE THLIA CAL ASTROLOGY. 159

princess was born with the ]) in the middle of the sign f in
;

the angle of the fourth house, and both and £ in moveable

signs. Numerous other instances might be given, as proof of

the author’s system, but these will suffice.

Again, $ angular in moveable or bicorporeal signs, is ano-

ther source of travelling also planets, especially g £ and
;

the D descending in the seventh house of the nativity and
;

for the most part, the significators in watery signs s x ,

cause voyages or after travelling, long residences near the
;

water.

The good or ill fortune attendant upon these pursuits is de-

rived from the good or bad aspects which the significators form

with each other as, for instance, the D being a significator of
;

travelling in d £ or ill aspect wTith J? £ O M or in or

£ to If. causes misfortune therein to <$ l£l danger by

ter ; to J danger by piracy or imprisonment : to $ unpleasant

travelling and so of the rest. But a good aspect to

as the parallel, , semisextile, quintile, trine, or bi-quintile

on the contrary, produces riches or good fortune by means of

journeys and voyages, and render these peregrinations free from
dangler.

place, whether the places of the O ]) and $ are powerful, and
free from evil or discordant aspects for

itself, in a manner,free from obnoxious rays of T? £ or l£[ , the

native will have but few enemies capable of doing him injury,

If the places of the O D or J be afflicted by the parallel

semiquartile , sesquiquadrate or g of T? <$ orljl, the native

will have a rough, turbulent, and quarrelsome life, and many
private enemies as well as public adversaries.

proach, and vituperative abuse. The unfortunate Keats the

AND THOSE NEARLY RELATED,

In treating of the different effects of the twelve houses of

heaven, we have mentioned that the north and south angles of

the figure or nativity, are given as the significators of the na-

tive’s parents. To these must be joined the 0 for the princi-

pal significator of thefather and paternal kindred, and the D
for the mother and all maternal relatives, and as these are situ-

ated so will be their fate. Ptolemy, in his system, also observes

12 and $ , but these the author rejects as incongruous to reason.

Independent of these, the angles signify all relatives in a ge-
neral way for when a celestial direction of death, or of any

;

particular trouble takes place in any horoscope, the student will

observe that the effects will extend themselves in distant rami-

fications, both in good and evil (as <f one evil seldom comes
alone”), to a remarkable distance which time and experience

alone can decypher. In these cases Saturn and Mars act most
powerfully according to their periodical circuits especially

;

when either of these planets are found posited in common
signs n f or x in the radical horoscope,—and, in every

;

instance, the nativity of the first-born is to be preferred in this

mode of judgment.

®o Calculate ttjc $imt£ of @fcentS.

In calculating the peculiar times when good or ill fortune

will occur, the ancient and modern Astrologers have made use

of various different methods thus the followers of Ptolemy,
;

still make use of the system of zodiacal directions which is the

art of computing the length or shortness of the celestial arc or

space of the-heavens intercepted between two significators

thus for instance, were a star in four degrees of T > and another

in eight degrees of Q , the celestial arc intercepted between
these (or the distance between each) would be what is termed

an “arc of direction,” which measured either by right or oblique

ascension according as the star should be posited, ascendant, or

vertical, would give a certain number of years and months,

when the event signified by the meeting of these stars might
be expected to happen.

The Arabian and Persian Astrologers make use of another

method, which is by giving for every day after the birth, a whole
year in time, and for every two hours motion of the Moon one
month thus were a native born at noon-day, (on the 1st of June

;

for instance) the positions of the various stars and planets that

took place precisely one day, or twenty-four hours succeeding

the birth, would give events corresponding to a whole year in

time this has been by modern Astrologers termed “ secondary
;

directions.”

A third set of Astrologers use the Placidian system, which
in addition to the “ zodiacal directions” of Ptolemy, compre-
hends another complete system of direction, termed mundane,
being formed entirely by the motion of the Earth around its

own axis thus, supposing
; a star to-be on the cusp of the mid-

heaven or zenith, and another within twelve degrees of the

horizon or ascendant, these stars are virtually approaching a mun-
dane n > and the arc or space intercepted between these, when
measured by the ratio of the stars proportional progress to either

angle, constitutes another number, which equated by certain

rules, distinguishes the exact time when the expected (or pre-

dicted) event will happen. Each of these methods are not only



, ;

164 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

correct, and approved by long- tried practice, but may be said

to defy the least contradiction, from those who will but take
the pains to examine them,—(and no one else should deliver an
opinion upon the subject.) Although each of the above me-
thods are different, yet they by no means contradict each other,
but each lead to true results, and in many instances they each
lead to the foreknowledge of the same event in which

; respect
they may be compared to the ascent of a mountain by diffe-

rent paths, where although some paths are longer and more
difficult than others, they notwithstanding all lead to the same
object.

The foregoing considerations, and the almost universal dis-

like which persons express towards calculations where many
figures are requisite, first led the author of this work to bend
his most serious attention to the subject, of discovering (if pos-
sible) a more concise method of acquiring the exact period
when the most marked or important events of life would hap-
pen. In this, he trusts he has succeeded, (even beyond his

first wishes) and therefore he now introduces, for the first time
in the memory of man, his system of ascertaining the time of
events, by

Celestial ^erto&3 of tfje planets.

The “ wise man” has declared that “ there is nothing new
under the Sun,” and hence it is almost certain that the ancient

Astrologers were well acquainted with the author’s discovery

although it is not only absolutely unknown to the present ge-
neration, but has never been divulged in any manuscript or

printed book whatever. Ptolemy in his Centiloquium (apho-
rism LXXXI) has these remarkable words “

: Times are reck-

oned in seven ways ; viz. by the space between swo significa-

tors,by the space between their mutual aspects, by the approach
of one to the other, by the space between either of them and
the place appropriated to the proposed event, by the descension

of a star with its addition and diminution, by the changing of a

It is the latter, “ changing of a significator," to which the
author claims the reader's attention, since he has found that in

addition to the art of “ directions," each of the wandering- stars

orplanets has a complete period of its own, entirely distinctfrom
every other motion which it may acquire either in the zodiac or

the world. The “ changing-" of these planets from sig-n to sig-n,

and thus forming- various configurations with their actual places

at birth, or with the luminaries, produce events in many instances

of equal mag-nitude with “ directions and in some instances

producing the most powerful good or evil fortune as the testi-

monials may warrant, nay, they frequently increase, accelerate

or retard the time ofprimary directions. To this cause may be
also assigned that seeming power of transits over the places of

the luminaries or other significators which a modern student
;

in the art in a recent publication was so enraptured with, as to

write himself down for an apparent simpleton, by exclaiming
against every thing else but the object of his adoration. The
foregoing observations will be best exhibited to the readers

It is presumed that the student or attentive reader will find

no difficulty in understanding* the foregoing* Table the
; first

column has the character of each planet whose celestial period

in years, and months, is noted in the succeeding columns
; and

for the sake'of facilitating the calculation the time each planet

takes in forming an aspect with its place at birth is also set

down. By these means the process of using the above is com-
paratively simple and easy.

$ produces a variety of evils, at the time as evil as T? , but
whereas those of T? are frequently anticipated and prolonged,
for nearly six months before and after the actual state of the di-

rection, so those of soon cease. The nature of his effects

is similar to the above, except in nativities he causes love in-

trigues, or marriage when aspecting $ , and quarrels when as-

specting £ in his periodical circuit. It is a singular and unde-
niable fact, that whosoever has $ and $ in aspect at birth, is

involved in a love affair in his nineteenth year. This is solely
caused by $ returning to his own place every nineteen years.

The ]) is a powerful significator, and by her quick motion,

going through three whole signs per year, she produces those

numerous inferior events of life both in good or evil which,
;

however light they may appear to be, do not fail to cause much
passing annoyance or transitory benefit; her effects are fre-

quently anticipated nearly three weeks, but seldom prolonged.

This is difficult to account for, except by a rather abstruse strain

of reasoning, but this very anticipation is a proof of her real

effects by her periodical circuit.

To calculate these periodical aspects the student needs

nothing more than to take their distance between their places

m ©trecttong.

These directions have usually been termed “ secondary” by
modern Astrologers for what reason does not appear plain,

;

since it may rather be said that they merit the name of primary,

on account of their palpable effects over the life and fortune of

every native. If any error has arisen in observing their effects,

it must have been through failing to take in, in the scale of

reasoning, the natural state of the planetary places at birth for
;

it must be well observed, that if the © at birth be in good as-

pect to 1/ or $ , the effects of any, and every evil direction, are

proportionally weak, and should © or ) be very weak or

afflicted at birth, the good aspects by direction of a planet or

star will have but a trifling effect either wray. For want of

observing these preliminaries, and blindly judging by certain

(so deemed) infallible rules, the science has met with that

blame which should only have been attributed to its injudicious

professors.

Julius Firmicus, a celebrated old author, speaks highly of

these directions, which he calls primary, wherein he says “ that

the D being in $, and full of light, was carried towards the

beams of the ©.” The expert Astrologers of the east use no
other method but this, for calculating nativities. The author

thinks fit, however, to term them progressive, as they certainly

exhibit the true diurnal progress of the heavenly bodies.

The true method of calculating these important arcs is ex-

ceedingly simple, and consists in nothing more than taking out

from the Ephemeris at birth, the places of each planet for every

succeeding day, accounting a day’s motion of the heavenly

bodiesfor one whole year, and two hours motionfor every month.

Thus in the scheme of nativity already given, page 131, the j)

qn the 17th day, twenty-two hours after birth, formed the com-



, ,

GENETHLIACAL ASTROLOGY. 169

plete of $ which caused a most violent inflammation of tho
,

chest and lungs, requiring surgical aid, and attended with im-

minent danger, at eleven months after the birth—and it is

also worthy of notice, that during the first six months of the

infant’s life it was continually afflicted. The student will ob-

serve, that the D by period met the of , six weeks after

birth, the J of 1$ at four months old, the of 0 at five

months and three quarters old and that the D was applying
;

uninterruptedly to the of ^ by progressive direction during

greater part of the first 1 1 months, which were certainly

sufficiently powerful to produce so many months illness.—Again,
the student must not only observe what aspects the luminaries

form with each other, or with the good or evil stars at birth,

but the aspects they form with the actual places in the radix
;

and in this respect even the change of the superior planets must
be accounted, which no former author has yet mentioned. Thus
for instance, in the nativity of a certain person the © at birth

;

was in r 22° 51', and when $ by progressive motion, came to

that degree of the zodiac, at so many years after the birth as

there were days , the native married and in the child’s
; nati-

vity, page 131, at eight days and nine hours after the birth day,

the }) will be in g to $ which answers to eight years and
,

four months and a half of the child’s life, when he will be in

danger of a violent scald or burn and in his sixteenth day
;

after birth, corresponding to the sixteenth year, the D will be
in d with 1/ in s, which will be productive of amazing friends,

happiness, and good fortune, in various ways.

Another occurrence which has already taken place in the

aforesaid child’s horoscope, was occasioned solely by the perio-

dical direction of Tj (and will serve to show the excellence
,

of this method) for by accounting the distance between the

place of Pj at birth, and the place of the D ’s g in 15° 11' of n
it is found to be nearly 22°, which denotes twenty-two months,
P
2 ’s motion being 1° per month, at which time the infant re-

ceived a violent fall, which caused a fracture of the os humeri
(or collar bone) for observe the aspect took place in n, which
rules the shoulders, but which was not dangerous, as 3/ by the

same method was in 0. 0' njp within orbs of the A of the ©

an accident was likely.

The attentive student will, from the above examples, be ex-

pert in his calculations by this process but in order to give
;

every possible clue to the method of these predictions, we shall

insert several remarkable horoscopes, as proofs of our theory ;

in all of which the time of birth may be relied on, as they are

obtained from undeniable sources of veracity.

The first example is

The only remarkable positions which we shall notice in this

illustrious geniture, are, first, the almost perfect of the ])

on his life, which the y? of the © and 7/ , and the •)(- of 1/ Tj

lastly, the configurations offour planets in n , the sign remark-

able for producing insanity, when thus afflicted. These alone

are sufficient to stamp the mark of truth on the Astral science.

By progressive direction , on the 25th of August 1738, four

hours before noon, which answers to eighty-one years, eight

months of the native's life being eighty-one days twenty hours
;

after birth (allowing a day for each year).

The planets were thus posited :

Although the student may certainly discover the chief events

of his life by the foregoing methods yet as some persons may
;

deem this work incomplete without it, we will give the pro-

blems for calculating these celestial arcs.

Directions termed zodiacal, are nothing more than the inter-

cepted arcs between certain significators, as before observed
;

and are easily calculated by a skilful arithmetician.

Problem 1 . To find the right ascension of a star, without

latitude.



174 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

Rule.—Add the co-sine of its longitudinal distance from the
nearest equinoctial point, to the arithmetical complement of the
co-sine of its declination, the sum will be the co-sine of its ri©^ht
ascension from that point whence the distance was taken.

If the star be in r Q orn, the arc thus found will be the R. A.
But if it be in s $ or ttj), it must be subtracted from 180°. If

in Tt\ or f it must be added to 180°. If
, in Yf or X, the

arc thus found must be subtracted from 360°.

Problem 2.—To find the R. A. of a star, with latitude.

Rule.—As the co-sine of the star’s declination is to the co-

sine of its longitudinal distance, so is the co-sine of its latitude

to the co-sine of the right ascension required.

The R. A. may also be easily found by Astronomical tables,

which are easily procured. In those, it is already calculated.

Problem 3.—To find the Ascensional Difference.

Rule.—Add the tangent of the latitude of the birth-place,

to the tangent of the declination, the sum will be the sine of

the Ascensional Difference.

Problem 4.—To find the Semi-diurnal arc of a star.

Rule.—If the star have north declination, add the ascen-

sional difference to 90o. If south, subtract it from 90° the
;

remainder is the required arc.

Problem 5.—To find the Semi-nocturnal arc of a star.

Rule.—Subtract the Semi-diurnal arc from 180°, it will give

the Semi-nocturnal arc required.

Problem 6.—To find the Oblique Ascension or Oblique De-
scension of a star.

Rule.—If the star have north declination, subtract the As-
censional Difference from the R. A. the remainder is the Oblique

;

Ascension. If south declination, add it instead of subtracting.

If the star have north declination, add the Ascensional Dif-

ference to the R. A. : and if south subtract it the remainder
;

is the true Oblique Descension required.

Problem 7.—To find the pole of a star, or celestial house, in

any figure.

Rule 1.—As the semi-arc is to 90°, so is its distance in R. A.

from the meridian or fourth house, to the difference between its

circle of position, and that of the meridian which difference
;



— ;

GENETHLIACAL ASTROLOGY. 1/5

subtracted from its right distance, will give its true Ascen-
sional Difference under its own pole.

Rule 2. To the sine of this ascensional difference, add the

co-tangent of its declination the sum will be the tangent of
;

its pole.

Problem 8.—To direct a significator to any part of the hea-

vens, or any star, conjunction, or aspect, without latitude.

Rule.—Find the true Oblique Ascension or Descension of the

star, under its own celestial pole, and subtract this from the true

Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension of the conjunction or

aspect, taken under the same pole the remainder is the true

celestial arc of direction.

Problem 9.—To direct a significator with latitude.

From the true Oblique Ascension or Descension of the aspect,

taken as before under the pole of the significator, subtract that
;

significator’s true Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension

under its own pole. The remainder is the arc of direction.

<S5f iflunaane Stmtions,

To the Angles.

A diagram has been already given, page 140, of these direc-

tions, to which we refer the reader. Further explanation is

therefore unnecessary, since the author will now give the facile

and ready method of calculating every celestial arc of direction

to the twelve houses, by right ascension only.

Problems.—To bring a star to the cusp of any celestial house*

Rule. —If the star be above the earth , to bring it to the cusp

of the ascendant, subtract its semi-diurnal arc from its right

ascension. If to the cusp of the twelfth, subtract two-thirds

of its semi-diurnal arc. If to the cusp of the eleventh, subtract

one-third. If to the cusp of the tenth, neither add nor sub-

tract. If to the cusp of the ninth, add one-third of the said

semi-arc. If to the cusp of the eighth, add two-thirds. If to

the cusp of the seventh, add the whole semi-diurnal are.

Universally, in all the above problems, subtract from this

1?6 A MANUAL of astrology.

sum or remainder the Right Ascension of the mid-heaven, the

remainder will be the arc of direction sought.

Rules. If the star be below the Earth. If it is to be brought
to the cusp of the sixth, subtract two-thirds of its semi-noctur-

nal arc from its right ascension if to the
; fifth subtract one-

third if to the fourth neither add nor subtract; if to the
; third

add one-third and if to the secondare? two-thirds of its semi-
;

nocturnal arc.

Universally. Subtract from this sum, or remainder, the R. A.
of the Imum Coeli, or fourth house the remainder will

; be the

true celestial arc of direction.

Every direction to the angles may be calculated by those rules-

®f)e J$untraite ©trofioitS,

Which the Starsform amongst themselves.

Placidus de Titus (mathematician to the archduke Leopold
of Austria,) was the first writer on this system and there

; can

be no doubt of their efficacy, when we reflect that-daily expe-

rience confirms the wonderful power which the planets have
over all sublunary affairs by their mundane rising, setting,

; and
culminating this no one in their senses we think can

; deny.

The proofs of these directions are open to the reader by the fol-

lowing problems
Problem 1. To direct a significator conversely (or contrary

to the order of the signs) to the conjunction of a star, is the

exact reverse of problem 9. For instead of taking the oblique

ascension, or oblique descension of the aspect under the pole of

the significator , we take the oblique ascension or descension

of the significator under the pole of the conjunctive aspect.

However, we will here give a general rule which will answer
in all cases whatever, for calculating mundane directions.

GENERAL PROBLEM for all MUNDANE DIRECTIONS.

Rule 1 . Observe that the planet whichforms the aspect by

moving conversely must always be directed > whether it be sig*

nificator or promittor.



GENETHLIACAL ASTROLOGY. 177

2. Observe the star to whose place or aspect the direction is

to be made, and take its distance from the cusp, either of the
preceding- or succeeding- house : find also the distance of the
star to be directed, from the cusp of that house that forms the
required config-urator with the cusp of the other house,from
whence the first distance was taken, and call this last the pri-
mary distance.

3. Then say, as the horary time (one-sixth of the semi-arc)

of the planet to whose configuration the other is to be directed,

is to its distance from the cusp of the house whence its distance

is taken, so is the horary time of the planet to be directed to its

secondary distance

If this secondary distance be on the same side of the cusp from
whence the primary was taken, subtract the one from the
other otherwise, if on different sides, add them their

; ; sum or

difference will be the true celestial arc required.

A GENERAL PROBLEM TO CALCULATE RAPT
PARALLELS.

Rapt parallels are the joint approach of two stars conversely

to the angle of the 10th or 4th, an arc of extraordinary strength

and power, even where life and death are concerned.

Rules 1 . Add their semi-arcs together.

2. Find the difference between their right ascensions.

3. Find the distance of the star that applies to the an-
gle when the parallel is complete, which is the primary dis-

tance.

4. Say, as the sum of their arcs is to the semi-arc of the pla-

net applying to the angle, so is the difference of their right as-

censions to the secondary distance.

5. If both distances are on the same side of the angle, sub-

tract the one from the other, if otherwise, add them the sum
;

or remainder will be the true arc of direction.

The author rejects all rapt parallels formed on the East or

West angles as void of any foundation in truth, although former
writers say much of their efficacy. The foregoing problems
are sufficient to calculate any primary direction whatever,

cessary to state that the above time of birth was taken from the

journals of the day, and has been twice published, once by a

writer in a monthly publication, and latterly in the “ Astrolo-

gical Dictionary/'—But each of the foregoing writers were
either not Astronomers enough to know, or wilfully forgot, to

make the necessary equation of time, or the difference between
the O and the clock which on the day of the lamented prin-

cess's birth was full five minutes toofast, as the Ephemeris for

the year proves.—The above equation in setting the figure

(which in every case the student must well observe, as every
Astronomer is aware of,) is all the alteration we have made in

the time of her horoscope, and. which is virtually no alteration

at all, but merely a necessary correction so that the author of
;

this work cannot be charged with aught of fallacy, in bringing

this singular horoscope as a most amazing proof of celestial

philosophy, which it is not in the power of all the sceptics in

the universe to invalidate.

The j) being in the tenth house is the true Hyleg, which

testimony of a short life, which nothing but the interception of

$ 's parallel could have preserved over the infant state; but

which was doomed to fall a prey to the first anaretic configu-

ration that the Hyleg formed, which we will in this instance

calculate at full length, as a praxis for the attentive reader.

probably unanswerable by the enemies of the science.

We will now refer to the doctrine of periodical direction
;

and first, with respect to the time when the illustrious na-

tive entered the pale of wedlock. The marriage took place

on the 2nd of May, 1816, or twenty years and nearly four

months of her age. Now we have before observed, that in a
1

female horoscope the © is invariably the cfoe/ significator of

marriage. By referring to the Table of Periods, we find the ©
returns to his own place at nineteen years old, to which if we
add 25° 18' the space of the zodiac he moves in sixteen months
(deducting a few days,) it brings his true place by period to

12° 12'ss the exact place of 1/ at birth l Probably nothing
could better depicture the truth of the science, or the excel-

lence of this discovery relative to these celestial periods than
the above instance.

The celestial directions (by periods) at the time of death, were
as follows :

jl0° 54' 0° 25' 29° 34' 7° 12' 2° 26' 29°- 39' 7° 37'

;

by period nearly in semiquartile to the radical ©.— g in exact

to at birth and lastly the D just entering the sign
; n

the opposite sign to her place in the horoscope, and within a

week’s celestial motion of the violent and malignant conjunc-
tion of , the same evil planet who at the instant of birth by
his anaretical rays forbade the duration of that inestimable

life, which was so highly prized by the generality of the Eng-
lish nation.

This nativity is remarkable on account of the singular satel-

litium of stars in the sign trjp in mundane A to the ascendant;

the native is the son of a fortunate and respectable citizen (a

student in Astrology).—From the configurations of 1/ $ and

^ , there can be no doubt but the child is born to be veryfamous
and noted in life for his talents in music or elegant scientific

acquirements.—He will however have a dangerous accident in

his eleventh year, from the ascendant to the g 1? ; but in his

nineteenth and twentieth years will rise to great eminence, and
be remarkably prosperous, in whatever sphere of life he may
be placed, from the excellent nature of the operating directions,

and other celestial causes, at that period of his life. The very

remarkable configurations in the above horoscope are worthy
of the student’s attention.

The recent production of this “ modern Juvenalist” (as some

world, is the author’s chief reason for inserting his horoscope.

The student will readily perceive the close zodiacal a of the

D with ^ > and the planet $ arising in in parallel to £
as the cause of his being a poet but the desire for the extra-

ordinary, which his satirical talent evinces, is solely produced

by the almost perfect semiquartile of the D and 1$, which never

fails to give originality of genius, as we have previously ob-
served in a former part of the work, we predict that “ the au-

thor of the age reviewed” is destined to great celebrity in the

< 4 There was a sound of revelry by night,

And Belgium’s capital had gather’d then

Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright

The lamps shone o’er fair women and brave men
;

A thousand hearts beat happily and when

Music arose with its voluptuous swell.

Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,

And all went merry as a marriage bell

But hush ! hark ! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell.

Did ye not hear it ? No : ’twas but the wind,

Or the car rattling o’er the stony street

On with the dance ! let joy be unconfined

No sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet

To chase the glowing hours with flying feet

But hark ! that heavy sound breaks in, once more,

As if the clouds its echo would repeat;

And nearer, nearer, deadlier than before !

Arm ! arm ! it is—it is—the cannon’s opening roar.

Ah ! then and there, was hurrying to and fro,

And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress

And cheeks all pale ; which but an hour ago

Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness !

And there were sudden partings, such as press

The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs

Which ne’er might be repeated ; who could guess

If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,

Since upon nights so sweet, such awful morn could rise.

And there was mounting in hot haste ; the steed,

The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,

Went pouring forward with impetuous speed.

And swiftly forming in the ranks of war

And the deep thunder peal on peal afar

And near the beat of the alarming drum,

Roused up the soldier, ’ere the morning star,

While thronged the citizens, with terror dumb,

Or whispering with white lips—the foe ! they come ! they come

Last noon beheld them full of lusty life

Last eve in beauty’s circle proudly gay !

The midnight brought the signal sound of strife,

The morn the marshalling in arms—the day

Battle’s magnificiently stern array !

Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,

‘‘Such were the extraordinary positions of the heavenly bodies

at the birth of the noble Duke of Wellington born
; under the

cardinal sign Capricorn, with Saturn the lord of his ascendant,

both cardinally and angularly posited in the house of war and
battle, born also under the exaltation of the 'fiery Mars with

;

Jupiter, the author of greatness and renown, riches and ho-

nors, strong in the mid-heaven, in a zodiacal trine to Mars, the

Moon and Saturn, with the Sun on the very cusp of the lower
heaven, in sextile to the natal stars, and closely parallel to Ju-

piter, in fixed signs, with five planets in the principal angles of

the celestial horoscope, at the same time that the bright star

Sirius, of the first magnitude, was setting in the west.—What
wonder that his name should demand so proud a place in the

annals of history, for his most fortunate warlike achievments ?

The time of his birth was obtained from his nearest relative,

some few years since, by a gentleman of eminence in the arts,

and is here inserted without the least alteration. The correct-

ness of the time the following celestial arcs of direction will

The foregoing arcs will sufficiently evince the surprising ve-

rity and singular accuracy of Astrological calculations, when
founded on the correct time of birth, and mathematically eluci-

dated. I have chosen the nativity of this illustrious native, in

preference to others, as the subject thereof is now living, and,

consequently, all possibility of making up any fictitious horos-

cope is at once set aside thus affording me a most powerful

shield against the insidious representations of the envious and
ignorant traducer of this sublime science.

I shall finish my observations, by remarking that there is a

singular agreement between the nativities of our most sacred

Majesty and the noble duke. The king of England having
both the Moon and Jupiter nearly on the actual place of the Sun
in the duke's horoscope. Another extraordinary proof, if any
were wanting (to the unprejudiced) that the heavenly bodies

most certainly govern the destinies of the most powerful, as well

as of the meanest individuals. I conclude by wishing (as a

lover of splendid warlike achievements) “ all health and hap-
piness to the Hero of Waterloo !”

Prophetic Messenger, page 40.

In addition to the above, it may be considered as a singular

fact, that although Napoleon and Wellington were each born
in the same year, yet there existed the greatest discordance in

their horoscopes.—In Napoleon Buonaparte’s nativity, the pla-

nets were thus posited

The student will readily perceive the powerful disagreement
between the two nativities, when compared together

; upon
which we need not descant any farther at present yet it may

:

be certainly adduced as another proof of the celestial science,

and a proof defying all contradiction, since the premises on
which it is founded must be granted, even by the most stubborn
incredulist and when

; those are granted, the conclusion is as
self-evident as a syllogistic proposition in logic.

anxious to obtain the exact moment of his beloved son's nati-

vity. Consequently, the student will presume upon the authen-

ticity of the horoscope, which the following celestial arcs will

prove, as they are calculated with all possible correctness.

The O in Astrology is known to every student to be a parti-

cular significator of the father, and being in this horoscope

so highly afflicted, both by the zodiacal of Tj and the mun-
,

dane sesquiquadrate of $ , is an astonishing instance of Astral

agency, and proves how far the influence of the heavenly bodies

extends over all sublunary affairs which may be seen in every
;

case, where the correct time of birth can be obtained.

At first sight it may be presumed, that as the native is born
with $ near the cusp of the mid-heaven, he is fated to honors
of an extensive nature.—This is however by no means the case,

for 5 is highly vitiated by a semiquartile aspect of Tj and the

to predict, that had the native been even the lawful heir to the
throne of France, he would never have inherited it for al-

;

though he certainly possesses a great share of acuteness, and is

even born (from the 0 f the D to ^ , and the of ^ and $ )
with strong military propensities, yet he is not destined to act

any conspicuous part in the great mundane drama of Europe ;

and the O being so highly vitiated, with T? angular, implies

but few opportunities of obtaining glory or honor. The ^
of O and 1/ undoubtedly assists powerfully in warding off per-

sonal dangers but in no respect is the nativity illustrious.—The
;

Bourbon government, therefore, have no cause to fear any in-

surrection in his favour were there any such, it would
; but

involve the leaders thereof in a host of difficulties. Indeed, it

was quite easy to see from the moment of his birth, that a most
extraordinary downfal awaited his family. In private life, the
native will be much esteemed, as he undoubtedly is a youth of

considerable talent and genius yet liable to rashness, and
; ex-

tremely propense to anger, (which arises from the of $ and

5 ). The configurations in his horoscope, when near eighteen
years old, may be expected to give the death of a near relation,

with indisposition or accidents to himself.—Also, in his twenty-
first year, the ascendant to the opposition of Saturn, denotes an
accident probably by a fall from a horse, or by fire-arms and

;

likewise ill health, with mortality among his relations.—But if

he survives these, the remaining directions are far more pros-

perous as far as his happiness and comfort in private life
; are

concerned,—The M. C. to the of 1/ in the twenty-ninth
year of his life, is one of the best configurations he could pos-

sibly have, and will doubtless produce very beneficial effects.

As we have already given our opinion of this illustrious and

regal nativity “ in the Astrologer of the nineteenth century,” (to

which we refer the reader) repetition is superfluous, save to

again remark, that the horoscope is replete with wonderful

verifications of planetary influence. And England cannot but

prosper, while she is blessed with the mild and beneficent sway

UPON THE MOST IMPORTANT AFFAIRS

OF HUMAN LIFE.

By a Theme of Heaven.

“ We must lay aside that lazy and fallacious method of censuring by the lump,

“ Gold, power, soft luxury, vain sports and ease,

The art of resolving- horary questions, is founded on the sym-
pathetic properties which are found to exist, more or less

throughout nature. It furnishes the student in starry science,

with the actual means of satisfying those doubts to which the

minds of all men are subject, by an apparently simple and easy,

but beautiful theory, which presumes that the same sympathetic

power which causes the iron and magnet to attract and approach

each other—which causes a detached portion of earth to return

heavenly bodies: and is the first prevailing cause of every

anxious and ardent doubt to which the mind is subject, or upon
which the mind dwells with eagerness, and a desire, if possible,

to know the result.—Nature, in this case, will be found to ac-

commodate herself to every emergency, and by a theme of

when the querent feels most anxious (and irritable) on the

witlings, is really founded on the same immutable laws to which
the universe, at large, is subject.

ofart in l^orarp ©.ucsttonO.
In order to be perfect in this part of Judicial Astrology, it is

absolutely necessary to be master of the following technical

terms, which the author has rendered as concise as possible

but at the same time he has given every requisite explanation.

APPLICATION.

Application is when two planets apply or go to each others
aspect, where, according as we have before described, it must
be well observed, that the light planets apply only to the more
ponderous : the following are the

Orbs of Application.

T? 9 degrees.

If 12 degrees.

S 7 degrees.

O 17 degrees.

$ 8 degrees.

5 7 degrees.

]) 12 degrees.



HORARY ASTROLOGY. 19$

In practice, these degrees are said to denote the distance at

which a planet may operate, from a partile aspect, before it

quite loses its effects.

Direct application, is when two planets are direct, or move
according to the order of the zodiacal signs, and one applies to

the other. Retrograde application, is when both planets are

retrograde, and move contrary to the order of the signs of the

zodiac, applying to each other. Mixed application, is when
one planet being direct, and the other retrograde, they yet mu-
tually apply by aspect.

The two first of these applications are deemed the best but
;

in all cases it must be seriously considered, whether the aspect

is approaching or receding, which leads us to treat next of

SEPARATION.

Separation is when two significators have lately been in as-

pect, and the aspect is just over: thus were 1/ posited in l°$s ,

and in 6
\ °r, they are applying by aspect; but if
i % instead

of this were in 8°s", and ^ still in 607-, the aspect is over
;

1/ having separated from the configuration of fj
, which in all

cases is of great importance to know as application is the sign
;

whereby events are denoted to take place, and separation de-

notes what has passed or taken place, whether in good or evil.

DIRECT AND RETROGRADE MOTION.

Direct as applied to planets, denotes their moving in the

true order of the celestial signs, as from r to Q , and the like.

Retrograde is when they
, move backwards, or reverse to this

order, as from r to )(, which is easily known by the Ephe-
meris.

PROHIBITION.

Prohibition
, is so called, when two planets are applying by

aspect to each other but
; before the aspect can possibly be

formed, a third planet interposes his aspect, and thus hinders
or prohibits the matter in hand : thus, were $ in 4° of Q , 1/

bits the affair, which to the matter in hand, would cause a com-
plete cessation and that person signified by $ , would; describe

the party through whose interference the matter would be

REFRANATION.

Refranalion, is when two planets are applying to an aspect

but before the aspect can be completed, one of them turns

retrograde, which in practice, is fatal to the success of the

question.

RECEPTION.

Reception is when two planets are mutually posited in each

other’s essential dignities, as 7/ in t , and the 0 in 25 , where

7/ being in the exaltation of the O, and the © in the exalta-

tion of 7/ , both are in mutual reception or the © in T> and
;

7/ in , are in reception, one by house, the other by triplicity.

This is accounted an aspect of singular amity and agreement.

PEREGRINE.

Peregrine , is when a planet is void of any essential dignity
;

and thus is rendered weak and unfortunate.

VOID OF COURSE.

Void of Course, is when a planet forms no aspect whatever
with any other planet, during his stay in the sign wherein he
is posited. This is particularly evil in certain cases, as it ren-

ders the conclusion of the affair extremely uncertain.

COMBUSTION-

Combustion , is when a planet is posited within 8° 30' of the

©, either before or after the©’s body. In horary questions,

unless the © be a chief significator, this is deemed unfortunate.

The D is singularly weak when so elongated.

To understand the foregoing diagram, the student must ob-

gives for every degree in longitude one day in a common sign

instance, were % in the ascendant in 14° of t in application

to a A of Tj in the fifth house in 16° of 25, his distance (the

intercepted arc) between the aspect being 2°, would denote



202 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

two days "ere the event, denoted by his application to Tj
, would

be likely to take place and were he in the ninth house, in
; the

same aspect, the time would be two months. The remainder

of the diagram is on the same principles and by a
; reference

thereto, on any particular occasion, considerable facility will

be afforded to the practitioner, or amateur, in the horary part of

the science, and the memory will be thus far less liable to those

mistakes which are found usually to happen when it is over-

charged.

BESIEGED.

Besieged is when a planet, fortunate by nature, is situated

between two malevolent stars, as ? in 12° of $, Tj in 15°, and
l£l in 10° of the same sign where she is in a

; state of “ siege/’

as the old Astrologers term it, and highly unfortunate. He
whose significator it was, would be denoted thereby to be in

“ a great straight,” and particularly “ hemmed in” or surrounded
with ill fortune.

SIGNIFICATOR.

The significator of any party is that planet which rules, or

has dominion by celestial house, over that part of the hgure or

scheme, peculiar to the business in hand. Thus were the ques-
tion about money, the lord of the second house of heaven is the

chief significator of the matter and his good or evil
; aspects

must be well observed, ere the answer can be faithfully given.

QUERENT AND QUESITED.

The Querent is the party who proposes the question, the

Quesited the party of whom the enquiry is made. In horary

questions, as before observed, the ascendant is invariably given

to him who asks the question, if im-elated but if related, the
;

lord of that house which has signification of the relationship.

Its various contingencies are shewn as before.

important particular by which means he will need no other

instruction than that which a patient and attentive investigation

will afford him.—Thus, in a comparatively brief space of time,

he will be able to resolve almost every anxious question, rela-

tive to his own destiny, or that of any other person, in a manner
which the enemies of science have scarcely any conception of,

but which is notwithstanding1 founded on sterling truth, and
which will amply repay the learner thereof for the pains he
may take in acquiring it.

To make the matter more plain we will insert the following

diagram, and afterwards point out the method of giving judg-

ments.

In the foregoing diagram, the sign Yf ascending, is the sign given

to the querent or enquirer, and as I rules that sign, he is under
2

the influence of that planet at the time he proposes the question.

In a general way the lord of the ascendant being retrograde in

s, the sign of his detriment in the sixth house, denotes indis-

position, sickness, and great anxiety respecting servants
; 1/

and $ denotes his pecuniary resources, as ruling the second

house
; 7/ the former of these planets being

, in the ninth

house free from any evil configuration, would denote a respect-

able person, and one whose resources were sufficient to meet
his wants but £ , the latter significator, being in the eighth

;

house opposite to the second, and disposed of by $ lady of the

third house, who is found in the twelfth, portends anxiety

and temporary vexation concerning the money, or well being of

his kindred, with expenditure in short journeys, but gain in

merchandise as 7/ ruler of the tenth house is found in the ninth,

and bears rule in the house of wealth.—The J of the O and ))

in the eleventh house denotes trouble and vexation by means
of a public opponent, or a law-suit wherein, as these planets

;

are each disposed of by 7/ the lord of the eleventh house, and he
in the ninth, it promises a fair stout person from a great dis-

tance (and a religious generous person) will become an active

friend ; while \ ruling the twelfth house, denotes his private

enemies to be in his own power and 7/ ruling the second, in-
;

dicates the means why, namely by means of his large pecuniary

resources.— $ t lord of the fourth house in the tenth, separating

from a sesquiquadrate ray of ^ and applying to his bi-quintile,

indicates some transaction relating to the purchase of lands or

houses, and a change of residence as naturally to be expected.

£ in the twelfth house and ruling the eighth, denotes the death

of a female relative as approaching, and by the measure of time

already given, it may take place in aboutfive months, account-

ing from the time for which the figure is calculated. (The
same thing is shewn by the 83 in the third to those who believe

in its efficacy.) In the accidental significations (see page 109)

;

planet l£[ in the ascendant foreshows many strange unexpected
occurrences, rather vexatious, as about speedily to happen.—In

particular questions

Were the query concerning money generally, it is favourable.

Were it concerning the expected receipt of money, it is against

it, as 7/ forms no aspects but the A of Tj and before he
;

the affair, or at least hinders it for a very long space of time.

The g of J? and $ also denotes a cessation of friendship be-

gence by letters and spiteful neighbours.

Were the query respecting the obtaining trade or profession,

&c.$ angular, in semisextile to 1/ denotes money to be requisite

in the affair, and by such means it might be obtained as
; ^ is

in b*i-quintile to P?
, and 1/ rules the eleventh house.

Were the query concerning the probable success in a law-

suit, the querent would lose the day, or have to pay money, as

the lord of the second house is in the house of his opponent’s

wealth, and $ ruling that house is in his twelfth house.~-But

the adversary would also be near ruin, owing to the position

of the luminaries in the eleventh house, and $ accidentally in

the opponent’s second.

Were it concerning a duel, the challenging party would be
killed, as the J of 0 and D would be fatal, added to P? in the

sixth and $ in the eighth house, or house of mortality.

Were it concerning marriage, no marriage would take place,

as sickness or death would prevent it.— P? ruling the ascen-

dant, being in the house of sickness and the D combust, which
signifies infinite vexation and defection of friends, from the

houses these planets rule.

Were it concerning children, £ angular in f a bi-corporeal

sign and 1/ in lit a fruitful sign, denotes a large family of both
sexes several of whom would be great travellers, but deaths

;

and sickness in such a family would be probable.

Were the question concerning short journeys, $ goingto the

£ of Pj , denotes all possible misfortune therein, and sickness

to the wife (if married) while absent.

If of long journeys partial gain would accrue, as 1/ is in the

ninth house, but a death would cause the querent to speedily

return, as P? is retrograde and $ ruling the ninth in the house
of death.

Were the question of the general state of life, ^ in the sixth

house denotes sickness by violent colds, danger by water, but

long life in the end as 1/ and meet by A aspect before they

neighbour but $ angular, is a testimony of his being led to
;

expect an active, public life, yet but few real friends.

In this symbolical system of judgment, where events are in-

dicated (not caused strictly speaking,) the lords of each house

being directed longitudinally, or by their motion in the zodiac,

void of latitude and the arcs equated by the measure of time,

which the diagram, page 201, exhibits, will also show the va-

rious events that will happen : thus for instance, , lord of the

second house, is going in the next sign to a ^ of 1/ , a fortu-

nate star this aspect being about 7fr degrees distant, denotes
;

some particular gainful event, (unexpected at the time of the

figure being set) in about 7f- weeks time, and partly by means
of a friend.— 1? approaching a retrograde A of 11 being nearly

eleven degrees distant, denotes the same thing in about eleven

months reckoned from the time the figure was cast but
; pre-

vious to this his g to £ as before said, acts powerfully in evil.

In all cases, the student will bear this in mind that the ho-
;

rary system of judicial Astrology presumes the end orfinal issue

of every contingency may be foreseen, either by a figure erected

for the occasion by one whose mind is interested and anxious
therein , or by casting a figure fot the exact time of its com-
mencement ; and this rule holds good in every undertaking

;

as a few examples which we shall give will illustrate. The
first possible beginning, of course, is in these cases absolutely

necessary to be known, such as in aquatic or other buildings when
the first pile or stone is laid, to that time must the theme of

heaven be erected.—And in journeys, the instant of time the
party sets out or in sea voyages, the exact

; time the vessel is

unmoored and floats freely in her wonted element.
The first figure we shall give is the horoscope of a great

national undertaking

“ On each side an imperial city stood

With towers and temples proudly elevate.”

HORARY ASTROLOGY. 215

As the horoscope of the new London bridge exhibits a most

remarkable proof of the certain principles on which the science

of Judicial Astrology is founded, (a science which is built on

a foundation as certain as " the firm pillars of the earth/’) we
must first beg the reader’s attention to the following extract

from that clever old Astrologer, the celebrated William Lilly.

In his almanack for 1666, he says, “ The nineteenth degree of

n is London’s horoscope, and at the foundation of the city the

O was in twenty-five degrees of the same sign. This is cer-

tainly true, that when any notable event happens to concern

that city, the planets are in those degrees, or those signs and
degrees are affected,” & c. &c.

Now, although, the engineers and architects of the present

day do not order their buildings “ by the courses of the stars,”

as they did of old, yet it is worthy of observation, that had
they employed the most skilful Astrologer to erect an horoscope

for the occasion, they could not have chosen a point of time for

their great national undertaking, more strictly agreeing with the

rules of the sidereal art, than the foregoing horoscope evinces !

Incredulists and sophists may ridicule this assertion, but such is

nevertheless the case : for observe, as if to verify the rules given
by every author who has written on the science that

; Gemini
is the ascendant of London, we find, that not only that very
sign arose at the commencement of the work , hut when thefirst

pile was driven, the identical degree, assigned as the horoscope

of the metropolis, also ascended in the eastern horizon.—Next,
to the above singular fact, the student will be led to notice the

excellent position of % hi $ his exaltation, and in the sign

of the second house.—The lord of the ascendant is posited in

a watery sign, separating from the A of 1/ and applying to a
bi-quintile aspect of

; ? in the mid-heaven—and more sin-

gular still the work was commenced upon a full
; Moon, which

(as the D at that period is increasing in light and thus rendered
fortunate) in Astrology is generally chosen as an excellent tes-

timony where circumstances will permit it.

Independent of the singular fact, which the foregoing proves,

that every important undertaking, connected with the welfare

of the British metropolis, has the sign n ascendant, at the time



; ; —

216 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

it begins the student will perceive the astonishing- number of

eminent fixed stars, of the first mag-nituderising within the limits

of London’s Ascendant which also proves that the old
; Astro-

logers had justifiable grounds for attributing that sign, and those

degrees thereof, to such a purpose : and as England is justly

stiled the greatest and bravest nation in the world, and also the

most renowned for her maritime power, so London being the

capital, the head of Albion, is the fountain and grand reposi-

tory of her almost boundless wealth—andjustly did the expert

and renowned sages of former times behold these particulars,

when they presaged her future grandeur by the discovery of

that celestial influence, and that peculiar constellation to which
she (next under Divine Providence) owes all her greatness !

It is both amusing and instructive, to reflect on the changes

and revolutions which are effected by short-lived man, or rather

by that grand march of improvement, which is the proudest

characteristic of social prosperity. All is made subservient to

his spirit he hews down forests, which become spread over
;

seas in countless fleets—plains, once barren and deserted, become
peopled—the hut leads to a cottage -the cottage to a village

and villages to splendid cities. Such is civilisation in embryo.

“ Thames the most lov’d of all the oceans sons

By his old sire, to his embraces runs,

Hasting to pay his tribute to the sea

Like mortal life to meet eternity.

Though with those streams he no resemblance hold

Whose foam is amber, and their gravel gold.

His genuine and less guilty wealth t’explore,

Search not the bottom but survey his shore ;

O’er which he kindly spreads his spacious wing,

And hatches plenty for th’ ensuing spring.

Nor are his blessings to his banks confin’d.

But free and common as the sea or wind.

Full of the tributes of his grateful shores.

So that to us no thing, no place is strange,

While his fair bosom is the world's exchange /”

Whilst we are treating- of horoscopes, that of the present

volume must not be neglected since its verification will here-
;

after tend to strengthen our theory.—In the Author's last work
heforetold therein of its great success, which it is well known
has been the case. Indeed the presage has not only been ve-

rified by its extensive circulation at home, but “ The Astrologer'

of the Nineteenth Century’’ has traversed many parts, both of

India, America, and other remote regions; where the more
brilliant and costly, but less successful, volumes of its contem-

poraries have scarcely been heard of—From the above horo-

scope and the reigning stars, the student will perceive that the

present hook isfated to enjoy celebrity, when probably some of

the most popular works of the present day will be sunk in the

lethe of public oblivion, and no more remembered in the circle

“ The links of the chain of prophecy, to a well informed mind, seem disposed

The theory of that part of judicial Astrology, which more
immediately refers the grand and magnificent machinery of
“ the heavenly host” to the destinies of nations, rather than to

the fate of individuals, is well deserving the student’s most se-

rious attention. By means of the light, which this part of the

sublimest of all sciences will throw upon the page of future
history, he may not only develope the causes of those extraor-

dinary passing events, which are found to occupy the entire

attention of the political world but he may alike read in

heavens the future fate, either of the mightiest monarchy, or

of the humblest principality. Neither will this be difficult,

provided he take but the requisite trouble in erecting his figures

or celestial themes, and observing the etherial revolutions of

the heavenly bodies, which are the ground work whereon his

predictions are founded; and which foundation (without strain-

ing any part of the metaphor) will be to him as a rock of ada-

mant, that through ages has lifted its almost eternal head, above
the dark and troubled waters of bewildered fanaticism and
gloomy incredulity.

In the foregoing parts of this work, the author has laid down
the systematic theory of the general effects universally found by
Astrologers of all ages, and in every clime, to have operation

over the earth and its inhabitants to which he must refer the
;

reader for his data, or first principles. In those, he will find

recorded the celestial signs and constellations which, by long
;

experience, are found to govern peculiar countries as well as
;

the different parts of the great etherial circle, that being di-

vided into equal proportions, and termed accordingly “ the

houses of heaven,” bear symbolical rule in determining the

particular effects, deduced from Astral agency.—And lest the

light and frivolous of the present generation, may here be in-

clined to laugh at, or condemn our theory, it may be mentioned,

as undeniable facts, well worthy the reader’s most serious and
candid attention, that if we look back to those periods in his-

tory, when the moral and political state of the nations of the

earth have been most subject to the horrors of war, the ravages

of pestilence, or the convulsions of anarchy or other impor-
;

tant revolutions, attended with direful results—we shall uni-

versally find that those disastrous events have been immediately
preceded, or attended, by some extraordinary phenomena, or

strange appearance in the heavens, as well as by (the natural

effects of these celestial omens) some extraordinary convulsion

in the elements of the globe !

The ancient philosophers, who were destitute of these means
of scientific information, which Providence has condescended to

place within our reach, were accustomed to consider the visible

universe as exhibiting ample evidence of the existence of an in-



—

visible Almighty power: thus Socrates, (in his dialogue with
Euthedemus) according to Xenephon, has these sublime re-

marks : “He who raised this whole universe, and still upholds the

mighty frame ; who perfected every part of it in beauty and in

goodness suffering none of these parts to decay through age,
;

but renewing them daily with unfading vigor, whereby they

are able to execute whatever he ordains, with that readiness

and precision which surpasses man’s imagination even he—
the supreme God, who performeth all these wonders, still holds

himself invisible ; and it is only in his works that we are ca-

pable of admiring him.

Ptolemy, “the prince of Astrologers and philosophers,” as he
is usually termed, (and whose works translated by the Abbe
Halma, the French government have lately patronized) had
likewise the same elevated views of the beauty and order of the
** heavenly host,” for as he justly observes, “ It is manifest to all,

that a certain power is distributed and passeth through all things

that are near the earth, from the nature of the firmament first
;

on the sublunary elements, the fire and air, which are encom-
passed by and changed with the motion of the firmament, and
these again encompass the rest, which are also varied according

to the mutations of the other, the earth and water, with the

planets and living creatures in them : for the Sun with that

which doth environ (meaning the starry heavens) governs all

things that are about the earth, not only by changing the sea-

sons, and bringing to perfection the produce of animals, and
the fruitfulness of plants, the flowing of waters, and the muta-
tions of bodies—but also causing changes ofthe day, of heat and
cold, dryness and moisture, as it hath respect to our meridian.

The Moon also, who is the nearest to the earth, distils down
much influence by which things

; animate and inanimate are

affected and changed, rivers are augmented and diminished ac-

cording to her light, the tides vary as she rises and sets, while
planets and animals in whole, or in part, increase and decrease
with her.”

“ In the same manner the stars, fixed and erratic, as they
keep on their course, cause many appearances about us for

;

they are producers of heat, and winds, and storms, by which



—

STATE ASTROLOGY. 221

also thing's on earth are suitably governed and their mutual
;

configurations (their influence being thereby mixed) produce

various mutations. But the power of the Sun is more preva-

lent, inasmuch as it is more universal the rest (according to
;

some measure. The Moon doth this more frequently and mani-

time, and more obscurely as they either appear, disappear,
;

or decline.—Since these things are so, not only conjoined bo-

dies are subject to the motion of the stars, but also the buddings

and perfection of seeds, are framed and formed according to the

quality with which the ambient is endued.—Now the more ob-

servant husbandmen and shepherds, conjecturing from the
winds which happen at the seasons of seed sowing, and gene-
ration of animals, foreknow the quality of succeeding accidents.

And in a word, the more universal, and whatsoever comes to

pass by the more apparent configurations of the Sun, Moon,
and Stars even they who are not skilled in nature foreknow

;

by observation alone : for we see, that even they who are igno-

rant, from observation alone, guess at those things which are

produced by a greater power: such as that of the Sun and
more uncompounded order, and which have each variation by
the configurations of the stars, and the Moon to the Sun.
Yea, some irrational animals have a foreknowledge, as may be
seen in the mutations of the seasons of the year, of the Spring,
Summer, and the others and moreover in the

; change of the
winds. For the most part the Sun is the cause of these, but
what are not alike simple, but have some small mixture, these
men do foreknow by accustoming themselves to observe them

;

as mariners do foresee the coming of storms and blasts of wind,
which are caused by the rays of the Moon, or the configurations
of the erratic stars. But these are often deceived, for by rea-
son of their want of experience, they do not know the times

,

nor the places, nor the courses of the wandering stars—all

which to be exactly known, conduce to a certain prescience of
these things.”

In another part of his matchless writings, after deducing the
existence of the Supreme Being, from the harmony of the uni-

verse, and the wonderful and beautiful order of its established

motions, he remarks with singular sublimity, (and, for a heathen

philosopher, with singular piety,) “ from the conformity which
is found in divine things, and the fine order of these propor-

tions, those who study them will be in love with this divine

beauty and accustom themselves to take it for the model of
;

their conduct, by a sort of influence which assimilates to the

faculties of the soul and we thus instructed by the labors of
;

those who have applied themselves to this science, strive to

increase this taste for eternal truths.”

These are sentiments worthy of so profound a genius for
;

why should not the grandeur and regularity of the work, lead

also to the reverence and deep admiration of the Almighty and
all-wise Architect ? Since the matchless and divine order,and

omnipotent skill displayed throughout " the vast whole,” when
seriously considered, cannot fail to impart a beneficial influence

to moral order, even amongst mankind in general and thus
;

the science of Astrology possesses the advantages of combining
both philosophy and theology together.—Who then can deny
the fact of its conducing,in a most eminent degree, to render

mankind wiser, happier, and better ?

Another poet of eminence in the remoter ages, who wrote

on the theory of celestial agency, has the following remarkable

lines relative to Providence

“ A most convincing reason drawn from sense,

That this vast frame is moved by Providence .

Which like the soul doth every whirl advance;

It must be God nor was it made by chance,
,

As Epicurus dreamt, he madly thought

This beauteous frame of heedless atoms wrought,

That seas and earth, the stars and spacious air

Which forms new worlds, or doth the old repair.

First rose from these, and still supplied remain,

And all must be (when chance shall break the chain)

Dissolv’d to these wild principles again !

Absurd, and nonsense ! Atheist use thine eyes,

And having view’d the order of the skies,

Think (if thou canst) that matter blindly hurl’d,

"Without a guide, should frame this wondrous world !”

Makilius.

It was by means of this part of Judicial Astrology, (which
the ancients contemplated and studied, more than any other

part of the science,) that the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Syrians,

Egyptians, Lacedemonians, Persians, and Arabians, ascended

to the summits of monarchical power, and whereby their names
and renown became famous and glorious “ upon the face of the

earth.” Indeed it is certain that David, the sacred Psalmist,

was profoundly skilled in these celestial arts; for when re-

flecting upon the admirable frame of the Divine system, he

says, “ the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament

the work of his hands.—Day unto day uttereth speech, and
night unto night sheweth knowledge.—There is no speech

nor language where their voice is not heard,” &c. And also

Solomon his son, the gifted of heaven, whom we read of in the

sacred volume, where it is said that “ God gave him wisdom
and understanding exceeding much and that “ Solomon's

wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east

country, and all the wisdom of Egypt,” (which last was the

country where Astrology reached to great perfection.) And in

the 7th chapter of his Book of Wisdom, he declares that he

knew “the circuits of years, and the positions of the stars, the

beginning and ending and midst of the times the alterations,
;

and the change of seasons,” &c. In fact there still exists a beau-

tiful monument of Solomon's superior knowledge of the science

of the stars, in the finely sculptor’d zodiac which is still to be

seen on the remains of an ancient palace at Balbec,(of which
Mr. Wood has given a faithful description) which the author of
this Work has historical groundsfor supposing to be the scite

of the ancient Lebanon, in consequence of the sculptor’d orna-

ments of flower-work, pomegranates, lions, oxen, cherubim, &c.

which were, according to the sacred scriptures, amongst the chief

decorations of the Jewish temple— (all of which are as authentic

grounds, as an antiquarian would naturally wish, for the esta-

blishment of any disputed point in historical research)—and
hence, it may be presumed, that if the most wise and virtuous

of the ancient worthies, as deduced from the united records of

both sacred and profane history, have studied and labored in

Having- erected the scheme to the g-iven time of the solar

ingress, the student must well and attentively collect the vari-

ous testimonies of good and evil observing what
; planets are

angular, (and consequently more powerful) what aspects they

form, and the symbolical indication to which they are allotted,

by the foregoing diagram ;—still bearing in mind, that as in the

doctrine of nativities, the greater cause will still be found to

overcome the lesser, and the more powerful aspect will neu-

tralise the weaker; by which means he will read in the heavens

the well or ill being of that nation or kingdom for whose lati-

tude he erects his scheme, with all its various contingencies
;

and will be able to answer positively of peace or war, health

or sickness, dearth or plenty, either of the national population,

or the particular subject denoted by that house of heaven from

which he deduces his judgment.—We have a most famous ex-

ample on record of the accuracy with which the ancient Astro-

logers observed the heavens In the instance of Thales,
; who

was one of the celebrated wise men of ancient Greece Aris-
;

totle relates of Thales, “ that being upbraided by some foolish

scoffers on account of his poverty, and with the unprofitableness

of his studies in wisdom and philosophy, he had recourse to his

Astrological skill, whereby foreseeing that in the year follow-

ing, olives would be unusually plentiful to show his
; reproach-

ers the vanity of their ill-timed scoffing, the winter before that

year he hired all the shops and depositaries (both at Chios and
Miletum) that were reserved for the making of oil, and having
got them into his hands for a very small sum, because no man
would give more at that season of the year—After he had thus
forestalled their use, the next year, when the time of gathering
olives came on, every man being suddenly destitute of rooms
and offices, answerable to the great plenty of olives, with which
they were glutted, were driven to resort to Thales for his sup-
ply thereof; who taking advantage of that necessity, did turn
them over at what price himself listed : whereby he gathered
together on a sudden, a great mass of money ; and afterwards
(to show his contempt of riches) gave it to the poor.—Thus
letting the world understand that it was no hard matter for an
Astrologer to enrich himself, if wealth were the thing that he

esteemed and although at the present
; day, “ the precious me-

tals” are more difficult to acquire, yet it may be still retorted

upon the adversaries of Astrology, that as in the days of Thales,

the wise observer of nature, by the courses of the stars, might,

were he so inclined, even in these days, as certainly enrich him-
self by his skill in celestial wisdom, as did those of old. The
foreknowledge of the rise and fall of certain commodities, con-

nected with the commercial pursuits, or the daily fluctuations in

the monied interest, and the various secrets relative to the

finances of the country which none but an Astrologer
; could

possibly foresee or account for, afford the means of almost

boundless wealth, and without the hazard usually attendant

upon such contingent speculations. Probably some illiberal

persons, or inveterate critics, may condemn these assertions, as

destitute of truth but the believer in the art, or the true phi-
;

losophic observer of nature, will readily perceive that it is no
vain or empty boast of fallacious skill, but merely the effects of

a judicious application of certain principles, which antiquity

has bequeathed us, and experience ratified in certain peculiar
;

cases, by which the student in starry science is enabled toforesee

the good or ill fortune of every undertaking .—Thus also the

sacred writers “ Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and
the man that getteth understanding—she is more precious than

rubies and all the things thou canst desire, are not to be com-
;

pared unto her,—length of days is in her right hand, and in

her left hand riches and honor V*

The ingress of Sol in Aries, is the horoscope, radix, or ground
work of the Astrological year, which commences therewith,

and continues with the solar circuit throughout the whole of
the twelve celestial signs.—Hence all predictions in almanacks,
and annual publ ications, have, or are presumed to have, the them e

of heaven erected to the vernal ingress for their primary data

but in addition to this, it is also necessary to pay great attention

to the Neomenia, or

THE NEW MOON OF THE YEAR.

In every annual revolution of the Sun, the first New Moon



—

STATE ASTROLOGY. 227

of the infant year, is to be considered as of particular and es-

sential force in Astrological knowledge. In former times, this

lunation was with much pomp and solemnity observed as a fes-

tival, especially in the remoter ages, and by the ancient na-

tions.— It was celebrated by the Israelites, as well as by the

Pagans (which is evident from the 20th chapter of the first

book of Samuel) and kept once in a year with extraordinary

ceremonies. Although these superstitious observances are hap-
pily no more, yet the efficacy of the planetary motions at the

New Moon, nearest to the vernal equinox, cannot be denied,

and in all cases the student must well observe the horoscope

for that lunation ; and by examining the various configurations

formed by the active or passive stars, and Astral significators,

joined to the effects denoted in the vernal ingress, he will be

enabled to arrive at the most perfect conclusions, relative to the

destiny of that nation, for which his calculations are made.

“ Look how the floor of heav’n

Too thick inlaid with patines of bright gold !

There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st

But in his motion like an angel sings,

Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims ;

In evil mixture, to disorder wander,

CONSTITUTING THE

Summer, Autumn, and Winter Quarters ,

In like manner as we have given the precepts for judging the

vernal equinox, even so must the student proceed in forming
his predictions from the remaining quadrants of the year, fram-

ing his horoscope for the summer quarter, at the precise hour
and minute when the Sun enters the constellation Cancer for

the autumnal quarter, when Sol enters the beginning of the

sign Libra, and the hyemal, or winter quarter, when he in like

manner touches the first star in the constellation Capricorn.

The time when each of these takes place, the Ephemeris, as

before said, will accurately show and, moreover, these ingresses
;

are in the Ephemeris calculated to solar time, which requires

no addition or subtraction whatever to be made, contrary to

nativities where the time is accounted by clocks and watches,
and consequently not correct, till regulated by the Sun.—Thus
the method of predicting by the horoscopes of the year in State
Astrology, is void of any difficulty in the process, and suffici-

ently plain and easy to any one who will but pursue the sub-
ject in a scientific way, as we have heretofore described.

As a stimulus to such proceedings, it may not be deemed
altogether irrelevant to the subject, by remarking that the most
remarkable events in the fate of Europe and the surrounding
nations, have been actually foretold, (through the simple but
beautiful theory of Judicial Astrology).—Thus, in the Prophe-
tic Almanack, the exact day on which the late Queen Caroline
died was predicted twelve months before it took place, and at

a time when the subject thereof was in the enjoyment of health,
and to all appearance long-lived as also the war with the Bur-

;

mese, and other special predictions.—And to go no farther back

STATE ASTROLOGY. 229

than the present year, in the Prophetic Messenger for 1827, the

author of the work predicted the death of the late illustrious

and lamented Duke of York the similar changes
; in the cabi-

net the aggression in Portugal, &c.—Even as late as the last
;

month, (November 1827) there is the following remarkable
announcement of an event that even now continues to occupy
almost undivided attention, namely, the battle of Navarino.
The author’s words are these “ The Turks are going to open
variance with a gigantic power ; a dreadful shipwreck or dis-

aster at sea is shown by the signs of the month, which are re-

markably replete with evil * &c.” Therefore it necessarily fol-

lows, if that the science, when closely studied, invests the dili-

gent enquirer with these “ prophetic powers,” which we have
given proofs that it does, it must be worthy of the patronage
and support not only of the learned, but of the most dignified

since many contingent events, which necessarily cause almost
fatal errors in the system of foreign dominions, might by this

means be rectified and partially prevented.

Doubtless, great care and almost undivided attention to the

courses of the stars and the “ bright messengers of Heaven,”
coupled with a true philosophical and patient genius, entirely

divested of prejudice, with a rigid observance of truth in every

instance, are qualifications not easily found at the present day,

when wealth and power are the idols most men worship but
;

still it must be allowed, that “ patience and perseverance will

perform wonders and no one should rest satisfied with a bare

superficial examination of any art or science, but according to

that saying of the ancients, Veritas in Pieteo (or “ truth lies

hid in a well”) they should strive by all possible means to arrive

at the possession of sterling knowledge, which is the noblest

attribute of mankind in every age. And the true observance

of nature in her most retired paths, will eminently conduce to

the attainment of this desired object. Thus Milton :

Her motions, as the great first mover's hand

First wheel’d their course ; earth in her rich attire

Consummate lovely smil’d air, water, earth,

And brute, as other creatures, but endued

With sanctity of reason, might erect

His stature, and upright, with front serene,

Govern the rest, self knowing, and from thence

Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven ;

And worship God supreme, who made him chief

Of all his works.”

Paradise Lost.

@Cltp£tS.

It has been a constant argument brought forward by the

illiberal adversaries of Judicial Astrology, that it is fallacious

to attempt at predicting future events from the known and ne-

cessary phenomena of nature, of which eclipses are a part. But
observe the true force of the argument the Astrologer does

;

not pretend to attribute the effects which follow eclipses, to

the single circumstance of the luminaries being obscured, in a

greater or lesser manner, (although the occurrence of a total

eclipse happens so seldom, that even here the Astrologer who
reverences the sacred volume, which speaks of the signs of
Heaven, might be probably somewhat justified by attributing

certain effects thereto). But it is the position of the whole
Heavens, taken in his horoscope for the given time of the
ecliptic darkness, which he observes, and the actual configura-
tions of every planet, as well as those of the luminaries, which



—

STATE ASTROLOGY. 231

are active or passive agents in the eclipse.—The eclipse itself

serving* only as an epoch, or celestial date, whereby certain

events are to be predicted from the heretofore known qualities

of the reigning* stars, or planetary orbs.—This places the matter

in a new light, and consequently removes the charges of super-

stition and absurdity, which are usually showered down in

plentiful epithets upon those who dare to be wise, by attempting

to find a clue towards unravelling the mysterious laws of the

universe. It is by a similar play upon letters, words, and argu-

ments, that the shallow and groundless abuses of this most
noble science is founded.—A fact, which we hope the critics

who may be fated to oppose our humble endeavours in the cause

of truth , will not suffer to pass by unnoticed.

As a proof of the reality of planetary agency at the time of

eclipses, let the reader only refer to the remarkable events

which succeeded the great solar eclipse of September 7, 1820.

In the latter part of that year, and in the early part of 1821, a

general ferment was excited by the proceedings of the late

Queen Caroline. It was in the month of May 1821, that the

most mighty of earth’s imperial conquerors, Napoleon Buona-
parte, died.—Next we have the extraordinary ceremony of his

majesty’s coronation, at which the ill-advised queen attempted

to be present ; the death of the same ill-fated princess within

a few days after the tumult at her funeral.—The persecutions
;

of the Grecian Christians by their Turkish taskmasters which
;

became general just at the occultation of the great luminary,

and which brought on a train of massacres and brutal violations,

as horrible and revolting to human nature as any on record, by
which the great cities of Turkey in Asia, were filled with fe-

male victims, and children, the prey of the barbarian and cities
;

of injured Greece with reprisals of Mahommedan blood !

Neither must it be forgotten, that in our nation the most extra-

ordinary distress prevailed among the agriculturists, which
caused the ruin of thousands, as well as the great depreciation

of land, which in many districts, was left almost entirely on the

hands of the proprietors and rents, in consequence, were re-
;

events were of too much magnitude to be indifferently passed

over by the reflecting and philosophical Astrologer

But more recent still, and more fresh in the memories of our

readers, are the no less remarkable events which have suc-

ceeded the solar eclipse of November 29, 1826. Within a

month of that celestial obscuration, arrived the news of the

war in Portugal the embarkation of British troops for the
;

scene of action, which was so totally unexpected, that millions

of money were alternately gained and lost by the sudden de-

preciation in our government securities.—Next, the nation was
filled with one universal note of lamentation and poignant

sorrow, by the death of the illustrious commander-in-chief, of

the bravest troops in the world succeeding this, were the
;

almost unprecedented distractions in the cabinet, through which
the king was left without a responsible adviser, the army with-

out a commander, and the government without a head.—Then
succeeded the Whig promotions, and the total change in the

cabinet thereby—the violent opposition in the parliamentary

senate— the death of Mr. Canning, at a most critical juncture
;

the arming of the Russian fleet—the death of the emperor of

Saxony, and other no less remarkable events, which whatever
may have been their cause, have produced the grandest actions

on the great theatre of Europe and events which none but
; an

Astrologer can possibly account for, but which, he contends,

were produced entirely by the positions of the heavenly bodies,

and their prevailing aspects, at the period of the eclipse to

which the solar ingresses, as before described, bore testimony.

In calculating eclipses, the Astrologer must draw forth his

horoscope to the precise minute of time when the eclipse is said

to be in the middle of its greatest obscuration.—This is also

known by the Ephemeris, where the date thereof is set down
;

but otherwise it is easily calculated by the requisite tables, or

by stereographic projection but the first of these is the most
;

facile and easy in practice, and the horoscope when erected,

must be judged by the aforesaid elementary principles, which
we have clearly elucidated in various parts of this work, which
if he wishes to excel in this pursuit, must be well remembered.
Each aspect must be equated, and its various designation, either

omen will be faithfully perceived, and its certain allusion to

accurately known.—We shall here subjoin the horoscope for

the late lunar eclipse of November the 3rd, 1827-

“ There shall be signs in the Sim, and the Moon, and the Stars—upon the

“ PROPHETIC OBSERVATIONS”

RELATIVE TO THE PORTENTOUS CONFIGURATIONS OF THE HEA-

VENLY BODIES AT THE VISIBLE ECLIPSE OF THE MOON,

On the 3rd of November, 1827 ; the effects of which will be in

active influence over the greater part of Europefor a consi-

. derable period

That the stars are signs of future events, and that they have
power over the inferior world, and over all terrestrial objects, is

clearly demonstrated not only by the inspired writers,
; but

also by the most celebrated fathers of the Christian church, in

all ages.—Luther, the great reformer, in his commentary on the

book of Genesis, affirms, that Moses expressly declares, “ that

the Moon, with the Sun and Stars, were placed in the firma-

ment of heaven for tokens of that which should befall us, as

experience teaches, in eclipses, great conjunctions, and the
like.” Melancthon also advises the reader to compare this

with the prophet Jeremiah, who speaks of “ the signs of hea-

ven” in a most emphatic manner.

The records of antiquity assure us, that Astrology was for-

merly the favorite pursuit of the wisest, the mightiest, and the

most exalted of mankind. Thus Berosus, the Chaldean, was so

famous in the art, that, after his death, his statue was erected

with a golden tongue, to denote his almost divine skill in pre-

dictions.—It is recorded of the Roman emperor Adrian, that by

his knowledge in the science, “ he wTas able to set dowrn a

diary of every accident that would befall him, to the very hour

of his death —And the extraordinary skill of Severus, another

Roman emperor, was such, that having cast his nativity, pre-

vious to his expedition for the shores of Britain, he caused it to

be inscribed on the wralls of his judicial palace, with the pre-

diction affixed, (as a monument of his knowledge,) “ that he

should never return again which accordingly happened,

for he died at York, after ruling the empire eighteen years !

And, as Sir Christopher Heydon justly observes, “so highly

hath this divine knowledge ever been esteemed, by the ancient

monarchs of the world, that grateful antiquity could not better

eternize their memory to posterity, than, as when they lived,

they valued nothing so precious as the contemplating the hea-

venly bodies so being dead, to make their names live for
;

ever amongst the stars. From hence it is that the fairest con-

stellations of heaven, as Arcturus, Orion, Hercules, Castor, Pol-

lux, Perseus, Chiron, and the like, still do retain their names :

whereby their renown now shines more durable, in these ce-

lestial lamps, than it could by being engraven on the most
sumptuous pyramid, mausoleum, triumphant arch, or other mo-
nument, made of frail earthly matter, and subject to the ruins

of time !”

Amongst the celestial phenomena of the starry orbs, those of

eclipses rank in the first class. In the Prophetic Messenger
of the former year, I have deduced an evidence of Christianity

therefrom, and proved thereby, that Astrology and Theology
are twin sciences each

; capable of making mankind happier
and better. The ancient records, were they consulted, would
also lead to convincing instances of these facts, had wTe time to

descant thereon. And it has been remarked by every wise ob-
server of nature, that important changes follow such configu-

rations which extend not only over kingdoms, states, and in-
;

dividuals, but also over the brute creation. A singular instance

whereof is recorded by Peucer, in his “ Tractate of Astrological

Predictions/" where he gives an authentic example of three

dogs, “ who were all whelped in the eclipse of the Moon,”
“ and which, after they were grown up, fulfilled the significa-

tions of the eclipse by their miserable death—one of them being

torn asunder by hounds, another falling off from a high place,

first broke his thigh, and the next time his neck the third was

burnt !”

The eclipse, of which I now intend to decipher the omens,
is that of the lesser luminary, the Moon, which takes place

November 3rd, 1827, 5h. 7m. P. M. or afternoon, a correct view
of the theme of heaven, for which is given in the foregoing

In the horoscope of the hour, the 23rd degree of the celes-

tial Bull is oriental and the mischievous fixed star, Caput Algol,

or Medusa’s Gorgon-Head, is unluckily located near the cusp

of the House of Life. The Moon is just arising in Taurus, op-
posed to Venus, from signs of a fixed nature, and singular

power. The Sun and Venus being configurated in the constel-

lation of the Scorpion.—Supreme in the middle heaven, the

Georgian planet Herschel, is gloomily beheld by a malicious

aspect of Saturn, the lord of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh

Venus, the reigning star, and ruler of the ascendant. Jupiter

and Mars are each found in the sixth mansion, in the Autumnal
Equinox the latter in amicable reception with his depositor,

“ Behold ! the day of the Lord eometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger,

to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.

“ For the stars of heaven, and the constellation thereof, shall not give their

light : the Sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the Moon shall not cause

her light to shine.”—Isaiah, xiii. 9, 10.

The Astral omens of this celestial horoscope are very porten-

tous and lasting in effect; they afford matter of serious contem-

plation to every “ nation of the earth,” especially as it takes

place in a fixed and determined sign, and under baleful con-

stellations. On the continent, and more particularly in those

countries where the eclipse governs, the hostile rays of the

warring orbs will be severely felt. Those are the Russian and
Turkish empires great part of Persia, Germany, Holland,

;

Rome, Italy, and the Netherlands the South American States,
;

the American Republic, and also India or China. In some of

these countries there will be fearful mortality, civil commotions,

insurrections, decay of trade, and oppression of the common
people, by tyrannical rulers numerous outrages, or fearful

;

murders, assassinations, and many unheard of crimes. The
Austrian monarchy has a share of the evil, in various ways.

The coffers of the continental governments are emptied and
drained of wealth. The cities of Tunis, Algiers, Constanti-

nople, Moscow, Petersburgh, Berlin, Madrid, Vienna, Mexico,
New York, and Philadelphia, are subservient to the hostile de-

crees of fate. Death seems busy with his dart, even in the

imperial palaces ! An Empress, or princely matron, and an un-

usual number of the fair sex, will stoop to fate.* The grim
tyrant will make sad havoc among the high, and the warlike,

and the mighty and many a splendid mansion, many a royal

will cause malevolent effects in Spain, the country of anarchy;
and not even the Bourbon government can expect to escape
from harm. Even nearer home, both in our own country and
in Ireland, will the shock of evil aspects be conspicuously per-

ceived. The Catholic mitre, the Episcopal chair, the Dissenting-

pulpit, each are warned of evil. A sudden event causes much

deserts. From the position of Herschel, I fear many failures

will take place in public buildings, edifices, and national works
of importance. Certainly the greatest genius in the known
world will die under the effects of this eclipse, and one state

in particular will, like a furnace boiling with wrath, become
both the terror and warning of despotic nations. The winding-

sheet will also deck the banners of a great military hero ano-

and hypocrisy in religion atheism advancing rapidly, and

renowned as the chaff in the field. Great part of the conti-

nent will suffer by storm and tempest, or inundations. The

suffer unconscious of the cause. In the new world, I perceive

THE DURATION OF THE EFFECTS CAUSED BY

ECLIPSES.

In eclipses of the Moon, the effects are found uniformly to

succeed the obscuration of that luminary almost immediately.

But in those of the Sun, it is generally found that three months
or more elapse, before the grandest effects are visible and as

;

to the duration thereof, the student must well observe in what
sign or constellation of heaven, the eclipse happens for the

;

effects of an eclipse of either luminary in Q ££ or ss , will

last for several years if in 25 T or Yf , the effects are over
;

in a far more brief space of time ; but if in n ttj) % or K,
they are found to commence much sooner, and to continue a

long while in force, yet liable to occasional interruptions and
;

in these latter signs, they are found also to afflict mankind far

more powerfully, than when the eclipse falls in tropical or equi-

noctial signs.—It must also be again remembered, that the
greater or lesser effects of each eclipse, will be always in pro-

portion to the number of digits eclipsed or in other words,
;

the more total is the eclipse, the more powerfully will it operate

upon the earth and its inhabitants.—Also, that eclipses which
are invisible, are found to have no peculiar or perceptible influ-

ence over that region, city, or country, to which they are invi-

sible.—The united observations of Astrologers, tf in every age
and every clime/’ confirms this opinion and the student him-

;

self can soon prove it.



240 A MANUAL OF ASTROLOGY.

OF COMETS,

aaroUtgte^ of peahen.

“ I consider a comet , or in the language of the vulgar, a blazing star, as a sky-

rocket, discharged by an hand that is Almighty.”

Addison’s Guardian.

“ Lo! from the dread immensity of space,

Returning with accelerated course,

The rushing comet to the Sun descends ;

And as he sinks below the shading earth,

With awful train projected o’er the heavens,

The guilty nations tremble.’'

Thomson.

On the appearance of a remarkable comet, a short time before

the death of the celebrated emperor Charlemagne, that mo-
narch became extremely anxious upon the sight of this terrific

messenger, and interrogated his Astronomers as to what it fore-

told ?—Eginardus, his secretary, a profound philosopher, with
whom he then held a conference, answered him from the scrip-

tures—“ Be not dismayed at the signs of heaven.” To which
the emperor replied, that “ he was not dismayed at such signs,

but feared and reverenced the powerful cause, and Divinefra-
mer of them, who being incensed with anger against a people

or a prince, is wont by these, to admonish them of his wrath,

and to call them to repentance that they may avoid it.

Modern philosophers have been at infinite pains to persuade

us, that every part of the sacred volume, which is replete with

intimation relative to the importance of the “ heavenly signs,”

is a mere jumble of words devoid of meaning-; nay, they will

not even allow that the most terrific, or blazing- comet, has any
thing- to do with portending national calamities, or the fall of

the mighty and tyrannical, in which light our ancestors inva-

riably viewed them. How far they have succeeded, and how
far they have reaped the fruit of their labour's, let the mon-
strous growth of atheism, sophistry, irreligion, crimes and im-

moralities, with the shocking contempt of “ all that is sacred

on earth, or holy in heaven,” bear awful witness —Our fore-

fathers were pious, were brave, were religious they fought,
;

bled, and conquered for the land “of their altars,” as well as

their homes but they believed in Astrology,
; they reverenced the

“ signs of heaven in a word, they were what is now called

“ superstitious,” although, except in the dark ages of popery,

(when the mitre and the crosier at times bore cruel sway,) we
could challenge the whole of our modern sophists to affix

aught like “ superstition” or credulity to the memory of our he-

roic ancestors.

It is fortunate for the celestial science, and proves the connec-

tion between its truth, and the truth of the sacred volume, that

in the minds of the great majority of mankind, there is, and for

ever will be, an innate evidence in favour of the ancient and
vulgar opinion for that opinion, whatever the pomposity of

;

modern scepticism may say on the subject, is certainly the most
pious.—Daniel (in his 6th chapter) says, that “ He (God)
worketh signs and wonders in heaven, and in the earth and
Christ, speaking of the calamities which were to come upon
Judea, declared, that “ nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom and great earthquakes

; shall be in

divers places, and famines, and pestilences, and fearful sights
;

and great signs shall there be from heaven.”—The history of

Josephus (the Jewish historian) proves that all these things

were fully accomplished.

Neither did these things escape the attention of the greatest

and wisest men of ancient times. Cicero writes, “ that in the

civil war between Octavius Augustus and Mark Antony, it

was observed that comets were the harbingers of the miseries

that then befel them.” He was of opinion, “ that such appear-
ances were prenunciations of great events ;” and which, he
says, “ were confirmed by various instances from all antiquity.”

Of the same opinion was Pliny,* who writes, “ afearful star

this cometis, and not easily expiated, as it appeared by the late

civil troubles when Octavius was consul as also a second
; time

by the intestine war of Pompey and Caesar and in our
; days,

about the time that Claudius Caesar was poisoned, and left the
empire to Domitius Nero, in the time of whose reign and go-
vernment there was a blazing comet, in a manner continually

seen.”—Another writer, no less celebrated among the ancient

worthies, Seneca, exclaims, “ Some comets are very cruel, and
threaten us wT ith the worst of mischiefs they bring with

; them ,

and leave behind them , the seeds of blood and slaughter.”

Socrates, the historian, records this passaget upon Gainas" be-
sieging of Constantinople, “ So great was the dangerwhich hung
over the city, that it was presignified and portended by a huge
biasing comet that reached from heaven to the earth, the like

to which no man ever saw before.” Cedrenus,% another histo-*

rian, states, that a comet appeared before the death of Johannes
Tzimicas, the emperor of the East. He says, “It foreshewed
the death of the emperor, and those immediate calamities which
were to befal the Roman dominions, by reason of their civil

wars.” In another part of his writings he likewise states, that

“ a wonderful comet was seen in the reign of Constantine,

which portended calamities that were to befal the world soon
after.” Anna Commena, the daughter of Alexius, the Greek
emperor, (whose life she wrote) speaking of a most remark-
able comet that appeared before the irruption of the Gauls,

remarks, “ This happened by the usual administration of Pro-

vidence in such cases,for it is not fit that so great and strange

an alteration of things as was brought to pass by that coming

of theirs, should be without some previous denunciation and
admonishment from heaven.” She further remarks, that all

the enquiry of spectators, was, “ What evils doth this new

doth this messeng*er from above arrive with *

Machiavel,* speaking concerning comets, remarks “however
it cometh to pass, so it is, that we have it vouched by experi-
ence, that some great commotions are the consequences of such
signs as these ” Milichius,+ professor of mathematics in Mai-
denburg, observes, “ there is good grounds for the usual beha-
viour of men as to comets for they have reason

; to gaze at them
with so much terror and astonishment as they do, because it

hath been proved, by a large induction of experience and obser-

vation, that they denounce great slaughter to the world, sack-

ing of cities, subversion of kingdoms, and other public disasters.”

The learned GrotiusX observes, that “ Comets and fiery

swords, and such like signs, are wont to be the forerunners of
great changes in the world Thus also Josephus,§ who after

commenting at large on the wonderful blindness and wilful ob-

stinacy of his countrymen, (by which their ruin was preceded)

remarks, that “ when they were at any time premonished from

the lips of truth itself, by prodigies, and other premonitory

signs of their approaching ruin, they had neither eyes, ears, or

understanding, to make a right use of them, but passed them
over without heeding, or so much as thinking of them : as for

example, what shall we say of the Comet, in the form of a
sword, that hung over Jerusalemfor a whole year together ?

In addition to the foregoing, it may be mentioned that the

most eminent mathematicians and philosophers of former times,

held similar opinions of the prodigies portended by Comets.

Among whom may be named, as most conspicuous, Ptolemy,
Tycho Brahe, Longomontanus, Clavius, Piso, &c. &c. and to

;

deny their effects, even according to natural philosophy, is

equally as absurd as to deny the known effects of the Sun and
Moon, or of any other celestial body. Their appearance may.

on natural principles alone, be accounted as forerunning- (and
consequently presaging-) evil, since their presence must certainly

derange the system for a time and as a clever Astrologer
; ob-

serves, “ The ancients, who though not so learned as the mo-
derns, were more acute in their observations, considered them
as the cause of every calamity that could afflict mankind

; and
modern observations confirm this opinion.” The great Comet
in 1680, followed by another lesser one in 1682, was evidently

the forerunner of all those remarkable and disastrous events

that ended in the revolution in 1688. It also evidently presaged
the revocation of the edict of Nantz and the cruel

; persecution

of the Protestants, by the French king Louis XIV., and which
was afterwards followed by those terrible wars, which with
little intermission, continued to ravage the finest, parts of Eu-
ropefor nearly twenty-four years.

Leybourn in his Mathematical Chariot,* gives a description

of four Comets which appeared in 1618, the year before the

commencement of the thirty years war in Germany, which evi-

dently prognosticated the devastation, blood, and slaughter,

that ensued as one of them appears to have been particularly
;

remarkable. Ricciolus, Hevelius, and Dr. Cotton Mather, have
given a catalogue of all the remarkable Comets that had ap-
peared before their time, with a list of the real occurrences

which took place soon afterwards. Indeed it is almost super-

fluous to mention further examples of the kind, did we not bear

in mind those recent instances, in which the appearances of

these warning messengers have had ample verification, as to the

events they foretold. Thus the Comet in 1807, which appeared
towards the south in September, presaged the troubles in Spain,

the dethroning of its king, and the subsequent usurpation of his

son Ferdinand, with those remarkable events that almost imme-
diately succeeded its appearance

But the great Comet of 1811, which appeared near the con-
stellation Ursa Major, and whose orbit crossed the ecliptic, in

the sixteenth degree of Leo and Aquaries, was the most remark-

able that has appeared in modern times, when about the time

of its greatest northern declination, and when its appearance

was in consequence most conspicuous, it daily passed over the

midst of Europe. Neither were the nightly changes, of which
it was the forerunner, less conspicuous in their quick and rapid

succession.—A few months afterwards, the late French empe-
ror, guided by his evil star, commenced his unfortunate march
against Russia. The burning of Moscow, the destruction of
armies, and the stupendous events which almost immediately

followed the appearance (of that celestial omen) are subjects of
history, never to beforgotten !—And he would deny the possi-

bility of Comets, being sent as special tokens, to forewarn man-
kind, naturally considering after such facts as the above, offers

a most pointed insult to the divine wisdom of the “ Most High/'

the Almighty Ruler of the Universe.

Astrologers, in general, have supposed comets to be of a

fiery nature which seems likely to be the case, since their ap-
;

pearance is usually succeeded by an unseasonable warmth in

our atmosphere. Providence seems also to have wisely ordered,

that they should move in angles, that do not interfere with the

planetary orbs that revolve in the zodiac.—To which it may be

further adduced in evidence of their being sent for “ signs/'

that the greatest of them, and the most remarkable, have

uniformly appeared in the northern hemisphere thus passing
;

over those nations which have been the most convulsed by great

political events.

ASTROLOGICAL PORTENTS

FROM THE APPEARANCE OF

METEORS, AND UNUSUAL CELESTIAL PHENOMENA,

In General.

The ancient Astrologers, in these particulars, were accus-

tomed to pay peculiar attention to that part or quarter of hea-

ven in which these celestial appearances were first seen added
;

to which, they observed in what constellation of heaven, and
near what fixed stars of eminence, they were posited, in re-

spect to their longitude. They also deduced a system of pre-

sages from their color, shape, resemblance to swords, crowns,

halo's, wands, flames of fire, &c. But the most philosophical

and also natural way, is evidently to cast a theme of heaven,

to that hour in which they are first seen and from
; which the

certain cause of their appearance is more likely to become ma-
nifest to the student, than in any other manner. The figure of

the heavens at the appearance of the Georgium Sidus, or the

new planet discovered by Herschel, and since called by his

name, evinces the singular truth of this corollary.—This planet

was first discovered on March 13th 1781, 10h. P. M. and by
;

casting the horoscope for that period, the student will perceive

that the celestial stranger was in the ninth house of heaven ,

and Saturn in the twentieth degree of Sagittarius, in the se-

cond house or house of wealth.—The horoscope of his appear-

ance of course most plainly indicated, that the influence to be

expected from this newly discovered star would be eminently

evil—and such. Astrologers have ever found it to prove.

Therefore it readily follows, that the same rules must be ob-

served in every case, where a new celestial appearance or un-

usual phenomena is observed in the heavens.

“ The heaven, stars, and planets, cause no evil, neither were

by a natural induction of blood and inheritance, we all derive

a corrupt will, which causeth in us many unlawful desires and
their consequences the fountain and cause whereof

; is, a cor-

rupt will, for every planet in its own property is good, and
communicates nothing to us but what is good, but our will

being corrupt, makes a bad use of that which is good in itself

as for example \—fire is good, and so necessary, that we cannot

live without it but he who is corrupt in his will, may set his

property, is placed above the other planets whose properties

are only active. The property of Saturn stirs up the contem-
plative faculty of man, and kindles in him a desire to know the

mysteries of God and nature, and this is done accordingly, if

the soul be good but if the unlawful appetite of the fiery es-

him flashing rejoicing lights, with a quick brightness and shin-

ing. This cannot be better expressed, than by a wise contem-
plative person, who being desirous of wTisdom and secret know-
ledge, seeks it with a kind of melancholy contemplative look,

if we consider only his outward appearance, for so far he is

truly saturnine so as we judge him sad, when indeed he is only
,

serious and although his countenance be heavy, yet his heart
;

is pleasant inwardly, and this is the right saturnine property. But

hath found out the secret he sought for, then he falls with great
joy from contemplation to action, and then the pleasure that

was only inwardly, appears outwardly on his face for

Tested, which it sets forward for action, and descends from Sa-
turn to Jupiter. 1/ then, as we have said, is the first active

planet, for in him, that which first begins to break out into

action was formerly conceived in Saturn, even as the thoughts
which are silently concealed in the heart, are actually and au-
dibly manifested in the mouth, where the very thought begins

to break out into action, in the voice, in articulate formed sounds

and words : not without reason, therefore, did the wise men
attribute to Saturn all scholars and philosophers, as also all

priests and hermits, all melancholy and reserved persons, who
love a solitary and retired life, and who are always full of

thoughts, and are more disposed to contemplation than to ac-

tion. On the contrary, to Jupiter all statesmen, magistrates,

and tradesmen, who use their heads more than their hearts, and
who are always busied in outward mechanical actions, and not

in the inward profound speculations of the mind and truly all
;

professed mechanical arts were found out first by the speculation

of the mind, for they are but the inventions of contemplative

spirits, so that the statesman receives his politics from the phi-

losopher, the one finding, and the other executing, so that con-

templation still precedes action, as Saturn is before Jupiter in

the heavens, even as thoughts are conceived in the mind prior

to the action of speech. Again, who can see the leaves and

flowers that are in the tree certainly no man, but when the
;

tree hath put them forth, then they are manifest to all men
;

even so our thoughts, while they are in the heart, appear to

none but God and our own souls but when manifested by
;

words or actions, they are known to all, the heart is the forge

of the saturnine properties wherein the thoughts rise and are

formed, and such as the thoughts are, such are the actions
;

therefore if the saturnine properties be good, those of Jupiter

must be the same, the saturnine being the source of all. There-

fore, a wicked man being of the saturnine or melancholy nature,

he is exceedingly wicked and dangerous.

vation, that among the planets the Sun signifies the pure prin-

ciple of light, and Mars the principle of fire, whence observe

that Mars is exalted above the Sun in the great world, which
shows to us the corrupt complexion of nature at present and of

man : also, the fire in both being placed above the light, the

principle of wrath being more predominant than the principle

of love thus hath God portrayed, as we may say, the fall of

man, in the great world out of which he was taken, and in

which, as in a glass, he may see his present and future state.

We are now come to the noblest of all the planets, the @ ;

we will begin with the metal attributed to that planet, which
is gold the most perfect body under the Sun, for

, there is no
superfluity in it, nor any inequality of elements, for it consists

of most pure elements, equally proportioned by nature, and by

a long concoction of many years it is most perfectly fixed,
; and

digested into the best temperature that can be, in which respect

it is incorruptible, for neither fire nor water can destroy it, nor

can length of days waste or alter it, nor can the earth ever rust

it; but amidst all these inferior elements, which corrupt all

other bodies, gold remains invincible for ever a wonderful
thing indeed, that a body born in a corruptible place in the

earth, should be incorruptible, contrary to the nature of the

parents. This made the wise men conclude, that there was in

the centre of the elements, a certain incorruptible hidden sub-

stance or seed, out of which gold was made and in the search
;

or inquisition after this, they labored much, but they chiefly

sought it in gold, because in gold it was most perfectly digested.

It has been asked, why and wherefore all the world have una-

nimously admired gold, and made it the price of all other com-
modities ; how came they to agree in this point, when they

disagree in all others, more or less ? for my part, the scriptures

have given me the amplest satisfaction on this head and since
;

1 have already entered into this discourse, I shall, in as few
words as I can, lay down my judgment concerning it. We read,

in Genesis, that the use of metals were known to man, even in



;

THE MYSTIC SIGNATURES. 251

the days of Adam, long- before the flood and though the
; scrip-

tures mention no metals but brass and iron, yet may we from
thence conclude, that gold and silver were not then known,
but rather infer the contrary, for gold and silver are easily

melted, out of their ore, but iron and brass not without difficulty

and labor; wherefore, if they knew that which was most dif-

ficult, consequently they were no strangers to that of easy ac-

cess. Now in the days of Adam and Tubal Cain, there were
but few men in the world, so that there was more riches than
they could possess nor need they to have looked for metals

; to

exchange with, for all was in common without purchase. It

is plain then, that the first use that man made of gold was not

to traffic with let us then enquire, what it was that made gold
;

so precious, and so much admired. Certainly the world is in

most gross ignorance, inasmuch as there is not one who can tell

what gold is good for did nature make it only to
; look at, and

to pass from one hand to another ? Can it only be seen and felt,

and is there no other use for it ? Moses took more than ordinary

notice of it, and knew its nature, and what it was good for

otherwise he had not been so curious, as so particularly to men-
tion and praise it, as he has in Genesis, where speaking of the

four rivers that came out of Eden, says “ the name of the first

is Pison, and is that which encompasses the land of Havilah,

where there is gold, and the gold of that land is good.” I ask

now those ignorant enemies of divine and natural magic, if

Moses was skilled in metals or not if he was, and being
; so

great and pious a man, how dare they condemn that which
teaches the knowledge of metals : if they say he was not skilled,

his own writings will condemn them, for in this text, he not

only says that gold is there, but that likewise the gold of that

land is good for my own part, I could wish he had said what
;

it was good for, and wherein the goodness consisted but surely
;

as to the skill of Moses, the scriptures bear him witness, that

he was skilled in all the learning of the Egyptians ; but if we
will prove the skill of Moses out of his own practice, we need
go no further than the golden calf, which by his skill he cal-

cined and burnt to powder, and sprinkling it with water, gave
it the Israelites to drink, and so made an aurum portabilc.

Surely gold is good for health, and was first used for that pur-

pose, which made it so precious, though that use is not known
in our days, yet we have been so fortunate as to see gold dis-

solved in certain water, and that water, together with the gold

in a long decoction, congealed into little red stones like rubies,

which when re-dissolved, and exalted by several multiplica-

tions, will show us what gold is good for, and why the first

fathers of the world did so much esteem it, which continues to

be highly valued to this day, though the principle cause why it

was so esteemed originally, is not now known to the usurers.

Gold by Ante-Diluvians was used for physic, and not for traffic

and its use as a medicine made it much desired and sought after,

inasmuch, as it was not only necessary for the prolongation,

but also preservation of life for many learned and religious
;

persons are of opinion, that Adam and the other patriarchs
who lived before the flood, did excel in this kind of knowledge,

and prolonged their lives many hundred years, with the use of
this medicine, whose virtues all men admire, and place more
esteem on it than on any other thing and though the know-

;

ledge of the use and virtues of gold was lost in process of time,

yet the custom of admiring and valuing it has remained, so

that gold came to be accounted the most precious of all sub-

stances, and at last was appointed to be the price of all com-
modities, and to pass in exchange for all necessaries whatso-
ever. I shall not now forbear to lay down the reasons which
made Adam seek for a medicine in gold though

; we have no
books written by Adam out of which we may take these rea-

sons, yet we have still the book of created nature, which was
the only book Adam had to use, and therein is as much to be
seen now as in the days of Adam, and those reasons which
Adam therein saw, the same do we now see. Before the fall

of Adam the elements of earth and water were much purer

than they are now, and the influences that descended from
Heaven were more abundant and more vigorous than they have
been since thus the fruits that were in paradise, and on

; which
Adam fed, were without doubt of an heavenly complexion,
there being in them such an abundance of light and brightness

that they shone like the Sun and Moon, by whose influence



THE MYSTIC SIGNATURES. 253

they were produced yea, even the ancient poets in their alle-
;

gories tell us of the g olden age &c., by which pictures they
,

mean nothing1 else but the great fertility before the fall, and

without doubt the waters and dews then were considerably

more luxurious and bright than they are now, from having much
more of the heavenly influence and light in them, so that the

fruits of paradise being nourished with those bright, luxurious,

and shining dews, did glisten and sparkle like the stars of

heaven ; for at that time man was not at variance with his

God, wherefore God did most lovingly pour down his blessings

in a much greater degree than the earth now does or would re-

ceive. But when man transgressed, he became separated from

his god, and immediately the earth was cursed, and as the rab-

bins express it, the upper springs of heavenly fountains were
stopped, so that the stars did not so abundantly shed down the

spirit of life as they did before, for Adam was cast out of God’s

paradise (the Sun) to dwell (as a banished man) on the cursed

earth, and to eat the cursed bitter fruits thereof, and we must
naturally conceive that the remembrance of the paradise and
the heavenly glittering fruits therein, was most fresh in Adam’s
memory, even as the remembrance of our country will remain

to a banished man. When therefore, he was constrained to

make use of the corruptible fruits of the accursed earth, he must
needs see the difference between them and the fruits of para-

dise, for the paradisiacal light and glory was not in them this
;

recollection we may reasonably conclude made Adam and his

posterity, who were instructed by him, to search diligently if
;

any amongst the fruits and productions of the earth retained

their primitive paradisiacal splendor but when they had done
;

all they could, none such were to be found in all the vegetable

kingdom colors there were, in flowers and fruits, but
; fading

and corruptible, there was no durable light nor shining lustre

in them at last they came to
; search the mineral kingdom, but

God had removed that from their eyes, it was locked up like a

treasure in the bowels of the earth, and they must dig for it,

and with much labor they find it. Then saw they a resemblance
to the first paradisiacal splendor, and that most durable and
incorruptible, having in some measure the primitive glory of

paradise for in gold the fire of heavenly completion abound-
;

eth, and in silver the light, and the like appearance is in all the

inferior metals, though not in the same purity. They also saw
it sparkling in precious stones, as diamonds, rubies, &c. which
made them respect them as certain relics of paradise. But as

gold and silver could be neither eat nor drank, they therefore

labored much to extract the light and tincture out of them,

that they mightfeed on them as on heavenly paradisiacalfood
or essences. This transcendant art they received from God,
and not by any human industry, God having revealed it to them
as a means to prolong life, and by which they lived many hun-
dred years, through the will and providence of God. There-
fore in the first and early times, gold was respected by wise
men for its medicinal qualities (and it is for these ends all true

alchemystical philosophers labor). I cannot pass by a tradition

of Pliny, who mentions that the broth of a hen destroys gold,

if it be boiled in it, and some physicians have affirmed the same
on their own experience, whereupon they prescribe that decoc-

tion as a prime restorative in physic.

The scripture tells us, that God has placed his tabernacle in

the Sun, [the original paradise of Adam] and truly there is

more of the power and majesty of God manifested in the Sun,
than in any other created body, if we consider only the parts of

the great world for we see that when the Sun withdraws
;

from us in the winter time, the life also withdraws with it, and
that many living creatures, as well as the herbs, suffer for that

time, a kind of death. Not in vain then did the magi affirm,

that the anima mundi, or soul of the world, was principally

resident in the Sun for if it be true that where there is life,
;

there must be heat, which no man can deny, then the life of the

world must needs be from whence the heat arises, and ques-

tionless all the heat of this world is derived from the Sun, and
communicated to all other parts, especially to the inferior ele-

ments and likewise in the
; heavens, where we observe the

Moon suffers her monthly change, agony, and as it were death,

by the absence of the Sun from her, for darkness totally pos-
sesses her, and she quite loses her light, and so continues until

the Sun again, who with his excellent brightness and abund-

dance of light illuminates the Moon, filling her with new light

for, from conjunction with the Sun, she appears red and not

unlike the color of heated iron, the Sun having penetrated her
whole substance and infused his tincture into her.

The Sun then stirs up the sadness of > and causes an active

pleasant complexion, which otherwise, without the mixture of

the Sun would be a black melancholy, which is a dangerous

complexion but where Sol and Saturn unite , then there is the
;

true philosophical genius, Sol therefore awakens the vital

spirits, and in all his operations resembles God,for as God hath
the keys of life and death in his hand, and by his sole power
kills and restores; so likewise doth the Sun bear a resemblance
for the Almighty does, as it were, look into this world through
the Sun, [the local residence of the glorified humanity of Jesus

Christ and the original Paradise,] and communicates his good-
ness by the light that is measured and proportioned to our ca-

pacities, who are not able to look on his inexhaustible light,

for “ no man can see him and live.”

&tnu&
? In the heavens is the next beneath the Sun, she is the day

star and rises with him, and likewise she is the evening star

and setteth with the Sun. Life is manifested in Sol and is shed

into all parts of the world, as the life is diffused into all parts of

the body. But the joy and pleasure which ariseth from the life

is manifested in $ , which makes her light more cheerly and
quick than any other stars or planets, for there is in her light

such afreshness, and liveliness, as is beyond expression hence
the Astrologers have acknowledged her the lady of love, and
have made her supreme over all our pleasures.

5 In the heavens represented the subtile vital spirit, and is

therefore seldom separated from the Sun any great distance,

keeping always in his beards, even as the vital spirit accom-
panieth the soul.

D In the heavens signifies the sensual soul, for though the

Moon puts on the image of the Sun and is full of light, and
hath a true heavenly complexion, yet by and by she loses all

her light, becomes dark, and puts on the image of the Earth ;

even so doth the animal soul, for one while she adheres to the

image of God and is full of heavenly thoughts and desires, and
in an instant she adheres to the flesh and is full of sinful affec-

tions and thus she falls and rises, rises and falls again, in a
;

perpetual course of revolution, so that the most righteous here

on earth are subject to these failings, for they wax and wane,
in evil and good dispositions though they are the children

;

of the light, yet have they their spots and eclipses, which makes
the Scriptures describe the church triumphant, as a woman that

hath the Moon under her feet, for, in that glorious church in

heaven, we shall be no more subject to such inconstancy but
;

shall trample the Moon under our feet, and be like the Sun, pe-

netrated through and through with light, splendor, glory, and
majesty and consequently free from every degree of darkness.
