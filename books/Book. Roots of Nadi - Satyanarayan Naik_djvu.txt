Prologue 



Informative articles on Naadi have flooded the internet and 
many authors have come up with Naadi books with different 
titles which contain either the material from Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 
or some stellar based system. 

My books on Naadi Astrology like Revelation from Naadi 
jyotisha, Orbital Providence, Celestial Matrix, and Prashna Hora 
are research based works on Bhrighu Nandi Naadi and Kasyapa 
Hora. 

There are other good works under Naadi system. In order 
to organize these works with workable principles which will be 
helpful for those who wants to do further research in application 
of these Naadi principles, I have ventured into bringing out all 
of them in one volume. 

Satyacharya's Dhruva Naadi, Stellar Based astrological works 
by scholars like Late Sri. H.S. Seshadri Iyer, Sri. R.Gopalakrishna 
Row, Sri N V Raghava Charry, Late professor K S Krishnamurti's 
stellar astrology and of-course the Bhrighu Nandi Naadi principles 
are included in this work. 

Utmost importance is given to explain workable principles 
of different Naadi systems and their method of application. 
Therefore, this volume does not repeat the fundamentals 
explained. 

I am thankful to Sagar publications for being instrumental 
in bringing this work. 

We as a team dedicate this work to Late Sri R G Rao 
the legend living in the hearts of Naadi Astrological 
fraternity

Roots of Naadi Astrology 
Introduction 



There are various types of Naadi granthas. Chandra Kala 
Naadi, Dhruva Naadi, Bhrigu Naadi, Nandi Naadi, Saptarishi 
Naadi, Vidyamadhaveeyam, Kakabhujandar Naadi, Guru Naadi, 
Buddha Naadi, Surya Naadi, Kapila Naadi, Vashistha Naadi, 
Shukra Naadi, Saptarishi Naadi and Pushya Naadi. Some of them 
are in different libraries or with traditional families in south India 
and North India. 

These Naadi systems have five different methods of giving 
readings. One set of granthas relates reading based on 
horoscopes with divisional reference points as with Dhruva Naadi, 
Chandra kala Naadi. Another set of Naadi goes with the stellar 
division which has some basis in Vidya Madhavaveeyam. Yet 
another set of reading is based on signification of planets with 
or without relating to Dasha bhukti like Nandi Naadi and Bhrigu 
Naadi. One more set is called Mantra Naadi which has some 
occult interference in reading through the palm leaves. Very 
rarely I have come across a Naadi reader having this mantra 
Naadi. However, some Naadi palm leaves and old scripts are 
available in the south Indian and North Indian libraries. Most of 
them are in Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada languages. 
The 5 th one is Naadi reading based on thumb impression index 
and identifying the palm leaf having the whole life reading 
including the names of relatives. This has become famous across 
the world over two decades. Originally this was restricted in 
and around Chidambaram and some places in Tamil Naadu. 
Now we can find branched out readers across the word and in 
every city there are number of such Naadi centers. 



x Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

There are number of articles on this type of Naadi, many 
giving their experiences hosted on the internet. There are 
arguments for and against the thumb impression Naadi system. 
Foreigners who visited Chidambaram have recorded their 
experiences and opinions. Many Indian scholars like Dr. B.V. 
Raman, Sri C.G. Rajan Sri. Santanam, Sri. C.S.Patel and some 
scholars from Andhra and Karnataka have also experimented 
with this system and have documented their experiences. 

There are recorded instances about the experience of the 
legend Dr. B. V. Raman who encountered certain Mantra Naadi 
exponent having the Guru Naadi palm leaves. He exhibited an 
empty palm leaf witnessed by Dr. Raman. With closed eyes 
certain mantras were recited and when eyes were opened the 
empty leaf had written messages in Kannada, a south Indian 
language. Again mantras were recited with closed eyes and 
they turned into another south Indian language Tamil. It is learnt 
that this Naadi reader explained niceties of this system of Naadi. 
Dr. Raman had also experience of another Naadi called Agastyar 
Naadi by which the exponent used the thumb impression of Dr. 
Raman and predicted certain events which came true. It is learnt 
Dr. Raman's group has a copy of Dhruva Naadi. 

Naadi in Sanskrit means, any tube or pipe, son of nada, 
vein, any tubular organ of the body, Nerve, pulse, box of a 
wheel, tubular stalk or any plant or any tubular organ, artery, 
deception, sort of bent grass, any hole or crevice, flute, strap of 
leather, any pipe or tube, juggling trick, thong, 

Naadika means osmium sanctum, any tubular organ, hollow 
stalk, and another pot-herb, windpipe or throat, trachea. 

In Muhurtha, Naadika is half of Muhurtha that is 24 minutes. 
In Naadi astrology possibly the meaning of pulse, or the box of 
a wheel, that is out of 12 zodiac sign wheel, a sign is considered 
as a box, or the juggling trick, or a string, or cord ( that is 
thong), or 24 minutes of Muhurtha, might have been attributed 
to word Naadi. It also means the subtle channels in the body. 



Roots of Naadi Astrology Introduction x! 



In Tamil the word Naadi gives many expressions such as "Search" 
or search of existence, search of past. 

Recordings of human life predictions by Rishis Bhrigu, 
Angirasa, Atri, Viswamitra, Kashyapa, Vashistha and Agastya 
are known as Naadi, How they recorded the destinies of human 
race including those yet to born is a million dollar question yet 
to be answered. The personal experience of Dr. Raman about 
the changing contents in a palm leaf is an astonishing 
phenomenon for which no answer can be found within the frame 
work of science which has limited resources. Writings of rishis 
are not only confined to Astrology, but also include medical 
science, Yoga, Metaphysical life, and Occult science. Whether 
these subjects also have sirtiilar magical powers to situational 
changes with regard to content and languages? I have no 
evidential research findings on this aspect. 

Contents of Palm leaf if written by Rishis in Sanskrit, which 
is evident from the libraries having some of the original works 
on Naadi, then the Naadi which books are in Tamil, Telugu and 
Kannada or Hindi must have been translated at a later date. 

Even these translated versions are also in palm leaf that 
means they date back to an era when paper was not in use for 
writing. In 2 nd century BC China has the archeological record of 
fragments of paper making. That means these translations 
should have taken place before 2 nd century BC. The 
earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero 
stones date from around the 3rd century BCE. The Sangam 
literature dates back from the 300 BCE. Tamil language history 
has been classified into three categories attested by scholarly 
research. Old Tamil dates back between 300 BCE - 700 CE, 
Middle Tamil dates back between 700-1600 and Modern Tamil 
dates between 1600-to date. Since the language of Tamil used 
is very old it can be traced between 300 BCE - 700 CE and 
therefore these palm leaves must belong to this period when 
paper was not in use. 



xii_ Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Prior use of written language, the subject Naadi was taught 
orally to the disciples. Later on some of them have been 
transcribed .in to vernacular on palm leaves. That's how the 
"taala-patra granthas"came into existence. The wonder incident 
that Dr. Raman experienced where the blank palm leaf converted 
into contents and then changing in the choosen language 
languages endorses the miraculous powers of transcribers. Such 
occult powers which are flowing through the palm leaves till 
recent centuries cannot be ruled out based on our limited 
perception levels framed in modern scientific outlook. There 
are others who had wonderful experiences with regard to Naadi 
reading. One of the famous Astrologer and an advocate by 
profession vouchsafed similar experience with little variations. 
He was dumbstruck when the Naadi reader said in Tamil 
"Kumbha lagnathil kelvikaaran..."(The person born in Kumbha 
Lagna is waiting for reading). 

To record description and events of generations in coded 
language on Talapatra bundles there must be a secret key which 
is known only to these traditional Naadi readers. The original 
Sanskrit contents were transformed into many regional 
languages like Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi. 
Segregated regionally, the collection of talapatra granthas run 
in to thousands which are by legacy possessed by the Naadi 
readers. These Granthas include Agastya Naadi, Brighu Naadi, 
Brahma Naadi, Shiva Naadi, Kaushika Naadi, Kashyapa Naadi 
etc. 

Unfortunately some of these great works were lost due to 
destruction of the talapatra and some have been lost due to 
negligence of people who did not realize the importance of these 
granthas. During 10 th and 12 th century AD kings of Chola dynasty 
helped to preserve these granthas duly classified and kept in 
the library of Tanjore in Tamil "naadu. 

The rich knowledge data base of Indian heritage suffered 
destruction due to invasion of Mughals and British. Mughals 
ruthlessly burnt most of the materials and nonetheless English 
men transported many Naadi granthas to Britain. However they

did not destroy it but sold most of them "to those connected 
with astrology. Some community hailing from Chidambaram has 
brought them. This Vallavar community settled down around 
Vaitheeshwaran Koil in Tamil Naadu which is now famous for 
Naadi readers- It is learnt that Lord Kartikeya is the key diety 
who is changed to protect these granthas. The planet Mars is 
attributed to Lord Kartikeya and this place is especially auspicious 
to ward of evils of planet Mars. 

The Map of Tamil Nadu is appended below marking 
Chidambaram.

The entire area is covered by many Naadi readers where in 
the Naadi granthas are under protection of Lord Shiva and 
Kartikeya. All of them follow a typicaf methodology of taking 
thumb impression, finding the index bundle then getting 
confirmation of events and later on gives general reading. These 
Naadi readers need not have any astrological background. Some 
of them even do not know how to draw a chart. They just know 
how to interpret the poetic coded language from the palm leaf. 
In the normal course if they get right bundle of leaves they can 
uninterruptedly read the past present future and also suggest 
remedies. If they encounter a palm of incomplete information 
or mismatch of events they stop reading. 



xiv Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

It is learnt that unless a person approach the reader with 
due respect to the knowledge and to the place of worship, the 
person will not get right readings or even find a relevant leaf. 
Mostly with faithless approach you are bound to land in front of 
a wrong interpreter. There is also myth about time of meeting 
the Naadi reader. If you approach a Naadi reader on a wrong 
Muhurtha you may get irrelevant readings or readings of 
displeasure. I have experiences of various persons who have 
gone there and returned with displeasure of having not found 
their leaf. Some were given wrong readings about future. But 
there are instances where every bit of life matched with that of 
reading. 

The first step in these Naadi methodologies is taking the 
thumb impression. For male the right hand thumb impression 
is taken and for female it is left hand. From 1008 types of thumb 
impression coded in Naadi granthas the impression of the 
consultant has to be segregated and matched with the batch of 
Naadi bundle related to the life readings. 

This establishes the fact that there is a relation between 
lines on the hand and the Naadi system of reading. In other 
words palmistry is also a part of Naadi reading. 

Once the right leaf is found then you will have different 
sections belonging to your life. They are called Kandams. This 
is more or less the regular reading of a horoscope based on 12 
houses. 

In Kandam one, many matters of general nature including 
the parental, spousal, siblings and progeny details are covered 
at times with their perfect names. It will have a general reading 
of all the houses with regard to past present and future. If 
requested specific reading of a Kandam will be read at an extra 
cost for each Kandam. 

The v 2 nd Kandam contains readings of second house of 
horoscope which generally covers the matters relating to Wealth, 
Family, and Education etc. 

The 3 rd Kandam reads about Siblings and Communications. 



Roots of Naadi Astrology Introduction xv 



4 th house matters like property, happiness and mother are 
covered in the 4 th Kandam. 

The 5 th Kandam covers the higher knowledge, Progeny and 
Its positive and negative aspects. 

Diseases, debts and enmity factors are covered in 6 th 
Kandam. 

Kandam seven reads about marital life and related matters 

Kandam 8 is about eighth house covering Dangers, 
difficulties and Longevity matters. 

Spiritual matters, fortune and endowment and father are 
covered in 9 th Kandam 

10 th house Karma, in material concept profession and 
business are covered in 10 th Kandam 

Second marriage, gains and loss factors are read through 
11 th Kandam 

Twelfth house matters like foreign journey, loss, 
emancipation and next birth are read through 12 th Kandam, 

Up to this the procedure is just like that of custom horoscope 
readings covering 12 houses. 

Normally a horoscope of the person is also given in writing 
in Tamil language marking Lagna and planetary positions. 
However this does not match always with that of horoscope 
erected by modern methodology as these Naadi horoscopes 
are based on Vakya panchangam where in the ayanamsha differs. 

The system described upto this level of horoscope based 
on the 12 houses, most of the reading given by the Naadi readers 
tally exactly when the Saturn in the horoscope is rotated in 
every sign and taking the planets posited in 2, 12 and 7 th houses 
and matching the significations of planets with regard to 
transiting Saturn. This system is from Nandi Naadi and Bhrigu 
Naadi decoded by an eminent Astrologer Late Sri R.G. Rao of 
Bangalore and is discussed in subsequent chapters.

Incidentally the scribe has a practical episode narrated by 
his friend Mr. R.Narasimha Murthy who visited Chidambaram. 

He met a Naadi reder from Agastya Naadi center at 
Vaideeswaran koil during 1977. He was asked to give his thumb 
impression. The reader searched for the relavent index bundle. 
After several attempts he could find bundle related to Narasimha 
Murthy, Many questions were asked and the bundles were 
disposed when not matched. In the last bundle the following 
question and answer session tookplace. 

Reader: Your father is a singer 

Narasimha Murthy: Yes 

Reader: Your father suffered family problems 

Narasimha Murthy: Yes 

Reader: Your's is case of dual marriage 

Narasimha Murthy: Yes 

Reader; Your father's name belongs to Vishnu and Lakshmi 
or it may relate to soorya 

Narasimha Murthy: Can you be more specific 

Reader: It may start with Female goddess Lakshmi or Rama 
devi 

Narasimha Murthy : Yes his first name is Rama 

Reader: Then the second part of the name may relate to 

Soorya 

Narasimha Murthy: Yes to a certain extent it may tally 
because the sencond part is Kantha 

Reader: That is.Ramakantha is the name of your father 
but he must have one more name attached to it which may 
relate to Vishnu or Narayana. 

Narasimha Murthy: Yes his name is Ramakanth 
Purandara.

Reader : Ok the leaf belongs to you. What to do you want 
me to read: sepcific kanda or general reading? 

Narasimha Murthy: General reading is enough for the 
time being. Can you give me my horoscope: 

Reader: Ok I will write and give you: Then I will give 
general discription of your life. 

The following is the horoscope given by the Naadi reader in 
Tamil. Astonishigly though no date of birth was asked, and none 
of the confirmation question relates to any clue towards date of 
birth the reader produced the horoscope which is given below:

He gave the following reading: 

Your father had to go in for a second marriage and this has 
the effect on your marital life also. Your first wife is not surviving 
at this time of consultation and she has left two children for 
you. Prior to your second marriage the bride had some 
relationship problems. You must have had some accident due 
to which you suffered injuries to head and foot which has resulted 
difference in your gait. You had troubled education and might 
have discontinued the education. Your professional life is also 
not settled till date. After 40 years of your age things start 
progressively beneficial and your profession will relate to 
accounting but you will not continue the same and you will 
settle down in some cinema or TV related firms and will have 



xviii Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



some technical experience. From 44 th year onwards you may 
settle down with good earnings and even you may have your 
own business with the help of your friends and relatives. Children 
born to your first wife will be away from you and suffer troubles. 
You may suffer due to your second marriage. The general reading 
of Naadi ends here as lord Murugan has stopped the reading 
and advised remedial measures: Do you want me to read the 
remedial palm leaf? 

Narasimha Murthy: No not at this juncture I shall visit 

again. 

Couple of years after this incident Narasimha Murthy met 
me and narrated the entire episode and he wanted some 
clarification regarding profession. Computer generated birth 
chart is given below. His date of birth is 18/11/1938 at 6 am at 
Hyderabad.

He then produced the horoscope given by the Naadi reader 
in an exercise book it was in Tamil as shown above. Since he 
has explained me about his experience as detailed above, I was 
astonished to see the correctness of the horoscope given by 
the Naadi reader and the one generated by me. The occult 
power hidden in Naadi granthas is fabulous. As a matter of fact 
I follow the Rao's system of Naadi astrology based on Bhrigu 
Naadi Naadi. I started to study his horoscope. Transit Saturn 
was about to come to Libra and I told him his career progress 



Roofs of Naadi Astrology Introduction xix- 

will commence shortly and you may even start your own, I also 
indicated the problems of first wife born children and also about 
the problems facing with his second wife. I suggested some 
remedial measures. Incidentally he told me that he had contacted 
Sri R.G. Rao in Bangalore and more or less the prediction read 
out by him also similar to what the Naadi reader as said and 
some of which the scribe predicted now. He told me that his 
horoscope matches with one of the horoscopes in Bhrighu Nandi 
Naadi in Kannada. The scribe took out the book and searched 
as this book contained horoscopes for period between 1889 
and 1980. I found on page 229 a horoscope numbered 180 
which exactly matched. The following is the reading and its 
comparison with facts. 

Bhrigu Nandi Naadi contents for this horoscope: 

The person is divine contemplative. He has the nature of 
helping others. His father is an intelligent person and a musician. 
But his father is deprived of family happiness. Moon if posited 
between Taurus and Virgo the father will have dual marital affairs 
but if Moon is in Virgo, the native will have dual marriage. Native 
will have two children a male and a female from his first wife 
and she will end her life after that. Native will go for second 
marriage. Unfortunately the second wife prior to marriage had 
an affair with a low class person who commits suicide after she 
gets married to this native. Due to aspect of Mars on Saturn 
having Ketu approaching and having link of Jupiter, the person 
will have different gait due to functional defect in the feet. 

(Fact: I cannot call him an atheist but he was normal just 
like others to perform a few minutes Pooja at home and visit 
temples once in a while. Helping nature was only a thought 
process in him and never was it practical. His father was a vocal 
singer but not a celebrity. There was not much unhappiness in 
his father's marital life nor did he have dual marriage. Native 
had to go in for second marriage. The second wife might have 
had some affair before marriage but there is no information 
about involvement of a low class person in her life and ending 
his life after her marriage.) 



xx Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

The children born to first wife will undergo difficulties and 
will not have harmonious relation with the second wife of native. 
However after 18 years of age they will see prosperity. From 
the second marriage the native will get one male child physically 
handicapped and will have miscarriage and then a female child 
having disease relating to Vayu. 

(The fact: As said the children of first wife did not have 
harmonious relationship with the second wife of the native. 
However he had one child from the second wife and one 
miscarriage. The male child born is healthy. The children born 
to first wife progressively settled in their education and 
professional career). 

Mercury signifying education is with Sun and Venus is also 
under the sway of Saturn and Ketu which indicates break in 
education. But there is an exchange of Jupiter by which Jupiter 
will help Mercury to get knowledge in shadow related technical 
learning. This is due to the fact that Jupiter from his original 
position links to Rahu and then when get exchanged he gets 
the link of Moo, Mars, Venus Sun and Mercury. 

Professionally he had to suffer a lot and struggle for a square 
meal this is due to effect of Mars Moon and Ketu on Saturn. Up 
to the age of 44-45 he will not settle down in any profession. 
He may do odd jobs relating to accounts and shifts many jobs 
of similar nature. At the age of 44 he will get into a job relating 
to light and shadow. Later he will also own a business relating 
to that which will also have some technical nature. He will involve 
his brother in the business and take help from others for this 
business. Up till 60 years there will be prosperity. 

(Facts regarding education and profession: His School 
education suffered and he was a dropout. Luckily he had an 
opportunity of doing a diploma course in accounting from Pune 
for which minimum education was only 8 th or 9 th standared. 
This diploma is recognized by other Universities as equal to 
their Intermediate education. After this he started working in 
private firms as accounting clerk. He could not stick to one 
organization and moved to different places doing the same job. 



Roots of Naadi Astrology Introduction xxi 



He went to Pune and started working in an organization having 
night shifts. During that period he went to film institute in Pune 
and got an admission for film photography course. He was 28 
years of age when he did that course. After that he left the job 
in Pune and came back to Hyderabad. He tried his level best to 
become a cameraman but all his trials failed. He was doing 
some part time job in some company to earn his bread. He 
struggled for many years to meet the two ends. He lost his wife 
during that period leaving two children. It was difficult for him 
to concentrate on professional life due to taking care of his 
children. He decided to go for a second marriage. He found a 
desperate family to settle a match for their daughter. He married 
her. She was adamant and self-centered and due to this the 
two children could not get the right care. The purpose of second 
marriage at one side of it failed. He lodged them in a hostel. 10 
years from this time was a hell for him as his earnings were 
meager and he was doing odd jobs in firms and he was also 
doing some commission jobs for photographic studios for 
arranging different functions to them. Somehow he made some 
money and changed the idea of becoming a photographer. He 
accumulated some money and bought a film Camera equipment. 
He started lending it on rental basis. His earnings increased 
and he further invested on equipment and accessories. His 
professional life got settled.) 

His second wife will physically handle him by hitting on his 
head and the native will go unconscious. He will not have 
happiness from the second marriage. 

(The fact: No doubt the lady is self-centered and 
concentrated only on her son and herself. She was short 
tempered and quarrel some in many aspects and eccentric. 
This normally would take place when this man gets drunk and 
wastes money on entertaining his friends with parties. However 
never ever she raised her hand on him; instead it was reverse 
case. In drunken mood several time he slapped her) 

From 45 th year till 60 th year he will see fortune and enjoy 
life. This commences when Saturn transiting in Libra. 



xxii Roots of Naadi Astrology; A Comprehensive Study 



(Fact: from 1984 he was doing well in his business in leasing 
out Cinema equipment. He enjoyed the life very well. His 
business went on well and made money upto 2002.) 

In 2004 he breathed his last due to diabetic effect 
on heart and brain. 

There are many matters which exactly tally with the reading 
of Naadi when the same were compared and read with the 
rules of BhriguNandi Naadi of Sri. R.G. Rao. Some of my friends 
who visited thumb Naadi reader and got their horoscopes were 
studied by applying the R.G.Rao principles. Sri R.G.Rao has 
done extensive research on the delineations of horoscopes from 
Bhrigu and Nandi Naadi. In these works only the results were 
given for each horoscope and the reasons were scarcely given. 
Sri R.G. Rao with his efforts zeroed in the key factor behind 
these results. He found out that the entire predictions were 
based on the Karakatwa of Planets and their combination in the 
chart. In his book "Bhrigu Nandi Naadi" he has applied his 
principles of combination of planets and given 500 horoscopes. 
His system was totally deviating from the traditional house 
system hence this book was not received well in the beginning. 
In his later works he clarified the principles elaborately. However, 
still his system was not acceptable in the traditional circle. My 
research on his works and I consolidated the method of Sri. 
R.G. Rao and came out with a structured approach in my book 
"Prediction secrets Naadi astrology" and further modified in the 
next work "Revelation from Naadi Jyotisha", Orbital providence, 
Celestial Matrix and Prashna Hora. Having seen the accuracy 
percentage of this system many astrologers shifted to R.G. Rao's 
system. There are many who even wrote articles and books on 
Naadi claiming their individual credits or inherited credits. 
However the credit of inventing the methodology of analysis 
definitely goes to Late Sri R.G. Rao. 

Based on my experience with these principles, some of the 
horoscopes belonging to my friends who have had the experience 
from thumb Naadi and got their horoscopes written in a book 
were put to experiment. 



Roots of Naadi Astrology Introduction xxii! 



In the thumb Naadi most of the past events tallied and as 
far as future predictions some have tallied and some failed 
miserably. When these horoscopes were studied with the Rao's 
method, 90% of future results came true. I found the reason 
for failure in thumb Naadi readings where in the results were 
mostly based on Saturn rotation and therefore most of the past 
results exactly tallied. They used Saturn for future results and 
presumably missed the rotation of Jupiter, Rahu and Ketu in 
transit rotation. But when I rotated Jupiter, Rahu and Ketu along 
with Saturn, results relating to Marriage, Health, Profession, 
Progeny and many more exactly matched and I got the 
confirmation for future readings also. 

With more charts coming to me I have zeroed is on the 
methodology used by Palm leaf contents which the Naadi reader 
spells out and it is mostly based on Saturn rotation. This may 
be one factor of the truth. However it worked on many charts 
brought by friends who visited Naadi centers. Logic here is Saturn 
is karma karaka who gives the results of past karma. Therefore, 
it is but natural that the past predictions tally. It is the Jupiter, 
the present living factor, who when encounters Karma becomes 
future karma. Similarly every planet has to be moved as different 
segments of life to understand the effects of future with regard 
to their signification. In the "Brighu Nandi Naadi" section I will 
deal in detail about the principles and the methodology of Late 
Sri R.G. Rao. 

The whole wonder is these 12 Kandams which closely relates . 
to 12 houses counted from Lagna seems to have no signification 
as none of the readings, the Dasha bhukti factors are considered. 
Only the age factor is mentioned. What I construed then is that 
these 12 Kandams are relatively structured based on the 
signification of planets. For example to know about health and 
personality matters, the Jupiter and Sun links are taken into 
consideration, for 2 nd house and 7 th house matter the Venus or 
Mars is considered for 3 rd house matters Mars and Mercury are 
considered. For 4 th house Moon, Ven, Mar, for 5 th house, Sun 
and Venus are considered, for 6 th & 8 th house matters, Mars, 



xxiv Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Moon, Rahu and Ketu are considered. For 9 th house Sun, Venus 
are considered , 10 th house linked to Saturn, 11 th house linked 
to Ven, Jup, Mer and 12 th house Ketu, Saturn and Jupiter are 
taken into consideration. 

In several cases such experiments yielded satisfactory results 
yet we cannot confirm this is the only key adopted in Naadi 
readings. Once again the occult powers referred in earlier 
paragraphs restrict our experimental curiosity. There are cases 
of astonishing predictions from Naadi palm leaves which cannot 
be attributed to any system of horoscope analysis. Definitely 
there must be some wavelength which is prevalent in heritage 
of Naadi community. 

There other Kandams in this Naadi system. 

Shanti Kandam: This is similar to past life regression; where 
in the sins committed in past has to be relieved by performing 
certain rituals. Rightly accepted in literal sense but greed grown 
giant will interpret differently and corrupt the originals for 
personal gains. Cautiously getting read this Kandam and not 
yielding to titanic demands, they can be consulted elsewhere 
for proper remedies. Usually Navagraha and their adhi devata 
and pratyadhi devata propitiations with proper Dana prakriya 
will suffice to clear many maladies. 

Deeksha Kandam: In this Kandam initiation of a secret 
knowledge will be given which will help to use right mantras for 
protection and prosperity. This Kanda cannot be independently 
read and performed. This has pre-condition that the Shanti 
Kandam rituals must be completed. This is the crux of the 
intention of materialistic gains for Naadi community. Because I 
have personally seen umpteen cases at Chidambaram where 
the chief Naadi reader demands golden idols with a specific 
weight, golden bangles, or golden coins etched with certain 
Yantra etc. In some cases they demand groceries, worth 
thousands of rupees. Some of them even read out in the palm 
leaf a certain amount to be paid to the Naadi reader as parihara. 



Roots of Naadi Astrology Introduction xxv 



Aushadha Kandam: This refers to healing diseases with 
herbs. 

I have no idea about how this is read and its efficacy and 
have no comments. 

Next is Dasha Bhukti Kandam. It is difficult to understand 
what type of Dasha they use and what they delineate because 
if a person makes them to read all twelve Kandams he will have 
covered all the matters of life as the events are time based age 
factor. 

Since I have not come across any experienced person on 
this issue I reserve my comment. 

Much has been written about the Naadi systems with varied 
opinions and arguments for and against, Yet this peculiar 
methodology is a traditional secret. Centuries down the lane 
eminent personalities of astrological fraternity have been 
discussing Naadi astrology. Though I have reservations in 
discussing this methodology of Naadi Astrology, I have tried my 
level best to give some clues regarding this methodology with 
due respect to my friends who shared their experiences with 
me and my own experiences during research stay over a period 
of 5 months at Chidambaram. 

When I was asked to write about Naadi in detail reluctantly 
I accepted because, unfortunately there are no sufficient material 
to support a particular methodology which I can share with 
regard to great works like Dhruva Naadi (not of Satyacharya), 
Saptarishi Naadi or for that matter any of the above Naadi 
granthas in their original formats. Translated versions Satya 
Jaataka (Dhruva naadi) of sage Satyacharya, Chandra Kala Naadi 
some portions from Saptarishi Naadi and Bhrighu Naadi of Sri R 
G. Rao of Bangalore, are with me in both English Kannada 
versions. Modern works from scholarly authors like Sri H R 
Seshadri Iyer, Sri R Gopala Krishna Row, Sri N V Raghava Chary 
and Sri K S KrishnaMurthy, deals with stellar system which is 
the base for Naadi systems. 



xxvi Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

From the first set of classical works I have tried to pick up 
the main theme and explain the principles in more lucid manner 
especially with Dhruva Naadi. From Chandrakala Naadi I have 
picked up general principles applicable in traditional astrology. 
Saptarishi Naadi has only predictions and does not have any 
adoptable principles. Sri J. N, Bhasin's book under the same 
title contains a few horoscopes for six ascendants with principles 
derived from his and adopted to support the delineations. Either 
I have to reproduce a few from his book with his point of view 
of prediction or include a few horoscopes from the version which 
I am having with my personal hypothetical formule to support 
the predictions. In both the cases it will not be of any help to 
reader. I prefer to skip this. 

From the second set of modern scholarly works, I restricted 
myself to pick up the main principles and explain them with 
examples at right places. In many sections I have also introduced 
my research materials. I have presented the gist of these works 
in a structured method establishing there applicability and also 
offered my opinion on several points. In this section the work is 
classified into two groups as follows: 

CLASSICAL NAADI SYSTEMS 

a) Principles of Dhruva Naadi 

b) Selected rules from Chandra Kala Naadi 

c) Principles and application of Bhrigu Nandi Naadi 
STELLAR BASED NAADI 

a) Stellar Based Naadi System - Iyer's Method-1 

b) Stellar Based Naadi System - Meena's Method-2 

c) Stellar Based Naadi System - Krishnmurthy's Method-3 

Bowing my head to Rishis, I offer this this work as a tribute 
to all those legends who gave such wonderful works for the 
astrological fraternity.

What You Read 



In the introduction of Roots of Naadi Astrology, essence of 
Palm leaf naadi systems are discussed with authenticated 
experiences of great personalities like Sri B.V. Raman besides 
an interesting case study of the friend of the scribe. This contains 
the details of 12 kandams and the methodology of Naadi readers 
situated across the world. At the end the subject selection and 
organisation of this book is given. Now summrising each method, 
I wish to give a summary of what you gain: 

By the Prninciple of Dhruva Naadi: 
A. Determination of fortune: 

a. The Lord of Lagna (Lagnadhipathi) 

b. Navamsa sign lord where Lagna falls in Navamsa 

c. Star lord of the birth Star of Moon or Ascendant 
whichever is stronger (Janma nakshatridhipati) (Same 
lord can also appear as sign lord) 

d. Dispositor of the above (sign lord where these lords 
are posited in Rashi chart) Compute strength of the 
above planets according to Shadbala. The computation 
of d, is the extended strength or weakness of 
Dispositor who will decide the ultimate strength of 
the Planets in a, b, c. If the Dispositor gets minimum 
strength, then the planet gets supported. If the 
Dispositor becomes weak, the planet gets weak. 

e. If all the 3 planets gets more than stipulated shadbala 
and their Dispositor also gets minimum required 
shadbala, then the Native will have excellent fortune. 



xxviii Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

f. If any 2 planets and their Dispositor gain full strength 
as above the native will be in a good status and position 

g. If only one planet along with Dispositor gain strength 
the native will be have average position 

h. If all 3 of them along with their Dispositor are weak 
the native will have poor yoga (difficulties in life) 

B. Pancha Siddhantika 

1. Grahasheela 

2. Karaka 

3. Nakshatra 

4. Vargottama 

5. Adhipatya 

In grahasheela you get detailed account of planetry 
significations especially their natural signfications which is the 
basis for any system of analysis. 

Karaka Siddhanta explains the significations of planets that 
are empowered to give during their Dasha periods based on 
their strengths. 

Nakshatra Siddhanta is the most important deviation you 
find and needs logical application particularly in Dasha system 
and Bhava analysis. 

Vargottama Siddhanta is again a planetary strength matter 
and Adhipatya siddanta is about the capabilities of lords of 
houses. 

By the Prninciple of Chandra Kala Naadi 

Selected rules which are universally applicable to traditional 
method of astrology are given. 



Wha t You Read xxix 

By the Principle of Bhrighu Nandr Naadi 

You will understand the diffrence between the traditional 
astrology and the prediction secrets hidden in Bhrighu Nandi 
Naadi in which only Sign and Planetary signfictions are used for 
studying the chart. This is a powerful method of prediction. It 
has simple rules but needs lots of practice to devleop the logic 
to study the horoscope in detail. If a person is a saadhaka 
(especially of Navagrahas) then this system works wonders for 
him. 

Unfortunately this system founded by late Sri R.G. Rao was 
pushed aside for quite long period by the so called stalwarts of 
tradtional astrology as it does not consider Lagna for prediciton. 
Even now many of them do not accept it as a system of prediciton 
though they use this system internallly for their commerical use 
and externally claim the credit thorugh traditional method. Some 
of them claim that they have better Naadi seecrets and consider 
Late R.G.Rao's system as just one drop out of the ocean of 
knowledge they have which neither they teach to others nor 
publish it as workable systems. 

No matter what others claim, there are umpteen number 
of disciples of Sri R.G. Rao, some of them are Ekalavyas but 
have mastered the subject and give excellent prediciton. 

The scribe conducts classes regularly on Naadi, traditon 
and KP systems and train students in live prediction methods. 

Stellar system: 

Tithi Vara and Yoga in predictive system: 

Late Sri H.S, Sheshadri Iyer introduced Vara, thiti and yoga 
in his systme with his intellgently woven system of yoga avayoga 
and the Dasha analysis. Yes, there are really good workable 
points that can be applied to in traditioal analysis and being a 
system which brings in deviation and divisional effects involging 
Nakshatra it is considered as Naadi system. 



xxx Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Meena system: 

This is a pure Nakshatra system where the point of focus is 
on that a planet gives the results of the Planet in whose nakshatra 
it is placed. One of the other interesting factor is about Jeeva 
and Sareera concepet basing it on Nakshtra. The authors have 
focused mainly on these two points. These two points can be 
taken up while traditionally analysing the horoscopes for better 
results. 

Krishnamurti Paddhati 

This system is well known across the world due to its 
sturctured approach. Like in every system this system has also 
certain unfocused issues, but largly it is claimed to be a successful 
predictive tool. The fact is it has used the exisiting calculation 
of Nakshatra dasha and bhukti of Parasara and super imposed 
its digital configurations in a blank chart renaming them as Star 
and Sub. The marvel of Professor Krishnamurti is bringing Naadi 
Karakatwa combination in these divisions of signs, star and sub. 
Amazingly these 249 subs through signs and its star denoting 
results of these plantary signficaitons is sufficient to predict 
answers to question when the person asking question indictes 
a number for his quesiton. However there is a system of Prashna 
Paddhati introduced seperately. Focused on the Sub and star 
using essentials from traditional astrology this system is 
appreciably an essential tool for prediciton.

Classical Naadi System 

Dhruva Naadi based 
Satya Jaataka 

Section I 



In thumb Naadi though there is a mention of Dasha Bhukti 
in Palm leaf reading which comes at the end of Kandam, in 
general reading of any Kandam, the reader points out the events 
that happen at particular age. This is the clue that this system 
of analysis is not entirely based on Parasara methods. Even if it 
is construed that they are reading only Bhava Phala, the timing 
factor is not attached to Bhava Phala as per Parasara or by any 
allied works like Jaataka Chandrika, Phala Deepika etc. Again 
considering results declared at certain ages due to unique 
planetary combinations is independent of its nature and irrelevant 
to house matters. 

Therefore any other method deviating from the standard 
principles of Parasara, Jaimini & Tajika is considered as Naadi. 
This is the only best logic by which I can differentiate between 
Naadi and Traditional astrology. Dhruva Naadi or Satya Jaataka 
has many such deviations and therefore it is called Naadi. This 
scholarly work has delightful astrological matrix that would give 
a splendorous experience to the reader. 

Birth epoch 

Sage prescribes three birth epochs to consider the planetary 
influences on the native. First is the time of conception, second 
the appearance of the head at the Vagina of the mother of 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



native, third is when the child falls out completely and touches 
ground. There is no way to record first two epochs especially in 
the modern conditions. The third one is normally considered 
for astrological recordings. 

To Decide the Birth star: 

Traditionally it is the practice to take the star in which Moon 
is located at the time of birth as birth star. Predictive part 
especially the Dasha readings in this work are based on the 
correct selection of birth star. Therefore, Sage suggests the 
following alternates to decide the correct birth star. 

The 27 Stars are grouped into 9 segments consisting of 3 
stars as a set governed by a planet 



Aswini-Makha-Moola 


Governed by KET 


Bharani-Pubba-P.Ashada 


Governed by VEN 


Krittika-Uttara-U.Ashada 


Governed by SUN 


Rohini-Hasta-Shravana 


Governed by MOO 


Mrigasira-Chitta-Dhanishta 


Governed by MAR 


Aridra-Swati-Satabisa 


Governed by RAH 


P-vasu-Visakha-P.Bhadra 


Governed byJUP 


PusyamhAnurada-U.Bhadra 


Governed by SAT 


Aslesha-Jyeshta-Revathi 


Governed by MER 



This is also the order of Dasha periods for the persons born 
on these Nakshatra which is called birth star. 

Keeping the Dasha order based on star in which Moon is 
present at the time of birth, selection of actual birth star is 
based on the strength of star assessed as follows: 

Judge the Shadbala of the following: 

A. Planet represented by the Star where the Moon is posited 
at the time of birth 

B. Planet represented by the Star where the Ascendant degrees 
fall in a sign. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 



The Star represented by the strongest planet out of Moon 
and Lagna planet will be treated as Birth star. 

Any subject will be clearer when illustrated with example. 
So I take an example horoscope and maintain it as standard 
horoscope throughout and add up information for practical 
application of principles of this system.

Moon is in the Star of Chitta whose lord is Mars and in 
Shadbala Mars gets 5.61 Rupa, 

Lagna falls in Revathi Nakshatra whose lord is Mercury and 
he gets Shadbala of 7.80 Rupa 

The Lagna felling in Revathi star is stronger than the Moon 
star Chitta. The birth star of this native is Mercury. 

Please remember for Dasha calculation only Moon star is 
taken into consideration. For the assessment of horoscope the 
Lagna star Revathi is the birth star and its Lord Mercury is birth 
star lord. 

Alternatively some suggest the birth star to be considered 
based on the shadbala strengths of the following lords 

C. Lord of Moon Sign 

D. Lord of Ascendant 

According to above horoscope the Lord of the sign where 
Moon is posited is Mercury gaining shadbala of 7.80 Rupa 

Lord of the Ascendant Jupiter gains only 6.45 Rupa. 

Therefore birth star should be taken as Chitta where the 
Moon is posited. 

This method is not convincing as the Sage has targeted 
star as specific Siddhanta. Obviously the correct method is to 
consider star position prescribed in the first formula. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 5 

PS. It is inspiring to deduce logic for tarabala in muhurtha. 
Normally the tarabala is matched for an auspicious work by 
taking the birth star reckoned from Moon. My logic is Birth star 
of Moon is subconscious instinct of the person and deals with 
constitution and personal matters of the person. Therefore, it is 
quite right to consider the Moon birth star for all personal and 
emotional matters like, health, healing, initiating, beginning of 
basic learning, occult rituals etc., But for material matters like 
money, luxuries etc., Star of Ascendant cusp is to be considered. 
However it is very much essential to consider the star of Dasha 
Lord who is actually the ruling planet for a particular period. 
This is the theory of cosmic vibration, 

Determination of fortune: 

a. The Lord of Lagna (Lagnadhipathi) 

b. Navamsa sign lord where Lagna falls in Navamsa 

c. Star lord of the birth Star of Moon or Ascendant whichever 
is stronger (Janma nakshatridhipati) 

(Same lord can also appear as sign lord) 

d. Dispositer of the above (sign lord where these lord are 
posited in Rasi chart) 

Compute strength of the above planets according to 
shadbala 

The computation of d, is the extended strength or weakness 
of dispositor who will decide the ultimate strength of the 
planets in a, b, c. If the dispositor gets minimum strength 
then the planet gets supported. If the dispositor becomes 
weak, the planet gets weak. 

e. If all the 3 planets gets more than stipulated shadbala and 
their dispositor also gets minimum required shadbala, then 
the Native will have excellent fortune. 

f. If any 2 planets and their dispositor gain full strength as 
above the native will be in a Good status and position 



6 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

g. If only one planet along with dispositor gain strength the 
native will be have average position 

h. If all 3 of them along with their dispositor are weak the 
native will have poor yoga (difficulties in life) 

(Note: The basic strength of a, b, c is of prime importance, if it is less 
than prescribed shadbala, even if the dispositor gains more shadbala 
there is of no value. On the contrary if the prime planet gets shadbala 
and the dispositor lesser one then it should be compared with other 
two. The best way is to total up the strength of both planet and its 
dispositor and then divide by 2 and derive net shadbala which will be 
easier for comparison.) 

Example horoscope: Fortune of the native: 

1. The Lord of Lagna - Jupiter (Rupa 6.45) Weak 

la. Jupiter is in the sign Taurus - Venus is dispositor (Rupa- 
5.53) ok 

Average shadbala for Jupiter = 5.99 it is less than the 
prescribed. 

2. Navamsa sign lord where Lagna falls in Navamsa in the 
sign of- Saturn that is Cpricorn, (Rupa-8.06) strong. 

2a. Saturn is in the sign Cancer - Moon is dispositor (Rupa - 
8.&6) strong. 

Average shadbala for Saturn = 8.36 which is higher than 
required minimum. Therefore it is strong. 

3. Birth star lord (as above in example) - Mercury (Rupa- 
7.80) strong. 

3a. Mercury is in Virgo- Mercury is dispositor (7.80) strong 

Both being Mercury it is 7.8 which is higher than minimum. 

Out of 3 planets two of them are strong therefore the fortune 
of the native is good. 

This is the first hand analysis in a horoscope which gives a 
bird's eye view of the status of native. This is an indication to 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 



astrologer to selectively focus on issues of life of native and 
study the related Bhavas and time factors based on Dasha. 

(Note: Taking reference of Phaladeepika this rule can be 
extended to all bhavas and status if related matters can be 
assessed)

Section II 

The grand Pancha Siddantika of Satyacharya is discussed 
below: 

Pancha Siddantika 

1. Grahasheela 

2. Karaka 

3. Nakshatra 

4. Vargottama 

5. Adhipatya 

1. Grahasheela Siddantika 

This section deals with the planetary significations. The 
qualitative effects of these planets will be positive if they are 
strong by virtue of lordship and placements in accordance with 
the rules prescribed by the Sage. Negative effects of these 
planets will be experienced if they are weak. These effects are 
to be predicted during their Dasha periods. 

(Note: This is the fundamental principle in Parasara, the natural 
signification of planets to fructify during the Dasha of the planet. 
Favorable and Unfavorable results are attributed to strength and 
weakness of planets computed on Shadbala formula)

The above information is useful in determining the details 
of many events. These will get modified by association aspect 
and strength of the plants. The strength of the planets is to be 
assessed based on shadbala. 

The friendship and enmity relationship as per Satyacharya 
is given below which is based on his simple principle that from 
its Moolatrikona sign planets posited in 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12 and the 
Lord of his exaltation sign are friends to "ft and rest are not. This 
is evident from the ensuing sloka. There is no reference of Neutral 
planets in this sloka. Subsequently there is an explanation of 
Planetary avastha in which the neutral effect of planets is 
considered based on Ati Mitra (close friend), Mitra (friend), and 
Sama (Neutral), Shatru (Enemy) relationships. In the normal 
course of Bhava analysis only friendship and enmity are taken 
into account. The same is illustrated below:

22 Roots of Naadi Astrology; A Comprehensive Study 



Based on the sloka in the enclosure, sign lords not crossed 
are friends and crossed sign lords are enemies to each Planet 
from its Moolatrikona sign, 

(^ercjqf^) Planets which come both as enemy and friend 
by virtue of being dual sign lord should be considered as Neutrals 
especially for a particular purpose to decide the planetary states 
derived by their Temporary relationships as given below. 

Planets posited in 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12 are considered as 
Temporary friends and in other places they are considered as 
enemies. 

Combining both permanent and temporary factors ultimately 
the planetary relationship is given below: 



Permanent friend + Temporary friend = Best friend 



Permanent friend =h Temporary enemy = Neutral 



Permanent enemy + Temporary enemy = Bitter enemy 



Permanent enemy + Temporary friend = Neutral 



Permanent Neural = Temporary friend = Friend 



Permanent neutral + Temporary enemy = Enemy 

These temporary relations are to be considered especially 
in horary astrology. 

Planetary Yogas: 

1 A Planet will get Shubha yoga when it is in the Rasi, 
Navamsa or in the Star, or hemmed between or 
having an aspect of Benefic Planets 

2 A Planet hemmed between friendly planets and placed in 
its direct motion heading towards his exaltation place will 
produce good results of his significations 

3 An Exalted Planet will give good result of his significations 

4 A Planet will give good results of his significations when he 
gets number of good Vargas, 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 23 

5 A Planet gives the results of the other planet which has 
aspect to it 

6 A Planet hemmed between malefic planets wilt give bad 
results of his significations 

7 A debilitated planet will give bad results of his significations 

8 A Planet which do not get good Vargas and not having 
other strength will give bad results of his significations 

9 A Planet is said have attained Ashubha yoga when 
it is in Rasi/Amsha of Malefic planets, hemmed 
between malefics or having aspect of malefics or 
placed in 3, 5, 7 Nakshatra from Janma Nakshatra, 

Planetary Avastha: which are based on the combination 
of Permanent and Temporary relationship and the possible effects 
during their Dasha are given below. (For all good results the 
planets must have good shadbala strength) 

1. Deepta (Brilliance) Exalted will give: Vehicles, 
happiness, courage, marriage, respect from relatives, 
education, material comforts favours from government 

Example horoscope 

Mercury is exalted: During Jupiter Dasha and 
Mercury bhukti, Vehicles and Marriage/ Education, 
and respect from relatives have all happened. 

2. Swastha (happy) Own sign will give: Happiness, 
wealth, conveyance and comforts 

Example horoscope 

Again Mercury is is in his own sign, which conferred 
happiness and comforts. Wealth of -course did not 
come due to weakness of Jupiter. 

3. Pramudita (comfortable) Ati Mitra sign will give: 

Pilgrimage, comforts, clothes, luxuries, religious knowledge 
and Happiness 



24 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

4. Shanta (Peaceful) Mitra sign will give: Royal favours, 
comforts, health, wealth and personality 

Example horoscope 

Moon is in friendly sign for the native of example 
horoscope during the period of Rahu, Moon bhukti 
he developed his personality and tried to earn for 
his comfort levels. 

5. Deena (Miserable) Neutral sign will give: Occupational 
hazards or low profiles, strained relations with relatives and 
diseases to native 

Example horoscope 

Venus is in neutral sign of Mars. In Rahu Dasha and 
Venus bhukti the native suffered due to disease, then 
he had problems with relatives, he also had to 
undertake low profile jobs 

In Jupiter Dasha and Venus Bhukti, he had health 
problems and also professional problems with lesser 
progress in financial growth. 

Mars is in neutral sign of Venus. In Rahu Dasha and 
Mars Bhukti, he had to take up low profile jobs and 
off-course he had problems with relatives 

6. Ati dukhita (extremely sorrow) Enemy sign will give: 

Many types of hardships, worries and tensions 

Example horoscope 

Current Dasha of the native is Jupiter who is in 
enemy sign, though due to his average strength he 
gave job, education and money, yet the native is 
facing worries, and tensions and hardships in 
professional level. 

7. Vikala (defective) Conjunct with malefic will give: 

Defects and deformities due to ill health, disgust, worries, 
hardships, ill health to wife and children troubles from 
vehicles, loss of clothes 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 25 

Example horoscope 

Rahu is conjunct with Mars, and in Rahu Dasha, he 
faced many problems but luckily he was not married 
at that time. The hard ship and worries were of 
different nature. 

8. Khala (cruel) Debilitation will give: Suffers ill health, 
difficulties, dangers from enemy/iow class, thefts 

Example horoscope 

Sun though debilitated/ being with a friend Mars did 
not cause any of these problems, In Rahu period in 
his Bhukti he helped him to recover from bad period. 
In Jupiter Dasha in his Bhukti Sun lifted him 
professionally and became more health conscious. 
However he could not get his due credits. Most 
probably, the 6 th lord being in 8 th causing yoga must 
have overshadowed the bad effects of his positional 
deficiency. However, he was deprived of his due 
credits. 

9. Kopa (angry) Combust with Sun will give: 

Unhappiness, difficulties, losses, and dangers to wife, 
children and relatives, eye troubles 

Example horoscope 

Mars is combust with Sun, I have already discussed 
the bad effects of Mars, Yes of-course, the native 
had eye sight problem and was made to wear glasses 
during Rahu Mars period. 

With 10 Planetary Avastha and 9 planetary Yoga the planets 
are entitled to give their results of Karaka Siddhanta. 

2. Karaka Siddhanta: 

In this Siddhanta Sage explains the significations of planets 
that are empowered to give during their Dasha periods based 
on their strength hitherto explained. 

I give below the table of planetary strengths for the example 
horoscope:

Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 27 

While dealing with karaka I also simultaneously discuss the 
example horoscopes. Therefore, I am giving the strength of the 
planets against each planet. After the significations in italics I 
give the results pertaining to significations during their periods 
either Dasha or Antar Dasha. 

SUN: 

For example horoscope: it gets the strength of below 
28% therefore weak: 

Atma, Self, Father, Vigor, Personality, Character, 
Determination, Governing and Government factors, Health, 
Excellence, Head, Fever, Indigestion, Eye defects, Trouble from 
kings rulers and deities 

Example horoscope 

Rahu Dasha and Sun Bhukti, Native's father did undergo 
difficult period. The native had eye trouble; he was having 
problems with his unsettling job profile. But he recovered from 
difficulties during that period. In Jupiter Bhukti the same Sun 
bhukti gave him upliftments. 

Moon: ordinarily good: above 28% 

Mind, Mother, Favours from elite, arts, Milk and Milk 
products, Cold, Cough, Blood impurities, Lungs problems, Curse 
of angels. 

Example horoscope 

His mother was having health problems, but the native was, 
though working had little problems but getting cooperation from 
his higher ups. No health problems noticed. 

Mars: Weak 

Construction, Buildings, Powered machines, Land, 
Uniformed men, Injuries, Fire, Danger from dogs, Trouble from 
Shaivetes, Danger from horned animals, Diseases, Enmity, 
Tensions, BP, Hydrocele 



28 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Example horoscope 

Rahu Dasha Mars's period, no bad effects of above 
experienced but he had to face problems of job and hard work 
causing tensions. He got treated for dog bite. 

Mercury: Strong: 

Education, Business, Communication, Intelligence, Power 
of judgment, Maternal uncle, Stomach disorders, Skin diseases, 
Devotion to Lord Vishnu and wise persons. 

Example horoscope 

Rahu Mercury, though had problems in education, changed 
the line of education, however in Jupiter Mercury period, he 
had all good results in profession and personal life. Experienced 
stomach upsets. 

Jupiter: Strong 

Higher Intelligence / Religious rites, Yoga, children, Minister, 
Royal favours, Devotion to Guru, Fat, Liver, Belly diseases 

Example horoscope 

Jupiter Dasha he had all good results, and off-course he 
had digestive problems. 

Venus: Strong 

Vehicles, Jewelry, Wife, Wealth, Fine arts, Sexual desires, 
Sandal wood, Clothes, Diabetes and related diseases 

Example horoscope 

Rahu Dasha Venus Bhukti, the native started earning. 
However not much of Venus results were coming due to Venus 
being lord of 8 th . 

Saturn: Strong 

Longevity, Profession, Control, Wealth of paternal uncles, 
Punishment, Imprisonment, Sin, Stammering, Fear, Poverty, 
Worry, Danger from devils and thieves, Rheumatism, Pains 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 29 

Example horoscope 

The strength of Saturn saved him from evil results in both 
the Dasha; in fact in Jupiter Dasha his professional progress 
was seen. 

Rahu: weak 

Authority from the position, Regal umbrella, Paternal 
grandfather, Epilepsy, measles, Trouble from devils, Witchcraft, 
Confinement, Imprisonment, Muslims, Indigestion, Tuberculosis, 
Leprosy, Poisoning, Danger from snake bite, Aggravation of 
diseases 

Example horoscope 

During Rahu Dasha he had to join military air force services 
for a short period, during that period he had problems with 
food poisoning and he had to leave the job. He had indigestion 
problem. Other than this nothing serious happened. 

Ketu: Strong: 

Itches, Scabies, Trouble from enemies, Maternal grandfather, 
Incurable diseases due to karma, Low caste, Trouble from low 
caste people, Dejections 

Example horoscope 

Despite Ketu being strong often during his Antara period 
the native will get health problems, though financially there is 
no problem. Off-course there is no incurable disease as such. 
He has no skin problems. 

The Karakatwa results are directly linked to planetary house 
lordship and positional dignities. Some of the significations may 
synchronize with the results. But these are well experienced 
during transit of planets. This aspect is discussed in Bhrighu 
Nandi Naadi 

3. Nakshatra Siddhanta 

In fact this Siddhanta is the crux of Naadi system. Though 
many other texts have Nakshatra references the logical

application part in birth chart analysis is given in this work of 
Satyacharya. 

The following table with regard to Nakshatra compatibility 
is generally given in most of the almanacs and commonly used 
by all for selecting a good day to commence something. There 
is no technicality involved in this. The only difference is that the 
Dasha lords are attributed to it. 

Most important: Birth Nakshatra can either be from the 
Birth ascendant or from Moon whichever is stronger as explained 
earlier.

Satyacharya uses this in qualifying the Dasha lord to give 
good or bad results based on the same principle. But most 
intelligently he uses it for entire period of Dasha equaling it to a 
day and compares them with Janma Nakshatra to decide the 
effect of the Dasha period whether good or bad. Here the word 
Naadi aptly fits in as the lengthy period of Dasha Lord is 
compressed to a time slot of a day represented by the Nakshatra 
of the Planet to compare it with the Nakshatra of day in which 
the Native was born that is Janma Nakshatra. 

{Imp: It is not simply dividing the time factor to its minutest 
divisions as in the case of divisional charts, it is also other way 
round, compressing the lengthy periods into smaller time slot 
with logical algorithms using the tools not deviating from the 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 31 

standard text is the basis of Naadi. (This is the secret of Naadi 
which I use in the Naadi delineations.)} 

1. The events of the life should be predicted from the 
Lagna alone if Lagna is stronger than Moon Lagna 
else it should be predicted from Moon Lagna. Even 
the birth star is to be considered based on the 
strength of Lagna. 

2. The Dasha of planets as indicated in the Nakshatra 
table above is to be considered in association with 
Bhava analysis 

3. Planets in Sampat (2), Kshema (4), Sadhaka (6) and 
Mitra (8) Tara gives Excellent results during their 
Dasha/Bhukti 

A Planets placed in signs trines (1, 5, and 9) to 
the signs of above stars will give best results 
during their Dasha/Bhukti 

B Planets placed in signs angles (4, 7, and 10) to 
the signs of above stars will give good results 

C Planets placed in signs cruel places (6, 8, and 
12) to the signs of above stars will give bad 
results 

4. Planets in Janma (1) and Parama Mitra (9) Tara gives 
best results during their Dasha/Bhukti 

A Planets placed in signs trines (1, 5, and 9) to 
the signs of above stars will also give best results 
during their Dasha/Bhukti 

B Planets placed in signs angles (4, 7, and 10) to 
the signs of above stars will not give good results 
but may give satisfactory results 

C Planets placed in signs cruel places (6, 8, and 
12) to the signs of above stars will give bad 
results

5. Planets in Vipat (3), Pratyak (5) and Vadha (7) Tara 
gives bad results during their Dasha/Bhukti 

A Planets placed in signs trines (1, 5, and 9) to 
the signs of above stars will also give bad results 
during their Dasha/Bhukti 

B Planets placed in signs angles (4, 7, and 10) to 
the signs of above stars will not give bad results 
but may give satisfactory results 

C Planets placed in signs cruel places (6, 8, and 
12) to the signs of above stars will give good 
results 

6. Wherever auspicious results are being produced by 
the Planet in the above cases, it is based again on 
the shadbala of the planet. If the planet has full 
strength the results will be very good and if it is of 
moderate strength it will be moderately good and 
where the planet is weak the good results will be 
meager. In case of bad results, a strong planet may 
reduce the effects of bad whereas the weak planet 
worsens the bad effect. 

Though the Nakshatra Siddhanta predominantly empowers 
the planet to give good or bad results in its Dasha bhukti 
periods, it is also used in Bhava analysis with respect to 
Bhava lord's stellar position, 

We have already used this Siddhanta in earlier example. 

This peculiarity is the reason for calling it as Naadi 
system especially Dhruva Naadi because Dhruva also 
refers to Nakshatra

C in its own sign it gets 50% strength 

D in its friendly sign it gets 25% strength 

E in enemy sign it gets lesser than 25% strength 

F If Debilitated, Astangata or Moudhya it will be weak.

5. Adhipatya Siddhanta 

Including Lagna all the 12 signs are called Bhavas. The 
sign lords of these Bhavas are lords of the Bhava. Each of these 
Bhava will signify several matters of life. There are innumerable 
significations which run into volumes if put it on paper. However 
commonly studied important significations are tabled in section 
I. 

Each of these Bhavas have planets representing it as Karaka 
as shown below:

In continuation to the Bhava analysis said earlier, in this 
Siddhanta, Sage prescribes the strength and weakness of Bhava 
based on Adhipatya. Natural benefics however will flourish the 
Bhava with their influence. On the contrary natural malefic will 
destroy the good effects of the Bhava. One good clarification 
the Sage gives here is about the 6, 8, 12 houses. Benefic planets 
here will reduce the evil effects of the houses while the malefic 
here will enhance the malefic nature of these houses- 
Counted from Lagna or Chandra whichever is stronger, the 
houses 3, 6, 10, 11 are upachaya (producing prosperity 
progressively) houses rest of the houses are apachaya houses 



Strength and Weakness of the Bhava 

A Bhava will be strong to produce its full effects: 

1 When the lord of a particular Bhava gets the aspect from 
benefic planets 

2 When a Lord is placed in upachaya houses from Lagna 

A Bhava will be weak to produce its full effects: 

1 When the lord of a particular Bhava gets the aspect from 
Malefic planets 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 35 



2 When the lord is placed in 6, 8, 12 from Lagna, from Lagna 
lord or from the Bhava. 

(Note: Elaborated scholarly commentary on Jaataka Chandrika has 
some different view on placement of lords especially when a planet 
gets the dignity of Dosha due to Adhipatya of benefics and malefics 
planets. There is a striking intelligence involved to pin down yoga 
classifications to planets. This technicality is based on the Dharma, 
Artha, Kama, Moksha classification of houses. The qualitative dignities 
are classified into Shubha, Raja yoga. Yoga, Shubha, Avayoga, 
Ashubha, Yoganukoola, Sandharbha Guna, Papa. Then the results are 
attributed through their relationships with houses and planets.) 

In addition to this the Bhava analysis prescribed below is to 
be considered. 

Bhavas Thrive or Decline 

1. If its lord and Karaka both are in their Exalted, Moola trikona 
or own signs the Bhava will thrive 

la. If it is debilitated or placed in enemy quarter the Bhava will 
decline 

2. If the Bhava lord is hemmed between natural benefic planets 
the Bhava will thrive 

2a. If it is hemmed between natural malefic planets the Bhava 
will decline 

3. If the Bhava lord is placed in Kendra or Trikona houses the 
Bhava will thrive 

3a. if the Bhava is lord is placed in 6, 8, 12 from Lagna and also 
placed 12 th to its own house, then the Bhava will decline 

4. If a Bhava lord is placed 2, 3, 11 houses which are either 
his exalted, Moola trikona, own or friendly house, then the 
Bhava owned by him will thrive. 

4a. if the above houses happen to be his debilitated, enemy 
sign then the Bhava will decline 

5. If the Bhava lord is placed in the even stars counted from 
Birth star as decided earlier based on strengths, or if it is in 
birth star itself or in 9 th star the Bhava will thrive. 



36 



Roots of Neadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



5a. If the Bhava lord is placed in the odd stars excluding birth 
star & 9 th star counted as above, the Bhava will decline 

6. If the Bhava lord is combust the Bhava will decline 

7. If the lord of the Bhava is placed within 6 signs from his 
own Bhava (which shall not be 6, 8, 12 to Lagna) or his 
debilitated or enemy sign the Bhava will thrive. 

8. If the Lord of a Bhava is progressing towards exaltation 
sign and if it does not happen to be 6, 8, 12 or 12 th to his 
own Bhava and if it is not his debilitated or enemy sign the 
Bhava will thrive, 

8a. Unless Bhava lord gains more benefic places in shodasha 
varga charts, his direction towards his debilitated sign not 
being a Kendra, Kona, exalted, Moolatrikona, Friendly sign 
the Bhava will decline. 

9. Bhava itself will thrive if it is occupied or having aspect of 
natural benefics or hemmed between benefic planets. 

9a. A Bhava will decline when it is flanked on either side by 
natural malefic planets or influenced by them by occupation 
or aspect. 

To apply the above rules to example horoscope some more 
components are needed to compute as follows:

With this computation applying the rules as mentioned

Bhavas as follows: 

Bhavas 1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12 has full strength 

Bhavas 4, 5, 8 Bhava gets average strength. 

Thus Bhavas 9, 6, 2 Bhavas have no strength at all. 

In Karaka Siddhanta strengths of Karakas will be considered 
to assess the qualitative effect of Bhavas. 

Proclaiming that the predictions made considering 
Panchasidhanthika would never go wrong, the great Sage ends 
his hi-tech Adhyaya on Panchasidhanthika. 



42 Rdots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Section III 



Bhava Phala 

Sage maintains brevity in enumerating the Bhava Phala 
generalizing for all 12 Ascendant and advises to use experience 
and logic in delineation of Bhava Phala independently for each 
ascendant. 

We find the following method to be useful in delineations 
of Bhava Phala 

1. The modified effects of Bhava by Bhava analysis along with 
the Planetary Yogas and Planetary Moods given in 
earlier paragraphs are all to be taken into consideration to 
delineate Bhava Phala" 

2. A lord sitting in a house will get the significations of that 
house along with the Karakatwa of the Planet ruling that 
house as Lord. 

3. The material welfare and eventualities denoted by house 
matters of occupant will thrive or decline through the 
objects and persons signified by the house and the lord of 
that house. 

4. The character/personal and biological matters of houses 
of occupant get influenced positively or negatively by the 
relational and temperamental biological matters signified 
of the house and the lord of that house. 

5. The good or bad effects of Bhava are based on the Bhava 
analysis and the Shubha and Ashubha yoga of both 
the occupant and the Lord of the House. The Natural 
signification of the Lord as a planet will be modified based 
on the sign status which will either support or negate the 
signification of the planet occupying the said sign. 

6. The Bhava governed by the Planet as Lord and as Bhava 
karaka will also get modified based on the beneficial or 

"â  malicious status of the house to that particular planet with 
respect to his Bhava representation. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 43 

7. If more than one planet occupy, the mutual modifications 
of the significations of occupied planet along with the 
modified effect of the house and the house lord due to the 
presence of these planets are to be assessed to consider 
the effects of a planet in that house. This is due to the fact 
that a planet in a house responsible to give the results, will 
also cover the Bhava and Bhava karaka results of Planets 
which are associated by Conjunction 

8. The results will also get modified by the planets who are 
placed in Mutual aspect, Mutual exchange or being in Kendra 
or Kona to planet occupying a Bhava. 

The effects will vary based on the ascendant therefore it is 
not proper to generalize the effects of Bhava when lords occupy 
particular Bhava. Using the basic signification given in the table 
the effects of lord of each Bhava when posited different Bhava 
can be ascertained for general assumption of the outcome of 
such Bhava. 

In order to know the effects of planets as lords when they 
occupy different Bhava the following points are to be considered: 

The places 6, 8, 12 give the bad effects. Therefore Lords of 
6 th , 8 th and 12 th carry these bad effects. If they are natural 
malefic planets the bad effects are fortified. 12 th house is vyaya 
sthana to Lagna, 8 th house is vyaya to Bhagya and 6 th is vyaya 
to Saptama. The bad effects of these houses are experienced 
when these lords are placed in bad houses. The bad effects are 
also transferred to planet being posited in these places. The 
nature of bad effects is based on the nature of planets involved 
as Bhava lords posited in 6 th 8 th , 12 th house and the nature of 
sign lord and signs which shall modify the effects and helps in 
knowing more details about the bad results. This applies to all 
Bhava lords when they occupy a house which is 12 th to the 
Bhava owned by them. If the Lords of 6 th 8 th and 12 th goes to 
other good Bhava, the bad effects of 6 th , 8 th , 12 th house are 
considerably reduced and the effects of other Bhava is to be 
decided upon the natural signification of planets being benefic 
or malefic. The rule is that a planet will get the signification of 



44 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



the sign where it is posited and the natural signification of planet 
is modified by the sign qualities. The Lordship of the planet will 
thrive with good effects if the sign occupied by planet represents 
a good house. The occupied house will get modified by the 
benefic and malefic nature of planet and the lordship of benefic 
or malefic. Significations are to be carefully, patiently & logically 
analyzed and identified for mutual harmony or disharmony with 
nature of planets, with their lordship and the houses occupied 
by them. Further fine tuning is based on Panchasiddhanthika 
the effects of these good and bad results can be attributed to 
planets with more accuracy. 

However in brief I will give the effect of 12 Bhavas keeping 
in view the above rules except where the effects of Planet as 
lord of different houses differing to each Lagna and multiple 
planet occupation & mutual relationship with other planets. 
Presuming that the lords attain Shubha yoga and good mood, 
thriving results of Bhava is indicated against "Benefic Yoga" 
and for contrary dignities to Lords and Bhava the results are 
indicated against "Malefic Yoga". Practically there could be 
mixed effects which needs logical interpretation while assessing 
individual horoscopes. In the example horoscope the strength 
of Bhavas are as follows: 

Bhavas 1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12 has full strength 

Bhavas 4, 5, 8 gets average strength. 

Thus Bhavas 9, 6, 2 have no strength at all.

Malefic Yoga: Living in poverty having low level jobs. 
Mother may be subjected to questionable character. Miserable 
life may lead even to get arrested. 

6 th Lord in 5 th 

Benefic Yoga: He may be adopted by his uncle. He may 
have wealth and fame. 

Malefic Yoga: He may face problems due to ill health and 
danger to life of progeny.

6 th lord in 7 th 

Benefic Yoga: Good for maternal uncle, Native may marry 
the daughter of maternal uncle and uncle may rule him. His 
maternal uncle may stay in foreign country. 

Malefic Yoga: Early death of wife or separation from wife 
is indicated. 

(Note if there is mixed yoga, the results are to be 
derived logically and similarly other results of planet 
conjunction can be derived) 

6 th lord in 8 th 

Benefic Yoga: Native will have medium life. 

Malefic Yoga: He may face troubles and dangers and will 
be sick throughout life. 

(Note: in astrology 6 th lord going to 8 th house is 
considered as Vipareeta raja yoga for material benefits) 

(In the example horoscope: 6 th lord is in 8 th and it 
has the association of 2 nd and 9 th lord and Rahu is also 
associated. Apart from this there is an exchange of 
Venus as lord of 3 rd and 8 th with 2 nd and 9 th lord. This 
makes Sun to get linked with 8 th lord also. Here the 
principle of Vipareeta raja yoga worked for him however 
the effect of 9 th /rouse and 8 th house both operated. 
There was steep increase in salary and and higher post 
was granted during Sun bhukti in Jupiter Dasha. Yet 
this is a medium life only) 

Important: All house results are attributed to Lagna 
and relationship to Lagna. 4 th house mother 6 th house 
uncles 3 rd house brother effects are not considered as 
Lagna to derive the results but their effect to native 
alone are discussed here

Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Malefic Yoga: He may not have marital pleasure and may 
have illusions of joy with other woman. 

Wife's death: 

7 th Lord, Venus, and their dispositor if all are strong, the 
wife may die during the 3 rd round of Saturn. If they are of 
ordinary strength she may die during 2 nd round of Saturn and if 
they are weak she will die during 1 st round of Saturn. 

We will verify this principle with an example as shown below

The Native got married in Februry 1976. 

7 th Lord Saturn is is 2 nd and it is in aspect to one of his 
house that is ff h there by it also strengthens his own house 7 th . 
There is an aspect of Jupiter to Saturn with the effect of Venus. 
Saturn also has the aspect ofRahu. Therefore he has ordinary 
strength. 

Venus is in 6 th house and with Jupiter and is having aspect 
ofRahu. This is also of medium strength 

Sun dispositor of Saturn is in 7 th and is with a friendly planet 
Mars and having Moon aspect He is having good strength 

Jupiter dispositor of Venus is also having good strength 
being in own house. But it has the aspect ofRahu. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based- Satya Jaataka 69 



Therefore all the 4 planets gain only medium strength. The 
native must lose his wife during 2 nd round of Saturn 

Native had 2 nd round of Saturn commenced during 
1978 in Leo. In this round when Saturn reached Taurus 
that is during Oct 2000 the native lost his iv/fe. 

Widowhood: 

Mars or Rahu placed in 2 nd , 7 th or 8 th house woman may 
become widow: If they are in 4 th mother may become widow: 

(Here slight amendment is needed, Mars must have 
Rahu link that is either Mars must aspect Rahu or Rahu 
must aspect Mars with its 5 th or 9 th aspect) 

With this amendment we can verify the above rule with an 
example horoscope.

It is a female horoscope and Mars is in 2 nd having aspect of

Timing of Marriage: 

7 th lord being strong and Venus is placed in upachaya houses 
(3, 6, 10, 11) with full strength during the first revolution of 
Jupiter marriage will take place. If- 7 th lord and Venus are of 
moderate strength marriage may take place during the 2 nd 
revolution of Jupiter. If both are devoid of strength he may 



70 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



marry during 3 rd revolution of Jupiter. If they are extremely 
weak there may not be marriage at all or the marital life will be 
miserable. 

We will verify this with an example chart:

In the example horoscope 7 th lord Mercury gets Stregnth of

The marriage must get delayed. Marriage took place in 3 rd round 
when transit Jupier met Venus in Scopio and havng 7 th aspect 
to Natal Jupiter 

(P.S. This two example of transit of Saturn and Jupiter is a 
clue to fine tune Bhrighu Naadi Principle of timing the events.) 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 71 



8 th House: 

8 th House is importantly seen for Longevity. Sage gives more 
details relating to this instead of giving the effects of this lord in 
different houses. One of the most important factors he indicates 
is the planetary contribution to study the longevity. This being 
the most effective part the same is explained with the method 
of calculating the number of years each planet contributes under 
different conditions. Each planet will contribute the number of 
years as mentioned in the first column of the top row being its 
exalted place. In its debilitated place it contributes 50% of its 
exalted place years. In between from Exalted to Debilitated 
place proportionate age is computed in decreasing order and 
from debilitated place again proportionate age is calculated 
increasing order till exalted place. 

Further three deductions as shown in the left hand column 
is to be made based on the positions in the birth chart. 

4 th column deduction is purely based on its position from 
Lagna. 

After all these deduction we get the number of years 
contributed by each planet. 

The following tables will be self-explanatory.

76 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Further the following rules are to be applied. 

Sat - Sun - Mar Any One in Lagna or 5 th or 9 th Aspect to 
Rahu in Lagna, follow the computation below: 

1. Count the remaining Padas from Lagna degrees to 

complete 108 Padas. 

2. Divide this by 108 

3. Multiply this product by years given by SATURN/ 
MARS/SUN as the case may be 

4. The resultant figure is to be deducted from the 
Longevity derived by that Planet 

5. If more than one Malefic, the planet nearest to Lagna 
need only to be considered. 

6. Out of Jup, Ven, Mer, Full Moon either conjunct or 
aspect ABOVE PLANET only 50% of above to be 
deducted 

Example: Suppose SUN is in Lagna 

Lagna: Above 25:22:00 Mithuna: From Mesha 

Mesha 9 Navamsa, Vrishabha 9 Navamsa 

In Mithuna it is in 7.7 Navamsa: 

Total 25.7 Navamsa is Over: Balance is 

108-2S.7 = 82.3 Navamsa: 

Therefore 82.3/108 * Sun =19 Years 

14.47 Years 

Is To Be Deducted: From Sun: 

1. Planet Enmity factor is to be considered 

2. Any two Enemy planets if conjunct within 5 deg orb is to be 
taken into consideration. Deduction is applicable to only 
one 



Ciassical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadl based - Satya Jaataka 77 



3. The strongest among them will not lose their age factor 
while the weak planet will lose 30%. Natural order of 
strength shown below: 

I. Malefic: Rah, Ket, Sat, Mar, Sun, 

II. Benefic: Jup, Ven, Moo, Mer 

Apart from this we should also consider the association of 
enemy planet and aspect of malefic planets at the rate of 30% 
each reduction. 

There are some more rules with regard to retrograde and 
Amsha positions. This can be studied exclusively in Hora 
Shastram of Varahamihiracharya. However with the simple 
principles an example is shown for approximation of longevity. 

Example horoscope:

In the above horoscope: Sun in Sagittarius he gets 12.67 
years but being in 12 th to Lagna loses all and contribution is 

Moon is in Virgo and gets 16.67 and being 9 th he gets less 
25% that is he gets 12.5 years and further 30% is deducted 
due to aspect of Ketu. Therefore he gets only 8-75 years. 

Mars is being in Aries gets 11.25 years no deduction 

Mercury in Capricorn gets 8 years but having Ketu aspect 
30% is reduced and he gets 5.6 years 



78 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Jupiter is in Libra and he gets 11.25 years Jupiter in 10 th 
therefore he gets 83% of the above. That is 9.33 years but he 
has the aspect of Mars a malefic he gets only 70% . That is 
6.53 years 

Venus is in Capricorn he gets 17.5 again Ketu aspect will 
make him give only 70% that is he gives 12.00 years 

Saturn gets in Virgo 18.3 and being in 9 th he gets 75% of 
this. That is 13.72. He is associated with Moon enemy planet 
30% deduction and again there is Ketu aspect 30% deduction. 
So gets only 40% of 13.72. That is 5.49 years. 

Total planetary contribution is 49.62 which is short 
life. Indeed the native died before reaching 40 years of 
age. 

(Note: Exception to scholarly claims, this method or 
any other methods of calculating longevity is only 
approximation. It is not within the purview of 
mathematical formula to precisely arrive at longevity.) 

Balarishta and other 8 th house related matters are discussed 
which are available in most of the traditional texts. However 8 th 
house is a most important house to be studied which reveals 
many secrets of life. This is invariably combined with Lagna and 
10 th house to understand the Karma effects.

10 th house is of profession or Karma. 

The 10 th house strength and its lord's strength along with 
Karaka planets of 10 th needs to be assessed 

A 10 th lord placed in good houses that is Kona or Kendra 
and also well placed in Amsha while the 10 th house has benefic 
planets and the Karaka is well placed in Rasi and Amsha. Very 
good professional life can be predicted. 

1 st house represents the life matters. Link of 10 th lord to it 
indicate professions relating to body matters. Like physical 
instructor or yoga teacher or even a healer. This depends upon 
nature of planet. 

2 nd house represents wealth matters and 10 th link may 
indicate profession of wealth related. Detailed study of Karaka 
planets and lords will indicate the nature of such profession 

3 rd house represents communications and short travel, the 
10 th link indicates profession relating to such matters and the 
karaka planets will give more details of such profession 

4 th house relates to assets and mind, therefore profession 
may relate to Land building and vehicle and psychology 

5 th house relates to authority and advising. The profession 
may relate to such matters 

6 th house relates to efforts and also violence, this may 
include military, army etc., or it may relate to hard works 

7 th house relates to business and foreign link of 10 th may 
indicate this. 

8 th house relates to secret affairs - irreligious link may 
give job in secret services and it may relate to foreign. 

9 th house relates to charitable activities and educational 
trusts & 10 th link ensures such activities. 

10 th relates to Karma or auspicious activities 

11 th relates to gaining factor, good for business 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 81 

12 th relates to loss and expenditure and asylums. There 
could be loss in profession displacement or it can be job relating 
to asylums, 

6, 8, 12 houses are called Dusthanas and therefore the 
native may find enmity, difficulties and displacements etc. 
especially when there is a malefic yoga. 

11 th Lord in 1 st 

Native earns wealth through yoga planet involved in this. 
Malefic yoga reverses the results 

11 th Lord in 2 nd 

Earning money through money transactions will be 
successful if good yoga planet is involved else there will be 
obstructions in the same. 

11 th Lord in 3 rd 

Native may earn wealth with the help of his brothers or 
through the matter relating to 3 rd house 

11 th Lord in 4 th 

Gains through lands agriculture assets and mother- Loss 
and disputes if malefic yoga 

11 th Lord in 5 th 

Gains through children and through blessing of deity 

11 th Lord in 6 th 

Gain in litigations and from partners. Reverse in malefic 
yoga 

11 th Lord in 7 th 

Gains from woman or from wife or from foreign country 

11 th Lord in 8 th 

Loss and difficulties and if malefic yoga there may be initial 
gains and sudden loss at a later stage 



82 Roots of Neadl Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

11 th Lord in 9 th 

Gains through father, preacher and religious and charitable 
activities 

11 th Lord in 10 th 

Gains from trade and profession and through religious rites 
11 th Lord in 11 th 

Rich and with malefic yoga loss 

11 th lord in 12 th 

Native may loose and spend away his earnings - it also 
indicate danger to elder brother 

12 th House: 

Similar to 8 th , this house has more malefic effects as far as 
material matters are concerned. 

Any lord posited in 12 th will lose the benefic effect of the 
houses he owns. 

On the contrary if the 12 th lord is placed in good houses 
that is Kendra or Kona the 12 th lordship will give good effects 
while the Kendra and Kona house will lose their strength to give 
good results. 

If a lord goes to 12 th house the signification of the houses 
owned by that lord will be lost in case of material matters and 
in personal and living matters pertaining to that house either 
face danger to life or death like situations. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 83 



If 12 th lord goes to any house the signification of that house 
get spoiled while the 12 th lord gives good effect of his 12 th house 
if the matter in that house is in harmony to his house matters 
but equally give negative effects of the house where he is posited. 

In deriving the Bhava Phala, the friendship/enmity factor 
between the two lords, their disposition in relation to Janma 
Nakshatra, the harmony between their karaka Bhava are all to 
be considered. If there exists enmity factor between two planets 
while their significations either natural or lordship matters are 
in harmony in those matters positive predictions are to be 
derived. Logical approach shall be nearer to correctness than 
generalized selective dictums. Points to be considered are: 1) 
benefic/malefic nature of planets, 2) their lordship disposition 
and star disposition to Janma Nakshatra 3) the relationship of 
this planet as benefic/malefic and by its Karakatwa to the specific 
matter of the house under examination 4) the compatibility of 
the two houses under confluence 5) the yoga and Avayoga 
status of the lords under consideration. 

This concludes the pancha siddantika of Sage Satyacharya. 
After this the Sage proceeds to discuss the effect of Dasha 
bhukti. 

The Nakshatra Siddhanta is predominant in deciding the 
Phala of Dasha and bhukti. 



84 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Section IV 



Dasha Bhukfr Phala 

All the principles like House strength, planetary strengths 
enumerated earlier in Siddhantas are applicable in deciding the 
effect of Dasha lords Phala. 

1 Wherever auspicious results are being produced by 
the Planet in the above cases, it is based again on 
the shadbala of the planet. If the planet has full 
strength the results will be very good and if it is of 
moderate strength it will be moderately good and 
where the planet is weak the good results will be 
meager. In case of bad results, a strong planet may 
reduce the effects of bad whereas the weak planet 
worsens the bad effect. 

2 To read the effects of Dasha lords the following 
qualitative assessment should be made: 

1. The natural qualities of the planets. 

2. The sign qualities where the planet is based its dignity 
in that sign whether Exalted, Debilitated or Retrograde 

3. Its benefic or malefic disposition as lord of house/houses 

4. Benefic or malefic nature as per Nakshatra Siddhanta 

5. Sum effects of its benefic or malefic in Divisional 
disposition 

6. Its strength in motional direction (Ucchabhilashi 
(towards exaltation) / Neechabhilashi (towards 
debilitation) and the combust positions and the speed 
of planets (ati Chara etc.) 

7. In the descending order of the strength each planet 
operates as Bhukti lord in every Dasha. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 85 



Considering these factor Sages gives a unique method of 
results of Dasha lords when placed in different houses. 

In every house the conjunction of the lord of the house 
with Dasha lord is taken into consideration. These 
combinations are selectively found in horoscopes and there 
is no clue to the effects of Dasha lord if placed alone in a 
particular house. 

This is the observation normally expressed in the translated 
texts. I shall definitely make efforts in the course of these 
delineations as to why this special feature of conjunction of 
lord with Dasha lord is included and explore the secret 
behind it enabling application of this rule universally to all 
horoscopes. (Attention is drawn to italic sentences in the 
following paragraphs) 

We shall restrict ourselves to be brief to save space for 
more information. 

Firstly the ascendant lord disposition is to be considered to 
get the overall effect in the capacity of Dasha lord applying 
the above rules. This will establish the favorable or 
unfavorable results of first house. Naturally, if he is placed 
in his own house, one of the points for getting favorable 
results is fulfilled subject to other conditions of pancha 
Siddhanta. 

In the absence of more number of beneficial dispositions 
the Dasha of Ascendant lord may not yield desirable good 
results and may encounter sufferings* The nature of such 
suffering will relate to the house positions predominant in 
the divisional chart especially Navamsa chart. This rule can 
also be applied to Ascendant lord when favorably disposed 
to ascertain the sources of such desirable good effects. 
Such sources and its effects are ascribed to the lord of that 
house in divisional chart during its sub period. 

Note: if the sign lord where the Bhava lord is posited and the 
Bhava lord both are strong, the Bhava will flourish. Any one 



86 Roots of Naadi Astrology; A Comprehensive Study 



of them is strong average good results. This is one of the 
rules for Bhava analysis. If the Bhava lord is in his own house 
this lord gets two good effects: to flourish his Bhava that is 
being in his own house and 2 nd being sign lord posited in his 
own sign. A lord being in 6 th 8 th 12 th position to the Bhava 
lord either in Rasi or Amsha chakra then also the lord is 
considered weak. Applying this strategy the Sage delineates 
good effects when the Dasha lord placed In a Bhava 
considering its strength independently to differentiate the 
results. 

This rule is applied in the following chart; "Any one of 
them being weak' considers that they establish 6, 8, and 12 
relation either in Rasi or Amsha. "Both are weak" represents 
the weak Bhava and its lord and also the Dasha lord. 

All the good effects of 2 nd house is indicated when thel st 
lord is placed in 2 nd along with 2 nd lord ( that is if the 2 nd lord is 
having stregnth). If the ascendant lord relates himself with 6 th , 
8 th or 12 th position to 2 nd lord either through rasi or divisional 
chart or if he is weak by any of the rules aforesaid, then the 
good effects of the 2 nd house is considerably reduced. 

Along with the 3 rd lord ( or if the 3 rd and 1 st lord both dignified 
with strength) good effects of third house can be experienced 
during the Ascendant lord. If either of them is weak, the good 
effects are considerably reduced and especially if they happen 
to be in 6 th 8 th and 12 th position as aforesaid the bad effects are 
experienced with due confluence of relatively bad resources. 

In 4 th house along with 4 th lord good comfort levels are to 
be predicted and if both are weak contrary results are produced. 
Either of them when weak ordinary good effects is to be 
predicted. 

Along with 5 th lord in 5 th house the ascendant lord during 
his period bestow good results pertaining to 5 th matters. When 
both are weakly disposed bad results and either of them when 
disposed weak ordinary effects of 5 th house is experienced. 

(Note; the natural zodiac house significations; that is 5 th house 
ruled by Sun represents government and the Sun represents 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 87 

father, all these are considered while considering the 5 th 
house.)] 

Being with sixth lord in sixth house the ascendant lord will 
give bad effects of 6 th house like litigations, quarrels and poverty 
etc., If the lord of 6 th is weak and debilitated while the ascendant 
lord is strong the above effects are reversed. 

Lagna lord being in 7 th along with 7 th lord, Journey, 
celebrations, etc., is indicated by Ascendant Dasha lord. In the 
event of ascendant lord or 7 th lord rendering weak opposite 
results are expected. 

Lagna lord in 8 th along with 8 th Lord the ascendant lord 
gives very bad results. 

Strongly pleaced ascendant lord in 9 th along with 9* will 
render good effects of 9 th house. A weak Dasha lord will render 
bad resutls of 9 th house. 

In 10 th the Lagna lord along with 10 th house (that when the 
10 th lord is strong), the fame, and progress in profession and if 
ascendant lord is weak then he will get reverse resutls. 

Gains are indicated by Ascendant lord when placed in 11* 
along with 11 th lord and if he is weak, loss will be indicated. 

In 12 th along with 12 th lord loss, Lagna lord gives unhappy 
life and foreign place are indicated 

There is hardly any difference between the Bhava Phala 
except that here we have to see the strength of both house lord 
and the lord occupying that house. This along with rules for 
Dasha analysis is to be combined to arrive at the final result of 
the results of Dasha. 

I have given only general idea about the concpet of as to 
how to read dasha phala basing on the position of dasha lord. 
Througout the text the Sage elobrately gives many results of 
each bhava having gained strength by placement of its own 
lord and then associated by different dasha lords. The principle 
is the house and the dasha lord both must be strong to give 
good effects of the Bhava. 



88 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

In the above example birth star for Lagna cusp is 
Revathi. The Rahu Dasha falling 7 th Tara Dasha was not 
good for native. Jupiter Dasha as 8 th /8 th and Sun Bhukti 
as 4 th Tara Dasha was good, 

Rahu is posited in 8 th and is associated with 9 th lord 
and 2 nd lord Mars. The 6 th lord Sun who is also signficator 
of father is also associated with the Dasha lord Rahu. 
Sun aspects 2 nd house. Mars aspect 11 th house, 2 nd house 
and 3 rd house. Rahu aspects 12 th house, 4 th house. Native 
drifted from his educational career. He had bad friends 
and spent money of father creating trouble to father. 
His mother also struggled hard with worries about the 
native's career. During this period he was sent out of 
home and joined in Airforce. There also native could not 
stay long and somhow returned. Though these couple 
of months he earned money that is due to effect of 9 th 
house indicating government and also Sun who 
reprensets govet. Mars who is 9 th lord and also 2 nd lord 
having aspect on his own house, again made him to 
resume to studies during this Dasha. 

Jupiter Dasha lord of 1 and 10 posited in upachaya 
3 rd house has changed the course of life of native. Jupiter 
aspects 11 th house and 7 th house and also 9 th house. He 
also apsects 4 th lord 7 th lord, 5 th lord and 3 rd and 8 th lord. 
He got a job in foreign firm. However the placement of 
Jupiter in 3 rd which is vyaya sthana to 4 th and having a 
link to Moon which becomes a Maraka stana 2 nd to 4 th 
house and Jupiter himself as 10 th lord is a Maraka to 4 th 
house as 7 th lord. These have resulted in death of mother. 

The scribe has given examples applying the general 
principles and with greater precision if theese rules are applied 
with necessary modificaitons as per other classical texts this 
system will be very much useful. 

The Sage goes on to prescribe rules to determine the results 
of sub period lords. The duration part of sub period lords is 



Classical Naadi Systems: Dhruva Naadi based - Satya Jaataka 89 

same as conventional computation but the order of sub period 
is set in a unique way by considering the strength of the planets. 
In general the Bhukti lord will give results as follows subject to: 

If he is in own sign 

If he is in friendly sign 

If he is in exaltation sign 

If he is in trikona to his own house 

He will give results of houses owned and occupied by him. 

The result of the house in which he is transiting at the time 
his Bhukti period 

The nature of results will be: 

Bad results if he is a functional malefic according to 
assessment of Pancha Sidhhantika. 

Good results if he is functional benefic according to 
assessment of Pancha Sidhhantika. 

If he gains mixed effects the results will also be mixed. 

Most important point 

In this section the Sage propounds that the Dasha 
lord will not yield results in his own Bhukti according to 
his disposed nature but will continue to give the nature 
of results of previous Bhukti. 

This rule with half-baked essence is carried down to 
traditional astrology and is mis-interpreted to give an idea that 
Dasha lord will not give his results in his own Bhukti But the 
truth is Dasha lord will not give results in harmony with his 
nature during his Bhukti. In case if he gives then he will not 
continue to give the results according to his nature through the 
Bhukti lords. 

When there is a benefic results pushed through by Dasha 
lord the Bhukti lord even if entitled to give malefic results will 



90 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



be silent on malefic effects. There is a peculiar way: Dasha lord 
disposed to give benefic results if placed in the midst of malefic 
planets he tends to give malefic results at certain stage. On the 
contrary if he is a malefic Dasha lord if placed in the midst of 
benefic planets he is bound to give some good results at certain 
stage. 

If Dasha lord is a Maraka planet and in his Dasha the Bhukti 
lord representing 8 th house if operates will cause death of the 
native. If that Bhukti lord is a Maraka planet death may not 
take place. Dasha Bhukti lord representing vice versa of above 
houses also result in similar results. 

The Sage exemplifies his stand by an example

This indicates writing job in Law institution of a foreign country 



During Dasha of Mars and Bhukti of Jupiter and during 
gochara of Jupiter in Cancer the native will be appointed as 
Legal writer relating to foreign land and will earn money with 
gains, 

Please note that the Sage takes Lagna from Rashi 
chart and the position of Navasmsa is also considered 
from Rashi Lagna. That is Rashi tulya Navasmsa method. 

In Amsha Venus is in Kanya which is actually Kendra to Lagna. 
A Shubha planet being in Kendra to Lagna is a good sign. Though 
Venus is debilitated the effect is taken from Rashi Lagna. Thus 
when Jupiter transiting in Cancer there is a link of Jupiter and 
Mars in Scorpio in Amsha and in Rashi charts Mars aspects 
Jupiter in transit. In Mars Dasha in Moon Bhukti, the native 
loses much of his earnings. This is due to the fact that Moon is 



92 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

placed in Taurus which is actually 12 th to Mithuna Lagna. From 
12 th the Moon aspects 6 th house which Is house of enemies. For 
Dasha Lord the Bhukti lord is placed in 8 th place. Thus due to 
enemies he will lose the earnings. 

The Sage brings the effect of Dasha Bhukti phala by 
introducing the Amsha position of planets in relation to Rashi 
Lagna. 

The Sage has given in detail about the Dasha phala 
presuming that both the Dasha lord and the Bhava lord having 
strength, delineates the results. This is similar to Bhava phala 
which is enumerated earlier. The only difference is we need to 
assess both Dasha lord and Bhukti lords for their strength and 
then relate it to the Bhava where these periods lords indicate 
the houses. 

It would be simply repetition with little details of Dasha 
lords, which I feel will only add up to volume of the book being 
repetitive in nature. Therefore I conclude this work with due 
respect to the Sage and the legendary authors who have given 
us the English version of this monumental work. 



Classical Naadi System 

Chandra Kala Naadi 
Deva Keralam 



1800 divisions of 360 degrees, each division of 0:12:00 
minutes that makes 150 division of a sign is the smallest division 
stipulated in Chandra Kala Naadi, This is also known as Deva 
Keralam the name suggests its origin in southern part of India 
that is Kerala, This work has contribution by two authors Achyuta 
and Venkatesha comprising of total 8200 slokas. 

Unless the birth time is accurate to 48 seconds the Naadi 
Amsha cannot precisely be applied and verified with the results 
thereof. For this there are number of obstrutive components: 

First and foremost is the decision of Birth time - This is 
always debatable whether the birth is appearance of the head, 
cutting of umbilical cord or first breath or weeping of child or is 
it conception time and what not. Even if unanimously agreed 
upon one such component then the crooked clock menace 
differing in time from instrument to insturment and the very 
standard time and local time factor because of dispute of Sunrise 
decision, apparent rays of Sun as rising time, appearance of tip 
of disk of Sun or center portion at horizon. Despite hoping 
successful ending of this circus, we have another infinite meters 
length hurdle called Ayanamsha with nothing less than 19 to 20 
versions claiming to be correct leaving the students and 
astrological fraternity in confusion. Surmounting these barriers 
to find accuracy of birth time to a tune of 48 mintues is next to 
impossible. However by mere tallying some of the results of 
Naadi Amsha claiming correctness of birth time is a limited 
experimental procedure.

Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keralam 99 



Except a few there seems to be interchanged names for 
the numbers in the above Amshas. Most of the names relates 
to female goddess Lalita, Durga, Lakshmi and some of them 
relates to few puranic names. Vernacular pronouciations may 
also have been contributed to differing names. 

Umpteen number of combination results are given for birth 
lagna amshas and planetary amshas. A structured approach to 
this method is possible only when the entire work is reorganised 
with a scholarly research orientiation having command over 
both Sanskrit and astrology subject and having original Sanskrit 
verses. Indeed legendary R Santanam's work is great for having 
gifted this translated version. There is no use of reproducing 
his work claiming to be a prediction system of Chandra Kala 
Naadi because, the scholar has done wonderful work by 
translating the monumental work. The scribe keeping the spirit 
of the translator would like to pickup only the general principles 
enumerated in this great work which are applicable universally 
in traditional astrology so that this piece of work may be useful 
to the reader. However we shall commence this work by 
reproducing a few Amsha theory from the begenning slokas of 
1 st Volume. 

Sloka 1 and 2: Vasudhamsa: Birth in this Amsha: 

00:00:00 to 00:12:00 or 29:48:00 to 30:00:00 or 15:00:00 to 
15:12:00 of Movable, Fixed or Dual respectively. One born in 
the first half of Maalini Amsha (no reference to this Amsha) 
with Jupiter in Kaalakoota Naadi Amsha 00:36:00 to 00:48:00 
with Matanga yoga (Jupiter exalted, being in Pisces Navamsa 
that is he should be in 26:40 to 30 Degrees along with Venus 
and Moon for Matanga yoga) will give red complexion and 
auspiciousness. 

Now see the contradictions and confusions in this 
very first sloka. There is no reference to Maalini Amsha 
in the 150 Amshas. If Matanga yoga is formed Jupiter 
cannot be in Kaalakoota Amsha 

Subsequent sloka mentions only Matanga yoga. 
Does it replace the Vasudhamsa? 



100 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Sloka 3: Malefics in trine from the Moon while Saturn is 
with Rahu, native born in Maalini Amsha indicates the impure 
family of low level, 

Sloka 4-5: Effects of Matanga Yoga: Born in Matanga yoga 
with Maalini Amsha will not have own siblings and may have 
step siblings. Native's father will have three wives. Native's 
mother is long lived and his sister will have blemish character. 
Mother will be devoted and chaste in character. She will be 
deprived of family happiness and will be troubled due to 
destruction of her brother. Her husband will be long lived. 

It is Cancer Ascendant and Jupiter is 9 th lord being in Moon 
ascendant along with Venus and Moon. Venus is 4 th lord and 
Moon Lagna lord. 9 th lord is father 4 th lord represent mother 
and Moon is karaka for mother indicates two mothers to the 

native. 

Important: Above sloka gives a clue to find out number 
of wives to a person. Similarly this can be seen for siblings etc., 
using the respective house and karakas. 

Sloka 6-7: As earlier said father is long lived and mother 
is grieved due to destruction of her brother due to presence of 
Jupiter in Matanga yoga and Matanga Amsha (No reference to 
this Amsha). One of her sisters will be long lived while other 
siblings die early. 

Sloka 8-13 V2: Person born in Matanga yoga will like 
union with his spouse only. His wife will become a widow due to 
separation and will die. Native will lose his father in child hood. 

Suddenly there is a shift from Cancer to Aries. 

If Moon is in Srikaara Naadi Amsha ( you don't find this in 
the Amsha list- but the translator has equated this with Karikara 
Amsha 6:24:00 to 6:36 for Movable sign but in the list it is 
under Chandra Kala Naadi and with reference to C G Rajan 
version it falls in Kaalamsha) becoming lord of 4 th (Aries 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi -Deva Keralam 101 

Ascendant) occupying Scorpio or Capricorn Navamsa having 
aspect of Jupiter as 9 th Lord (Aries ascendant) and the native 
born in Durbhaga Naadi Amsha that is 11:48:00 to 12:00:00 
will not have younger brothers. He will have lonely sister long 
lived. Mother will also live long. Natives born in Durbhaga Naadi 
Amsha will have one sister with ill fortune. Father may have 
two marriages and step brothers of the native will be destroyed. 
Father of the native will prosper after 15 th year of native. Father 
may have business visit to foreign countries dealing in diamonds, 
grains and clothes having commercial vocation and will have 
siblings. 

Sloka 14 to 16: The place denoted by addition of degrees 
of 4 th lord and Sun, if transited by Saturn will result in destruction 
of father. For a person born in first half of Maalini Naadi Amsa 
with Matanga yoga the first sub period of Janma Dasha will 
prove dangerous for father. 

(Author also adds up another clue that 5 th house denotes 
death of Mother and if Saturn transits In the place derived by 
adding Degrees of Moon and 5 th lord, death of mother can be 
predicted.) 

(The Janma Dasha is the count from Nakshatra Siddhanta 
of Satyacharya where in the birth star assessment is essential. 
Please see Dhruva Naadi chapter.) 

This is how the Naadi amshas are expounded throughout 
the volume. However, there are number of secret formulae like 
the one explained for death of father and mother in the above 
paragraph. Focused study of the entire text is essential to pick 
up such formulae and logically adopt them to universal 
application in traditional or naadi astrology. 

The scribe has picked up the universally applicable principles 
from these volumes and incorporated in this section with example 
wherever it is possible. 



102 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

General principles from Chandra Kala Naadi: 

Book-2 nd part, sloka 26 onwards 

Malavya yoga: Venus being in own house or in his sign of 
exaltation falling in kendra to a lagna will cuase this yoga: This 
yoga bestows the person with all the richies like convyeance, 
position and knowledge. The yoga caused by Venus being exalted 
in a kendra to a Lagna that is for Sagittarius, Pisces, Gemini and 
Virgo, if the dispositor Jupiter is associated with a malefic planet 
or if ill placed the yoga will get cancelled. Normally this 
cancellation of yoga will also occur if Venus is ill disposed in 
navamsha. 

This is a part of Panchamahapurusha yoga well 
known to astrologers. The other mahapurusha yogas 
are given below; 

Hamsa yoga: Jupiter in his own or exalted house 
falling in Kendra to a Lagna. All the four Lagna in dual 
signs having Jupiter posited in his own sign will cause 
thisyoga. Aries, Capricorn, & Libra as ascendants Jupiter 
in Cancer as exalted place will cause this yoga. 

The person will be righteous in his deeds, will have 
attractive body and will be liked by all. He will have 
auspicious marks on his sole. 

If Jupiter is eclipsed by Sun or if he is hemmed 
between Saturn and Mars or if he is ill placed in 
Navamsa, this yoga will give adverse results. 

Sasa Yoga: Saturn in his own house or in Libra falling 
as Kendra to Lagna will cause this Yoga. For Libra 
ascendant Saturn in Capricorn and vice versa(due to 
exalted place), for Scorpio Saturn in Aquarius, for Cancer 
Saturn in Libra or in Capricorn, for Leo Saturn in Aquarius 
for Aries Saturn in Capricorn or in Libra, for Taurus 
ascendant Saturn in Aquarius will cause this Yoga. 

While Saturn in exalted place if Venus is debilitated 
or conjunct with Sun or Moon and badly placed in 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadl - Deva Keralam 103 



horoscope or Navamsa this yoga will give very bad 
results. 

Results: will have faithful servants, he may lead a 
village or town but will be grabbing others properties 
or even steel their belongings. He may not cultivate good 
character. 

In the event of malefic influence this may worsen 
and he may lose properties and also earn bad name. 

Ruchaka yoga: Mars in his exalted house (Capricorn) 
or in his own house falling Kendra to any Lagna will 
gain this yoga. For Cancer, Libra and Aries, Mars in 
Capricorn will give this yoga but if Saturn is in Aries or 
if he is associated with Rahu, Ketu, Moon or Mercury 
and be placed in bad houses or if he is ill placed in 
Navamsa this yoga will give adverse results. For Taurus, 
Mars in Scorpio and for Libra Mars in Aries. For Capricorn 
Mars in Aires for Leo Mars in Scorpio also gives Ruchaka 
yoga. If there be association of Mercury or Ketu or Rahu 
this yoga may not give good results. 

Results: Well-built personality, a fighter, he will have 
traditional values for his birth place and will be 
disciplined with charitable disposition. With good 
longevity he will be equal to a kind.

In the above horoscope the native has Mars in his exalted 
place. But he is with Mercury and the dispositor Saturn is placed 
in Leo an enemy sign and is having an aspect with Rahu. In 
Navamsa Saturn is in Cancer an enemy sign along with Mercury 
and having aspect of Sun. Thus the native had reverse effect of 
Ruchaka yoga. He has a weak body with bad immune system. 
He had to struggle hard in his professional life. He is afraid to 
encounter people. 

Bhadra yoga: Mercury when he is in own house 
Gemini or exalted in his other house Virgo will cause 
this Yoga. Unless very badly afflicted or if he is placed 
very badly in Navamsa this yoga will make him a 
gentleman and will be generous in helping his relatives 
and earn a good name and make others happy with his 
company.

Mercury being exalted in natal chart and is having 
an aspect of Jupiter and it is in 7 th house. In Navamsa 
though he is placed in 8 th from Navamsa Lagna he has 
the aspect of Jupiter from Aquarius. 

The native enjoyed the Bhadra yoga and he is well known 
among the friends and relative circles as a good companion 
and a party guy. He is helpful to his relatives. 



106 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Note: We must actually take the strength of the 
planet, in the chart and also assess the yoga and avayoga 
according to Parasara before we predict the results of 
Panchamahapurusha yoga. When a planet becomes 
Dosha as per Parasara yogavali rules the 
Panchamahapurusha yoga cannot be attributed. A yoga 
karaka may get this yoga to further strengthen his yoga 
effect. 

Book 2 part 2 sloka 28 onwards: 

Very bad results are to be expected involving poverty and 
misery when all planets exalted in Lagna chart and debilitated 
in Navamsa. 

A planet debilitated in Lagna and exalted in Navamsa is an 
indication of progressive happiness. Vargottama planet will give 
good results, provided the house happens to be favorable 

More number of planets getting exalted in Dusthanas is an 
indication of miserable life and their ill position in Navamsa will 
worsen the case. 

More planets being posited in their own signs will produce 
desirable good results and it will be more effective in granting 
comfortable life if they happen to be in Yoga karaka signs in 
Navamsa. Contrary positions in Navamsa will cause difficult living. 

Book 2 - 2 nd Part sloka 33 onwards 

Adhi yoga: 

From Chandra or from Janma Lagna if benefics are in 6 th 
7 th and 8 th house this yoga is formed. This yoga gives powerful 
position, strength to conquer enemies and good health. 

Comment: Though there are divergent views about 
the Lagna Adhi yoga and Chandra Adhi yoga, the scribe 
prefers to original recommendation of Chandra Kala 
Naadi for this yoga.

Considering from Lagna the benefic planets Mercury, 
Venus Jupiter in 6 th 7 th 8 th as shown above is possible. 
Sun can be in 6 th or 7 th or 8 th or 9 th (because malefics 
allowed in 9 th ). 5 th is to be vacant. Now according to 
author the Moon should have brilliant rays. That means 
he should be at least 5 signs away from the Sun. Then 
Lagna adhi yoga is possible. 

If we consider Chandra Adhi yoga, Moon by default 
gets brilliant rays as Sun will be considerably far away 
from the Moon, since 5 th should be vacant, the Sun can 
occupy 6 th , 7 th 8 th or 9 th house as said above. 
Subsequently it is said that if Sun and Moon involve in 
this yoga, this is possible when Sun is exactly opposite 
to Moon where they have relationship due to mutual 
aspect, the yoga gain full strength and excellent results 
are produced.

Fortunately Janma Lagna and Chandra Lagna of the native 
fall in Cancer. The 5 th is vacant. In 6 th Venus and Jupiter, in 7 th 
Mercury, Mars and Sun are posited. Despite a malefic planet 
Mars in ,7 th , having full Moon in Lagna, the native enjoyed this 
yoga during Moon period which occurred after retirement. This 
yoga gave him recognition and name in occult knowledge. The 
involvement of Mars along with Mercury has given him the writing 
ability. 



Book 2 Part 2 sloka 40 onwards: 

1, Strong Saturn being vargottama or in yoga karaka Amsha 
associated in birth chart with Venus will give intelligence, 
fame, wealth and skills to complete the jobs assigned to 
him by authorities. He will be lustful. 

2. Similarly strong Saturn as above with benefics will bestow 
excellent raja yoga. 



Classicai Naadi Systems: Chandra Kafa Naadi - Deva Keralam 109 

3. Debilitated malefics and exalted benefics as lords of 9 th 
and 10 th and posited in angles are trines will bestow high 
authority like that of a king with fame and longevity. 

Explanation: The scribe has explained this in his 
work on Naadi system "Revelation from Naadi Jyotisha", 
that strong Saturn association with Venus is an 
indication of good yoga for wealth. According to this 
Mercury, Venus, Jupiter association to Saturn will 
indicate a royal life with good and smooth profession, 
when Sun also joins with them the person will raise high 
position with name and fame. 

The 3 rd point has a clue towards hidden meaning of 
dictums in Jaataka Chandrika, Malefic when owns a 
Kona house the other house not being papa house, they 
tend to get Dosha. This is not apparent in translated 
dictums. Some scholars have logical explanation and 
proved this to be perfectly working. Such Dosha planets 
must be in Kendra or Kona from their own house (not 
from Lagna as indicated). This gives them yoga karaka 
position. When they get exalted they gain the malefic 
nature. Therefore they should not get exalted. Benefic 
planets when they appear as Kona lords their exaltation 
become an additional benefic point to bestow good 
results. (But not when they become Dosha planet). 
There are number of rules to identify the Yoga karaka 
for a particular Lagna which supersedes the generalized 
yoga karaka listed in astrological texts. The scribe is 
planning to come out with a special edition on this 
subject.) However in the above sloka there is a clue 
about this by mentioning debilitation of malefic planets. 

Example illustrating the ill-effect of exalted Mars 
who is supposed to be a yoga karaka for Cancer 
ascendant in general.

1. Mars as lord of 5 th a Kona and 10 th a Kendra is 
generally considered yoga karaka for Cancer 
Ascendant. 

2. In Mercury Dasha and Mars Bhukti in 1965, the 
native had to abandon his education and wandered 
without aim and spoiled his career. 

3. In Ketu Dasha Mars Bhukti in 1975 he had health 
problems and joined a small job involving hardwork 
and suffered humiliations. 

4. In Venus Dasha Mars Bhukti 1986 he had terrible ill 
health problems wherein he had to run pillar to post 
to get a job and maintain it. He failed miserably and 
his condition was pitiable. 

5. In Sun Dasha and Mars Bhukti during 2001 he had 
to suffer mental tensions due to ill health and other 
family matters and had to resign job. 

6. In Moon Dasha and Mars Bhukti he had severe health 
problems. 

All these because of his exaltation, he has also 
contributed in material benefits just because he is with 
Mercury there-by his exalted effects are reduced. In his 
Maha Dasha as ruler he will have powers to give rise as 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kaia Naadi - Deva Keralam 111 

yoga karaka being conjunct with a functional malefic 
and getting associated with Sun as the 2 nd lord. But he 
will equally give his malefic effects of exaltation though 
controlled. 

Mere being the lord of Kona and Kendra it cannot 
be construed as Yoga karaka. The positional and 
relational dignities and other technicalities are to be 
considered for correctly identifying the yoga karaka. 

Book 2 Part 2 - Sloka 44 onwards; 

Childlessness: 

A malefic in 5 th house associated or having aspect with 
Saturn and the 5 th lord placed in 6 th or 8 th house with a malefic 
or with an aspect of malefic will deprive the birth of Son. 

Not having malefics in 5 th house if the 5 th lord is strong in 
all aspects, the native will get progeny, mighty and happy 
professional life with wealth and gains. 

In the previous example horoscope, the 5 th house is 
clean and has no malefic influence. 5 th Lord is exalted 
and placed in 7 th another house of children. He is having 
aspect of full Moon as not only Lagna lord but also as 
powerful benefic. According to Phala Deepika benefic 
posited in 2 nd to any house will fortify the good effects 
of the house. 5 th house in the above chart is having two 
natural benefic planets Jupiter and Venus in Sagittarius 
which is 2 nd to 5 th house. Involvement of female planets 
and the association of Male planets have all contributed 
and the native has two issues one male and one female. 

Book 2 part 2 sloka 46 onwards: 

Whether exalted or debilitated 5 th lord getting Vargottama 
Amsha or if debilitated having benefic aspect or 5 th Lord being 
in his own sign, the native will have yoga for getting status, 
riches and happiness.

This is a simple Bhava analysis procedure. More 
details can be studied in Phala Deepika and Bhavartha 
Ratnakara. 

Book 2 part 2 sloka 52 onwards 

Pisces being a trine to Lagna and Jupiter being posited 
along with Moon or with aspect of Moon, the native will prosper 
from 16 th year of age. 

Sloka 54: Aroodha pada: 

Parasara and Jaimni texts deals with Aroodha pada. 
Jaimini astrology discuss this issue in detail and contains 
intelligent predictive modules. 

Aroodha is the sign position counted from a bhava 
to the position of bhava lord and again counting the 
same number from Lord and ariving the Aroodha pada. 
This Aroodha pada is a mirror which reflects the Bhava 
of its origin.

Count the number of signs from Lagna to Lagna lord 
sign and then count from Lagna lord same number of 
houses. Similarly all Bhavas has to be counted. Note that 
the same house or 7 th house cannot be Aroodha pada. 
In such case count 10 th from the bhava and note as 
Aroodha pada. If 4 th becomes Aroodha pada 4 th itself 
will be Aroodha pada. 

We will find out the Aroodha pada for 12 houses for 
the previous example horoscope: 

Lagna is Cancer and lagna lord is in lagna itslef 
therefore 10 th from it becomes Aroorda; 

That is Aries is Lagna Aroodha pada 

(the native's nature is hot tempered and had to put 
hard work in life) 

2 nd house is Leo and the Lord Sun is 6 houses away 
from 2 nd house. 6 th house from Sun is Gemini. 

That is Gemini is Dhana Aroodha pada 

(native's earnings relates to accouting and writing 
he will engage in subjects relating to metaphyscial and 
arts due to aspect of Jupiter and Venus.) 

3 rd house is Virgo and the lord Mercury is 5 houses 
away from 3 rd house. Counting 5 houses from Capricorn, 
Taurus is Aroodha pada 

That is Taurus is Vikrama Pada 

(the native though enthusiatic in nature, he is soft 
in approach. Taurus is a female sign and lord Venus is 
also female. Therefore native has only two sisters.) 

4 th house is Libra and the lord is in 3 rd house from it. 
From Venus 3 rd house is Aquarius 

That is Aquarius is Sukha pada 

(the native had to struggle hard for happiness, and 
his mother overcame many difficult situations) 



114 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

5 th house is Scorpio and the Lord Mars is 3 rd to 
Scorpio. From Mars 3 rd house is Pisces. 

That is Pisces is Putra pada: 

(Incidentally the native's son and daughter both are 
born in Pisces Lagna.) 

6 th house is Sagittarius and the lord Jupiter is posited 
in the same house. Therefore 10 th from it that is Virgo 
becomes the A rood ha pada. 

That is Virgo is Roga pada 

(Ironically, the native has very large number of 
friends circle yet there are enmity factors and suffered 
nerves and digestive health problems.) 

7 th house is Capricorn the lord Saturn is 8 th from it 
that is Pisces is Aroodha pada. 

That is Pisces is Dara pada 

(Wife of native is Pisces Lagna) 

8 th house is Aquarius the lord Saturn is 7 th from it. 
Therefore 10 th from 7 th will be Aroodha pada 

That is Scorpio is Mrityu Aroodha pada 

(Right from child hood the native suffered with 
violent attacks and met with accidents and suffered lot) 

9 th house is Pisces and Jupiter the lord is 10 th from 
it. 10 th from Jupiter is Virgo. 

That is Virgo is Pitru pada 

(Native's father also worked as clerk and he was 
also interested in writing dramas etc.) 

10 th House house is Aries and Lord Mars is 10 th from 
it. Libra is Aroodha pada 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keralam 115 



That is Libra is Karma pada. 

(Libra represents commercial place and the native 
worked in private commercial organizations in finance 
and accounts dept) 

11 th House is Taurus and the lord Venus is in 8 th from 
it. From Venus 8 th is Cancer. 

That is Cancer is Labha pada 

(Being an enemy to Venus, the Moon has not given 
any material benefit to native) 

12 th House is Gemini the lord is in 8 th from it. 8 th 
from Mercury is Leo is Aroodha pada. 

(Native had to spend away all his earnings, there 
was no help from father's side as Sun is karaka for 
father) 

Now let us see what the Chandra Kala Naadi says about 
Padas. 

One will enjoy prosperity and fame if Venus is having 
relationship with Aroodha pada of Lagna or to 9 th house by 
aspect or association. 

Native's Aroodha Lagna pada is Aries and Venus does 
not have any relationship. 9 th house is Pisces and even 
then the Venus is not having any relationship by aspect 
but he is having relationship with the lord of 9 th . Off- 
course native got a two wheeler, a house and a land but 
all lost. This is due to relationship took place in 6 th house 
and badly influenced by Rahu from 10 th . 

If Venus is 11 th from Aroodha Lagna having strength and 
good aspect or Venus be in the ascendant with Moon it will 
grant conveyances and good position 

Lagna Aroodha is Aries and the Venus is not in 11 th 
to it. Nothing good happened.

Book 2 part 2 sloka 55 onwards 

Lakshmi yoga: 

Most malefic planets Saturn and Mars in upachaya especially 
in 3 rd house and another upachaya house 6 th occupied by Sun. 
Benefic occupy Kendra or Kona especially Jupiter in Lagna, Venus 
in 5 th and Moon having full strength and exalted causes Lakshmi 
yoga. Since Rahu and Ketu are malefic in nature they are good 
in in other upachaya houses. 

Note: This indicates the general principle of 
traditional astrology where benefic results are to be 
predicted if Benefic occupying Kendra and Kona while 
malefic occupy upachaya houses and Moon having 
strength 



Book 2 part 2 sloka 60 onwards:

If any one of the conditions is not fulfilled the yoga 
may not fructify. If the pivotal Moon itself is weak and 
placed in 8 th or 12 th then it may turn out to be Avayoga 
causing miserable situations. 

Book 2 Part 2 sloka 69 onwards 

Effects of Three planets: 

If there are three exalted planets in a horoscope the person 
will be highly intelligent. If three planets occupy own signs he 
will have political status. If three planets are in debilitation and 
not qualified to be in yoga, it indicates dull headed person 
suffering in life. 

This also is a generalized combination, the exaltation 
and debilitation are linked to yoga dignities considered 
differently for each ascendant. Author hints about this 
referring to debilitated planet participating results in 
avayoga. 



Book 2 part 2 sloka 70 onwards

yoga which is possible for three Lagnas:

Note: the effect of this yoga may be reduced or 
nullified or modified due to influence of malefic planets 
or due to association of functional dignities of planets. 



Book 2 part 2 sloka 80 onwards 

Results of Sun through Navamsa position: 

Sun in dual signs falling in 4 th pada division denoting 
Capricorn, Cancer and Aries Navamsa will reduce the life span. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Kerafam 1 19 

The Pisces as dual sign is not mentioned in the text, 
though Sun gets Libra Navamsa here. In the above cases 
Aries is the exalted sign of Sun and the rest of them or 
4 th and 10 th Kendra houses. The logic here is exalted 
Sun and its Kendra are considered omitting the 
debilitation sign of Sun placed in 8 th position in Navamsa 
Sun is strong enough to afflict longevity. In Libra he 
will be weak. 

Book 2 part 2 sfoka 81 onwards 

The effects of Sun and Saturn through their positions: 

Dangers to father and to paternal relations are to be 
predicted if Sun is in 12 th or Saturn in Aswini Nakshatra or if 
posited in 3, 7, 11 or 10 th from Lagna 

This is generalized effect. There is a dictum that if 
Karaka is in 12 th the effective relative will thrive. This 
dictum from Bhavartha Ratnakara stands for repeated 
test. 

However the position of Sun in 12 th may denote 
differently depending upon its lordship to particular 
Lagna. Therefore, this simply by taking Sun in 12 th does 
not indicate danger to father or paternal relatives. 

Sun in Aswini Nakshatra, the only reason found to 
support the author's dictum is that in Aswini star Sun 
gets exalted. The space factor of blessed place of Sun is 
afflicted by Malefic. 

If Saturn is posited in 3 rd and 7 th it aspects 9 th palce denoting 
father. From 11 th he throws his aspect on Lagna, 5 th house and 
8 th house. 8 th is 12 th to 9 th and 11 th house is house of longevity 
for father and 5 th house becomes house of native. 11 th also 
indicates paternal relatives. Thus these houses are under the 
spell of Saturn as powerful malefic. 

These are generalized effects in Bhava analysis. 
Other components needs to be considered before 
prediction. 



120 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Death of father: 

From Lagna if Moon is in 5 th havng aspect of Mars and 
Saturn, the 1 st Dasha of the native will cause danger to father. 
Timing of event can be further pin pointed by the sub period 
lord who should be dispositor to Dasha lord in Dasamasa.

Ketu Dasha- 13-8-1929 to 13-08-1936 
Mercury Bhukti 17-8-1935 to 13-08-1936 

The native had lost her father during February 22 1936 
that is when she was only 5 years old. Moon is in 5 th from Lagna 
along with Saturn and Mars is having aspect on Moon. 
Incidentally Mars is also 9 th Lord placed 6 th from his own 9 th 
house along with Ketu. 

The running dash at that time was Ketu and Antar 
Dasha is of Mercury who is the dispositor of Ketu the 
Dasha lord in Virgo Dasamasa. Antara of Mars was 
running at the time of death. Mars is in Mercury 
Dasamasa who in Amsha chart links both Dasha and 
Bhukti lord in Dasamasa. 

Not necessarily this yoga should only indicate early 
death of father, this is one of such rules rarely seen in 
horoscopes. The Karmamsa is of important factor, and 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keralam 121 

other factors of longevity from the father's horoscope 
are essential to decide. 

Book 2 part 2 sloka 92 onwards 

Venus posited in 5 th or 2 nd and the dispositor that is the 
sign lord of 5 th or 2 nd is strong then, royal favours are predicted. 

2 nd lord strongly placed in 7 th while Moon in 2 nd while Mercury 
placed in Aries and exalted Venus along with Sun, will make the 
native live long with wealth, ruler ship, scholarly disposition 
and fame and pleasures having dual spouse. 

Out of 6 th , 8 th and 12 th lords two of them are placed in 
mutual aspect or if all of them interchange their houses it should 
be Raja yoga. This is what is known as Vipareeta raja 
yoga irrationally followed by astrologers. 

Short life: 

Conjunction of 6 th and 8 th lord in aspect or association of 
Saturn results in short life: (8 th lord and Saturn association gives 
long life when 6 th relationship is not there) 

Love affair with married woman 

Venus posited in 3, 7, 11 hsving an aspect or conjunction 
with a malefic the native involves in love affair with a married 
woman and depends on women for his livelihood. 

Note: Not always the above combination seems to be 
working. Venus even if posited in 6 th having benefic and malefic 
association love with married woman has been recorded, (though 
not dependent on her earnings.) 

Book 2 part 2 sloka 100 onwards 

Conjunction of Moon and Venus in Artha Trines that is 2, 6, 
10 indicates the royal favours from the daughter of elite 
personality. 



122 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

(Basically, such simple combinations adding up 
house matters do not function independently. Normally 
when Venus and Moon conjunct the native will lose 
money or will have lesser income. His wife will be spend- 
thrift and fickle minded. He will have artistic nature. In 
a woman's chart this combinations indicates the 
capricious nature of the lady. These Karakatwa based 
predictions repeatedly proved correct. The house level 
dignities must also fulfill other conditions to get the cited 
results.) 

Getting assocation of princes: 

Venus in 4 th , 7 th , 8 th or 12 th having a malefic influence or 
Venus exalted and posited in 7 th lord's Navamsa, the native 
gets union with a woman of elite circle. 

Alternatively the scribe observed: 

Venus having similar position and getting malefic 
influence and placed in 12 th lord's Navamsa should result 
in joining with other caste woman. It can also result in 
dual marital life. 

Getting Honour of royal type: 

9 th lord with maximum strength and having aspect of Moon 
and the trine or angle from Ascendant is posited by Mercury, 
the native will be very rich with fame and will have sons but 
deprived of brother. 

Self-realization: 

Exalted Lagna lord or Lagna lord getting Vargottama 
Navamsa and having aspect of Venus will have self-realization 
following Advaita doctrine.

Emancipation or salvation 

Jupiter or Venus in an Angie or trine falling in 12 th sign 
counted from Navamsa ascendant, the native will be relieved 
from mundane bonds and attain moksha.

Book 2 part 2 sloka 113 onwards 

Charitable, noble disposition of native: 

9 th Lord (preferably a benefic or friend to Jupiter) along 
with Jupiter occupy auspicious, friendly or exalted sign having 
a conjunction of another benefic or being in aspect to their 
dispositer, the native will be charitable and takes up welfare 
programs of many villages and gets the association of virtuous 
persons and earns a good name. Similar effects are to be 
predicted if Jupiter aspects Moon in 2 nd and Sun in 10 th . 

Book 2 Part 2 sloka 116 onwards: 

Yogas: 

(Kahala yoga is referred to here) 

Innumerable Yogas are elaborately discussed in Phala 
Deepika which is recommended for application in the horoscope. 
A planet attaining a yoga status will have powers to bestow 
good results during its period. Apart from giving the results of 
yoga it also gets modified in preventing other evil events 
indicated in the chart. However if any of these yoga becomes 
Ava yoga, then the planet not qualified as yoga karaka status in 
the chart will bring worst experiences to native. 

1. Excluding nodes and luminaries other planets occupy 
2 nd 12 th or both the houses from Moon, Sunapha, 
Anapha and Durdura Yogas are formed: In the 
absence of any one of this yoga it is known as 
Kemadruma yoga. 

Sunapha yoga confers kingly disposition with self- 
acquired property f wisdom. Anapha yoga confers 
health, power enthusiasm, reputation and courteous 
disposition. Durdura yoga gives vehicles and 
comforts and wealth. Contrarily Kemadruma yoga 
reverses and causes suffering and tends the native 
to commit sin. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keralam 125 

2. Except Moon other benefic planets when occupy 2 nd 
or 12 or both counted from Sun, shubhavesi, 
Shubhavasi, and Shubhayachari Yogas are formed. 
These Yogas confer meritorious, brave under 
shubhavesi, popularity and prosperity by Shubhavasi 
and Shubhayachari gives fame and eloquent 
speaking capability. Malefics forming this yoga 
reverses the good effects and gives evil effects. 

There are innumerable Yogas given in other classical 
texts and it is beyond the scope of this work to 
reproduce them. 

Aroodhadhipathi and Hora lagnadhipathi should be benefic 
and should be posited in benefic house to have overall wealthy 
and noted person among the relatives. 

A person will have luxurious vehicles if Moon in fixed Lagna 
having Jupiter in 2 nd or 11 th . 

When Jupiter influences the Lord of 4 th or 9 th royal favours 
and riches can be expected. On the contrary the malefic influence 
cause wrath from higher ups and loss in wealth. 

Native having Lagna lord in 11 th house and the dispositor 
of Lagna lord is n 9 th and 9 th lord is is in 10 th or along with 10 th 
or 2 nd lord, will have great fortune. 

(This supports the dispositor theory) 

Mani pravala Yoga: 

1. Benefic Planet must be exalted in 2 nd or 3 rd house while a 
malefic planet must be in debilitated condition anywhere in 
the horoscope. 

2. 4 th or 5 th house should have an exalted benefic. 

3. A malefic must get exalted in 8 th while a benefic should be 
in an exalted 9 th house. 



126 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Any one of the condition being fulfilled the person will have 
wealth and fortune. 

What will happen if one condition fulfills and the other 
condition reverses the position? There must be a yoga and then 
yoga bhanga. This is to be determined by the timing of events 
based on the planets involved. 

For any yoga to fructify the Dasha of the planet involved in 
yoga must operate. Therefore, the time factor of yoga is very 
important. 

Spouse & Marriage 

The lord of sign where Venus is posited in Navamsa if exalted 
in Lagna chart early marriage is indicated. Saturn placed in 7 th 
house will give marriage during ending time of his Dasha. 

Important clue: A planet during his Dasha will give 
the result of its dispositor and then the planet closely 
conjunct, of the planet in exchange with it, then the 
planets posited in Kendra, next planets posited in Kona, 
lastly planets posited in mutual aspect. Lastly the house 
occupied by it and houses under its aspect. 
Predominantly in all the house results the natural 
signification and its Bhava karaka significations 
influence the matter. 

Malefic in 7 th house and the 7 th lord is conjunct with another 
mafefic indicate the infected womb of wife causing conception 
problems. 

Note; 7 th house as space matter indicate the spouse. 
A malefic in it indicates defects in the body of the spouse 
being Lagna to spouse. 7 th lord is antarbhava the inner 
section and 7 th is also 4 th to 4 th and therefore, their 
associations with another malefic indicate the infection 
in the womb. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keralam 127 

One of the Jupiter's sign being 7 th house having 9 th lord 
posited in it and the Jupiter is placed in 10 th house with, a malefic 
the native will get a physically handicapped girl as wife. 

Note: For Gemini Ascendant 7 th house is Sagittarius, 
and for Virgo ascendant 7 th house is Pisces. For Gemini 
9 th lord is Saturn. 9 th house indicates thighs and Saturn 
indicates legs and being malefic in 9 th afflicts that part. 
For Virgo ascendant, 9 th house is Taurus which indicates 
neck portion and Venus indicates the same portion. 
Venus 9 th lord in Pisces again indicates feet. Venus is an 
enemy planet to Jupiter. In both the cases when the 
dispositor of 7 th Jupiter conjunct with a malefic posited 
in 10 th indicate affliction to legs in one case and in 
another case the extremities of shoulders. 

Conjunction of Rahu and Sun in 7 th house will cause two 
sickly wives. If Jupiter influences this they may be healthy. 

Similar effect can also be predicted if Saturn is in 7 th and 
Rahu in 9 th 

Lagna and 9 th house both are occupied by malefics and 
Moon is afflicted, the person may have multiple marriages. 

9 th house or the 2 nd house if occupied or having aspect of 
malefic and the lords of 9 th or 2 nd as the case may be if weak 
then the native will get remarriage. 

Good education: 

Strong 4 th lord or Mercury occupying Lagna or 
conjunct with Lord of Lagna without any malefic 
influence will indicate the intellectual background of the 
native with great learning abilities. 

Rahu in Lagna influenced by Saturn will cause fever, trouble 
from poison and fire or fear of imprisonment, skin diseases and 
the native may resort to secret evil acts and may trouble or get 
troubled from foreigners or foreign matters. 



128 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Book 2 part 2 sloka 479 onwards 

Sub periods of lords of 6 th and 8 th of any running Dasha 
native suffers from ill health during the days ruled by 6 th or 8 th 
lord as the case may be. Sun's transit in adverse signs indicates 
the month. Disease may commence on the week day ruled by 
Sub period or the Dasha lord. 

No auspicious results can be expected of a weak malefic 
planet's period. 

Effects of Dasha Lord: 

Book 2 part 2 sloka 423 onwards 

The strength of Dasha lord is considered here. 

In a strong Dasha lord's period all round prosperity can be 
expected by native. 

If he has average strength the efforts of the native will 
yield slow, or disturbed or negative results. If it has least strength 
native may lose his wealth, dignity, troubled family circumstances 
and ill health. In completely weak Dasha lord period, native 
may face crucial health, wealth and relational problem. 

Note: The strength here is not simply shadbala; it 
includes Adhipatya Bala which is directly related to yoga 
and Avayoga concept. A natural malefic attaining yoga 
status if exalted and gets full strength it loses its yoga 
capabilities and even turnout to be an Avayoga karaka. 
Therefore, the above generalized effect may suit if only 
natural Karakatwa of planets are considered during the 
period of Dasha planet. 

Dash of a planet is indicating the physical decay, if survives 
will have displeasures. A Dasha of a planet in the division of a 
yoga karaka will bestow desirable material benefits along with 
good relational happiness. If it is in the divisions of adverse 
planet all evil effects can be predicted. 



Classical Naadl Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Kerafam 129 



Note: Yoga planets as prescribed by Parasara, 
clarified by Jaataka Chandrika and Bhavartha Ratnakara 
with regard to Lagna based Adhipatya yoga dignities, 
Pancha Maha Purusha Yogas and planets involved in the 
yoga caused by luminaires are all to be considered when 
the amshas of Dasha planet in yoga karaka planet being 
decided. 

Dasha lord not having strength (subject to yoga karaka 
conditions) or placed in any one of evil houses 6, 8, 12 (not 
beng a house that promotes a planet to yoga status) or if it is 
associated or having apsect of dispositor of evil lords, loss of 
wealth and health can be predicted. The participation of evil 
lord as enemy to Dasha lord will cause distress due to enemies. 
Planets involved in causing evil effects will show their effect in 
their sub periods of the main Dasha lord. 

Jupiter in Pisces: 

Jupiter in Pisces will give knowledge, peace and 
virtue and the native will have royal patronage. Some 
other texts mention more favorable results. Basically 
this indicates preaching ability. 

Jupiter in 10 th 

10 th Jupiter indicates minister ship. Being in 10 th if it falls in 
Navamsa of a friend makes the native closer to royal dignities. 
In enemy Navamsa will face trouble from such elite persons. 
Apart from it being the 12 th sign in the natural zodiac it restricts 
sexual enjoyments but promotes scholarly disposition with wealth 
factors being Dhana karaka in own house. He will be inclined to 
charitable activities. 

If Jupiter gets the Navamsa of Saturn, the native may resort 
to irreligious activities and will be untruthful and develops 
disputes among friends, kith and kin. 

Note: This is just a common indication based on simple 
rule of Bhava analysis. The results are subjected to drastic 



1 30 Roots of Neadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



reverse in case this position attracts Avayoga due to different 
Lordship Jupiter rules. The effect of getting Saturn Amsha is 
biased opinion of malefic nature of Saturn. Without considering 
lordship effect merely on the malefic nature of Saturn the results 
cannot be confirmed. 

Jupiter in Libra Navamsa: 

He will have enmity with paternal uncle and will be close to 
children of maternal aunt. 

Book 2 part 2 sloka 461 onwards: 

Saturn transiting in Swati star will cause destruction of 
enemies. While Saturn in Swati Sun's transit in Capricorn through 
Pisces will help befriending enemies. Sun transiting in Aries will 
cause destruction of enemies. Sun's transit in Gemini will cause 
little distress but while transiting in Cancer all difficulties will be 
solved and success will prevail. 

Saturn transiting in Visakha will enable to reconcile with 
enemies and enjoy happiness. 

Saturn transiting in the 3 rd star counted from birth star 
(Note birth star not necessarily be from Moon. According 
to Satyacharya the birth Lagna or Moon whichever is 
stronger is to be considering as birth star) the native 
conquer enemies yet suffer from fear complex. In 4 th star the 
native may face difficulties due to external disturbances relating 
to that place and may involve in disputes with authorities. In 
2 nd and 4* star the death of elite circle may cause trouble to the 
native and his relatives. 

Note: There are references to mundane matters like 
social and political disturbances. Logically these matters 
cannot be studied from an individual horoscope. The 
scribe has taken the meaning of such mundane 
prediction and incorporated in individual matters. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadl - Deva Keraiam 131 

Some results are given for transit of Saturn in various 
Stars. 

In Birth star Saturn transit will raw* grief, rift with royals 
and unsteady financial progress.

of relatives, disputes with servants and short temperaments

in the body. 

In 8 th star - Union with friends, honour from elites, 
ornaments, conveyances and bed comforts 

In 9 th star- Will have royal friendship, association of virtuous 
people, gain of knowledge and will obey royal instructions, visits 
of kith and kin and enjoy good health 

Note: This is general odd and even star position as given in 
Tara Bala, This needs other considerations and cannot be taken 
strictly based on Saturn without assigning horoscope dignities. 

Saturn transiting in 12 th house 

If 12 th house happens to be of Venus or Mercury, then the 
native will contemplate on low caste woman or woman who 
aborted a child or a young girl attained puberty. He will be 
worried about progeny and may suffer from fever, phlegm, 
indigestion but gains materially.

Ardhashtama 4 th house transit, Ashtama 8 th house 
transit equally fearsome are deceptively warned to the 
clients in general. Worst possible maleficence 
significations are attributed to Planet Saturn. 
Innumerable incidents are noted with high profile 
progress during these periods to many nativities. 
Arguably the status of Saturn first entering on 12 th , 1 st , 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keralam 133 



2 nd house is compared with dignities like Rajata, Tambra, 
Swarna and Loha considering the transit position of 
Moon reckoned from birth Moon at the time of entry of 
Saturn in the these houses as follows: 

At the time of entry of Saturn in any of the houses 
12 th , 1 st , 2 nd to Moon if transit Moon is in: 

1 st , 6 th , 11 th to birth Moon Swarna Golden form 
Highly favorable. In 2 nd , 5 th , 9 th to birth Moon Rajata 
Silver form favorable. In 3 rd , 7 th , 10 th to birth Moon 
Tamara Copper form Unfavorable. In 4 th , 8 th , 12* to birth 
Moon Loha Iron form Highly unfavorable 

In the example horoscope the native had his second 
round of Saturn and in 12 th house when Saturn entered 
Moon was in 6 th and Saturn dignified as Swarna form.

In this period the native had changed job twice and 
both the changes were only good and got higher salaries, 
of-course there was little health problems which is of 
general nature. There have been problems in working 
environment. But nothing unfavorable as indicated by 
Loha form of Saturn happened. 

Transit of Saturn in Libra will take the form of Tamra 
which is lesser unfavorable than Loha. 

Not only that even the native's father had seven and 
a half year period and during its period he had name, 
fame and comfortable living though retired from service. 
No doubt he had health problems which are generally 
caused due to old age. 

Before jumping into conclusion attributing all evil 
significations to Saturn, it is better to closely study the 
horoscope and ensure the Dasha periods and overall 
strength of Lagna and the houses operative under Dasha 
bhukti lords. In Naadi Saturn is karma karaka, he is the 
most noblest planet who does not cause harm but simply 
transfers the effect of past deeds either good or bad. 
This logic seems to be very convincing and found that 
the transit of Saturn over Jupiter, gives a career 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keraiam 135 



upliftments, on Venus it promotes wealth factors and 
on Mercury knowledge and business factors. The scribe 
normally interlinks traditional Dasha bhukti and the 
transit position of Naadi to arrive at the quality of results 
by transit of Saturn. This would be safe factor instead 
of creating fear in clients by declaring all evils during 
Sade sati 

Diseases: 

Saturn transit over the sign which happens to be the 
Navamsa sign of Ketu, the person suffers from diseases causing 
pain etc. Recovery from such diseases will also be early. 

Note: This on verification found to be not fully 
applicable, whereas, if Saturn is transiting in a Navamsa 
sign of enemy planets and simultaneously in the natal 
chart if those enemy planets are posited in trine to this 
transiting sign or having aspect with Saturn or with a 
planet having aspect to Saturn diseases suffered by 
natives are invariably found correct. Again the Dasha of 
planets and its strength etc. are to be taken in to 
account. 

Saturn transiting in Aswini Makha or Moola while a malefic 
in natal planet is placed in these stars, great danger and diseases 
are. experienced by native: 

Note: This is also a general observation, but actually 
no such serious effects are found in many of the 
horoscope, instead when Saturn transits over natal Ketu, 
there have been problems of health and profession. 

Navamsa sign of 8 th lord to any given Bhava will yield bad 
results when Saturn transits the said Navamsa sign, 

Week days, birth star and related results: 

If the birth star of a person coincides with the weekday of 
birth then auspicious results are predicted. This is especially 



136 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

true if the birth star is benefic and the day lord is friendly to the 
birth star. 

Born on Monday the person will have liking for flowers, 
sexual enjoyment and happiness. 

On Tuesday - grief, self-destruction and quarrels 

On Wednesday - Learning, intoxication, wealth and 
enjoyments 

On Thursday - Physical happiness and wealth 

On Friday - sexual pleasures and happiness getting 
ornaments 

On Saturday - fear, diseases and difficulties 

The translator disagrees with the coinciding birth 
star with weekday and gives the following results on 
different weekdays. 

Birth on Sunday: 

With a life span of 60 years the native may encounter 
dangers in either 1 st or 6 th month or in 22 nd /23 rd year. 

Birth on Monday: 

11 th month, 26^/27* year may be dangerous he may live 
upto 84 years. 

Birth on Tuesday: 

He may face troubles in 2 nd or 22 nd year and suffer from ill 
health in his life and may live unto 74 years 

Birth on Wednesday: 

8 th month or 8 th year will be danger and will live 64 years 

Birth on Thursday: 

7 th month 13^/16* year will have problems and live unto 
84 years 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keralam 137 

Birth on Friday: 

Always healthy will have longevity unto 60 th year 

Birth on Saturday: 

1 st month and 13 th year will encounter danger and will live 
unto 100 years. 

Extending this one can also coincide the birth star 
and birth week and make good or bad predictions. 

Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and the stars 
of Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are benefit week 
days and benefic stars. 

Sunday, Tuesday and Saturdays and the stars of Sun, 
Mars, and Saturn are malefic days and stars. 

These snap shot predictions are generalized and this 
cannot be accounted for accuracy. 

Some of the General Principles from Book 3 

1 Navamsa dispositor of lords of 6 th , 8 th and 12 th happens to 
be natural benefic the enemies of native will get destructed. 

2 Spouse is represented by 7 th its lord and Venus. If 7 th lord 
is in debilitated Navamsa troubles to in-laws can be 
predicted. 

3 Strong Saturn having lords of 1 st , 8 th and 10 th in angles or 
trines or 11 th to ascendant, will indicate long life. 

4 Mars in Ascendant, Saturn in 8 th while 8 th lord is with Rahu 
will have a medium life and will fall sick at the age of 54 
years, 

5 3 rd house influenced by Mars will make native truthful. That 
is malefic in 3 rd bestow good results. 



138 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Special rules for transit: 

Count the 5 th lord from Moon and also from Jupiter and 
note their longitude and add them, the point of this longitude 
when transited by Saturn and the 5 th lord is having a benefic 
aspect at the time of transit birth of child can be predicted. 

The sum of longitude of 4 th and 11 th lords falling in a sign, 
when transited by Saturn, gain of properties and happiness to 
be predicted 

Longitude falling in the sign when the 2 nd lords and 11 th 
lord degrees are added, when transited by Jupiter having another 
benefic aspect at that time will give wealth 

Total longitudes of Mars, 2 nd and 5 th lords when transited 
by Saturn will give loss of wealth and cattle. 

The sign position derived by adding longitude of 1 st , 5 th 
and 7 th when transited by Saturn having aspect to 10 th lords 
professional fulfillments are indicated 

Saturn with an aspect to Jupiter when transit a place of 
sum total of longitude of 2 nd , 10 th 11 th lords will give pleasure of 
women or marriage 

Place denoted by the sum total of degrees of 2 nd , 10 th and 
11 th lords when occupied by transit Jupiter with an aspect to 
Moon will indicate financial gains. 

Saturn while transiting a place derived by the sum total of 
longitudes of 1 st , 4 th , 2 nd and 11 th lords will cause marriage, 
gain of lands and conveyance. 

The longitude of sum total of 2 nd , 9 th and 12 th lords when 
transited by Saturn having a benefic aspect will result in loss of 
wealth and grief. 

Longitude place of sum of 5 th and 12 th lords when transited 
by Saturn will cause evil effects to progeny. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Chandra Kala Naadi - Deva Keralam 139 

Harm to co born is to be predicted when Saturn transits on 
the sum total longitude place of 3 rd and 12 th lords or the place 
derived by adding longitude of 6 th lord to above two lords.

when transited by Saturn progeny problems, and if Rahu joins 
Saturn danger to wife can be predicted. 

Total of degrees of 1 st lord 10 th lord 11 th lord when transited 
by Jupiter, Moon or Mercury will cause pilgrimage.

dusthana lords, will indicate death to a person born in day time 
and if the transit taking place 7 th to the place derived, then 
death of night born person can be predicted. 

The sign where the total degrees of Saturn Gulika and Rahu 
when transited by Saturn, Ketu or Mars death of native can be

Add the longitude of 6 th lord from Ascendant, from Moon

by Saturn separation from mother will be caused 



140 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Example: 

In the example horoscope: the sum total of 6 th lord 
from 4 th lord and Moon happens to be Saturn posited in 
Cancer at 112:08. From Ascendant 6 th lord is Sun who is 
in 185:39. Total is 297:47 which falls in Capricorn. In 
2000 October 20 th Saturn was transiting in Taurus which 
is trine to Capricorn, the native lost his mother. 

These are similar to sahams which elaborately described in 
Tajaka system. 

However, the scribe noted many of such combination 
do not always yield the prescribed results. The transit 
results are predominant when it touches the karaka 
planets or its trines. 

There is a reference to Moon's different phases 60, 36 and 
12 which are well defined in Phala Deepika. It's use is generally 
well suited in Prashna and Muhurtha. The logic of using this in 
Birth chart is not much elaborated. However this will be very 
much useful in Naadi readings to understand the status of mind 
at the time of query. 

The words used in results are to be modified to suit the 
modern world. Simple terminology is used giving the meaning 
of the Sanskrit sloka. Therefore, the same is reproduced here 
for the benefit of readers

Some of the results like mounting of elephant, Conducting 
Royal meeting etc., can be inferred like owning heavy vehicles 
and good organizing capacity. These results are to be logically 
applied to know the mental condition of the person at the time 
of consultation. 

By putting more efforts on this subject, the Naadi Amsha 
parts needs to be organized with the help of scholars, so that 
this monumental Naadi text can be put to test and made available 
to coming generation. With gratitude to the great scholar who 
put his efforts to give an English version of this text, the scribe 
ends his introductory efforts of Chandra Kala Naadi. 



Classical Naadi System 

Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 



Bhrighu Samhita is said to be existing in Hoshiyarpur and 
supposed to be having around 5 lakhs horoscopes in palm leaves. 
There are many testimonials supporting the accuracy of this 
reading. However there are some Marathi and Hindi versions 
published in later days. These contain some index to find out 
the date of birth of person and then search for the horoscope of 
the person. The contents there in are read. In most of the 
cases out of many prediction 40 to 50% seems to be matched 
and in some cases most of them are tally. The scribe verified 
with the Marathi version lying with one of his friend. About 10 
cases were located and could only get a few points tallying due 
to planetary configuration. Original work of Bhrighu Samhita 
seems to be existing in Tamil Naadu in Tamil language which is 
called Bhrighu Naadi. 

One more Naadi text which is equally famous is Nandi Naadi. 
Here also the predictions are made on planetary combinations. 
Sri R G feao of Bangalore did some extensive research on these 
two works and brought out a book called Bhrughu Nandi Naadi 
in Kannada and English. In his research process he has found 
out some techniques of prediction based on the combination of 
planet 

Taking some portions from Bhrigu and some from Nandi 
Naadi he compiled his system of prediction. 

Main concept of this system of prediction is to select a 
planet that indicates the matters of life like, Jupiter for birth of 
children, Mercury for education, Saturn for profession, Venus 
for marriages etc., 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 145 



Timing of the event is based on the transit of Jupiter, Saturn, 
Rahu and Ketu. 

The first set of rules is to select the planet for the matter 
and then combine the planets posited in 2 nd and 12 th to it and 
then take the planet in 7 th . Logically combining these 
significations will give prediction relating to the matter of the 
planet selected. Let us see how this principle is derived. This is 
the same concept of predicting through karaka planet* It is a 
well-known fact that the zodiac has 3 zones of 120 degrees 
having nine stars grouped into 3 sets. The stars are nominated 
by planet as ruler which is explicit in Vimshottari Dasha. This 
concept drives that the zones have similarity due to repetition 
of same planets in three zones. Thus trines will have same 
planets. Extending this rule planets posited in trines to each 
other are considered as being in conjunction* 

If we take a Karaka planet, the planets in its trines are 
considered to be together with Karaka planet. Therefore, planets 
in 1, 5, and 9 are grouped into one direction. The Planets in 2 nd 
place when considered, naturally its trine 6 th and 10 th positions 
are also to be considered. Similarly when a planet in 7 th is 
considered, planets its trine 3 rd and 11 th are also to be grouped. 
Likewise, a karaka planet in 12 th will get the conjunction of 
planets placed in in its trine that is 4 th and 8 th place* 

This is the theory advocated by the Scholar. This looks to 
be very simple rule but has many intricacies involved like 
retrograde pianet, exchanged planet, exalted planet, debilitated 
planet, and dispositorto a particular planet and the signs where 
these planets are posited. We will dwell into details at the later 
stage. The scribe would like to re-present a few horoscopes 
from Bhrighu Nandi Naadi and discuss the intelligent 
interpretation techniques involved in selected horoscopes. There 
are a few wonderful horoscopes which gives detailed analysis 
based on signification of planets considered for Naadi readings. 
For this purpose essential significations are tabled below: 

Sign significations play very important role to give a shape 
to particular matter under consideration. All the astrological text

books give the sign significations. For Naadi we need some 
more detailed significations of sign. Therefore, a modified set 
of significations are tabled below for each sign of zodiac.

Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 147 

The significations given above are very important and are 
based on long term applied research work. 

Apart from the sign significations, we need to know the 
planetary dignities in each sign. Since planetary dignities are 
shown in each sign, the sign lord being a planet we have given 
the signification of planets in that sign itself. The significations 
are simplified by using words which can be elaborated by logic. 

These two tables are essential tools for introductory lessons 
in Naadi system of predictions. All the visible and invisible 
elements living or non-living matters in the entire universe or 
for that matter galaxies are all to be covered within the realm of 
planets and 12 zodiac signs. Logic is an inseparable catalyst for 
Astrological intelligence. This is especially true in Naadi astrology 
as there are no hypothetical divisible components to support 
the sign and planets. The deepest multiple levels of matter are 
to be derived by signification, position and positional details of 
nine planets. Rules are very simple, but in application logic plays 
an important role and calls for progressive intelligence. 

The table given below indicates the positional dignities of 
planets and each sign at bottom has the signification of the 
planet who is the lord of that sign. 

P.S.: Sign significations are in Sanskrit words & their meaning 
is given in the center box.

There is a reference to palmistry in this reading. Jupiter is 
in Capricorn who is looking upward and therefore right side 
portion is right hand which commences from Virgo till Sagittarius. 

Sun, Ven approaching sat and Mer who is linked to Wheel 
significator Rahu, therefore there are 4 chakras in his right hand. 
The Sagittarius has Ket and Moon, tailed creature in water fish. 
This indicates fish mark on the hand. 

Jup Sun Ven is in on group and Jupiter is in Saturn house 
Capricorn. It indicates lean body for native. 

In the group Jupiter Sun and Venus, Sun represents father 
and in the 12 th there is Moon Ketu and Mars. Sun is in Mercury 



150 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

house along with Venus, this indicates, Mars Moon Ketu 
Agriculture, Mercury corps and Venus money. The father earned 
money through agriculture. 

In the next sign there are Rahu Saturn and Mercury having 
in opposition Mars Ketu and Moo. Saturn is son of Sun and it is 
with other siblings that is Mars and Mercury. Therefore the 
earnings of father will be shared by his sons and also by his 
brothers. Father's brother is linked through the exchange of 
Mercury and Venus where will have aspect of Mars from Aries. 

The native Jupiter is having Moon in the backdrop indicating 
an Elder sister, next Jupiter in his rounds encounter Mars, Rahu 
Sun Saturn and Mercury this indicates younger brother. Venus 
which is linking Jupiter indicates younger sister. 

From this point the delineation is based on transit of Jupiter: 

In the first 12 years of transit Jupiter encounters first Mars 
who is also retrograde linked to Moon Ketu and Venus and Sun, 
Jupiter meets retro Mars in Pisces that is about 3 rd year of age 
and in Aries 4 th year of age. He suffers from ill health pertaining 
to blood related problems. (See the significations of sickness). 
He will get over health problems after crossing Rahu in Gemini 
at the age of 6-7 years. 9 th and 10 th year when transiting Leo 
and Virgo Moon Ketu indicating drowning and in Virgo Mercury 
exchanged with Venus as life giver supports thus he escapes 
death by drowning. 

Due to link of Mercury to Jupiter in the Natal chart 
established through exchange of Venus with Mercury, the native 
is destined to get education. During his transit from Capricorn 
to Taurus there will be link of Jupiter and the intervening Venus 
will help to get over the problems of Mars thus gives opportunity 
of education. However since protection has already been received 
once, the same cannot be expected second time. Therefore, at 
the age of 17 and 18 the Mars Ketu Moon caused troubles in 
education. Moon being elder sister the transit of Ketu and Rahu 
on Moon during that period caused death of elder sister. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 151 

After break in education, again at the exaltation of Mercury 
place Jupiter transit continues education. Due to involvement 
of Mars and the next sign having Saturn the education would 
relate to machinery and technical nature. 

Though there is direct link to Venus by Jupiter in exchange 
with Mercury Venus goes to own house which is the exalted 
place of Saturn and joins Saturn. Saturn link to Venus is delayed 
marriage. 

This also indicates that his fortune starts after marriage. 
Saturn while in Virgo Jupiter transit will be in Taurus and Gemini, 
the native gets marriage and he will also get an engineering 
Job in government. It is due to the fact that Sun and Venus are 
involved linking to Saturn. 

Jupiter linking to Venus at the age of 33 gives him a daughter 
and when Jupiter links Sun at 36 th year he gets a male child. 

Saturn in transit encounter Moon and Ketu at the age of 
36-37 and the native changes his job and having Natal Jupiter 
next to him will undertake a higher status job of teaching of 
engineering in a Government college. This is due to Jupiter 
+Venus +Mercury+ Sun combination. 

At the age of 41-42 transit Jupiter while crossing Mars will 
encounter difficulties from the opponents. Jupiter in transit 
linking to Rahu and Moon in opposition will give the native 
opportunity for a foreign trip. 

Jupiter in transit when contact Sun he gets a higher job 
after returning from foreign. 

When all the effects of planets have completed by four 
rounds, the Jupiter in his 5 th round encounters Rahu that is kala 
purusha and this closes the chapter of his life. This will be around 
53- 54 years of age. 

Most of the matters which are general in nature are 
covered in example horoscope being explained 
subsequently and several matters are covered in the 
example horoscopes from Bhrighu Nandi Naadi. This 



152

horoscope is also from Bhrighu Nandi Naadi and is given 
exclusively to deal with some important aspects of life 
like previous birth siblings and progeny etc.

Character: 

Jupiter in Pisces - non materialistic in nature 

Jupiter having Mercury in Kona: Intelligence person 

Jupiter having Sat Ket and Moon in 2 nd : - Spiritual bent of 
mind with knowledge of sacred scriptures. Combination of Sun 
and Ketu along with Moon and Ket indicates that the person 
travels and then gets name and fame in the society. 



Previous Birth: 

This person born in a different caste and was violent in 
nature and committed sins by deceiving spiritual persons. Later 
on repented and did prayaschitta for his sins. 

This is due to fact that Jupiter when counted one sign behind 
from Kumbha links Mars and Rahu and in the axis of Rahu and 
Ketu there are Moon Ketu and Saturn. Mercury the intelligence 
planet is in the house of Mars that is house of debilitated Moon 
having Sun next to it and linked to Venus and then forming a 
malika yoga touching Jupiter. Due to this prayaschitta he has a 
good birth this time. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 153 



His Father is a Rama Bhakta 

Sun having crossed Vishnu Amsha Mercury and then 
reaching sign of Kodanda is an indication that Father is devotee 
of Rama. Saturn Ketu and Moon having Mars in 11 th indicate 
Hanumantha. 

Number of siblings; 

In Naadi the brother factor is indicated by Mars and it has 
Jupiter ahead who is Jeeva karaka which confirms one younger 
brother. Mercury is also an indicator of younger sibling either 
male or female. Mercury in this chart is in male sign and having 
Sun ahead, a male planet which indicates another younger 
brother. However this Mercury is hemmed between the effects 
of Ketu influenced by Moon and Saturn one side and is eclipsed 
by Rahu on the other side. Therefore this brother aspect is 
nullified. This Mars is having Jupiter as an elder brother and is 
having Saturn as one more elder brother. That is two elder 
brothers and out of Ketu and Moon one out of them that is Ketu 
becomes another brother and Moon is a female planet and one 
sister. Therefore total including Jupiter they are four brothers 
and one sister. Ketu having Saturn and Moon goes away pursuing 
spiritual life. Out of other brother due to exchange of Saturn 
and Mars one of them go away having a fight with the other 
and while in exchange the planet in Kumbha will have death 
inflicting planet Rahu in Libra which indicates death of a brother. 

Number of children: 

Jupiter is having Venus in 11 th and in 2 nd and 12 th there are 
planets both male and female. The Planets in 2 nd is directly 
linked to Sun confirming progeny prospects. As explained in 
siblings above little change in gender aspect will have two male 
and two female issues. Venus and Moon becomes two female 
issues and Sun and Mars becomes two male issues. 

Sun is having in front Venus and having Mercury and Jupiter 
at the backdrop which indicate that one of the progeny will 



1 54 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



have good educational back ground and earn money with name 
and fame in the society after changing a place and profession. 
Other male child will go to foreign country to pursue his education 
and will at one point of time be interested in spiritual matters. 
He may not have good marital life. 

One of the female progeny will have comfort levels in the 
marital life that is Venus which has Sun and Mercury at Back 
drop and having Mars and Jupiter ahead. Another girl will have 
problems in marital life. She may also have health problems. 
That is Moon, Saturn Ketu with Sun effect. 

Education and Profession: 

The involvement of Mercury having Sun with the effect of 
Saturn is clear indication that this man is interested only in 
Business. 

Mercury is in the house of Mars having Sun in 2 nd and Rahu 
in 12 th supported by Jupiter in 5 th . Sun is linked to food material 
Moon and small items Ketu and Saturn readymade. This indicates 
the native is having knowledge of baking. Sun is wheat, Moon 
is round, and Ketu is small. Saturn is yeast. That is he has the 
knowledge of bakery items. Apart from it Venus is money and 
also beauty, 

Having a good knowledge in baking this person earns well 
having Venus in 2 nd to Sun Moon, Ketu, Saturn combination 
backed by baking knowledge Mercury. He earns well and makes 
property. The Moon indicates different units. He establishes 
different units and makes lots of assets. . 

Change of working Place: 

He may change his place of profession at a later stage that 
is due to effect of Moon being with Saturn and Ketu which 
makes him to leave one place and move to another place. 



Classical Naadi Systems; Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 



155 



Marital life: 

Venus is in the house of Saturn and is having Mars in front 
of it and is having Sun behind. The Sun is having link of Saturn, 
Moo and Ketu. This is an indication that the wife hails from a 
family having some traditional values. It also indicates that thdy 
struggled hard in life. Wife definitely will exhibit proud and will 
be short tempered but will be a good guide to husband. Despite 
they have a cordial marital life, *

Mercury the signficator for education is in western direction 
2 nd direction has Jup Sun Ket. Native is a legal expert. Jup Sun 
Ket indicates a spiritual and good character. He has a brother 
(Mer behind in a male sign). Saturn in east has in south that is 
2 nd direction VEN MAR RAH. He will have multiple buildings and 
vehicles (Ven + Mar Buildings, Ven + Rah vehicles and Rahu 
indicates abundance) He will resolve litigations and also involve 
in litigations ( Mar = litigation - being a legal person resolves 
litigations: Professionally Saturn encounters Mar + Ven, therefore 
involves in litigation for money) 

Most dangerous part of this system of prediction is that it 
reveals many secrets which may offend the consultant. This 
prediction given below is such a secret one. 



1 56 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



In the house of Mars there is Saturn and Moon. This house 
of Mars that is Aries represents husband. The lord of this sign 
Mars is in the Venus house along with Venus. That is Venus 
now has a back drop two persons one is Saturn and another is 
Moon. Saturn is debilitated and in an enemy house. Therefore 
Moon becomes the other male of debilitated and low level person. 
We saw that there is a fight between two persons Saturn and 
Mars. From the point of view of Venus as wife, husband is 
engaged in professional fight. During this time Moon comes 
and joins Venus who has Rahu in 5 th . Both will run away for a 
secret affair. 

Further deep study shows, when Moon enters Venus it is 
an indication of pregnancy, and Moon and Venus runs away 
and only Mars remains there. That means the wife delivers a 
male child leaves him and goes away. 

Though wife runs away she has problems to face as in the 
subsequent houses she has to face enemy planets in north, 
east and southern directions. 

Note: here the Venus is being rotated considering it as 
Jupiter that is Jeeva for wife. There are many such wonderful 
clues for going deeper into the prediction part explained in this 
work. 

The entire book of Bhrigu Nandi Naadi covers about 500 
charts basing its predictive principles on selecting the Karakatwa 
of planets and giving prediction on the basis of combination of 
planets. The timing of events is based on transit of Jupiter, 
Saturn and Rahu and Ketu. 

Since Karakatwa and combination of planets are important 
the author has written two more books giving results of two 
planets and three planets combination. He has also written a 
book on transit results. 

The scribe has done extensive research on this method of 
prediction and has written "Prediction secrets-Naadi Astrology" 
"Revelation from Naadi Jyotisha", "Celestial Matrix", "Orbital 
Providence" and "Prashna Mora". 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 157 

In this section the scribe would like to give the 
predictive principles in an organized manner comparing 
with the traditional methodology which will be useful 
to the students of astrology and also to the astrologers 
following traditional system of analysis. 

Longevity: 

Traditional method 

1 st house, 3 rd holuse 8 th house 2 nd house 7 th house 12 th 
house are studied with various other principles to know the 
longevity of the person. 

Naadi method: 

There are no houses involved, therefore the importance of 
Lagna or other houses are not considered, 

Jupiter the planet of Jeeva karaka is considered to assess 
the Longevity. Mark the position of Jupiter in the Natal chart. 
Then take the planets falling in between Rahu and Jupiter (that 
is planets posited along with Jupiter, in 5 th , in 9 th , in 2 nd , in 7 th , 
in 12 th and their trines except Ketu) Rahu encountering these 
planets will indicate dangers to lives indicated by these planets 
and after completing the effects of these planets in each round, 
the next encounter with Jupiter with Rahu will indicate the death 
of native. 

(Note: the longevity is a matter of cosmic decision, this will 
indicate only possible time frame and average age factor, there 
are number of other principles involving Saturn and Ketu which 
are hidden secrets normally cannot be disclosed in written 
formats - Therefore it is only to indicate the possible danger to 
life period the above principle is to be used. Even in traditional 
astrology such secrets are withheld. There also it is only 
approximation which denotes Long life, Middle life and short 
life) 



158 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Generally when Rahu is approaching Jupiter where Jupiter 
has no other planet supporting it and equally if Saturn is 
disposited with Ketu without many planets support it indicates 
short life to native. The reason is Rahu is Kala purusha who is 
approaching the Jeeva Karaka to end his life. If there is Karma 
balance the Jeeva cannot leave this body and go away. Therefore 
Saturn if has more number of planet linking to it unless all the 
Rinanubandha of these planets are completed the Jeeva cannot 
end its journey, But the effect of Rahu will make the life of 
native miserable with diseases and unethical activities.

Rahu approaching Jupiter and Jupiter approaching Rahu is 
an indication of short life less than 40 years. 



Death of relatives: 

Traditional: 

3 rd and 11 th house along with Mars and Saturn represents 
brothers and sisters. Taking the reference point from the houses 
indicated or from the Karaka planet the Maraka planets are 
noted and synchronizing them with the Dasha of native, the 
respective danger period to life for brothers and sisters are 
indicated. Similarly for other relatives are computed. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 



159 



In Naadi: 

Younger siblings are represented by Mercury and immediate 
brother is by Mars and elder Brother by Saturn. Venus and Moon 
also represents sisters. The transit of Ketu or Rahu encountering 
these planets will indicate the danger period for the siblings. 

(Normally the effect of Rahu indicates danger to life and 
sickness and Ketu shows the de-linking factor)

This is a male horoscope, in this Mars the brother is afflicted 
by Ketu not having any planet in support. The brother of the 
native is short lived (less than 40 years). 

Longevity of wife/ husband 

In Traditional Astrology 7 th house its lord and Karaka Venus 
represents wife. For female some take Jupiter and others take 
Mars as karaka for husband. The danger period is indicated by 
the Maraka planets fot 7 th house synchronizing with the Dasha 
of native. 



In Naadi: 

Venus is wife and for female Mars is husband. The 
relationship of Ketu and Rahu are taken to indicate the danger 
to lives of spouse- 



160 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



(In a male horoscope if there is close relation 
between Venus and Rahu or Ketu without any benefic 
planets supporting Venus early death of wife is 
indicated. In female it is Rahu versus Mars which 
indicates similar effect. This again is a broader 
perspective) 

Danger to Mother and Father 

Traditional method: 

4 th house and Moon for mother and 9 th house and Sun for 
father is considered and taking the reference points both from 
house and karaka the Maraka planets synchronizing with the 
Dasha of native indicates danger to the life of parents. 



Naadi method: 

Moon for mother Sun for father is considered along with 
the relationship of Rahu and Ketu. Lesser number of planets 
supporting the both Moon and Sun will indicate early danger to 
father and mother. Transit of nodes will indicate this danger to 
life.

This is a female horoscope where in mother is represented 
by Moon which is having Rahu behind and having the Ketu 
effect in Aquarius. Moon has only Jupiter in 5 th and Saturn an 
enemy planet in 7 th . Her mother is short lived. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandl Naadi 161 

Danger to children: 

Traditional method: 

5 th house, 7 th house 9 th house & karaka, Jupiter is considered 
for children and Maraka planets counted from these reference 
points are operative in synchronization with Dasha of native 
will indicate danger to their lives. 

Naadi Method: 

Sun is represented as male progeny and Venus as female 
progeny. The nodes closely linked to them without any support 
will indicate danger to their lives. 

(Important: There is a drawback normally expressive in 
this aspect, because Sun also represent father, Venus also 
represent wife, and daughter in law the question is how to 
identify whether it is father or son, daughter or daughter in law 
or wife. This genuine doubt is common. The most important 
principle of Naadi astrology is, to have a time chart for every 
horoscope analysis. Time chart is nothing but a chart drawn at 
the moment of analyzing the horoscope. Taking the present 
position of Jupiter, if the Sun is behind Jupiter it is father and if 
it is ahead it is son. Similarly if the Venus is along with Jupiter or 
behind Jupiter it is wife and if it is ahead it is daughter. If Venus 
is linked to Mercury then it is daughter in law. Please note the 
ahead and behind position can happen even by exchange, by 
Retro and Exchange or it can happen through some other planet 
associated with them. Present Jupiter position to Natal Sun and 
Venus and Natal Jupiter to present Venus and Sun both are to 
be seen, if Jupiter happens to be in the same position as in 
Natal chart. Number of male planets linking to Sun is number of 
children and number of female planet linking to Venus is female 
children. Degree wise they are to be decided). Another method 
is to look for the house and karaka represented in traditional 
astrology and link the dasa of native to maraka planets for 
relatives.

This is a female horoscope in this both Sun as male child

approached by Rahu. Both of them are short lived. 



Health matters: 

Traditional method: 

1 st house, 6 th house, 8 th house and 12 th house, Saturn and 
Mars Gulika are considered for assessing health along with 
natural zodiac body parts and also 12 houses as body parts. 
The linking factors and the weakness of Lagna are all taken into 
consideration to indicate the health condition and probability of 
diseases are seen from the Dasha of evil planets. 

The twelve signs of the zodiac relative houses counted from 
ascendant and the nine planets are the pillars of astrology. The 
same is extended to medical astrology and the significations 
relates only to medical terms.

Naadi Method: 

In this method broad diseases are grouped by combination 
of planets and listed out. This will fairly indicate the possible ill 
health factors to the native. Invariably this proved with greater 
accuracy than any other method. 



170 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Indian philosophy advocates karma theory and confirms 
that bodily sufferings due to chronic diseases are linked to past 
evil deeds. 

This principle is directly applied in Naadi: 

1, If there is a link of Saturn, Moon and Rahu it is an indication 
that this person will suffer with chronic diseases due to his 
past karma, 

2. If the Jupiter is linked to Rahu and Moon then it is due to 
his present evil deeds he will suffer ill health/ 

3. Instead of Rahu if Ketu is linked, then he will nullify the 
karma by fully suffering. 

4, Venus is Mrithasanjeevini and Sun is Dhanvantari 

Keeping these four fundamental rules, the following are 
the disease factor which can be identified through combination 
of planets. 

Diseases by Combination of Planets 

1. If there is a conjunction of Rahu, Mercury and Mars, or if 
they are placed in trines to each other or if any two of them 
is in trine to the third planet: - Problems in the Spinal cord 
can be identified. 

2. Conjunction of Sun, Moon, Rahu, Saturn or if Sun and Moon 
are in trine to both Rahu and Saturn, the native will suffer 
with - Chronic headache problems that is Migraine 

3. Mercury and Moon in conjunction or in opposition or in 
trine will cause infection in thorax. 

To this combination if Ketu influences Mercury by conjunction 
or being in trine, there may be a growth in thorax area 

From the above confluence any of these planet is getting 
the influence of Venus by conjunction, opposition or from a 
trine to them, this will result in Thyroid problems.

Jupiter or Saturn, the persons suffers from cold related 
problems resulting in obstructive breathing

Education: 

In Traditional method: 

2 nd house, 4 th house, 5 th house 9 th house and 11 th house, 
Mercury as karaka are considered for education. Strong houses, 
lord and karaka will provide good education during a good Dasha 
period. The nature of education is studied by using sign, 
planetary significations and also star indications. 

In Naadi method: 

Mercury indicates education and Venus indicates expertise, 
Sun indicates success, Jupiter guarantees the education. Mars, 
Ketu, are main hurdle for education. Moon though disturbs it 
only indicate changes and travel in education. Mars indicates, 
Mathematics, Machinery, Power, Arguments etc., Ketu indicates 
Medicine, Law and spiritual matters. When Mars and Ketu are 
attached to Mercury, and the line of education relates to these 
two planets then there will not be any obstruction in studies. 
Rahu indicates foreign matters and also cheating elements. Rahu 



176 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

can also cause disturbance in education. Saturn will slow down 
the process of learning but supports practical learning. 

General rule is that Mercury having Jupiter link ultimately 
will give good education. If Sun combines will give merits in 
education. 

Other planets indicate the nature of education, for this we 
have to consider sign significations and also the nature of these 
planets in a particular sign where their obstructive qualities are 
modified as supportive qualities. 

From Mercury the directional planets are to be considered 
along with sign significations. 

Profession and Business: 

In Traditional astrology: 

10 th house is considered for profession. Another school of 
thought considers Lagna for livelihood. However it is either of 
these or both the houses it's Lord Karaka for 10 th house are to 
be studied. The strength of houses its lord and Karaka will bestow 
good professional career during the period of good Dasha. 

In Naadi astrology: 

Saturn is main significator of profession: 

Jupiter is the promoter of profession 

Sun is Recognition and a Governing and Establishing planet. 

Moon indicates changes, blames, transfer and transport 
liquid and food and art related professions 

Mars indicates hazards, enmity and obstructive forces in 
profession and it also indicate technical and powered nature of 
profession. 

Mercury indicates knowledge based and commercial nature 
of profession or land related profession 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 1 77 

Venus indicates Money, Assets and Luxuries and arts related 
profession 

Rahu indicates - Foreign, Shadow, Unethical nature of 
profession and also indicates hard work in profession 

Ketu indicates - Dejections, ending of Job, Medicine, Law 
and spiritual related jobs and also low level jobs like tailor, painter 
etc., 

Saturn and its relationship with other planets in 1, 5, 9, 2, 
6, 10, and 3, 7, 11 and in the back drop of 4, 8, 12 along with 
sign signification will decide the professional matters of a native.

Yogas for material benefits: 

Traditional yoga: 

Lords of 1, 5, 9 are benefic planets and give good results 
during their period. Lords of both Kendra and Kona or called 
Yoga karakas they give good material benefits. Planets owning 
2 nd and 11 are good for financial matters. 4 th house represents 
assets. 9 th house indicate fortune and 5 th house indicates dignity. 
Lords of 6-8-12 or evil lords this will cause material and personal 
losses to the native. The association of good lords with these 
evil lords results in unfavorable results 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 179 

Naadi method: 

Venus denotes Money, Assets and Luxuries 

Mercury indicates landed properties 

Sun indicates success and recognition. 

Saturn linking to Venus, Mercury and Sun in the order directly 
either being together or in trines without other planets interfering 
in between will cause supreme yoga of wealth. 

Jupiter linking to Venus in the same sign or in trines indicates 
ordinary material conditions.

If Moon is linked loss of material matters are indicated 

If Mars is linked litigation, expenses are indicated 

If Rahu is linked unethical and frauds are indicated 

If Ketu is linked disputes and blocks of material matter are 
indicated. 

With strong combination of Saturn and Venus and Mercury 
the other planets will indicate the nature of such material 
benefits. 

Marriage: 

Traditional method: 

7 th lord if associated with Venus not having influence of 
malefic planets, the native will have single marital life. 

More than one marriage is predicted if:

Character and nature of marital life: 

The lordships, nature of sign, planets and their natural 
significations are all considered to delineate marital life and 
character of spouse. Being voluminous it is impossible to 
accommodate all of them in this limited section.

A. JUP if linked to Venus in 1, 5, 9, 2 nd , 12 th or 7 th places 
counted from Jupiter early male marriage is indicated 

B. SAT if linked to Venus in 1, 5, 9, 2 nd , 12 th or 7 th places 
counted from Saturn delayed male marriage is indicated 

C In the above combination instead of Venus if Mars is involved 
it indicates female marriage early or delay as the case may 
be 

D. Mars linking to Venus also indicate female marriage 

E. Ketu linking to Venus will indicate problems for male getting 
married or there could be marital disputes 

R Instead of Venus if Mars is involved it indicates female marital 
problems 

G. In both the cases that is E and F if Jupiter is linked the 
problems will be solved 

H. Linking of Rahu to Venus (naadi placements 1, 5, 9, 2 nd , 
12 th ) indicate delay or denial of marriage for a male native,

to a female and if married she dislikes husband. 

J, Combination VEN + KET + MAR, indicate separation or de- 
linking factor between wife and husband. Jupiter if aspect 
this combination then compromise is possible 

K. MER+KET+MAR in same direction or same sign separation 
or divorce is possible 



182 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

L VEN+RAH+MAR this combination in same sign or same 
direction in a male horoscope indicate separation in female 
horoscope it indicates ill treatment to husband by wife. 

M. MER+KET in the same sign or same direction especially in 
human signs or in odd signs whether male or female 
horoscope indicates love affair. If this combination is 
supported either by Jupiter or Venus this will turn into 
marriage. Mars will break the love affair. If Moon association 
brings blames to them. Saturn involvement indicates the 
love affair at work place. If Sun involves the affair will be 
fair and known to everybody but will be success if only 
Jupiter aspect it. 

N. VEN+MOO (while Mars crossing Ketu) will indicate 
pregnancy before marriage. If Rahu involves with Venus or 
Moon the same will be a secret affair and may run away 
with lover. Jupiter if involved between Venus and Moon 
then she will only contemplate on such matters but does 
not do it. 

O. MER +VEN++MAR- This indicates dual relationship of female 

P. MER+MAR+VEN- indicates dual relationship of male 

Q. MOO+MAR+VEN also indicate dual relationship of male 

R. MER+VEN+SAT this female will be happy with lover 

S- If Venus is approached by Rahu and if there is a link of 
Ketu and Mars it is the combination for widow in a female 
horoscope 

T. Jupiter or Saturn linking to more number of female planets 
indicate multiple relationship in a male horoscope 

U. Venus having aspect of Saturn, Rahu or Ketu in case of 
male horoscope, Mars having aspect of Saturn Rahu or Ketu 
in case of female horoscope indicate denial of marriage 
and if Jupiter is supporting Venus or Mars with remedial 
measure the marriage can take place 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 183 

V. Combination of Venus, Moon and Mercury in any order, in 
either male or female horoscope indicate immoral nature 
of the person 

W, Saturn + Venus indicate working lady as wife in a male 
horoscope and it also indicate prosperity after marriage 

X. Jupiter and other planets link to it indicate character of the 
male in a male horoscope and Venus and other planets link 
will indicate wife's nature. 

Y, In a female horoscope, the Venus and linked planets will 
indicate her character and Mars and other planets link to it 
will indicate husbands nature 

Z. Ultimately in male horoscope: Venus, Mercury, Moon 
represent females and Jupiter, Saturn represent the Jeeva 
and Karma. Mars is Deha and Rahu unethical and Ketu is 
dejection. In Female instead of Venus just take Mars and 
link all other planets according to horoscope. Logical 
combination with these planets marital matters can be 
predicted. 

Child birth: 

Traditional method: 

5 th house, 5 th Lord Jupiter, alternatively 7 th and 9 th lords are 
considered for child birth. 

Naadi Method: 

Sun is male child and Venus is female child. 

If there is a link of Jupiter to Sun in 1, 5, 9, 2, 12, 7 places 
as per naadi the native will beget a male child 

If there is a link of Jupiter to Venus in 1, 5, 9, 2, 12, 7 
places as per naadi the native will beget a female child 

Rahu eclipsing Sun or Venus may cause denial or deprival 
or danger to born child 



184 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Ketu eclipsing Sun or Venus indicate obstruction in child 
birth 

Moon Venus combination indicates lesser sperm count in 
males and the same combination in female horoscope indicate 
problems in ovaries and therefore conception may not be strong 
enough or may not even conceive. 

Sun and Venus combination (that is within a quarter of 
same Nakshatra) indicate denial of child birth 

Saturn linking to either Sun or Venus indicates delayed child 
birth. 

Number of children is indicated by an experimental method 
which is proved in most of the cases as correct. 

Note the Jupiter position and from there link all the planets 
linked to it through 1, 5, 9, 2, 7 and 12 if Jupiter retro. 

Similarly write down the planets associated with Saturn in 
the same places as prescribed by Naadi. 

Confirm that Jupiter or Saturn is linked to Sun to note the 
male child birth or to Venus to female child birth. 

Linking of Sun, Mer, and Mar indicate male children and 
Ven Mer Moo indicate female children. Strike out the planets 
which are afflicted by Rahu and Ketu, remaining will be number 
of children. 

Next method is: in a male horoscope bring Venus to Mars 
and in a female horoscope bring Mars to Venus and then rotate 
them hypothetically in each sign at the rate of 1 year in a sign 
and find out the male and female planet linking to them in 1, 5, 
9, 2 nd or 7 th places and ensure that during that period of rotation 
Jupiter is linking to the rotating planets. If in rotation Rahu or 
Ketu encounters stop rotation and take the number of planets 
earlier linked as children. But if Jupiter is placed after Rahu and 
Ketu while rotating take from the point of Jupiter the planets 
linked to it and earlier planet will indicate abortive, deprived or 
denial of progeny.

encounter Moon which is having Jupiter in 5 th and Saturn in 7 th . 
Jupiter is linking to Sun and Merucruy. The naitve have two 
sons. The Moon being in Saturn house and having aspect of 
Saturn indicates some other matters of marital life which we

How the planet give results: 

Select any planet for the matter to be examined 

Note the planets posited along with the selected planet 
degree wise. The Planet which are approaching the selected 
planet indicates the matters that are related to selected planet 
and the planet which is behind will indicate the matter in the 
background

In the above horoscope if we want to see the education 

We must select Mercury. 

Mercury is in Scorpio: 

Mercury is having Sun behind and it has Saturn in 9 th and 
Jupier in 7 th which is again havng Moon in 9 th to Jupiter and 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 189 

next house it has Rahu and then from Leo there is Mars and 
afterwards there is Venus, 

The educational career of this native has strong back ground 
of Father's influence and more of practical nature and undergone 
changes or change of place due to hurdles of Mars and Rahu 
and then continued the education 

A planet approaching the karaka planet selected will give 
its karakatwa to the selected planet which logically need to be 
modified for the required matter. 

Since planets in one direction are considered to be together 
it is better to group the planets in four directions as earleir 
explained. 

Degree wise combination is essential to be precise on 
combining significations. 

Simple rule: Planets which are friendly to the selected plaent 
will give favourble results of the matter selected while the enemy 
planet will give adverse results. 

Sometimes we may see the karaka planet is associated 
with a enmey planet but by exchange with another planet the 
enemy planet may replace a friendly planet. This will modify 
and give good results. The reverse can also happen. 

Therefore exchange of planet is most imporatant factor in 
Naadi. Normally in a horoscope if you find planetary exchange, 
there will either be good results first and later bad results or 
vice versa based on the nature of exchanged planets. If there is 
an exchange between two good planets then the matter may 
enhance good results by interference signfications of planets 
involved. 

Exchange also indicates the juxtaposition of relatives or 
persons involved to modify the results. 

Debllated planet indicates the difficult situations of the 
person or matter indicated by that planet. 



190 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Exalted indicates the desirious attitude and ease factor of 
related signification. 

A retrograde planet will have effect on the previous sign 
and therefore if a friendly planet is situated in the previous sign 
the effects will be positve if there is an enemy planet then the 
effect will be negative. 

A planet may also get exchanged effect in its retro position, 
or it may get the effect of another planet which get exchanged 
with the planet posited behind the karaka planet. 

Retrograde and Exchange of planets indicate diversification 
and different effects at different stages. For every incident once 
noted with a combination, the retro effect is to be taken for 
next incident and if there is an excahnge, for next incident 
exchanged position is to be taken. For further incidents again 
original position and repeat the process to cover all the planets 
link to give the entire prediciton whch follow one after the 
another. 

By exchange or retro the planet may get exhalted or 
debilaited these things are to be noted. 

Timing of events: 

Traditional astrology: 

Dasha Bhukti Antara Sookshma and Prana are different 
periods of planets which will decide the timing of an event. 
Normally astrolgoers read upto Dasha and Bhukti and a few of 
them go up to Antara. Sookshma and Prana requires accurate 
birth time therefore, instead of going in detaH of these levels 
they resort to transit effects. 

In Nadi Astrology: 

Timiing of event in Naadi astrology is purely based on transit 
of planets. For major events only four planets that is Jupiter, 
Saturn Rahu and Ketu are taken. Jupiter takes 12 years to 
complete one round of Zodiac. Saturn taken 30 years. Rahu/ 
Ketu takes 18.5 years. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 191 

One principle is to take Jupiter's original position for the 12 
years and then link the planets as per naadi and asssess the 
results. These results will be effective during the transit of Jupiter 
on these planets or in its time or in 2 nd or 12 th to it. Some times 
results are given in other places too if that sign happens to be 
own sign or exalted sign of either karaka planet or the transiting 
Jupiter. 

Saturn rotation is taken for incidents relating to Karma. 
Normally it is taken for professional matters. However, some 
incidents in life are to take place according to previous karma 
which is denoted by planets linking to Saturn in birth chart. 
Those incidents will take place when Saturn in transit link them. 
However along with the incident the experiencer that is jeeva 
karaka Jupiter must also participate. 

Rahu transit indicates the dangers, unethical or displacments 
etc., Ketu indicates blocking, obstructive, de-linking and 
disputable matters. 

Transit effects of four slow moving planets Jupiter, Saturn, 
Rahu and Ketu on other planets and vice versa is given below 
which is a powerful tool in naadi astrology,

also face professional hazards by entry of new persons, dispute

Transit rules: 

A transiting planet may give its effect much before or after 
crossing the natal planet of event, if the sign ahead or behind 
of that planet is exalted or own house of either natal planet or 
transiting planet. A transiting planet will not give results when 
it encounters an enemy planet in front of it (provided such 
enemy planets are linked originally in natal chart). In these 
circumstances it may give result when it retrogrades provided 
that retrograde place does not have an enemy or an obstructive 
planet to the matter indicated by the natal planet. If a sign lord 
is associated with a friendly planet or if he relates to the matter 
of the planet with whom he associates, the transiting planet 
may activate him when it transits the own or exalted signs of 
associated planet even the position does not fall in the purview 
of naadi links.

Mer. Saturn has 3 planets and also aspect of Jupiter. She has 
more Karma to experience and clear. She lives long 

Education: 

Mercury has support of Sun and Mercury Mercury is 
debilitated. Mercury is in the house of Jupiter and Jupiter by 
retro goes to exalted place of Mercury and supports Mercury. 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 203 



Debilitated Mercury with Sun indicates the low level efforts 
of father towards knowledge. It indicates incapability of father 
to support for education of her daughter represented by Venus 
who is posited in Aries a house of Mars along with Saturn and 
Mars. Therefore, the beginning days of education were not 
comfortable for the native. She had hardships in getting 
education. Mercury linking to Saturn and Mars and Venus having 
Ketu in Leo indicates the native had intention of studying different 
subject which was afflicted by Ketu and Mars. Later period Jupiter 
by retro going to Virgo supported Mercury. She had to take up 
commercial study (Virgo +Mercury + Jupiter effect from Libra). 
She completed B.Com. 

Marriage: 

Take the planets in Eastern direction since Mars the indicator 
of husband is with other planets. Mother is linked to Saturn, 
Venus and Mars. It indicates that Mars is related to Mother 
through her elder brother who is in turn linking to Venus the 
native. Venus will get married to a relative of Mother. She got 
married to the son of mother's elder brother. Link of Ketu 
indicates not only known or relative it also indicates love affair. 
Moon, Mars and Venus link when linked to Ketu there could be 
a deep affair which turns into marriage when Jupiter supports 
it. 

Mars is with Saturn and Venus linking to Ketu and Moon. 
The husband is luxurious in nature and works hard to earn 
money and spends everything. He will have another association 
because of Moon + Ketu and therefore loses money and status. 
He also mentally tortures his wife (that is the Native). 

This makes her life miserable and therefore she needs to 
stand on her own leg. 

Saturn is next to Sun and Mercury who is supported by 
Jupiter who before getting retrograde directly links to Saturn. 
She took up the teaching job after marriage. 



204 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Children 

Sun is in Pisces which has Mercury with him but has Rahu 
behind and in front there are number of enemy planets and 
also the effect of Ketu. This blocks the birth of male child. 

Moon+Ket+Mars together afflicting Venus indicate an 
abortion and later on since Saturn a karma planet also supporting 
Venus, gave her a female child. 

Marriage took place when Jupiter transiting in Virgo which 
is 11 th place to Mars and Saturn was transiting in Sagittarius 
over Moon linking Venus and Mars together. Incidentally Mars 
was also transiting in Sagittarius. That is during January 1990 
Saturn transiting in Capricorn during October 1992, he linked 
to natal retrograde Jupiter in Virgo and Jupiter was transiting in 
Virgo to give a teacher's job. Again when Saturn reached Pisces 
during June 1995 she got a promoted. Saturn linked again to 
retrograde Jupiter in Virgo and transit Jupiter was in Scorpio 
linking transit Saturn in Pisces and by retro he linked both natal 
Saturn and natal Jupiter. 

Though there are marital problems due to number of planets 
afflicting Venus and Mars, the Jupiter support made wife and 
husband to be united. 

Note: If this methodology is adopted along with modified 
traditional astrology the predictions can precisely be made. 

Naadi transit Naik's system of prediction: 

1. Note the Lagna and find out the ruling Dasha planet and 
Bhukti planet: 

2. Both Dasha and Bhukti planet must be in friendly disposition 
to Lagna lord either by natural nature or by house 
compatibility 



Classical Naadi Systems: Bhrighu Nandi Naadi 205 

3. Dasha of 1, 5, 9 or 3, 7, 11 Lords and during Bhukti of lord 
representing these houses, the transit of Saturn and Jupiter 
will confer marital or progeny matters that is matters relating 
to relational matters. 

4. Dasha of 1, 5, 9, 3, 7, 11 coupled with 2, 6, 10 will support 
the transit of Saturn over Jupiter for professional success 

5. Dasha of 4 th , 2 nd , 11 th , 5 th , 9 th , and or Lagnesh, the transit 
of Saturn over Venus and support of Jupiter or vice versa 
will ensure financial and property gains. 

6. Dasha of 6, 8, 12 with Bhukti of Maraka or vice versa, Natal 
Jupiter and Saturn getting afflicted by Rahu and Ketu, Mars 
and Moon indicate danger and diseases to life, 

7. During Dasha of 12 th lord, 8 th lord and Bhukti of 6 th lord or 
3 rd lord the transit of Saturn on Moon and Ketu create difficult 
periods. 

8. Please go through Prashna Hora book of the author to find 
out the qualification of Dasha lord as Yoga and Shubha for 
each Lagna. During the Dasha of such good planets the 
transit of Saturn or Jupiter over friendly planet will yield 
positive results and if the Dasha is of bad houses these 
transits will not yield good results. 

9. It is a must that Dasha and at least up to Bhukti level the 
computation is correctly done so that we can match the 
Naadi transit with Dasha and Bhukti which ensures right 
timing of event. 



Stellar Based - Naadi System 
Method 1 



Late Sri H.R.Seshadri Iyer from Bangalore is another great 
astrologer who has experimented using stellar system and 
included some of the classical components generally used in 
Muhurtha. By his introductory writing it can be understood that 
he had referred to great works like Brihat Jaataka, 
Vidyamadhaveeyam, Chandrakala Naadi and many other works. 
It is obvious that the work of Satya Jaataka has also great 
influence on the research of this great astrologer. In fact this 
author has introduced some of the rare components in the 
predictive astrology which are not found generally in many 
astrological works. Each component has its root in some of the 
great classical works. Being a mathematician with his intelligence 
and extraordinary logic the author has summed up some of the 
unique points and brought out two volumes. Cleverly organized 
his points in these two volumes this work has been understood 
partially in the astrological circles and some of the latest 
computer astrological software includes a few points from this 
author's work to generate a required report. 

It is of no use to reader if the contents of these two volumes 
are simply reproduced. In order to make it more applicable to 
horoscope, I am explaining the major points and its applicability. 
Most of the first volume contains fundamentals and some 
extensive significations of signs; planets etc., Out of these most 
useful matters are discussed here.

While discussing sixty Indian years the author suggests an 
idea of timing of events based on the distribution of 60 years 
with their names commencing from Kaliyuga presumed to have 
commenced in Aries on chaitra shukla Prathama and allots 6 
degrees to each year and completes all the sixty years in 12 
zodiac signs each sign indicating 5 years. Based on this he has 
correlated the English years to the corresponding Indian names 
of the years commencing from 1987 to 2046. Occurring 
debatable phenomena over a component involved in framing 
rules in astrology is historically proved and this one is no 
exemption. Therefore, correctness of correlating names of Indian 



208 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



years with English years depends upon the fixing of the date of 
commencement of Kaliyuga. He intended to introduce varga 
charts for timing of events using these year, month and tithi 
etc., overriding the Dasha bhukti system. Author was to further 
research on this subject hence further details are missing. 
However, this clue is enough to go ahead with research. Since 
each year is covered by 6 degrees the divisional charts needs 
corresponding computation to match the timing of events. 

This work gives some of the fundamental which are rarely 
used in practice such as Rithu (seasons). Commonsense will 
play a role in using the seasons in predictions. No extraordinary 
relationship to planets need be established with the seasons as 
the sensations experienced by human during these seasons 
can be co-related with the nature of planets.

It is well known that the names of 12 months in Indian 
calendar are based on entry of Sun into a sign while the Moon 
is in a star during very close to Poornima. Thus when Moon is 
Chitta Nakshatra Sun entry into Aries is called Chaitra Masa. 
Similarly Moon's position in Vaishakha Sun's entry into Taurus 
and likewise, Jyeshta Moon- Ashadha, Shravana, Bhadrapada, 
Aswija, Kartika, Mrigasira Pushya Magha and Phalguna are 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 1 209 



named after basing on the Moon opposite Sun position. This 
closely relates to zodiac relationship and equally, the seasons 
also relate to Zodiac position. Therefore, both seasons and 
months are integral part of Zodiac sign with reference to position 
of Sun and Moon. Further certain components like Paksha, Vara, 
Hora details are described in this work. 

Each one of them has bearing on the personality and destiny 
of the person. Of course not in the original material by the 
author the scribe includes this with examples for the benefit of 
readers. 

Effects of Shukla Paksha on birth 

This is progressing towards full Moon the brightness keeps 
on increasing. The Moon is representative of mind, emotions 
and changes. Therefore the person wilt be interested in various 
subjects and will be emotionally balanced and understand things. 
He will be honest in his relationships and will balance himself in 
all situations. He will have interest in arts and things of beauty, 
He may be comfortable in finance matters. 

Effects of Krishna Paksha on birth 

This period is declining bright phases of Moon towards 
Amavasya the darker side. He will be secretive about his 
relationships and will use this for his benefits. He may use tactics 
to get benefit from others. They are more self-centered, cunning 
and hypocrite in nature. They may live together in a large family 
yet they seek to be independent and different from others. 

Tithi: 

This is one of the major components which is used in 
Muhurtha and is very important in deciding the nature of the 
day for doing any work. Every 12 degrees difference between 
longitude of Sun and Moon is one Tithi. Total 30 Tithi makes 
360 degrees. These are divided in to two parts commencing 
from New Moon to Full Moon and again Full Moon to New Moon.

In Indian calander it is called Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha. 
These are based on the phases of Moon on these two divisions. 
The same is illustrated below: 




Some of the astrological texts give the details of the qualities 
of persons born on each of these Tithi. I reproduce the same 
for the benefit of readers. 



Prathama: 

Good wife and native involves in illicit relationships

Amavasya 

Will enjoy good life and they are fierce to their enemies. 

However the author does not import this idea of prediction 
in his astrological works but uses this for a specific purpose 
which shall be incorporated in identifying the qualitative effect 
of certain houses when falling in signs for the person born under 
specific tithi. 

Tithi is one component which is used in this work specially 
to identity the void Zodiac signs (Dagdha Rasi). A brief content 
with regard to Dagdha Rasi is quoted to have found in 'Vidya 
madhaveyam" a Sanskrit edition available in Mysore Oriental 
Library. Contradicting its correctness in the original text the 
author simply submits the Dagdha Rasi for persons born in 
certain Tithi. A table is appended below with extra information 
of planets ruling the Tithi in groups as Nanda, Bhadra, Jaya, 
Rfkta and Poorna and the lords of sfgns against it. 



Use of tithi in birth horoscopes: 

the following signs are called Dagdha Rasi that is Zero 
signs. Though author refers to its roots in 
Vidyamadhaveeyam research is required to correct 
them to use in the horoscope predictions as detailed 
below. However no logical explanation is given for 
attribution of zero signs against each tithi.

Use in Horoscope: For a person born in these tithi the signs 
shown against them becomes zero signs and the relevant 
Bhava ruled by this sign will be of zero effect 



Persons born in these Tithi the signs shown against them 
will become Dagdha Rasi which is void and the Bhava denoted 
by this sign will have zero effect. Naturally, the lord ruling this 
Bhava or a planet posited in that sign will be defunct with respect 
to this Bhava. 



Nitya yoga in Panchangam: 

There are twenty seven yogas formed by combination of 
Sun and Moon. In panchangam Tithi is difference between the 
longitudes of Sun and Moon divided by 12 degrees. While yoga 
is the sum of Longitudes of Sun and Moon reckoned from Aries 
divided by a Star span of 13:20 minutes adding 1 to quotient.

The 6 th number in the above table of yoga is Athiganda. 
This is used in Muhurtha. However the author cuts a new path 
on the lines of Professor K.S. Krishnamurti. The author maintains 
Yoga seriatim and allots a star to yoga commencing from 
Pushyami to Vishkambha and continues in the order of 
Vimshottari Dasha covering all 27 yoga with respective star lords. 
By his method we may not get the yoga number as prescribed 
in Muhurtha as it is not simply the sum of longitude of Sun and 
Moon, it also adds up the longitude of beginning of Pushyami 
star in Cancer sign. He prescribes the following method to derive 
at a zodiac point by adding 93:20 which is the starting point of 
Pushyami star to the Sum of Sun and Moon longitude. This 
point represented by a star is considered as Yoga point. The 
star lord as per Vimshottari Dasha is considered as Yogi. The 
above calculation is presented in accordance with the new 
method of this system. The Star lord represents as yogi and the 
sign lord where this point falls becomes an alternate yogi which 
the author termed it as "Duplicate Yogi"

Here the Yogi is Moon and the Venus the lord of Taurus is 
Duplicate YogL 

Having set a system to arrive at Yogi and Duplicate Yogi, it 
is essential to determine a Avayogi planet. For any Yogi planet 
the Avayogi planet is an Enemy. It is not the traditional 
classification of friendship and enmity which is to be considered, 
Because to derive Avayoga status to a planet the author goes 
one step ahead and deviates from the classical approach towards 
friendship, enmity and neutral factors of planets. I presume 
that he has considered this aspect only for the purpose of arriving 
at Avayoga status as nowhere in his texts he refers the classical 
approach of planetary relationships.

This concept is not found in any of the traditional works 
either classical or Naadi approach. However some of them tally 
with Naadi principles Like Mercury and Mars, Saturn and Moon 
etc... The author does not give any logical explanation for this 
enmity factor to dignify a planet 'as Avayogi. (In this table 
enmity factor between Sun and Saturn, Moon and 
Mercury, Mercury and Mars, Venus and Jupiter, Saturn 
and Moon are to a certain extent coincide with 
traditionally accepted norms. Mars and Ketu, Jupiter and 
Sun, Rahu and Venus, Ketu and Rahu cannot be 
explainable. As a matter of fact the author himself 
includes Sun as benefic planet along with Jupiter group 
but tables him under enemy group- Despite having no 
logical explanations the scribe suggests to stick to the 
author's point of view) 

He further derives a three sets of planets where in one 
group will fall as enemy to other group which acts like Avayogi, 
The concept is illustrated below:

Despite the fact that the yoga point for this text is based on 
adding longitude of Pushyami star the beginning of yoga 
Vishkambha starts from this degree onwards. This differs from 
the normal computation of yoga in Muhurtha which is counted 
from Aswini. The significations of each of this yoga also differ in 
comparison. However author gives the following description of 
yoga based on computation advocated by him.

Though he deviates from the traditional system of 
considering yoga from Aswini star he supports his 
recommendation of counting Yoga from Pusyami star as its 
correctness is authenticated by his research. 

(Explanation: One possible argument to consider 
Cancer sign and Pushyami star starting point is, it is 
from here the Dakshinaayana starts where in all the 
festive seasons and auspicious days for functions begin 
in the mundane world. From Capricorn it is Uttarayana 
which represents exotic world the journey beyond body 
begins. A yoga or celebration is only for the living human 
being in the material world. Since Punarvasu has only 
one pada of Nakshatra which is at the beginning of sign 
normally considered as powerless for any planet, 
hopefully the next star Pushyami is considered. The deity 
of Pushyami star is Brihaspati that is Guru the Jeeva 
Karaka. This is only a hypothetical explanation in the 
absence of authors comment.) 



Karana 

Karana is half of a tithi is also component of Muhurtha. 
Though much significance is not attached to its use in predictive 
astrology in this work, its details are given. Like tithi it has 
certain qualities of birth the scribe feels that this can be used 
for the quality of Birth. Karana which of-course does not find 
any significant role in prediction astrology advocated by this 
system.

Planetary states of Dasha lord: Dasha Graha samyam: 

To find out the state of a planet count the number of signs 
the Ascendant moved from Aries. Again count the signs from 
Ascendant to sign where Dasha lord is posited in the natal chart. 
Multiply the sum of these two by twice the number of years 
allotted to of Dasha lord. Divide the product by 27 and the 
remainder will give the state of Dasha planet. 

This is not the Planetary Avastha discussed in earlier 
chapters. This computation and considerations are exclusively 
given to assess the condition of Dasha lord in this work. Author 
gives about 27 states of these planets and however does not 
seem to give much importance in application. Our aim is to pick 
up important applicable matters. Therefore I skip this 
information. 

Rectification of Dasha balance 

There is a reference to rectify the period of balance of Birth 
Dasha. He derives the 41 days difference computed by deducting 
324 of stellar days as (Dasha system is based on stars) from 
365 days of a calendar year. This difference per year have to be 
calculated on either balance of period remaining of a Dasha at 
birth time or the expired period of Dasha at birth time whichever 
is higher. The results in days converted to year month and days 
are to be added to the balance of Dasha. Then rest of the 
calculation remains unaltered. This is to be done only for birth 
time balance Dasha, 

This logic is applicable when manual calculations of Dasha 
are done. Latest computer programs have given options for 
different computing considerations. 

I am omitting the contents which deal with significations of 
signs and planets, stars and houses which are all available in 
many texts. I am also omitting the discussion on Ayanamsha.

Fundamentals like calculating Lagna etc. are of preliminary 
nature and I go directly to some of the important topics not 
generally covered in modern texts. 



Tatwa theory: 

In astrology four elements are adopted in sign qualities as 
shown below: the fifth Akasha tatwa is an integral part of all 
these tatwas. In this section the original author has used the 
five elements for time rectification and also to decide the gender 
of native.

Though there have been references to these five elements 
in traditional astrology rarely the real use of this is discussed. 
However in this section, the author has suggested to use them 
to decide gender and also to rectify the time of birth. 
Authenticated from Jatakaphala Chintamani the author of this 
theory explains the five elemental cycles in a day. These are 
Prithvi (earth), Jala Tatwa (water), Agni (Fire), and Vayu (Air). 
These are of-course discussed in various parts of astrology and 
have relevance in day to day affairs. The scribe has tested this 
and planning to research its use in Naadi astrology. The element 
ruling at the time of birth will indicate the gender of the native 
born. This many times proved correct.

The birth is 
above. 



of a male person which is indicated 



The duration of is 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 minutes. Thus if there 
is a mismatch between birth gender and elemental indication 
the rectification may have to be made between any of these 
ranges. However further divisions of Antara tatwa also suggested 
by distributing the major span of tatwa in the same ascending 
or descending order of the main tatwa and this span of major 
tatwa is to be distributed among other tatwa proportionately 
basing on their respective spans. This however may be 
experimented, if in case of mismatch of gender and the shorter 
time span correction is essential especially to ensure the 
correctness of micro divisional charts. 

Sub divisions are based on simple rule that is duration of 
tatwa is to be distributed to among the five tatwa proportionately 
as per their main duration. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 1 227 



This point is highlighted in this work while discussing about 
Birth time, Lagna calculations, and house divisions. 

The effects of tatwa: 

The one born in order sequence of tatwa will have gradual 
progress in all aspects of life. One born in reverse order sequence 
will experience hardships in progress. 

Earth element: Internal earth elements include head hair, 
body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bone, organs, intestinal 
material, It also indicates firmness, stability and solid matters 

Water element: Internal water elements include bile, 
phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, nasal mucus, urine, etc. 
It is emotional element, flow of thoughts, moving and flowing. 

Fire: Internal fire elements include those bodily mechanisms 
that produce physical warmth, aging, digestion, etc. Energetic 
enthusiastic, Vitality, force and authority 

Air element: Internal air element includes air associated 
with the pulmonary system and the intestinal system. It indicates 
intelligence, adjustability, search and distance travels 

Space element: Internal space element includes tpodily 
orifices such as the ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, etc. it indicates 
inner quest, though metaphysical will find interest in varied 
matters and are nature lovers. 

House division: 

While erecting the chart the author prefers unequal division 
of chart and mostly relates his argument similar to Professor 
Krishnamurti. Though he refers Sripathi paddati, his intention 
of using word "Cusp" establishes that the house division is to 
be based on unequal house system. However in his example 
chart he does no depict the cusps though he hints that a sign 
may contain more than one cusp which leads some sign lords 
losing their house lordships. 



228 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Shadbala: 

Not attaching qualitative effects of planets by their six fold 
strength, he recommends the quantitative effects by shadbala 
of planets. He describes shadbala in accordance with 
fundamentals in classical texts. However he indicates the typical 
results of some of the strengths of planets. For example, Kalabala 
gives good effects of matter relating to time, Chestabala prompts 
for movements, changes. Uccabala supports in all matters. 
Digbala will support command over others and Ayanabala in 
directional effects. Stanabala denotes Status. Application of this 
strength even extended to divisional chart. 

There is lengthy discussion about yoga like 
panchamahapurusha yoga adhi yoga etc., which are covered in 
classical texts, like Phaladeepika etc. 

Bhava Phala 

In this section the author has dealt in details some of his 
points that are logically convincing and hence I prefer to 
elaborate on this. I also offer my comments on points. 

1. A Bhava will thrive when it has the aspect of its own lord 
(The word aspect includes its position in a Bhava for Bhava 
analysis and when relates to planets it also includes 
conjunction). 

2. Aspects are considered from signs (not cusps) and the 
strength of such aspect is based on the longitude difference 
between the planets in aspect. 

3. All planets aspect 7 th sign from their position. Mars, Saturn 
Jupiter, and Nodes have special aspects. 4 th & 8 th , 3 rd and 
10 th and 5 th & 9 th respectively. 

4. Houses 3-6-8-12 are malefic places and planets here will 
not give good results. Planets in other houses give good 
results except 2 nd house which is neutral and the planet 
placed here also behave like neutral. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 1 229 

5. As a Lord of good house when a planet sits in another good 
house the effect is to be read two ways. 

a. The good effect of the house where a lord is posited is 
attributed to matters of his house lordships to be 
enjoyed by the Native as houses involved are reckoned 
from Lagna, 

b. The house posited by the lord if falls in 3-6-8-12 place 
reckoned from houses owned by him, then the bad 
effects of these houses may attribute to the houses 
owned by him. This bad effect should especially be 
considered to the relative of the native indicated by 
the Houses owned by the Lord 

6. A planet eclipsed by Sun and defeated in planetary war 
cannot give good results being in good houses and they 
tend to give worst results in bad houses except Saturn and 
Venus. 

7. House hemmed between malefics does not produce its good 
effects and therefore the planet sitting in that house will 
not get the good effects of the house. (In other words 
this house then falls under category of 3-6-8-12 and 
the nature of such bad quality to be assessed by the 
nature of malefic surrounding this house). Benefics 
in the place of Malefics the Bhava will thrive. 

8. Placed in junction of two Bhavas that is Bhava sandhi a 
Planet will will become ineffective in getting the significations 
of the two houses of Junction. Whereas as a lord and Karaka 
of certain houses and his natural Karakatwa results can be 
expected of him considering his qualitative 
modifications being in a sign and Bhava. 

9. Planets will be strong in exact cuspal point and at the two 
ends of Bhava it will have zero effect. In the intermediate 
position commencing from beginning point it yields 
progressive results and in the later part it will the 
results will be declining progressively. (This portion 



230 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

of the rule in practice is not always applicable as 
many horoscopes have shown contradictory results.) 

10. A Planet is effective in two ways: one by its natural 
qualitative dignity and the other by its functional dignities. 
Either of these qualities may become favorable or 
unfavorable depending upon the nature of the sign and the 
Bhava it represents. Both aspects are to be attributed to 
the results of the planet during its period. 

Following paragraph will be helpful to differentiate the 
functional and natural dignities of the planet. 

Natural Benefits: Jupiter, Mercury, Venus and Shukla 
Paksha Moon without any malefic conjunction. The author 
attributes benefic quality to Sun. 

Natural Malefics: Saturn, Mars, Rahu, Ketu and Krishna 
Paksha Moon 

Functional Benefits: Planets not owning houses 3-6-8- 
12. 

Functional Malefics: Planets owning houses 3-6-8-12. 

A Planet having dual lordship of houses each from the above 
acts both as functional benefic and malefic simultaneously and 
his natural signification is also to be taken into consideration. 

Natural benefic planets give their natural benefic effects 
when they are placed in benefic houses and malefic effects of 
their significations when placed in malefic houses except in 3 rd 
and 6 th house being upachaya houses where they give 
progressively good effects of their significations. 

A. Results of the Bhava posited or having an aspect to 
a Bhava 

1. Natural Benefic planets flourish the Bhava they occupy 
and aspect. In Benefic Bhava their natural signification 
will get enhanced and in 3 rd and 6 th Bhava progressively 
their natural significations will improve and in 8 and 
11 th Bhava their significations will have bad effect. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 1 231^ 

2. Natural Malefic planets decline the good effects of Bhava 
they occupy and aspect. Their natural significations get 
modified as said in the earlier Para. 

3. Natural Benefic Planet when exalted gives good effect 
of their Natural significations. 

4. Natural Malefic Planet when exalted gives bad effects 
of their Natural significations. 

5. Both Natural Benefic and Malefic when placed in their 
own house give good effects of their Natural 
significations. 

B. Results of the houses owned by Planet being in a 
Bhava 

1. Functional Benefic planet in Benefic Bhava: the houses 
owned by the Functional Benefic will thrive. 

2. Functional Benefic Planet in Malefic Bhava: the houses 
owned by the Functional Benefic will decline. 

3. Functional Malefic Planet in Benefic Bhava: the bad effects 
houses owned by the Functional Benefic will thrive. 

4. Functional Malefic Planet in Malefic Bhava: the bad effects 
of the houses owned by them will considerably reduce and 
even it may lead to'Vipareeta Yoga" sudden goodness may 
experience after a bad experiences. 

5. Functional Benefic Planets if exalted is good for the houses 
owned by them and if it is in their own house it is still good. 

6. Functional Malefic Planets if exalted bad for the houses 
owned by them. 

7. Both Functional Benefic and Malefic if placed in own house 
always flourish the houses owned by them. 

The Natural Karaka results and Functional house results 
are to be read together with their independent results.

Functional Benefic Planets for this horoscope: 

Jupiter Lord of 1 and 10 is posited in 2 nd House according 
to House division. 

Jupiter as Functional benefic being in good Bhava, the native 
has good professional career and earns money. Due to 1 st lord 
being in 2 nd he spends lot on family. As karaka being in good 
Bhava, he has cultivated good habits and nobility. Being in Venus 
sign, he however has luxurious desires. We need to take the 
enmity factor of Venus to Jupiter who is also in mutual 7 th aspect 
besides being in Scorpio sign positioned in 8 th house in bhava. 
Therefore he will not be benefited from the inherited property 
of father. Apart from this he will also overcome certain bad 
habits and hurdles in life. Jupiter aspects 7 th house and 11 th 
house he will get married to a working girl. 

Mars Lord of 2 nd and 9 is posited in 7 th house according to 
House division. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 1 237 



Being lord of 2 nd in 7 th house he will gain from in-laws 
house. Being lord of fortune in 7 th house he will have foreign 
journeys. Considering 7 th house of native as Lagna to his wife, 
Mars becomes 3 rd and 8 th lord which is not good for the wife 
which may cause health and difficulties to her in life. 

Mercury Lord of 4 th and 7 th posited in 7 th House according 
to house division. 

Mercury not only 4 th lord representing education, but also 
karaka for education being in 7^ own house and exalted and 
Bhavath Bhava rule 4 th lord is 4 th from his house will give him 
education after education being the sign of commerce he will 
thrive in that line. 4 th lord is also associated with Moon 5 th lord 
though weak, supports him in changing education. This is also 
having aspect of Jupiter not only being Lagna lord but also 
being 10 th lord; hence he will continue education relating to his 
profession during his professional career. 7 th Lord being in 7 th 
house, he will have professional related foreign travel and his 
wife will be self-centered. 

Moon lord of 5 th house posited in 7 th House according to 
house division 

5 th lord in 7 th house, which Is house of wisdom, is good but 
for progeny matter 5 th lord is 3 rd from his own house and he is 
with 12 th lord to 5 th house. He will face problems in progeny 
matters. 

Functional Malefic 

Sun lord of 6 th house posited in 7 th house according to 
house division 

The 6 th effect is reduced but the 7 th house gets the effect of 
12 th house to it. Therefore, often there will be temporary 
separations from wife. 6 th lord being in in conjunction with Rahu 
and Mars, the native may encounter health problems which 
may relate to Rahu Mars Sun and also inner parts of 6 th house, 
7 th house and 8 th house.

But he will face difficulties with respect to siblings, Karaka going 
to 8 th house will again indicating problems to or with marital 
life. 

Saturn lord of 11 th and 12 th house posited in 5* house 
according to house division 

Saturn as Longevity karaka being in a good house, good 
longevity can be expected. As 11 th and 12 th Lord being in a 
good house his income and expenditure are under control. As 
12 th lord and Saturn being in 5 th house, the progeny matter 
may be delayed but Saturn having aspect to his own house 
delayed progeny is indicated. Saturn also aspect 7 th house and 
2 nd house he gains from foreign trips and gain from spouse, 

Rahu posited in Libra represents 8 th house but positioned 
in 7 th house according to house division. This is also one of the 
reasons which indicate health problems to spouse. It indicates 
difficulties to the native through spouse. 

Ketu posited in Aries represents 2 nd house but positioned in 
1 st house according to house division. 

Despite the fact that finance is good, the self-efforts are 
needed to get the desired income. Ketu causes body pains being 
in 1 st house. Ketu aspect 6 th house 10 th house there will be 
health problems caused due to tensions at work. 

4 th lord is in 4 th to 4 th : Education + Education. He did 
attempt multiple education.

242 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Modifications to be applied to rules: 

1. A planet will retain its yoga status even if it gets negative 
status by other dignities. 

2. Yogi planets or the planets in their stars will give positive 
results. Similarly Avayoga planets or the planets in their 
stars will give negative results. 

3. Yoga planet give good results in Positive Rasi, Bhava or 
star and Avayoga planets gives good results in Negative 
Rasi, Bhava or star. 

4. Zero Rasis are good when falls as 6 th , 8 th , 12 th houses. 

5. Positive planets including yoga planets give considerable 
good results even if they are in negative dignities if they 
are retrograde. This condition is not good for negative 
planets. 

6. Nodes to be treated as natural negative planets. They need 
to be in negative dignities for good results. 

7. In dual lordship consider the Positive and negative house 
lordship simultaneously. 

8. Planets in mutual aspect will share significations and in 
such circumstances they may exchange results. 

9. Planet will get the significations of a planet and house it 
aspects 

10. Avayogi in an enemy star ( as per the table above) will give 
good results and inter changing star position of Yogi and 
duplicate yogi gives good results. 

With this we shall analyze the example horoscope: 

1. Moon-Avayogi but also duplicate yogi in the Star of yogi 
group Mars. Therefore being 5 th a positive house lord Placed 
in a Positive house and being in a Yogi group star and 
posited in positive sign aspects Lagna. It is linked to Saturn's, 
aspect therefore, houses 11, 12, 5 th house are also linked 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 1 243 



to him with a malefic effect of Saturn and also 12 th house. 
But Saturn is a Yogi planet. Therefore all results of Moon 
should be good for this Native. 

(Note: Native yet to get Moon Dasha but in Jupiter Dashd 
Moon bhukti is shortly expected and verily the native is 
planning for progeny during that period) 

2. Mars- Yogi Group is lord of positive houses, 2 nd and 9 th by 
placement also Mars is in Positive 7 th house, He is also in 
positive sign. But he is in the Rahu star that represents 8 th 
sign from Lagna but situated in 7 th house. He is also linked 
to 3 rd house by his 8 th aspect. These two are negative points. 
Mars is positive for 2 nd , 9 th , 7 th , 11 th house matters but 
creates problems relating to 3 rd and 8 th maters. 

(Note: Native was born in Mars Dasha and it lasted till Oct 
1982 that is up to his & h year of age. He had very good 
appetite and was given all comforts but due to operation of 
3 rd and 8 th house he had to be separated from working 
parent whole day being in a crutch all these years and he 
had constipation problem during that period.) 

3. Mercury is lord of positive houses 4 th and 7 th by placement 
he is not only in 7 th a positive house lord but also in his own 
exalted house which is also a positive sign. He is also in the 
star of Yogi Group Mars. All round positive effects are 
expected from this planet. Mercury is linked Lagna by aspect 
and through Saturn it is linked to 11, 12, 5 th and by Moon it 
is linked to 5 th again. 

(Note: Native is yet to get this Dasha, but in Jupiter Dasha 
he was running Mercury Bhukti from June 2005 to 
September 2007. During this period he had a few foreign 
assignments. He had completed higher professional course 
sponsored by his employer due to the fact that 4 th lord is in 
4 th to 4 th house. He had good promotional career. During 
this period he got married). 

4. Jupiter retrograde is Avayogi in the star of negative house 
lord and is the lord in group of of two positive houses 1 st 



244 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



and 10 th house by placement he is in 2 nd house. By sign 
position it is in 3 rd which is little negative point. He is in the 
star of 6 th lord Sun who also indicated as enemy in the 
yoga table. Therefore it should be good. He is linked to 4 th , 
7 th 5 th and 3 and 8 th lord by aspect. He links to 7* 1 house 8 th 
house and 11 th house by aspect. Therefore as far as his 
professional matters are concerned Jupiter should give good 
results. Though first house matters are taken care by him 
yet being linked to 6 th and 8 th he will cause health trouble. 
He is also linking 3 rd house which is loss house to 4 th and 
he is also linking karaka for mother Moon (weak) (4 th house) 
and then linking house of distress that is 8 th . He should 
cause disturbance in the relational matter of 4 th house. Being 
retrograde though he is strong for his positive houses and 
karaka signification yet he is equally bad for health and 
other matters. 

(Note: in October 2000, Jupiter in his Dasha and 
Bhukti commenced positive results by giving him 
career start. However his negative effects were also 
felt during his Bhukti period commencing from 
October 2000 to November 2002 during which 
period he gave negative effect of 4 th house as he 
signifies 3 rd house and linking weak Moon karaka 
for mother. He lost his mother within 10 days of his 
getting the new job. 10 th house is Maraka for 4 th 
house. 3 rd house is 12 th house to 4 th house and 5 th 
house is maraka for 4 th house mother which is linked 
through Saturn aspect to 4 th lord and 4 th karaka. 11 th 
house is 8 th house to 4 th house which is again linked 
to 4 th house and 4 th lord and karaka through Saturn. 
He lost his mother. During the same period he 
suffered from lungs problem and was hospitalized.) 

(Imp: It could be possible that a retrograde planet 
when gets Avayoga Saturn might loose that status 
and gives good results & also gives bad results by 
his positional dignity.) 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 1 245 



5. Ketu Avayogi and natural negative planet represents a 
positive house 2 nd and by position again goes to 1 st house. 
He is in his own star and by all means he is in positive 
place. By aspect he links to 6 th and 10 th house. His bhukti 
period commenced from September 2007 ended during 
August 2008. Though he did not do any harm to 10 th house 
matter and 2 nd house matter, his 6 th house effects were 
severely felt by the native during this period having 
hardships and enmity factors at work place causing tensions 
and worry. He had also suffered health problems during 
this period. 

6. Sun being a negative lord of 6 th house posited in a positive 
house 7 th is not good for 7 th house matters. He is in the star 
of Mars who is a positive planet being in yoga group. This 
also helps 6 th matter. Being in debilitated sign being negative 
planet he becomes good. Sun aspects 2 nd house. 

(Note during Jupiter Dash a Sun bhukti commenced 
on April 2011. This Sun has given the native a good 
financial jump in a new job. Health of the native is 
excellent. - Job status is good. Though bad to 7 th 
house the Sun did not do much harm to 7 th house 
except that the native's wife left the job). 

Dasha system with Distinctive Bhukti Readings 

This is the most important chapter in any astrological works 
which deals with the timing of an event. There are number of 
Dasha systems in traditional astrological classical works. However 
most universally accepted and adopted system is Vimshottari 
Dasha system. Author of this work naturally deals with this 
system. With a logical argument he puts forth his novel system. 
Nine planets assigned to each star in 3 groups of Nakshatra 
assigned in the three zones measuring 120 degrees each which 
covers 12 signs, 27 Nakshatra and 360 degrees from as Dasha 
sequence commencing from the lord of assigned to the star 
falling in the longitude of Moon at birth. The Bhukti and further 
Antar dashas are computed by a rule of proportion based on 



246 



Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



the number of years allotted to each Dasha. In Dasha all the 
nine planets appear as Bhukti and in Bhukti again all the nine 
planets appear as Antara. Therefore it is quite natural that all 
the 9 planets will appear repeatedly in all Dasha, Bhukti and 
Antara. Whatever the methods adopted to derive the 
significations of the planets ultimately the significations remain 
same with changing sequence of Antar Dasha which reckons 
with the beginning Dasha or Bhukti planet. The author puts this 
argument and presents his novel method in analyzing Bhukti

However the Dasha analysis is to be based on the Positive

For Bhukti the present unique system is to be used to identify 
the Starter planet and Ruler planet to each bhukti. 

Components involved in this method 

1. Instead of Birth Moon star, the current Dasha lord falling 
first after Moon Birth star will be taken as birth star. 

2. Having used Tithi Nakshatra and Yoga, now the week day 
of birth is considered for this purpose

In the example horoscope we shall see these three points. 

The current Dasha star lord is Visakha. The day of birth is 
Friday the 6 th day counted from Sunday. The Sun star remains 
always Krittika for computation of any bhukti. 



To find the starter for a Bhukti 

1. Count from Krittika the Star of Sun to the Bhukti star lord in 
the order of Dasha (which naturally is) and double the 
counted number. 

2. Count from the current Dasha star lord (i.e., current Dasha 
lord) to the Bhukti Lord in the same Dasha order and note 



248 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



the number 

3. Count from Sunday till the birth week day and note the 

number. 

4. Add the total and divide by nine in a manner that the 
reminder does not exceed 9. 

5. Count from Sun this reminder number in the Dasha order 
and arrive at the planet. This planet is STARTER for bhukti. 

To find the Ruler for a Bhukti 

1. Count from from Bhukti lord to star lord of Bhukti in 
Dasha sequence 

2. Count the same number derived in above from starter 
in Dasha sequence and that Planet is Ruler 

For the example chart I have worked out the Starter and 
Ruler for all the Bhukti in guru Dasha which is in the table 
format involving all the above rules. It is easier to understand

250 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

the above rules in the table given below: 

The Ruler of Jupiter Bhukti Saturn as a ruler is yogi Planet; 
hence materially good results were felt during Jupiter Bhukti. 
However at relational matters it did not help him and he lost his 
mother due to Saturn linking to 4 th house and 4 th lord. 

In Saturn Bhukti Moon as ruler being both duplicate yogi 
and Avayogi, he did have mixed results during Saturn Bhukti. 
Materially good but health disturbed. 

In Mercury Bhukti Mars being ruler who is yogi planet linking 
to 7 th , 2 nd and 9 th gave him marriage and foreign trips. 

In Ketu Bhukti Rahu is ruler being a negative planet created 
problems in job and health. 

In Venus Bhukti ruler being Mercury, the bad effects of 8 th 
and 3 rd house is considerably reduced but no significant good 
happened. 

In current Sun Bhukti ruler Venus being in Yogi Star has 
boosted the career with financial increments. 

However, though this exercise is little lengthy yet there is 
some logic convincingly working behind it. The negative and 
positive effects of planets are convincing. More application and 
research on this can lead to precise structured approach. 

The author has discussed a few more points with regard to 
Dasha readings which are essential for further research and 
study. He has also discussed about use of divisional chart for 
predictive purposes. To conclude this subject the scribe would 
like to endorse the use of divisional chart to assess the strength 
of the planet to give its karaka effect in relation to matters 
assigned to D charts. 

This is a tribute to the legendary author Sri H S Seshadri 
Iyer 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 251 



STELLAR BASED NAADI SYSTEM - METHOD-2 

The stars and its related computations are the basis which 
differentiates the system of prediction between conventional 
and Naadi Astrology. This is evident from the earlier chapters 
wherein the diversified star level computations were introduced 
by different methods accredited with the Naadi title. There is 
no specific different subject as Naadi Astrology, it is only the 
deviated divisional effects either star based or sign based 
incorporated in the mainstream astrology entitled as Naadi 
system. The only exception is the miraculous mantra naadi and 
the collection of palm leaf horoscopes finding its origin in South 
and North India which are standalone system in Naadi astrology. 
However a few ancient scholars having access to some of the 
great works of seers have culminated the vital minute divisional 
effects and established the new path of prediction as Naadi 
system which deviated from gross level conventional approach. 
Some of the great works of seers are lying in libraries in different 
parts of the country. A few traditional family/institutions in India 
and abroad believed to have some of the old scriptures handed 
down from ancestors. In the recent centuries modern scholars 
in astrology who toiled to get hold some of these works and re- 
framed these computational methods with their expressive logic 
and naturally related it to either Naadi or new discoveries. 
Whatever the name they assign to their modified predictive 
principles, ultimately all these principles should fit in to delineate 
from the Signs, Houses, Planets and Stars being the pillars of 
main stream astrology. 

Late Sri R Gopalakrishna Row and Sri N V Raghava Charry 
worked simultaneously on stellar system of astrology. They were 
guided by a scholar in Budha Naadi astrology. Sri R Gopalakrishna 
row published three volumes of stellar astrology. Later on Sri 
N.V. Raghava Charry published the Practical Stellar Astrology 
book claiming to be original research work. Though there are 
minute differences in certain fundamental attributes in both the 



252 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

works the main theme of the system is based on star level 
prediction. The Dasha as in traditional astrology is based on the 
moon position in a star at the time of birth. These stars are 
allotted planets to form an order for timing the event. Why a 
particular planetary order is selected for Dasha is well explained 
in my Naadi book titled as Prashna Hora. The entire scheme of 
astrology is directly linked to astronomical order. However for 
easy reference the 9 stars falling in the 120 degrees zone of 
zodiac are considered in order and the planets commencing 
from Ketu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, 
Mercury are allotted to the stars and the same order of planets 
repeated for the next two zones of stars. Timing the events 
being the crucial part in astrology, these planets as Dasha lords 
and their fractional time indicators as sub periods lords are 
reoriented with their planetary lordships and positions and the 
progressive prediction parts are framed in rules. We have seen 
in earlier chapters how the star level significations are being 
used in different methods. In this system the stars are used in 
relation to Dasha planets and their disposition in the chart as 
lords of different houses are studied for which several sets of 
principles were framed by these two legends. This is the 
beginning part and the same work with modified concept further 
developed into Krisnamurti paddhati by Professor K.S. 
Krisnamurti which is the last chapter in this work. 

Though combined efforts were put in for this system of 
astrology, independently two works originated from the two 
authors Sri R Goplakrishna Row and Sri N V Raghava Chary. 
Both were colleagues and friends having interest in astrology. 
Certain common features in their horoscope linking to sign Meena 
(Pisces) both have their pen name as Meena. Earlier book was 
published by Sri. R. G Row in three parts. In 1995 the modified 
version of the practical stellar astrology written by Sri N V 
Raghava Chary (Meena- 2) was published. Both the works 
advocate same principles which are based on stellar system. 
Using selected information from these works of both the authors 
the scribe presents an applicable module with explanatory notes 
and additional information from other matching works.

Useful Fundamentals: 

Normally in Astrological books more than the main points 
fundamentals are elaborated/ To avoid repetition the scribe 
restricts to give only essential fundamentals relating to this 
particular system. 

Normally Sun being attributed with the powers of Trimurti, 
Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshwara, in some texts the Sun is attributed 
with Satvik Guna. Being reflector of the Moon it is also given 
the same tatwa. Jupiter being the noblest character again it is 
also given the same Satvik tatwa, Ketu is being a moksha karaka 
for him also Satvik Guna is attributed. Mercury being the 
intellectual planet and Venus being the pleasurable planets, both 
are given Rajasic Guna. Rest of the planets that is Saturn, Mars, 
and Rahu are given Tamasic Guna. The Guna itself is transitory 
nature and changes from one Guna to another Therefore no 
planet can be attributed with a fixed Guna. The later author 
maintains this in his own style. 

In this work The Stars and planets were allotted Guna as 
follows:

Note; Many astrological works have different 
attribution of gunas to planets. Each author follows 
certain authenticated work suitable to him and adopts 
it throughout his work. Some intellectual authors use 
their gifted logical approach and modify them to testify 
the application of rules. Readers distinctively use the 
rules restricting their application only to the particular 
method being advocated by author. When the 
fundamentals are mixed up with different systems, the 
structure will get disturbed and we may often face 
failures which normally we designate it to the authors. 

The author has given simple signification of gunas. The 
scribe elaborated which is useful to this particular system.

The following portion of the infromation is one of the 
highlight of stellar system of astrology advocated by the two 
authors. 

The basic guna of the planets will undergo modifications 
when they are in a star. 

1. A Planet will acquire the Guna of the planet in whose star it 
is posited. 

2. Rajasic and Satvik planets should not get (being in the stars 
of) Tamasic nature. 

3. Tamasic planets getting Rajasic nature renders them to give 
bad results. 

4. Inter change between planets of Satvik & Rajasic will 
undergo modifications and will give mixxed effects. 

5. Further cosmical changes iri Gunas are also explained where 
in a planet will be imbided with three gunas and the 
predomience however is its star position. It is a matter of 
research and these details can be had from the authors 
original works. At present it is enough to know that a planet 
undergoes change in its guna by being in a star.

The author ephatically states that Rahu and Ketu are similar 
to Saturn and Mars. Using the logic that they are always retrogrde 
in their motion, the scribe reversed the exaltation and deblitated 
positions of Saturn to Rahu and Mars to Ketu.

Important aspect of this is to find the stregnth of these 
planets when they get associated with the above houses. For 
example Sun is in or associated, aspected or in the star of any 
planet having lordship of 10 th he gets dig bala. Similarly if he is 
assocaited with other lords he gets the percentage of stregnth 
according to the house mentioned above. 



Moola trikona and own sign: 

Exlatation sign of Sun is Aries, Moola trikona and own sign 
happens to be same Leo. 

Moon gets exalted in Taurus having its Moola trikona and 
his own house is in Cancer. 

Mars gets exalted in Capricorn and his Moola trikona is 
Aries own sign is Scorpio: 

For Ketu the exalted place is opposite of Mars that is Cancer 
and his own and moola trikona is Scorpio. 

Mercury gets exalted in his own Moolatrikona sign and his 
own house is Mithuna.

Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Exaltation sign is Cancer and Moola trikona of Jupiter is 
Sagittarius and own house is Meena. 

Venus is exalted in Pisces and his Moolatriona is Libra and 
own house is Taurus. 

Saturn is exalted in Libra and his Moolatrikona is Aquarius 
and own house is Capricorn. 

There is a variation which the scribe included here about 
the own signs which is the result of experiment on this system. 

Rahu is exalted in the opposite sign to Libra that is Aries 
and his Moolatrikona and own house is Capricorn. 

The authors have not prescribed any Moola trikona or own 
sign for Rahu and Ketu. Emphatically they claim that the Rahu 
equalling Saturn and Ketu equalling Mars. The other houses of 
Saturn and Mars where their Moola trikona does not fall is alloted 
to nodes as their moola trikona and own house. 

Friendly or enemy houses 

Planets in their friends' houses attain strength and in the 
enemy sign become weak. Similarly they attain strength or 
weakness by being in the stars of friends or enemies.

There is no uniform friendship and enmity factor. Each 
system has its own enmity and friendship set for planets. It is 
not even based on the Satvik Rajasic Tamasic qualities of the 
planets. (However the scribe in his experiments found out the 
best method of determining the relationship of planets. It is 
very simple and logical. Identify the particular matter from the 
natural significations of a selected planet and compare identified 
matter with the significations of other planet. If both matters 
are in harmony then consider them as friends to that particular 
matter. If it negates take them as enemy to that matter. In this 
method there is no question of outright friendship or enmity 
among two planets. The compatibility will be based on the 
particular matter in their significations. This logic can be extended 
to house matters also. If a particular house matter is supported 
by any planet or any lord for that matter the relationship with 
that lord or planet can be taken as positive. Otherwise treat it 
as enemy to that particular matter.) 

Following the previous trend we shall focus on applying the 
principles in this work for an example horoscope: date of Birth 
22-10-1976, Born on Friday, evening at 5 pm. Tithi is Amavasya. 

First we shall compute the strengths of planets:

The above results are generalized and cannot be taken as 
ultimate. Fundamentally contradicting qualitative effects between 
friendship and enmity, harmony of Guna, natural malefic and 
benefic nature of planets and their lordship with their positional 
dignities are to be examined. The Guna factor is an additional

component in order to assess the nature of results to be 
experienced by native. 



Jeeva and Shareera 




Taurus 



Gemini 



The entire subject of Astrology is based on interchanging 
positions of Sun and Earth on Earth's orbit Therefore it is the 
orbit of Sun around the earth which takes a year to complete 
one circular motion. Each planet has its own orbit in the order 
of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, on one side (Earth path Sun path or 
same), Venus, and Mercury on the other side. The Moon 
revolving round the earth and the Sun's motion is equated with 
earth's motion. Sun and Moon paths are considered as whole 
circle around the earth. The orbits of other planets are divided 
into two portion one visible half circle and the other is invisible 
half circle. These sections of the orbits are ruled by the five 
planets as their lords. The Sun and Moon revolve round the 
earth and they rule the entire path. Thus 5 planets rule 10 



268 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



sections and Sun and Moon rule other 2 sections. These sections 
are equally distributed at 30 degrees each forming an imaginary 
elliptical circle extended beyond stars. These divisions are named 
after the shapes formed by group of stars falling in each division 
and thus 6 visible and 6 invisible parts are called 12 zodiac 
signs. The root of imaginary belt is planetary paths therefore 
each division of path of a planet is ruled by it. Remember the 
interchanged position of Sun and Earth. The Astrology is based 
on the concept that earth is stationary and entire solar system 
moving around it. This solar system is seen through the zodiac 
formed by orbital path of planets. Due to this the revolving 
earth is considered as Suns revolution around earth which takes 
1 year. Therefore the Sun stays in a sign for one month. This is 
because of revolving movement of Sun. Next is earth spins on 
its axis in 24 hours. This has to be reflected through Sun keeping 
earth as nonmoving object. Therefore keeping the Sun in the 
same sign, the zodiac is moved at the spinning rate. This makes 
every sign to rise at horizon at an interval of approximately 2 
hours and all the 12 signs rise at horizon within 24 hours. Entire 
month the sign where Sun is posited will be rising in the horizon 
along with Sun. When month changes, the next sign will continue 
to be rising at horizon along with Sun for the entire month. 2 
hours each sign will change whereas the the Sun will remain in 
the same sign for the entire month. These rising signs are called 
ascendants. We have all the 12 Ascendants rising in 24 hours. 
In this daily cosmic plan the rays of Sun representing universal 
Atma energizes the eastern horizon with several Jeevatma 
destined to be born on earth through 12 zodiac signs. In this 
celestial bombardment, not only the Jeevatma but also other 
wonders of creations are also activated including plant, mineral 
and animal Kingdom. Through Ascendant the Jeeva comes into 
being in the world and therefore, logically the astrological texts 
consider Lagna as Jeeva. 

The advantage of flexibility of Indian philosophy is, it can 
be universally applied. Hitherto science claimed that mind is 
outcome of brain. Modern scientists, especially psychological 
experts are diving into exploration of consciousness. They have 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 



269 



to a certain extent established that the brain is an instrument 
like computer with circuits. Conscious at different parts trigger 
the cells of brain which generates wavelengths. These 
wavelengths when perceivable with 5 senses collectively is called 
mind. In its perception shapes and varied sensibilities are 
generated and perceived by the mind. Beyond this perception 
what exists is energy. Mind is a product of brain, triggered by 
consciousness, creates illusions through its functional ability of 
perception. The human being as physical body and the material 
world is one such product of mind which it perceives through 
five sense wavelengths. Each of these wavelengths interacts 
with chemical activities to produce nine different qualities of 
experiences and expressions. This relationship philosophically 
explained by great seers as Panchendriaya and Navarasa.

The planets allotted to nava rasa is for another purpose, 
however, it is to establish that all the feelings, perceptions are 
the creation of mind and its chemical reactions. If Jeeva is the 
triggering factor, the Body is the illusion of mind which is ruled 
by Moon. 

If Jeeva is the ascendant which is derivative of Sun moment, 
the Shareera is the derivative of Moon which is represented by 
the sign where the Moon is posited. This is called Ascendant of 
Moon. 

This factor has some sensible predictive aspects in astrology. 
However there is one more concept of Jeeva and Shareera, 



270 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

A large percentage in the human race suffers due to 
disharmony between the conscious and the illusionary effects 
of Mind. This disharmony can be identified by the strength of 
these two ascendants and their relationship in the horoscope. 
The assessment is based on static space matter that is both 
signs of Ascendants and dynamic lords of these signs. Benefic 
and malefic influences are judged for these components to 
determine the favorable or unfavorable experiences of the native 
during his life time. The horoscope is assessed in two ways one 
through Ascendant another through Moon sign. Normally all 
traditional astrology recommends this type of assessment. 

Jeeva and Shareera concept in astrology has many versions. 
One such version is considering Jeeva and Shareera planets for 
each house separately. Here every house is considered as Lagna. 
The sign lord where the House lord is situated is called Jeeva 
planet. The sign lord occupied by the sign lord of Jeeva planet 
will be Shareera planet. 

In the example horoscope Pisces Lagna lord Jupiter is also 
10 th Lord and Jupiter is in 3 rd house that is Taurus. The Lord of 
3 rd house Venus is Jeeva planet for 10 th house. Venus is posited 
in Scorpio and sign lord is Mars. Mars is Shareera lord of 10 th 
house. The. 10* house Jeeva is represented by Venus who is 
lord of 3 rd and 8 th house posited in 9 th .aspecting his own house 
3 rd Shareera Planet Mars is lord of 2 nd and 9 th posited in 8 th and 
he is with Sun the 6 th lord and with Rahu. The Jeeva planet is 
also having an aspect with 10 th Lord who is also Lagna lord. 
The native desired for a Job in a luxurious organization. Mars 
who is Shareera planet first gave him hardworking jobs and its 
exchange with Venus gave him the desired job ultimately. There 
is a harmonious relationship between Venus and Mars being in 
exchange. The effect of 8 th , 3 rd 2 nd and 9 th house is unique 
supporting factors. 9 th house of Mars is 2 nd to 8 th house of Venus. 
3 rd house of Venus is 2 nd house to Mars owned 2 nd house. 
Ironically they are in exchange. 

The concept is extended to Karaka planets of each house. 
For example in the above horoscope the Karaka for father is 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 277 

Sun who is in Venus house. Venus is the Jeeva for Father's 
house. From Venus 9 th house is Cancer is Shareera house whose 
lord is Moon is Shareera planet. ft>r father Venus and Moon are 
Jeeva and Shareera. Father is artistic minded interested in occults 
matters and he retired from commercial oriented private services, 
lost properties and money. Hope we can relates all these because 
with number of planets linking to Moon and Venus in various 
manner. 

We are discussing stellar naadi system and therefore I need 
to focus on Jeeva and Shareera through stellar mansions as 
propounded by the authors. 

Each Bhava has to be considered separately and consider 
its Bhava lord and then apply the following rules. 

Jeeva Planet 

The lord of the Star in which a particular House lord is 
posited is Jeeva Lord for that House. 

If the lord of a house is in his own star then the same lord 
will become the Jeeva Planet. 

If Jeeva Planet is associated with another strong planet 
then that planet, strongest among them will become the Jeeva 
planet. 

Shareera Planet 

The star lord of the Jeeva Planet will become the Shareera 
planet. 

In case where the Jeeva Planet is in its own star, then the 
sign lord where this Jeeva planet is posited will become Shareera 
Planet 

If this Shareera planet is in association with another strong 
planet then, the strongest among them will become Shareera 
planet. 



272 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

(Note: if more than one planet is in the same sign, strongest 
among them and close to the Jeeva or Shareera planet will take 
away the dignities). Dr. N.V.R.A Raja, (Jr.Meena 2) gives 
application of this module in his research work "Stellar effects 
in Astrology, Jeeva and Shareera" 

At this stage, to apply the principle of Jeeva and Shareera 
we take the example horoscope given above: 

In the above example, the lord of 10 th Bhava Jupiter is in 
the Star of Sun. 

Sun is Jeeva planet for 10 th House. 

Sun is in the star of Mars, 

Mars is Shareera Planet. 

With this we can write whole history about 10 th house. The 
Jeeva planet Sun is debilitated and is again associated with 
Shareera planet in 8 th house along with Rahu. Sun represents 
Government, Mars represents uniformed services. The native 
did work for Air force. This combination in 8 th house made the 
native to quit the Air force. There is an exchange of planet Mars 
with Venus, the native gets a Job relating to Vehicles and Finance 
in a foreign company. This is. due to Jeeva planet being with 
foreign planet Rahu. While Shareera planet in exchange gets 
the link of Jupiter through Venus and Jupiter himself is in another 
house of Venus that is Taurus and links to Moo and Mercury in 
Virgo which is 7 th house. He changes his job and goes for higher 
jobs. Because there is friendship between Deha and Shareera 
planet and they are in 8 th house both good and bad results of 
10 th are experienced by native. The exchange also played a big 
part in it. This sort of prediction is the main trick of Naadi system.

This is purely a logical authenticated star division linking to 
Vimshottari Dasha. This time division is an additional component 
which can be tried in horary astrology. The day's Nakshatra lord 
is the ruling Dasha lord. Equating 120 years of life span as 1 
day that is 24 hours, each planet's Dasha duration is derived 
during that day. That is in a day all the planets in Vimshottari 
order will run their Dashas. The authors recommend 
commencing from the Sun rise and taking the Nakshatra 
prevailing at that time and give the full time as shown in the 
table

house. Jupiter also aspect Mercury lord of 9 and 12. Saturn is 
aspecting Mars lord of 2 and 7 in 9. Mars is also aspecting 
Saturn 12 th and 3 rd and 4 th house. All the houses and planets 
are interlinked to establish that the present karma of astrology 
research supported by houses and planets. This is how the 
cosmic plan works and gives confirmations to our actions. 

This particular system can be used for Prashna especially 
relating to metaphysical matters. It can indicate whether a 
thought process of karma will lead to papa or punya. 

For precision it is advisable to consider the balance portion 
of the day's star and then compute for the ruling lord of the 
time of epoch. This will be more accurate. The same example is 
worked out as shown below;

This information is useful only in Prashna and can be used 
with other astrological principles for predicting questions. Beyond 
this, its use in the in birth chart analysis is insignificant.

The computation is taken as 1 hour 30 minutes for each 
Guna that will be ruling at a particular time of the day. Basically 
the above system is similar to Hora lord having a span of 1 hour 
where in at the end of 24 hours, the next Hora lord will indicate 
the next day of the week. Here also the next Guna after 
completion of 24 hours is the beginning Guna of the next day. 
At any given point of time these two components either give a 
harmonic or disharmonic Guna for a particular matter in question. 

This will be useful again in the horary astrology especially 
useful in compatibility factors between personal, professional 
and material aspects of life. 

For example to know whether this particular method of 
assessment is in harmony with the authenticated methodology 
of astrology, I take the two components for the present day. 

Today is 29/7/2011 the time is 10:01 am. The day is Friday.

During this question hour both Guna and the ruling planet's 
Guna are Satvik which is indicating the harmony between the 
methods of analysis duly authenticated. 

Yoga karaka for each Lagna: 

Aries SUN (5), MOON (4), JUPITER (9, 12) 

Taurus MERCURY (2, 5) 

Gemini VENUS (5, 12) 

Cancer JUPITER (6, 9)

Pisces MOON (5), JUPITER (1, 10) 

The authors seem to have taken Sun as benefic and Moon 
also as benefic attributing Pakshabala of Moon as its strength. 
Yoga karaka status for Saturn and Mars being natural malefic 
are completely ignored though traditionally they are designated 
with Yoga karaka status for a few ascendant. However one of 
them has included Saturn and Mars when they own two houses 
both from Kendra and Kona. There is also mention of Rahu 
equating with Saturn. (However Ketu is ignored though equated 
with Mars) 

Presumably, to avoid the natural malefic instinct of cruel 
planets, the authors must have advocated only the best yoga 
karakas for each ascendant as they also mention it. 



280 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



{Explanatory Note: The subject dealing with Yoga 
karaka status in Parasara is of high technical nature 
explored in Jaataka Chandrika. The modifications each 
planet undergoes due to their lordships by position and 
association results in not less than five types of dignities. 
These planets will have different capacities to give 
results during their period. Every planet has criteria of 
becoming yoga karaka depending upon the Ascendant 
This entire technology is hidden in explanatory works 
on Jaataka Chandrika, Bhavartha Ratnakara and Phala 
Deepika. These secrets are taught in n Saampradaya 
paddati" through a guru. Anyway though contradicting, 
for the purpose of this work we consider the list provided 
by the author) 

Drekkana 

Parasara, Jaimini, Varahamihira all have introduced the 
divisional charts. Drekkana is a divisional chart wherein the sign 
is divided into 3 portions of 10 degrees each. Each division is 
assigned with the lordship of 1, 5, 9 counted from them. 
Therefore, first division of every sign will have the same sign 
and its lord assigned. 2 nd division belongs to the sign and lord 
of 5 th sign from it. The 3 rd division belongs to 9 th sign and its 
lord counted from it. Each division will have 3 Navamsa that is 
3 Padas of a Nakshatra. Three Drekkana will have total 9 Padas. 
In Each sign one division of Drekkana is called Uttama Drekkana. 
In Uttama Drekkana falls one Pada representing same sign which 
is Vargottama pada. In other words a planet in this pada will 
attain same sign in Lagna and Navamsa and of course the same 
sign of Drekkana. In this Uttama Drekkana division one Pada 
gains the status of Vargottama and the signs representing other 
two Padas will have a Pada of Drekkana in consideration. 
Therefore these two pandas will be called Parivarthana Pada. 
That is exchange of signs by these two Padas with the original 
sign. A planet Uttama Drekkana gives good results and in a 
vargottama pada excellent results. In Parivarthana pada planets 
get exchanged. The results are again based on the house analysis 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2

and stellar positions counting from Lagna. The Drekkana are 
governed by Sages as follows: 

For Movable Signs: Aries, Cancer, Libra & Capricorn - 
Narada, Agastya and Durvasa 

For Fixed Signs: Taurus, Leo, Scorpio & Aquarius -Agastya, 
Durvasa and Narada 

For Dual Signs: Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius & Pisces- Durvasa, 
Narada & Agastya.

Sages have their peculiar qualities which is explicit by their 
activities. Narada is a spirited devotional and dedicated soul 
and he is the best personal relationship manger. Devotion, 
dedication and personal relationship matters can be seen through 
these especially concerning siblings. 

Agastya Muni is also called Kumbha sambhava, meaning 
born out of pot is known for his illustrious knowledge and mental 
capabilities, he is also presumed to have initiated the grammar 
of Tamil language. The extraordinary mental powers of curse or 
care are a unique quality of this Sage. This Drekkana indicates 
the psychological and mental powers. Control of senses being 
the main quality of Sage Durvasa, the the Drekkana is named 
after him. Drekkana is also used to identify the body parts and 
the related diseases affecting the body. 

The author of this section restricts their explanation only to 
Uttama Drekkana, Vargottama and Parivarthana pada. According 
to them a person born in Uttama Drekkana will lead prosperous 
life. They will have artistic bent of mind. 

It is learnt that Satvik Drekkana as it is originally known in 
the astrological fraternity was first brought into light for 
application in prediction with the modified name as Uttama 
Drekkana exploring its use in stellar system of astrology by Sri 
N. V Raghava Chary in his lectures for which he was addressed 
by then astrological circles as Uttama Drekkana Raghava Chary. 
In his later published book he highlights explicit principles on 
Uttama Drekkana. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 285 



In the example horoscope the native was born in Pisces 
Lagna 21:37 which fall in Uttama Drekkana. Though not highly 
qualified the native is leading a prosperous life. 

House division: 

In this system unequal system of house division is not 
prescribed. Only Lagna is computed and sequentially the other 
houses are assigned to signs. 

Influence of stars on Planets 

This is purely based on planets significations and its 
relationship with the other planet representing that star. Here 
the Guna factor of the star lord may have influence in modifying 
the quality of result of the Planet. Basically the qualities of 
Nakshatra may modify the nature of planet in giving the result. 
In stellar astrology the signification of a planet ruling the star is 
merged with the planet under study. The right method in such 
case would be to take the sign lord significations to derive a 
right combination result. It is not possible to link all the sign 
lords into consideration for entire combination and give results, 
only the star planets signification is considered and the scribe 
gives the gist of them while indicating a few results of planetary 
combinations relating to the two planets as per Bhrigu Nandi 
Naadi given in Brackets. 

Sun in the star of Moon: Sun and Moon are both Rajasic 
in nature and both are friends. Due to their same nature there 
will be some excessive proud factors which may belittle the 
good effects. However there will be progress in professional 
and government matters. Moon represents movement and mind 
linking to Atma, native may plan for pilgrims. He may suffer 
from fever and eye trouble. 

(Explanatory notes: The governing signification of 
Sun is evident from its basic signification as atma. Mind 
is the prime signification of Moon. Mind is nothing but 
the reflective factors of sensations through sense organs 



286 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

â iw^m* i â â Â«^ i i Â»"â â â .^â ^â m i n 

rather waves of thoughts. Moon is quick in nature and 
disturbs the reposed status of Sun who is posited in the 
star of Moon. Sun is forced to give the effects of Moon 
attached to his own matters. However the supremacy 
of the Sun prevails and therefore ordinary significations 
of Sun is also experienced by native. In Naadi, Sun and 
Moon combination actually speaks of instability factors 
of father.) 

Moon in the Star of Sun: The position is reversed where 
Moon is under the control of Sun and therefore excellent 
significations of Sun such as Royal favours, parental welfare, 
gains from medical transactions and the holy activities are 
experienced by the native. 

(In Naadi the combination of Moon and Sun speaks 
of governing status of mother and prosperity of father 
in different place is indicated. (However in Naadi Sun 
also represents male progeny and their change of place 
and prosperity are also indicated) 

Sun in the star of Mars: Sun indicates heart and Mars 
indicate blood circulation. Both are fiery planets with different 
Guna one is of Rajasic another is Tamasic. Sun exercises 
governing powers, Mars exerts egoistic powers. These clashes 
of qualities and increased elemental nature affect the brain to 
activate the adrenal glands to produce chemicals which are 
harmful to health. 

The power of Mars is more who is also litigious in nature 
and being the signficators of siblings having prompted by power 
factor of Sun relational disharmony may crop up among siblings. 

The Royal favours may get disturbed due to overpowering 
Mars. Traditionally the solid matters are attributed to Mars; hence 
property matters are also disturbed. 

(According to Naadi Sun and Mars combination gives 
status to brother and tension to father and troubles in 
progress of male child) 



Stefiar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 287 



Mars in the Star of Sun: Mars gets the qualities of Sun, 
All his significations, like daring efforts, Overcoming difficulties, 
Winning spirits, Prosperity to siblings, Grabbing royal favours 
are all indicated. 

(In Naadi the effect of Sun on Mars will be mostly 
on brother of the native who will attain status in the 
society after struggle) 

Sun in the Star of Mercury: Educational and commercial 
inclinations are attributed to native. 

(In Naadi Sun representing father Mercury 
representing intelligence and trade, indicate these 
matter attributed to father. In Naadi the Son is also 
represented by Sun and therefore native's son also 
prospers in similar activities.) 



Mercury in the Star of Sun: Minimal good effects are 
indicated to native in trade, business, and government dealings. 

(In Naadi this combination linked to Jupiter gives 
success in education, Mercury also indicates younger 
siblings, pride and prosperity of younger siblings are 
predicted) 

Sun in the Star of Jupiter: In traditional astrology Jupiter 
being the significator of finance, Children, and a supporting 
factor for relational matters besides being a planet of wisdom. 
All good results are indicated in these matters and Sun being 
indicator of Government, respective support is expected from 
it. 

(In Naadi it indicates the nobility and success factor 
of Father and also the good future for native's son. 
Native himself will have good back ground and inclined 
to gain name and will be spiritual in nature) 

Jupiter in the star of Sun: Constitutes for pride, fame, 
success and celebrations involving relations and friends. Favours 
from the elite and government are also indicated. Sun supports 
good health. (In addition to above results, birth of progeny and 



288 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

success and fame to native and support to son and noble 
background of father is indicated in Naadi) 

Sun in the Star of Venus: Due to enmity factor between 
these two planets, relational disturbances especially among 
opposite sex are attributed. Progressively dissatisfied restricted 
material gains are indicated.

Most of these combinations are based on the significations

attributed with bad results and therefore in majority of the cases 
the bad effects are mostly indicated when the influence of these 
planets is on benefic planets. However along with it the friendship 
and enmity factor are also considered to modify the bad and 
good effects. 

These can only be used as simple guide lines to assess the 
combination of planets and the actual results shall go various 
modifications based on the houses and lordships. 

Retrograde planets 

In Bhrigu Nandi Naadi retrograde planets are supposed to 
give the results of previous sign. However the point at which 
the retrogession commenced will be given prime importance. 
For example if a planet has moved to next sign and then by 
retrogression has reached previous sign, the effect of the sign 
where he entered first will be given importance and those matters 
are considered reversal. If he retrogrades in the same sign not 
reaching previous sign then the matters of previous sign is to 
be brought forward to modify the result of present sign. 



300 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



In this work, the authors suggest that for malefics the sign 
in which the planet is posited is to be considered irrespective of 
his commencement of retrograde sign. For benefics it is 
suggested to take the sign where actually retrograde 
commenced. 

The works of both the authors though differ on negligible 
issues contain same information. The latter has some exclusive 
purport for reading. However certain classical definitions 
regarding Bhava analysis, Yoga karaka and Dasha bhukti analysis 
need to considered and then the principles of Naadi propounded 
by the authors to be taken into consideration. 

Predictive principles: 

1 6, 8, ,12 houses as known in traditional method is 
considered evil. In this method also these houses 
and their lords are evil. 

2 Planets will acquire the Guna of the lord of star 
where the planet is posited. Similarly by conjunction 
and exchange with other planets there will be 
interchanging Guna. 

3 Jeeva and Shareera Planets identified to each Bhava 
may lose their acquired dignity to another strong 
planet conjunct with them. 

4 The Guna is qualitative change in the results and it 
will not block the events. 

5 Planets in the stars of lords of 6, 8, 12 tend to give 
bad results. Such bad results will intensify further if 
the lords of these houses are Tamasic nature which 
causes much agony. 

6 Natural malefic planets especially Saturn and Mars 
will influence the houses and planets they associate 
or aspect with their evil effects. Rahu and Ketu ahe 
also equally malefic. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 301_ 

7 A house will also lose its good effect if it is occupied 
or having aspect or hemmed between malefic 
planets 

8 Results of houses owned occupied by a planet will 
be given by another planet posited in its 3 stars 
anywhere in the horoscope. 

9 Significations by their natural nature, acquired 
(Guna) and the houses signified by lordship and 
occupation of both Planets and its Star planet should 
be in harmony for very good results. 

10 The strength of the planets like Digbala, exaltation, 
placed in own house or friendly house are to be 
considered. 

11 A Bhava karaka planet is to be given equal 
importance as to the Bhava to which he is a Karaka. 
Planets in its star will give the results of Karaka. 
Karaka in a star of planet signifying disharmonic 
house matter will lose its dignity as Karaka. 

12 Conjunction of Karaka planet and the planet 
signifying the house matter of Karaka in a good 
house (that is other than 6, 8, 12) gives good results 

13 Planets in their own stars are power full to give the 
results of the houses owned and occupied by them. 

14 Mutual aspect between two planets in their own 
stars will indicate certain memorable incidents 
either good or bad during their period. In case one 
of them being in other's star. The planet will give 
the results of the star planet with the modified 
effects of houses owned by him. (Example Sun lord 
of 5 posited in 2 nd in the star of Mars who owns 1, 8 
and placed 8, then Sun will give results of 
unfavorable results of 5 th while supporting longevity 
factors.) 



302 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

15 The bhukti of a planet in whose Star the Dasha lord 
is placed will be eventful period. Similarly the bhukti 
lord will give eventful matters during Antara of a 
planet in whose star the Bhukti lord is placed. 

16 The stars of Sun, Mars, and Jupiter extend over two 
signs. Any planet in these stars will have the 
influence both these signs and the relevant houses. 

17 A Planet placed in the star of a planet that is evil by 
its natural signification and also signifies houses of 
evil by ownership and occupation, will cause 
immense trouble during its period. 

18 House spoiled by natural malefic planets will cause 
displeasure when they are signified through planet 
in the star of their lords. This will be evidently 
disgraceful if the planet itself is linked to evil nature 
by houses and also by its natural nature. 

19 A planet in a star of Yoga karaka tends to give the 
effect of Yoga during its period. 

20 The status of yoga results again dependent on 
several harmonic factors to have desired enjoyment 
through yoga. 

These are some of the principles suggested in the system. 
In Astrology rules are for guidelines, the application parts depend 
upon the logic quotient and the interpreting ability. The art of 
prediction lies in explored diverse application of authenticated 
principles restricted to a particular method. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 303 

The entire work is concentrated on 4 main points: 

1 Guna of Planets 

2 Jeeva and Shareera 

3 Uttama Drekkana & Vargottama Pada 

4 Star level significations. 

Uniqueness is of using Guna of planets, Jeeva and Shareera 
and Uttama Drekkana. The 4 th component is stellar based 
prediction was already used by many scholars. There have been 
further works on sub division of stars which were gaining 
popularity. Even today stellar based astrology especially with 
division of stars are progressively under research and modern 
scholars have gone ahead with minutest division of stars and 
tried to perfect the system of astrology to the best of their 
ability. These are partly discussed in some other section in this 
volume. We are trying to understand one of the unique systems 
involving the new components introduced by these two authors. 

Having covered the important components, we shall see 
how these are applicable practically taking the example 
horoscope. 

Though the authors are silent on the part of computation 
of birth chart based on unequal division of houses, the scribe 
feels it is essential to erect a chart with unequal division, in 
order to suit the stellar divisional effects which these authors 
have established. This is scribe's personal opinion and belief. 
Logic behind is when we arrive at cuspal degrees for all the 
houses for a given ascendant, the cusps fall in certain stars 
giving a scope to study the effect of their Drekkana and Amsha 
position. This perhaps may be unpermitted extension with due 
apologies to authors the scribe would like to present while 
highlighting their principles through the Example chart.

Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 307 

The first general analysis based on the cusp position and 
its Drekkana and Amsha representation is given in the table -1. 
With the help of these tables we analyse the example horoscope. 

House: 

Lagna is Pisces and ft is in Uttama Drekkana. According to 
this system, if Lagna is in Uttama Drekkana over all life will be 
prosperous. 

This is true the native at present is well placed both 
professionally and personally. 

Scribes addition: It is in the Amsha of Capricorn 
which is 11 th house to Lagna. Which also speaks of 
profitable tendencies, being in Saturn Amsha progress 
as far as gain matters are concerned delayed. 

The authors did not prescribe to see the other houses due 
to the fact that they have not prescribed unequal division of 
houses. The scribe feels it is logical to have unequal division of 
houses especially when dealing with stellar system. Besides, 
one of the astrological principles is to treat every Bhava as Lagna 
and study its effect. Authenticated by these points the scribe is 
experimenting with the other houses taking the clue from the 
authors. 

2 nd House: 

Aries and it is in Sagittarius Drekkana which is 10 th house 
from Lagna. The money factor is linked to 10 th house that 
indicates the native has to earn money from profession. The 
lord Jupiter being also Lagna lord, it is clear that the native has 
to decide the course of money matter by his own efforts. It is in 
the Navamsa of Scorpio which is 9 th house from Lagna. It also 
supports distant travel and changes in profession. Mars is also 
lord of 2 nd and 9 th 9 th also involves government matters Mars 
relation to uniformed forces. The Native for some time earned 
money being in Air force.

Native did go on short travels; he is enthusiastic does not flee 
away from risk factors. He has a sister; incidentally Capricorn is 
a female sign. It is in the Navamsa of Cancer which is 5 th house 
from Lagna. Being 3 rd to 3 rd and being a female sign it indicates

factors which is yet to be watched 

4 th house:

mantra. His progeny matters again are indicating female gender. 
It is in the Amsha of Scorpio which re-confirms above matters. 

6 th House:

hard worker. He does not have any debts. He purchased a vehicle 
on installments which he cleared fast He even plans to buy

health and maintains it. Amsha is in 5 th house Cancer which is 
actually a house of cure. He takes precaution even to smallest 
discomfort in health caused due to professional stress.

beautiful wife and good marital life. He cooperates with his 
wife. In his foreign journey he gets benefited. It is in the Amsha

of of 5 th house, which indicates promise of female progeny again 
being linked to female signs. 

8 th House: 

Libra is in the Drekkana of Gemini the 4 th house from Lagna 
and it is in the Amsha of 3 rd which is 12 th to 4 th house. Native 
had to lose his mother. Being linked to 3 rd house native longevity 
is good.

foreign firm and had visited many times to US and still he has 
plans for further visits. His wife is also working. Virgo being

is composed and sleeps well. His assets are guarded. He has 
good bed comfort from wife. 

This is an experimented house readings, which fits 
in very well with the native's life. 

Including all above the principles I have tabulated the 
information in a table which will give at a glance the effects of 
all the planets during their Dasha period with regard to the 
effects of Guna, Jeeva and Shareera, and stellar effects along 
with other traditional formulae.

Dasha-I 

Mars: Up to -09-10-1982 

Mars lord of 2 and 9 in 7: It is in the star of Rahu thus 
attains Tamasic Guna to give depressed results as Karaka. Mars 
is in Drekkana of Aquarius which falls in 12 th house from Lagna. 
For 2 nd and 9 th house Jeeva and Shareera are Rahu and Venus. 
Though there is friendship between these two planets, the Guna 
differs. Mars being exchanged gets linked to Venus and Mars 
has to give the results of 3 rd and 8 th house. Rahu which is posited 
in 7 th and the Shareera planet Venus who is lord of 3 and 8 
posited in 8 th house. Mars is conjunct with Rahu and Sun who is 
lord of 6 again posited in 7 th . 7 th is 4 th to 4 th , after birth the 
native was taken care by a maid. She used to carry him to 
other's house while she works for them. He was getting fed by 
the house members where the maid used to work. 12 th house is 
displacement. Later on he was put in baby-sitting center. Thus 
he was deprived of parental care during his child hood. 
Involvement of 3 rd house through aspect- of Karaka Mars to 3 rd 
house and again linking 3 rd house through exchange with Venus 
has resulted in birth of a sister to him during this period. Note 
the involvement of female sign and female planets for birth of 
sister. 

Dasha-II 

Rah: From 1982-10-09 to - 2000-10-09 

8 th house is represented by Rahu being in that sign. By 
Bhava position he is in 7 th . Saturn as Jeeva karaka and Moon as 
Shareera the 8 th house again indicates violence activities. Rahu 
getting the Tamasic nature the results are depressing nature. 

The native had disturbed educational progress, he wandered 
with foul friends. Rahu being conjunct Mars and Sun made him 
to work for military for very short period as Mars aspect his own 
house 2 nd and 11 th house. The effect of 12 th and 8 th house 



312 Roots of Naacfi Astrology; A Comprehensive Study 



worked against this activity and had to return back to study 
further which with great difficulty had to complete his graduation, 
there have been many side tracks in studies, like discontinued 
computer education, failure in other trade matters and smaller 
working experiences. It is because 7 th house happens to be 
10 th house to 10 th house and 7 th house indicates breaks in activity. 

CURRENT MAHA DASHA-3 

Both the houses 1 st and 10 get Rahu and Venus as Jeeva 
and Shareera. Jupiter as a karaka of 10 th house, being in Sun 
Star gets Rajasic Guna; this made him achieve growth in the 
native's activities. Houses 1 and 10 gets Rahu as Jeeva planet 
and Venus as Shareera planet, despite there is Guna of ignorance 
and passion, the friendship factor worked here. Houses 7, 8, 9, 
11 have given him foreign travels. Sun is not only Jeeva planet 
but also placed in Uttama Drekkana definitely helps the native 
for a good life during this period. Sun being lord 6 will cause 
health problems as 1 st lord is linked through Jupiter. 

Bhukti of Jupiter 

Jup: 2000-10-09 To 2002-11-26 

Jupiter is a yoga karaka for Pisces native: 

The effect of Guru Bhukti gave him a standard MNC Job for 
a long standing period and could get a promotion during this 
period. Sun conjunct with Rahu who indicates 4 th house matters. 
Guru by his position placed 12 th to 4 th house by sign. Guru has 
aspect on 3 rd and 8 th lord. Jupiter has aspect on Mercury who is 
lord of 4 th and 7 th . Jupiter also has aspect on Moon who is 
karaka for mother. Jupiter being lord of 10 th house becomes 
Maraka for 4 th house. This factor made him to lose his mother 
during this period. 

Sat: 2002-11-26 To 2005-06-07 

Saturn gets Satvik Guna and therefore, mixed results are 
expected during his period. Saturn indicates houses 11, 12, 5 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 2 313 

by lordship and occupation for this Mercury a Satvik planet 
becomes Jeeva planet that is linked to 4, 7, 7 and 1 st house. 
During this period he visited foreign countries on assignments. 
Tamasic effects of Rahu as Shareera planet resulted in health 
problems. 

Mer: 2005-06-07 To 2007-09-15 

Mercury representing houses 4, 7 and 1 st house and it's 
star lord Mars representing 2, 9, 7 and 3, 11 and Mercury being 
exalted, despite the Tamasic qualities involved, the native got 
married during this period and he had a foreign trip during this 
period. Though auspicious things have taken place during this 
period, there has been the effect of Tamasic quality attained by 
Mercury which resulted tensions in arranging the marriage of 
his sister (star lord representing 3 rd house and its 7 th house 9 th 
house and Mercury being in Amsha of Leo which is 6 th from 
Lagna). Immediately the couple had health problems and could 
not enjoy their honeymoon followed by temporary separation 
due to professional travel of the native. Apparently every event 
was good enough but the effects had their own dissatisfactions 
throughout the period. The effects of bad Guna of planets do 
not block the events but create unpleasantness in experiencing 
those results, 

Ket: 2007-09-15 To 2008-08-21 

Though there was increase in income, there have been 
hard work and ill health problems due to involvement of 6 th 
house, 1 st house. The planet being totally acquiring Tamasic 
nature is the main reason for ill health and distress situation in 

work. 

Ven: 2008-08-21 To 2011-04-19 

Planet Venus getting Mixed tatwa and being in the star of 
Saturn indicating 11 and 12 and 7 th linked to 3 rd and 8 th houses, 
there has no much professional growth and stagnant position 
with mental worries, and it gave change in job which again was 
not satisfactory. 



314 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Sun: 2011-04-19 To 2012-02-06 

Current Bhukti 

Sun being in Uttama Drekkana, in the star of Mars indicating 
2, 11, 3, 9, 7, & 6, turned the situation and the native got new 
employment with higher emoluments. However the Tamasic 
effect of Sun resulted in some health hazards. During this period 
the 3 rd house linking to 7 th house made his wife to resign from 
the job and pursue higher education. 

Moo: 2012-02-06 To 2013-06-07 

Next Bhukti is of Moon who is not only yoga karaka but 
also represents Uttama Drekkana for his signification of houses 
covering 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 5, 11, which includes the signification of 
star lord Mars. The results are evident with regard to progeny 
matters. 

Through this system of analysis we can not only pin down 
timing of event but also assess the quality of results. 

With high regard to both of the great authors, this chapter 
is concluded. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 315 



STELLAR BASED NAADI SYSTEM - METHOD-3 

We have seen that any deviation involving a divisional factor 
in comparison with standard horoscope analysis system is termed 
as Naadi. In the modern scholarly research work many have 
contributed to this stellar theory, C.G.Rajan, R.Gopala Krishna 
Rao, Sri Raghava Chary and last but not the least Late Professor 
K.S.Krishnamurti are some of the names which are commonly 
known in the field of stellar theory. 

Though most of them are stellar based, the system 
introduced by Professor K.S. Krishnamurti gained popularity 
across the world due to its brevity and standardization of 
horoscope analysis and favorite as KP. Despite the fact that is 
there is no system which ultimately yields 100% correct 
predictions, claims are high in KP analysis. Professor had vast 
knowledge of many classical works which he often quoted in 
his lectures recorded and shaped into books. 

Though it is in the format of a modern scholar it is completely 
based on the classical texts and the principles are not deviating 
from the standards prescribed by many outstanding works. We 
have seen in Dhruva Naadi the use of Nakshatra theory. Instead 
of using Nakshatra in deciding Tarabala, in KP Professor KSK 
divides the stellar zones and derives his predictive principles. 

Professor KSK claims his observation of Naadi readers 
prompted him to think the methodology used in the Naadi 
techniques and fill in the missing links. According to him the 
division of zodiac is the main criteria in Naadi technique and 
instead of following the existing method of divisional charts 
and the 150 divisions of Chandra Kala Naadi, he opted to divide 
the zodiac based on Dasha bhukti sequence and use its 
computational formula rightly establishes that he was within 
the ambit of prescribed rules of Sages. 



316 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



In his method he ruled out the traditional attributions of 
natural benefic and malefic qualities to planets and adopted 
functional benefic and malefic natures based on the stellar 
signification of houses by planets instead of planetary functional 
dignities as prescribed in traditional method. Any planet 
irrespective of its natural dignity if it signify 6, 8, 12 houses 
through its stellar disposition it is attributed as malefic planet 
and if it signify other houses it is attributed a benefic dignity. 
Apart from it a planet signifying badhaka house and planet 
signifying death houses 2 and 7 are considered dangerous as 
far as health and longevity are concerned and the house 12 th to 
a house selected for a matter is detrimental to that house. 

A set of houses consisting of more than two houses is 
responsible for a matter. The significators of these houses are 
dignified to give favorable or unfavorable results of that house. 
All the matters are judged by these sets of houses their 
fructification is attributed to significator. Professor then derived 
a formula to qualify the significator to give results during their 
Dasha bhukti periods. There is no specific independent Bhava 
Phala. The analysis of Bhava is through stellar lords. Due to this 
simple approach many fundamentals of classical approach 
became unwarranted. The unequal system of house division 
enables every Bhava to have a star and sub lord. The sub lord 
is pivotal in this system. Similarly all planetary position will 
indicate it's stellar and sub position. Professor KSK opted to the 
simplest format of division of stellar already existing and used it 
for static division of signs in the zodiac. The existing format of 
star division is illustrated below:

This existing star division is familiar to everybody and being 
used in all methods of astrology. The Vimshottari Dasha system 
of Sage Parasara is in the same sequence of Nakshatra shown 
above grouped into three zones by allotting the lordship to these 
Nakshatra exclusively for Vimshottari Dasha. 

The Divisions commences with zonal division of Zodiac. The 
stars of first four signs commencing from Aswini of Aries to 
Aslesha of Cancer having span of 120 degrees are allotted with 
the lordship of Planets and the next zone of 120 degrees 
commencing from Makah in Leo to Jyeshta in Scorpio is again 
allotted with the same planets of first zone and they are again 
repeated to the Last 120 zone commencing from Moola star in 
Sagittarius to Revathi in Pisces. The same is given below: 

Aswini-Makah-Moola Ketu

"(Imp: Do you know that these allotments of lordship are 
again based on astronomical orbital sequence of planets?)" 

The simplest concept is to perceive interchanged places of 
Earth and Sun and then match that visual perception keeping 
earth as center of Galaxy and visualize all other celestial objects 
are orbiting the earth while stars are fixed. If the above order 
of planets is arranged as per perceived concept the visual effect 
would be: 




Sun the king of galaxy goes round the earth is the first 
planet influencing earth on daily basis. Therefore, the first planet 
is taken as Sun, next from right to left upward Moon rotating 
earth and then to the left upward, the Mars in the external side 
of earth. After Mars the reverse influencing force of Rahu a 
creation of Moon's orbit is considered. Jupiter is the next planet 
in that order then planet Saturn is the last planet in the external 
orbital zones and completes the left upward sequence. On right 
upwards the internal zone first planet is Mercury then the again 
on the other side of influential zone of Moon's orbit Ketu is 
considered and lastly the orbit of Venus in the internal zone 
towards right to left upward is considered. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 319 

Not only the order ofDasha but also the entire astrology is 
based on this visual perception of interchanged positions of 
Sun and Earth. 

This system of allotting planets to stars based on 
astronomical orbital order is a grand observational feat used by 
Sages in creating structured astrological foundations with which 
Macro spectrum "Rashi-chakra", "Lagna" and Micro spectrum 
"Shodasha-Amsha" and other sensitive points were created. 

Nonetheless, modern scholar Professor KSK not deviating 
from this grandeur, improvised logical Dasha strategy and 
extended it to create sensitive points in zodiac and cosmically 
prized for this scholarly efforts by his deity Ucchista Ganapathi) 

The 120 degrees zone consisting of nine planets, each planet 
representing a star span of 13' 20" is allotted number of years 
as Dasha period. 

Aswini-Makah-Moola Ketu-13:20:00- 7 years 

Bharani-Pubba-P.Ashada Venus-13:20:00 -20 years

This is unilaterally accepted dictum from Sage Parasara. A 
zone of 120 degrees are divided into 120 years and allotted to 
planets as shown above. 

The advantage of KP is that every house has its cusp falling 
in a star due to fact that this system adopts the western concept 
of house division based on Placidus. This system is widely used 
in modern astrology especially in the western system. In this 



320 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

system, elliptical position is captured for an epoch moment 
trigonometrically, locate the cusp of houses 1, 2, 3, 11 and 12 
and mid haven and degrees are marked. Exactly at 180 degrees 
to these houses the cusps of houses 7, 8, 9, 5, 6 and 4 are 
located. This system of house was introduced by a Professor of 
mathematics named Placidus. 

This adaptation presumably influenced or equated by the 
Indian traditional system with slight modifications propounded 
by a great scholar called Sripathi, His system is known to be the 
best computational encyclopedia for traditional astrology and is 
called Sripathi Paddati. Wanting further precision Professor KSK 
migrated from traditional computation and advocated western 
Placidus system. In this system of houses, a house can spread 
across two houses thus getting two planets ruling one house 
while two houses may get single lordship. One house may get 
single sign qualities or two houses may get one sign qualities. 

Dasha period representing star span in degrees are located 
as static celestial points dividing the orbital path of planets in to 
three zones of 120 degrees span which is taken as maximum 
120 years of human life. This is a logical interpretation of allotting 
a year for a degree. This concept also found in Naadi texts 
while rotating a planet in transit to delineate the effects of the 
planet in each year. First zone comprises of Aries, Taurus, Gemini 
and Cancer covering the first set of nine stars ruled by planets 
as stated above. The second set of stars having same planets 
ruling is covered from Leo to Scorpio. Finally from Sagittarius to 
Pisces the 3 rd set of stars are covered with same ruling planets. 

Any celestial coordinate be it a reference point as static 
zone like house and or dynamic planetary positions for particular 
time of epoch should fall in in any of these three star zones and 
in the star span 13:20:00 degrees ruled by a star planet. 

This is the basic constructive principle of KP. The houses 
computed which fall in a particular star portion is called Cusp. 
The Dynamic planet noted for a particular moment in a star is 
known as significator of that star lord's dignities.

Suppose if Lagna falls in 44 degrees it means that the Lagna 
falls in Taurus sign in the star of Moon. That is ascendant cusp 
is in the star of Moon. This being a static zone for Dasha lord 
Moon, the ascendant has the static effect of Moon by his natural 
quality and also links statically the house owned by Moon that 
is 3 rd house. The quality of the ascendant is now assessed based 
on the sign quality which is Taurus which is fixed sign having 
earth quality and ruled by Venus and duly modified by nature of 
Moon and his 3 rd house signification. This type of house analysis 
is applicable to all the other 11 houses involving the qualities of 
sign lord, modified by the cusp representing the star lord his 
qualities and the houses owned by that lord.

In order to assess the good or bad effect of these houses 
Professor KSK advocates the house compatibility. The 
signification of houses and planets remain the same. However, 
the most creditable research work of KSK is the grouping of 
houses for an event. All the matters of life are grouped in to 
more than two houses signifying the allied relationship with an 
event. 

For this purpose he uses the Dharma Artha, Kama and 
Moksha qualification of houses with modifications to match the 
requirement of the houses. 



322 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Houses 1, 5, 9 are Dharma houses. Professor KSK uses 
these houses in the sense of effortless significations negating 
effortful houses. 

Houses 2, 6, 10 are Artha houses. Professor KSK attributes 
value additions, efforts and professional activities and material 
benefits to these houses. Earlier said Dharma houses falls in 
12 th to these material houses therefore they negate the Artha 
houses of material nature. 

Houses 3, 7, 11 are Kama houses that is, house of 
Agreement, association and desire fulfillments this set is used 
both as negating and supporting matters in relation to houses 
of Dharma and Artha. 

Houses 4, 8, 12 are Moksha houses this has eliminating 
factors to be used both positive effects and negative effects of 
all the above groups. 

Considering the metaphysical and material contents in house 
matter the grouping is expertly done by Professor KSK keeping 
in view the requirement of Modern society. 

Longevity is denoted by three houses 1, 3, 8. Self, 
enthusiasm and daring to overcome adversities denote the 
energy of life. Thus these houses are judged for Longevity 

Education is denoted by 4 th house, higher education by 9 th 
house, 3 rd is inclination of mind and thus these houses coupled 
with desire fulfillment house 11 th are together studied. 

Profession is 10 th house and 2 nd is Money and 6 th is efforts 
and this will give the professional indications coupled with 11 th 
house of fulfillments, this stands best to give professional and 
monetary benefits. 

Marriage is coupled with addition to family 2, 7 th partner, 
11 th is desire fulfillment. These houses are studied for marital 
matters. 

Children are studied again from addition to family, 2, 5 th 
progeny and 11 th fulfillments 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 323 



Assets indicated by 4 th house of comforts, 2 nd is additions, 
11 th is fulfillments. 

He has grouped several houses indicating many matters 
including litigation, partnership, court cases, theft etc. by using 
the respective houses and the related houses supporting the 
significations. 

Any house which is 12 th to a house negates the required 
significations. For example for marital life houses 1, 6, 10 are 
detrimental as they are 12 th to 2, 7, and 11 

This is the basic consideration and houses 6, 8 from a house 
also considered detrimental to a given matter. 

If 7 th cusp falls in a star of a planet who in turn holds the 
lordship of 6 th house indicates negating the marital matters. 

House division and subs: 

At star level a house may indicate generalized matters. A 
house is to be restricted to a particular reference point in order 
to specifically indicate certain matters of house. Professor KSK 
having used stellar Dasha division now maintains the symmetry 
for further division on the same line as bhukti division to Dasha 
and used this excellent tool for division of zodiac into sub divisions 
in order to specify the finer point of a house. Normal computation 
of Dasha sub division into bhukti gives 9x9 =81 subs in in 
zone of 120 degrees amounting to 243 divisions of bhukti for all 
the three zones.

The 22 nd sub sections pertaining to star Krittika, Uttara and 
U.Ashada represented by Rahu spilled over to next signs. 
Similarly the 61 st sub sections represented by Moon pertaining 
to star Punarvasu, Visakha, and RBhadra spilled over to next 
signs. Thus Rahu and Moon each of them get extra 1 sub in the 
subsequent signs in a zone of 120 degrees. In three zones each 
of them 3 subs. Thus extra 6 subs accumulated to original 
divisions 243 bhukti making it 249 subs. 

This divisional concept of Bhukti into 249 sub areas in the 
zodiac is an excellent concept of Professor KSK which he himself 
expresses as an intuitional experiment to match the Naadi 
readings minutely. This will enable a house matter to be precisely 
assessed. Earlier the star planet would either support or negate 
the significations of houses is now being transferred to sub 
level and the star level is restricted to signifying results of the 
house.

With this, the ascendant now has the relationship of 3 rd 
house due to lordship of Moon over the house and which is 
being the star lord of the Ascendant and being in the sub of 
Jupiter it links to houses 8 and 11. The Ascendant is now linked 



326 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

to houses 3, 8, 11. This indicates, the Ascendant is quite strong 
with regard to Longevity matters, and it is also indicating that 
gains by selling of assets or sudden gains through brokerage. It 
also indicates chronic diseases linked with upper respiratory 
problems Moon and Jupiter being Kapha planets it may cause 
him Lungs or Asthma problems, 11 th house also linked through 
Jupiter therefore cure by medication is also indicated. 

In his works while giving the significance of each sub 
Professor KSK, takes the natural signification of planets to 
consider the effect of each sign and sparingly uses the star and 
sub lord house representations. This part of the text is most 
important in KP system which needs an expansion in relation to 
houses represented by star and sub. 

This static analysis of Bhava, changes with the dynamic 
planetary positions. If a planet posited in the star of Moon 
anywhere in the chart will activate the 3 rd house and the first 
house. If it is in the star of Sun or Mars, will not affect the first 
house but instead affect the houses connected with Sun or 
Mars that is 4 th or 7 th and 12 th as the case may be. If it is in the 
Sub of Moon being in either Sun or Mars then the link of Lagna 
is also considered. 

This is the static house analysis and the effect of each house 
explained in detail in the original works of Professor KSK. 

The principle of delineation is framed into set of rules. The 
core concept behind framing such rule is explained here which 
is not found in any other KP works and not even mentioned in 
the original texts of Professor KSK. 

Before that I give the entire 249 subs.

It is evident that all the cusp of 12 houses must fall within 
the star and 249 sub ranges. Similarly the dynamic planetary 
position should also fall in any of the star and sub ranges. 

The house system is based on Placidus and therefore you 
get each house with specific degree minutes and seconds. Since 
the zodiac is divided into three zones of stars ruled by nine 
planets every house must fall in the star represented by a planet. 
The division is sub divided again by nine planets falling in unequal 
division forming 249 sub areas. Therefore, a house must again 
fall in a particular sub. The house is a space division reckoned 
from the birth epoch. This epoch should also have the records 
of dynamic celestial bodies that are nine planets. Striking the 
momentum at that particular time of event, these dynamic 
planets should also fall in a star and sub in the static area of 
zones. Thus all the twelve static houses and nine dynamic planets 
should occupy a star and a sub. The star is a signification factor, 
the planet is a signifying agent and equally the sub also a static 
zonal point equated with dynamic planet and through its star 
establishes the relationship with the significations of either a 
planet or a house. Every star area of the zodiac is a signifying 
zones and sub area is static area equated with a dynamic planet. 

This is the core concept hidden in KP system. This can be 
clearly understood by an illustration.

In the left hand side the star zones are indicated Krittika 
relating to Sun, Rohini for Moon, and Mrigasira for Mars. For 
Taurus Ascendant the Ascendant fall in Rohini star that is Moon 
who is the 3 rd lord and in this example case we are concerned 
with the lord ship of Moon (and we have to take dynamic position 
of Moon in the practical chart and take that house also into 
account). The Ascendant is linked to 3 rd house through its star 
level. Now the ascendant being in 44:00:00 falls in a static sub 
division of Jupiter who is a lord of 8, 11. Ifthereisnostarinthe 
star of Jupiter then Jupiter links houses 8, 11 directly. If there is 
a planet in the star of Jupiter then we have to see the star 
position of Jupiter and find out the lordship and position of this 
star lord as signifying houses of Jupiter and consider its linking 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 335 



factor to ascendant. At the star level signification it is the linking 
of 3 rd house to first house giving a clue about longevity factor 
and in this example case Jupiter as sub lord (considering not 
having any planet in its star) linking 8 th house adds up strength 
to the signifying longevity. The ascendant is strong as far as 
longevity mattes are concerned as there is harmony between 
the signification of sub and the star to that of matter signified 
by ascendant However Professor KSK hints at the star level 
activation for each of the ascendant in a nutshell as given below. 

The set of nine stars spreading over three zones are 
considered for prediction in each of ascendant. 

For ascendants Aswini, Makha, Moola represented by Ketu 
and Ardra, Swati and Satabisa of Rahu have not explained as 
they do not own any houses and they are to be judged based 
on their position in the individual horoscopes. 

For Aries Ascendant Bharani, Pubba, P.Ashada is represented 
by Venus and Venus is the lord of 2 and 7 for Aries, 1 and 6 for 
Taurus, 5 and 12 for Gemini, 4 and 11 for Cancer, 3 and 10 for 
Leo and 2 and 9 for Virgo, 1 and 8 for Libra, 7 and 12 for 
Scorpio, 6 and 11 for Sagittarius, 5 and 10 for Capricorn, 4 and 
9 for Aquarius and 3 and 8 for Pisces ascendant (drifting of 
cusps may alter houses). Venus may also by his position occupy 
certain house. Therefore, during the Dasha and transit periods 
of a planet posited in these three stars or the sub of Venus will 
activate the houses governed by Venus respectively for 12 
Ascendant. 

Krittika, Uttara and U.Ashada are the stars of Sun who holds 
the 5 th lordship to Aries, 4 th to Taurus, 3 rd Gemini, 2 nd to Cancer, 
1 st to Leo, 12 th to Virgo, 11 th to Libra, 10 th to Scorpio, 9 th to 
Sagittarius, 8 th to Capricorn, 7 th to Aquarius, 6 th to Pisces. Sun 
may also represent a house by his occupation to any of the 
ascendant During the period of a planet posited in any of the 
three stars of Sun, houses represented by Sun will be activated. 

Rohini, Hasta and Shravana are the stars of Moon who will 
be 4 th lord for Aries, 3 rd lord to Taurus, 2 nd Lord to Gemini, 1 st to 



336 Roots ofNaadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Cancer, 12 th to Leo, 11 th to Virgo, 10 th Libra, 9 th to Scorpio, 8 th 
to Sagittarius, 7 th to Capricorn, 6 th to Aquarius, 5 th to Pisces and 
he may occupy any one of the houses in the respective 
ascendants. A planet during its period of Dasha and transit being 
in the star of Moon will activate the houses governed by it. 

Mrigasira, Chitta and Dhanishta are the stars of Mars donning 
the lordship of 1 st and 8 th to Aries, 7 th and 12 th to Taurus, 6 th 
and 11 th to Gemini, 5 th and 10 th to Cancer, 4 th and 9 th to Leo, 3 rd 
and 8 th to Virgo, 2 nd and 7 th to Libra, 1 st and 6 th to Scorpio, 5 th 
and 12 th to Sagittarius, 4 th and 11 th to Capricorn, 3 rd and 10 th to 
Aquarius, 2 nd and 9 th lordship to Pisces Ascendants- He may 
also occupy any one of the houses in the respective ascendants. 
Planets in the three stars of Mars, during their Dasha and transit 
activate the houses governed by Mars. 

Punarvasu, Visakha, P.Bhadra are the stars of Jupiter who 
owns 9 th and 12 th lordship to Aries Ascendant, 8 th and 11 th 
lordship to Taurus, 7 th and 10 th to Gemini, 6 th and 9 th to Cancer, 
5 th and 8 th to Leo, 4 th and 7 th to Virgo, 3 rd and 6 th lordship to 
Libra, 2 nd and 5 th lordship to Scorpio, 1 st and 4 th lordship to 
Sagittarius, 3 rd and 12 th Lorship to Capricorn, 2 nd and 11 th to 
Aquarius, 1 st and 10 th lordship to Pisces Ascendant and he may 
occupy any one of these houses in the respective ascendant. 
Any planet posited in the three stars of Jupiter will activate the 
houses governed by Jupiter during the Dasha and transit period 
of the planet posited in the Jupiter star. 

Pusyami, Anurada, U.Bhadra are the stars of Saturn. Saturn 
is the lord of 10 th and 11 th to Aries Ascendant, 9 th and 10 th Lord 
to Taurus Ascendant, 8 th and 9 th Lord to Gemini, 7 th and 8 th 
Lord to Cancer, 6 th and 7 th Lord to Leo, 5 th and 6 th lord to Virgo, 
4 th and 5 th lord to Libra, 3 rd and 4 th lord to Scorpio, 2 nd and 3 rd 
lord to Sagittarius, 1 st and 2 nd lord to Capricorn, 1 st and 12 th lord 
to Aquarius and 11 th and 12 th lord to Pisces Ascendant and he 
may occupy any one of the houses in the respective ascendants. 
A planet in the three stars of Saturn, during its Dasha and transit 
periods will activate the above houses of Saturn. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 337 



Aslesha, Jyeshta, Revathi are ruled by Mercury who is the 
lord of 3 rd and 6 th to Aries Ascendant, 2 nd and 5 th lord to Taurus 
Ascendant, 1 st and 4 th lord to Gemini Ascendant, 3 rd and 12 th 
Lord to Cancer, 2 nd and 11 th Lord to Leo, 1 st and 10 th Lord to 
Virgo, 9 th and 12 th lord to Libra, 8 th and 11 th to Scorpio, 7 th and 
10 th to Sagittarius, 6 th and 9 th to Capricorn, 5 th and 8 th to 
Aquarius, 4 th and 7 th lord to Pisces and Mercury may occupy 
any one of the houses in the 12 ascendants. The houses 
represented by Mercury will be activated by the planets posited 
in any of the three stars of Mercury during their period of Dasha 
and Transit, 

This is the principle which is embedded in the rules of KP in 
arriving at the significators for a given horoscope. 

However in dealing with the 249 subs, we can see the total 
shift in the application by Professor KSK. In his reader III he 
elaborately covers the delineations mostly based on the 
Karakatwa of planets. This is the highlight of his concept intended 
to introduce the Naadi reading principles. This can be verified 
from a few subs explained below: Karakatwa of planets are 
essential part of Naadi exposition which is dealt in the section 
of Brighu Nandi Naadi may kindly be compared while reading 
the below explanations. 

Aries Ascendant:

346 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Selected a few from the work of genius narration as per 
Naadi is given above to establish the fact that Naadi reading by 
Karakatwa is the main key in these 249 sub indications. 

Professor has done a laborious work in drafting these 
significations wherein utmost importance is given to Karakatwa 
of planets at star, sub,, and sign lord including sign significations. 
Professor has simply used them basing these 249 subs 
exclusively treating them as Lagna which will include, Character, 
health and professional mattes which are part and parcel of 
first house matters. (Note livelihood is the signification of first 
house according to classical texts). Professor's work being 
suggestive in nature he kept the option open for application of 
this great principle to other houses falling in the star and sub 
area by which every house will give elaborate details of the 
matter. Apart from this if the relationship of houses signified by 
the star level and sub level as earlier discussed clubbed, the 
matter would be clearer in Bhava Phala prediction. This concept 
of extensive use of Karakatwa at predictive level through 249 
subs relating to house matter is rarely found in the recent 
applications by the KP fraternity. 

It would be voluminous yet worthwhile if these 249 subs 
are elaborated by using Karakatwa, house matters of Sign, Star 
and Sub for each ascendant for 12 houses. The scribe however 
appends tables for 12 houses giving the house matter and 
significations of 9 planets to enable the reader to interlink house 
matter with that of planetary signification. It can further be 
fine-tuned with attaching lordship to planets and sign qualities 
for meaningful predictive matters for all the twelve houses of 
12 Ascendants,

Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 359 



With this information one can arrive at the nearest possible 
predictive matters relating to each house with logical combination 
of sign lord, star lord and sub lord with that of each house and 
taking into account the effect of Karakatwa of each planet for a 
given ascendant. 

Main principles of K P 

In this system importance is given to star level as 
signification factor, therefore the sub area lords are also treated 
as planets ^nd the signification of these sub level planets are 
also to be considered for harmony of the significations. That is 
a planet will be a significator of houses owned by a star lord 
and occupied by him. Let us say Jupiter is in a star whose lord 
is owner of 2, 7 and posited in 5 then Jupiter will be signifier of 
houses 2, 7, and 5. Jupiter is entitled to give the results of these 
houses during his period. This is a confirmed matter. The effective 
results whether it is a good or bad experience will be decided 
by Bhukti lords based on their harmony with the lord giving the 
results during his Dasha. Therefore Jupiter as indicator of houses 
2, 7, 5 must be in a Sub (that is bhukti) area whose lord by his 
star level signification must be in harmony with the houses 
indicated by the Jupiter responsible to give Dasha results. 
Suppose Jupiter falls in the sub area(that is bhukti) of a planet 
who by his star lord indicates houses 1, 6, 8 then the results of 
Jupiter is negated by the sub area(that is bhukti). Therefore 
Jupiter signifying houses 2, 7, 5 is not considered as beneficial 
planet for that matter. 

This has relevance to the traditional concept of harmony 
between Dasha and Bhukti lord by virtue of their functional, 
natural qualities, friendship and enmity qualifications. 

To expand coverage of houses, exemptions are introduced 
in identifying the significators. 

a. If there is no planet in any of the stars of the planet then 
the planet itself will be the significator of the house it owns 
and occupy. This is simple reverting to traditional rule that 



360 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

a planet gives in its Dasha period the houses owned and 
occupied. Interestingly this planet which has no planet in 
its star is considered a very strong significator. 

b. Planets in aspect with the significator will also be eligible to 
give the results of the planet. This also is from the traditional 
concept of aspectual relationship. 

One rule that is popularly advocated in KP is to find the 
fructification of a particular matter. As said earlier every matter 
of life is indicated by more than two houses as group. For 
example whether marriage is promised or not is to be worked 
out by considering the houses 7 th 2 nd and 11 th houses. For this 
concept of sub area is brought into action. Since 7 th house is 
pivotal for marriage the sub area of 7 th cusp is considered. This 
static area represented by the planet as sub lord is dignified as 
a Dynamic planet. If this sub lord is in the star of a planet who 
owns and occupy houses 6, 1 or 10 which are detrimental to 
hquses 7 th , 2, and 11 then marriages will not take place. If that 
planet either by occupation or lordship indicate 2 or 11 any one 
of it then the marriage is promised. Even if the star planet 
indicate any one out of 1, 6, 10, 8, 12 and also indicate either 2 
or 11 then also marriage is promised but it indicates some marital 
problems. 

If you. observe carefully, this rule has been applied in 
assessing individual Bhava and the effects of these Bhava as 
explained earlier. 

If a matter is promised by such positive configuration of 
houses by a sub as planet, then if that planet is a prime 
signficator for marriage matter because he will be definitely 
appearing in the planetary list and being a signficator he wilt 
participate in Dasha also. 

Logically if we observe the effective rules of KP it is based 
on harmonic theory between static zodiac areas and dynamic 
planetary positions in those areas. The static area as a 
component sub is given the dignity of a dynamic planet. Planets 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 361 

then are assessed through their star position to signify the 
houses. These signified houses which are in harmony with the 
static houses grouped for a matter will yield desired good effects 
during the period of significators and those are not in harmony 
will give bad results. 

However, in KP neither the lord of the house nor the planets 
themselves are involved in direct results of any houses. Each 
planet will activate certain houses owned and occupied by the 
lord of star in which it is posited and is called a signifier of those 
houses. 

The primary rules of KP to identify significator for a 
house: 

1. If there are no planet in the stars of occupant then the 
occupant itself become strong significator of that house. 

2. Planets in the star of occupants of a house are (medium) 
strong signficators of that house 

3. Planets as occupants even though there are planets in the 
stars of occupant as 2 nd grade signficators 

4. Lords of the house when there are no planets in their stars 
strong 3 rd grade significators 

5. Planets in the stars of lords of a house as (medium) strong 
3 rd grade signficators 

6. Lords of the houses when there are planets in their stars 
4 th grade signficator 

7. Planets in aspect to these signficator as 5 th grade 
significators 

In other words: 

1. A Planet will signify the houses owned and occupied by its 
star Lord 



362 



Roots ofNaadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



2. If no planet in its stars the planet itself will be significator 
for houses owned and occupied 

3. Planets in aspect to these signficators will also be 
significators. 

This is how the great master links the static space factor 
with Dynamic planets.

This is the beauty of the excellente work of Professor linking 
the dynamic planets in most convincing manner to the space 
factor of their star position and then linking those space factors 
to the cusps either through occupation or lordship. 

This is one part of the predictive technique to find out the 
signficators to houses. Out of these signficators the Dasha lord 
will be identified for an event indicated by houses.

Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



Assessment part: 

Professor introduces a unique two method theory: 

1. To assess whether a house will fructify or not, the cusp 
sub lord is assessed 

2. To assess the strength of signficator the sub lord of the 
planet will be assessed. 

This structured approach is shown below: (Refer, example 
data) 

For example 7 th house matter is to be examined whether 
marriage is promised or not; we shall take the 7 th Cusp.

Sub lord of the 7 th cusp is Sat. Saturn is in the star of Sun. 
7 th Lordship is covered by 6 th house lord Moon who spreads his 
7 th house lordship over Leo. Therefore Sun do not get the 
lordship. Sun is posited in 11 th house. 

According to rule the 7 th cusp lord should indicate any one 
house from the marriage group houses that is 2, 7, and 11. 
Saturn sub lord through its star lord is indicating 11 th house by 
Sun's position. Therefore, marriage is promised. Since the event 
is promised we should now see who will give the marriage 
through significator of 7 th house. 

We apply the signficator rule. 

7 th house has no planet posited. We must find the planet 
posited in the star of 7 th lord. 7 th lord is Moon. There is no 
planet in the star of Moon. Therefore: 

Significator of 7 th house is Moon 

2 nd house: 

2 nd house has two planets posited in it, Mars and Rahu. 
Catch the planets posited in Ketu stars of Mars and Rahu. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 



365 



Planet posited in Mars's star = Jupiter 

Planet posited in Rahu's star = Moon 

2 nd Lord is Jupiter. We have to take the planet posited in 
Jupiter's star. 

Planets in Jupiter's star= No planet in its star. 2 nd lord Jupiter 
itself is significator 

2 nd house signficators are: Jupiter, and Moon . 

11 th house 

Planets in 11 th house- Saturn, Mercury and Sun. catch the 
planets in their stars. 

In the Star of Saturn = Rahu and Venus 

In the Star of Mercury = No planets therefore take Mercury 

In the Star of Sun = Saturn 

Lord of 11 th is Jupiter: in its star: No planet is posited: So 
take Jupiter 

Marriage event signficators: MOO-JUP-RAH-VEN- 
MER-SAT 

These planets are entitled to give Marriage during their 
periods. 

Now the 2 nd module of testing comes in to picture: That is 
strength of these planets. 

Significator if they are in the sub of a planet, who is 
signficator of 1, 6, 10, will be weak significator to be eliminated.

366 Roots of Naadt Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

In this analysis only Jup, Rah, Ven, Mer are indicating 
predominantly 11 th house through star level in positional dignity. 

This period the marriage should take place: 

Identifying significators, qualifying the matter, qualifying 
the signficator are the structured approach in KP introduced by 
Professor KSK. 

Cusp Sub lord: 

The deeper technicalities are also introduced by Professor 
when there is confusion or irrelevant significator are derived for 
an event. 

This theory Professor himself adopts in his work in reader 
III Advanced Stellar Astrology - Practical section while dealing 
with a case study of "overseas" in page 148. 

Quote: 

"4f times when the analysis ofBhava does not point 
out a particular planet as signficator or whenever there 
is some confusion in regard to selection of significators 
for particular point in consideration, the cusps alone 
come to our rescue and solve our problem â Now the 
principle to be commonly applied is very simple. Mark 
where a particular cusp lies, what its constellation is 
and what its sub is. Further mark whether any planet is 
posited in the constellation of the constellation lord of 
the cusp. If so take that planet as significator. If no 
planet is posited in its constellation, consider that very 
planet alone. 

Similarly mark who the sub lord of a particular cusp 
is. Further notice whether any planet is posited in its 
constellation. If so that planet will be a very strong 
signficator, because according to KP it is the sub and 
sub alone which decides a particular matter" 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 



367 



This drives us to two important rules to identify special 
signficators as follows: 

1 A planet in the star of a cusp sub lord will also be a 
significator to the houses represented by this cusp sub lord 

2 A planet in the star of a star lord of cusp will also be a 
significator to the houses represented by this cusp star lord 

Please note the importance given to the cusp sub lord 
prompted by a planet in its star appearing as signficator, by 
none other than Professor himself. 

Quote: "If so that planet will be a very strong 
signficator, because according to KP it is the sub and 
sub alone which decides a particular matter" 

We illustrate the above 1 st principle for the example.

Imp: This is the key factor. How this most important 
factor escaped the attention of intelligent KP scholars 
earlier is a matter of surprise. Of late some intelligent 
KP follower noticed this and elaborated this principle 



368 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



with logical explanation adding a few more useful details 
and published it as an innovative experiment work 
suffixed his name to it as new system. Plagiarized 
versions of this new work was elegantly presented 
reorganizing the contents by others without attributing 
any credentials to its origins. 

Though Professor advocates cusp star also to be 
considered similarly, his emphasis on the cusp sub logically is 
more convincing and in application it repeatedly works. That is 
the reason he declares that even if the signficators fail, these 
planets in the star of cusp sub lords activating the house will 
have more importance. That means this principle will become 
the prime importance which overrides the significator. 

Sub lord of Planet; 

We have seen that Professor includes a module to testify 
the significator that is a Planet through its star lord indicates its 
signification. Then the Sub lord of that planet through its Star 
position will indicate whether the signification will be fruitful or 
not.

Jup Rah Ven Mer through their stars lord of sub lords 

have indicated 11 th house and therefore they were qualified as 
fruitful significators for marriage. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 369 



New concept derived from the above original principle: 

When the planet is qualified through a star position of sub 
lord why that sub lord as planet should not be a signficator? 
This logic drives down that when a sub qualifies the planet of 
its signification, through its lordship and position also through 
its star position this is equated with the planet. 

According to rule planet will be signficator subject to not 
having any planet in its star. If there is a planet in its star, then 
the planet will signify through its star. 

Since sub is equated with planet the sub lord as a planet 
will signify its lordship and occupation if it does not have any 
planet in its star. If there is a planet in its star, then the sub will 
signify through its star. 

This drives down to 4 stages of significations of planets as 
shown below, which is actually the derivative point from the 
work of Professor KSK. 

1 st level significator is Planet itself 

2 nd level significator is Star planet (Planet in the star) 

3 rd level significator is Sub lord as planet (Planet in sub) 

4 th level significator is Star lord of Sub lord (Sub in Star) 

(Qualifier) 

Logically this sounds right, and there is nothing wrong in 
taking sub as signficator because the ultimate decisive power 
lies with the sub. 

This original concept divided into 4 stages is re-introduced 
by modern authors with modified additional presentation 
techniques as new found theory. 

Modern KP system has undergone many changes with 
minutes divisions like sub sub sub levels. There are artistic and 
graphical presentations with excellent narratives about KP on 
the internet. Internet is fully loaded with KP astrologer's sites 



370 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



some of them commercial and some are generous. Some of the 
well-known scholars in south India have mixed up other system 
in KP and written books in vernacular language. Some technical 
youngsters have done wonderful job on KP software and 
generously posted on internet for free download. 

Other points of analysis: 

In this method of finding out signficators for each Bhava, 
at times many planets will emerge as significator for a particular 
Bhava. The strength of each significator is assessed separately 
one based on the natural order of strength of Planets, their sign 
based dignities like debilitation or enemy association, their sub 
level negative significations, their natural signification in relation 
to the Bhava under examination and the sign qualities are all 
considered for assessment. 

With these fundamental let us try to understand its 
application on a practical example horoscope: 

The scribe has introduced table formats to identify 
signficators which will be useful for prediction. In this the above 
said KP original principle and logically acceptable modifications 
are included.

With information from the above chart a table is prepared 
to derive significators and the cusp relationships are shown in 
the table. 

The table has two parts: 

Part I Significators having no planets in their stars 

Part II Significators having planets in their stars 

In both the cases the signification of cusp sub lord position 
are indicated through the star planet where the planet is posited. 

Left hand side is the Secondary Signification and the right 
side is Primary significations.

The reading can be done with the help of the above tables

Dasha Bhukti chart. 

The first house lord is Jupiter and star lord is Mercury 
and sub lord is Sun. It is an indication that this native will have 
his livelihood linked to, education, commercial, finance and luxury 
related and the sub is indicating 2, 9, 7 houses and therefore, 
he may change jobs and it may relate to foreign and medical 
related institutions. It is due to the fact that Ketu is posited in 
1 st being the lord of 2 nd which is a medical planet The presence 
of Ketu signifying the 2 nd house has always created problem in 
getting due financial benefits compared to others in the same 
cadre. Since we are talking of livelihood it is essential to see the 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 375 

10 th house also along with 1 st house. 10 th house lord is again 
Jupiter and it is in the star of Venus and it is in the sub of Mars 
which also indicate technicality and sub lord is in the star of 
Rahu indicating computer and foreign related, vehicle and 
military related matters. This person did job in Air force then 
later on shifted to computer, medical firms lastly settled down 
in a big MNC where in the transactions related to vehicles, finance 
and medical fields. His 2 nd house is ruled by sign lord Mars and 
star lord Venus and sub lord is Mercury, therefore his earning 
will be through commercial and machinery related organizations 
where in finance is the prime factor in his work field due to 
presence of Jupiter in 2 nd house. 

3 rd house lord is Venus, star lord is Moon and sub lord is 
Venus which is also in the star of Saturn. This indicates female 
domination in the siblings. This is a fact that this person is 
having only one sister. Because this feminine domination this 
person approach to life will be very soft and he lacks 
determination in certain area of life. 

4 th house sign lord is Mercury, star lord is Rahu and sub 
lord is Sun who is in the star of Mars. This person had many 
breaks in his education and changed his subject from technical 
to commercial at a later stage. Rahu, Mars and Mercury 
dominating in this house made this person effective in using 
computers in accounting matters. Mercury being lord of the 
house he took up commercial education. 4 th Lord is posited in 
7 th which is indicate business and being with Moon the 5 th lord 
which is 11 th to 7 th house given him an opportunity to do an 
institutional Business management education. 4 th Lord is linked 
with Karaka for mother Moon and 4 th house itself indicates 
mother, his mother was working in educational institution. 
Considering 4 th house as Lagna for mother the involvement of 
Rahu Sun and Mars and their presence in the 4 th house counted 
from 4 th house as Lagna indicate a heart related problem to 
mother. Moreover, Mars is 6 th lord counted from 4 th house and 
Sun is 3 rd lord indicating longevity. The maraka for 4 th house 
are Jupiter as 7 th lord and he is also Badhaka (for Chara Lagna 



376 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

11 th house, for Sthira Lagna 9 th and for Ubhaya Lagna 7 th is 
Badhaka) for Ubhaya Lagna Gemini of mother. Moon as Maraka 
being 2 nd Lord is placed in 4 th house counting from Mother's 
Lagna, 4 th house from mother's Lagna is having aspect of Jupiter 
both as maraka and badhaka. It is also influencing the Lagna 
and 4 th lord placed in 4 th and the Maraka lord Moon. During 
Jupiter Dasha and Jupiter Bhukti his mother expired due to 
heart attack. 

His marriage took place during Jupiter Dasha and Mercury 
Bhukti. 7 th house is ruled by sign lord Mercury, star lord Moon 
and Sub lord Venus. She is highly educated lady and good 
looking. She has cold related problems. Sub is in the star of 
Saturn and she is a working lady. 

Till the writing of this section, the native has no issues 
even after 3 years of Marriage. 5 th house has Saturn and Rahu 
ruling at star and sub levels. 

This way Naadi reading through KP can be more effective 
and merging with Dasha the timing can also be more precise. 

A planet signifying a required house is also in a sub which 
by its star position signifies houses which are harmonious to a 
matter, and then the planet signifying the required house is 
considered as strong. More so if the cusp position of these star 
lords are also harmonious. In the process of deriving signficators, 
number of planets appears to be more or less of same strength 
for a given matter In such cases the eliminating process becomes 
essential to pin point exact result giving planet as signficators 
for a particular matter which has to be identified with period's 
lords. For this purpose KP has a golden principle "Ruling planet". 
The ruling planets are taken at the time of assessment based 
on the following components. 

The star Lord of the Lagna (the star lord where Lagna cusp 
falls) 

The Lagna lord 

The Star lord of Moon 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 377 

The sign lord of Moon 
The Day lord 

(In case in any of the nodes occupy in any of the signs of 
lords said above they should be included) 

From this group, common planets emerging as signficators 
to Bhava is to be considered rests are to be eliminated. Thus 
we may get 3 or 4 planets which are strong contenders to offer 
results during their period. By sequencing them in the order of 
Dasha an event is timed to a greater accuracy. Further fine 
tuning of timing is done by transit theory. The houses owned, 
occupied and the cusps to which a planet ruling as sub lord are 
all activated by a planet transiting in its star is the main principle 
of KP. We know that the filtered signficators of an event are the 
sequential Dasha, Bhukti and Antara lords entitled to give the 
desired results. Therefore these dignified planets in their transit 
should activate the star lords who signify the required houses. 
This process will pin down the timing factor. Scholars 
experimented and claimed to pin point an event to take place 
on a particular day and hour. However we shall broadly accept 
that an event can be narrowed down to closer timing by this 
process. 

Wonderful logic is to relate a group of cusps for a particular 
matter of life and then collective signficators being identified, 
filtered, dignify them with their timing effect and then co-relate 
them with the present transit position in the star lords who 
harmonize the event. 

In this process, KP did include the planetary aspects and 
attributed the secondary signification to planets in aspect with 
signficators. The exaltation, debilitation, negative house 
significations, barren, fruitful, male, female, fiery, earthy, air 
and water elements of signs are all considered in assessing the 
matter. 

Sincere KP followers do adopt a deep analysis method, many 
take to snapshot procedure taking into broad principles that a 
Dasha lord to give results of Houses owned and occupied by

Steifar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 379 

him (if there is no Planet in his star) 

Houses owned and occupied by the planet lord of the star 
where the Dasha lord is posited. 

These results will get modified by the Sub lord who by his 
star signification will either support or negate the houses signified 
by Dasha lord. 

The sub lord himself may participate to support or negate 
the houses signified by Dasha lord 

Let us take the example of Jupiter Dasha, Sun Bhukti, which 
is current in the above example: 

Jupiter is the Dasha Lord and there are no planets in the 
star of Jupiter therefore, the houses signified by Jupiter that is 
as Lord of 1, 10 and his position in 2 nd house and his cusp lord 
ship of 11 th house are ail active during the period of Dasha. In 
fact the native got settled professional life during Jupiter Dasha. 
Since Jupiter is in the sub of Mercury and Mercury has planets 
in its star it gives the effect of its star lord Mars, who indicate 2, 
9, 7 and 10. That is During the Jupiter Dasha the native will 
have change of jobs and also foreign journey This native had 
many official foreign trips and had changes in job. 

In Sun bhukti: There is planet in Sun's star therefore Sun 
will give the result of Mars who is the star lord of Sun. Mars 
owns 2, 9 and posited in 7 and he is the star sub indicating 10 th 
cusp. Sun is in the sub of Moon who has no planets in tis star 
and Moon indicates 5 th and 7 th . The Native during this period 
changed the company and took one month's time to join. This 
one month he had no pay. This is due to the operation of 5 th 
house which is negative house for 6 th house labor. 

The karaka effects of planets that is Jupiter, Sun and Mars 
if taken into consideration we can say that the new job relates 
to a medical firm. Native Sun is debilitated and therefore native 
is not involved directly in medicine but medical related activity. 
If we go deeper into Naadi Jupiter is Jeeva karaka that is life, 
Sun who is with Mars and Rahu in natal chart indicate ill health 



380 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

factors to Jeeva Rahu "indicate number of people therefore more 
Jeeva, Sun is medical planet, Jupiter is finance, Mars is an 
assurance and in natal chart they are in the 8 th sign relating to 
death and insurance. Therefore it indicates Medical insurance 
company. 

This sort of snapshot method though works out well it is 
always recommended to go through the structured principle to 
get hold of the real secret behind the prediction through stellar 
astrology. 

As a matter of fact Professor Krishnamurti did not give any 
scope to include new theory and covered flawlessly almost all 
the point. Despite the fact this system has some defined 
approach yet it is not complete as compared to classical 
approaches. In fact majority of predictive principles from classical 
works if merged with this structured approach it would perhaps 
meets the requirement of entire naadi system. 

Some of them have gone further ahead in analysis by taking 
into account further divisions which will include more number 
of significations. Some scholars go in detail analysis of each 
house separately with their significators and go in for elimination 
of weak significators and then match them to Dasha lord. Some 
use classical approach and then revert to KP analysis and arrive 
at combined formula to give predictions. A few of scholars use 
the stellar position and rest they attribute to classical analysis. 

Though Professor cited on many occasions the effective 
principles of Moon Lagna, in later times quoting a reason of 
twin births which is an epoch of less than 0.2% for birth rates, 
withdrew the use of Moon Lagna. It is better to reconsider this 
and use it in general cases and refrain when such twin birth 
charts are to be analyzed. 

The KSK attributed malefic effects to planets not by their 
natural qualities but due to their functional disharmony in relation 
to their association with houses. However the strength of the 
planets are also based on the natural strength of planets and 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 381 



also their functional dignities coupled with their exaltation, own 
house though there are references to friendship and enmity not 
much importance is attached to it in comparison with their star 
and sub level dignities. Most importance is given to retrograde 
planets as negative significator. This is exactly the Naadi principle 
wherein a retro planet will signify the effects of previous sign. 
This rule is applied with the same concept that 12 th house to 
any house is detrimental to desired matter. 

Some of the fundamentals needs some clarification: 

Whether true or mean nodes 

Due to erratic movement of nodes, there will be change in 
quick succession either retro or direct motion. However, their 
mean motion is always retrograde. There will be a few degree 
differences between true and mean nodes. If this difference is 
ignored the whole analysis will be upset. Apart from this in the 
mean nodes, the effect of direct motion not reflected which is 
similar to that of retrograde effect of planet. The analysis part 
will be misleading particularly, when the nodes shoulder the 
responsibility of offering results. It is absolutely a matter of 
spot decision to cross check the computational part and adhere 
to true nodes especially when Rahu and Ketu becomes the 
absolute signifiers 

The role of retrograde planet 

The role of retrograde planet is still a matter of debate and 
there are diverse opinion heralded by many stalwarts. However, 
Prof. KSK attaches an important factor saying that a planet in 
retrogression will not give the result of its signification. There is 
volume of information hidden behind this statement. It is beyond 
doubt that there is a motion of reversal. This fact made Prof 
KSK to attach reversal result to the planet. If you read between 
the lines, there is a secret lying here. "A retrograde planet does 
not give result, " it means: 



382 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

1 The planet will not give its signified results. 

2 The planet will give results, which are opposite to its 
signification. 

These 2 points have different meaning attached to it. 

In the first case, it will not give any results. In the second 
case, it will give opposite results of its signification. 

If you consider first point, a planet when operative cannot 
be silent without participating in any results. Since it is active in 
its period, it must give some results. 

Then we need to consider the second point. If so, why 
should it oppose the results? Is it because of reverse movement? 
Why should it matter as long as it is moving in the heavens? 
This forces us to accept the view that the planet is influencing 
some other houses due to its reverse motion. One such thought 
provoking theory is promoted by Late Sri M P Shanmugam in 
his Astro-Secrets. 

Quote Extract: W A planet may be owner of one or two houses. 
For example Kumbha Lagna, Jupiter is the rightful owner of 
houses 2 & 11 as such he is a vyayadhipathi to houses 3 and 

12 In the normal course he will give opposite results of 3 

and 12 and when this Jupiter when it is retrograde will not be 
able to give the opposite results and will give results of 3 and 
12/" 

This is other way round, Lord of 2 and 11 will give the 
results of opposite results of 3, 12 in the normal course that is 
he is giving the result of 2 and 11 which is 12 th to 3 rd and 12 th . 
When retrograde he does not give this opposite results and 
gives results of 3 and 12. 

Ironically, there is a shift in lordship itself. Lordships based 
on static chart, and the planetary positions are dynamic. This 
logic would have been convincing if Jupiter were to be in, say in 
11 th house and by retrograde he is deprived of his 11 th position 
and gives results of 10 th which is vyaya to 11 th house thereby 
instead of profit the efforts are increased. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 383 

Surprisingly, there are several reports, by few astrologers 
who have adopted the vyayadhipathi theory and proved that it 
works. However, since in KP least importance is given to lordship 
this rule is of no significance to us. 

We do attach very importance to position of a planet in a 
house. Now if a planet is in a house and it is retrograde in 
classical approach it is considered equaling exaltation. Therefore, 
this planet cannot be ignored. This planet must give some results 
either positive or negative. In Naadi system, retrograde planets 
are empowered to give results of previous sign. This logic is 
convincing because in our experience we have records of 
retrograde planet getting the significations of previous sign and 
the planet posited in it. 

Prof KSK in his introductory lectures relates his stellar 
experiments to Naadi system. Therefore, safely we can rely 
upon the principle of Naadi with regard to retrograde planets. 
we will explain this with an example and then import the rule to 
KP horary system. 

Suppose Jupiter is retrograde in the eighth house. Any planet 
in its star should give eighth house results. However, since Jupiter 
is retro and not concerned with eighth house this planet in the 
star of Jupiter will not give results of 8 th house. If this Jupiter by 
his retro motion reaches 7 th house at any given point of time 
then we can say that this planet in his star will give 7 th house 
results instead of 8 th house results. If the planet is retrograde in 
the same 8 th house and does not cross the limit of 8 th house in 
retro motion, then this planet gives neither 7 th house result nor 
supports 8 th house results. This is as far as planetary position of 
Jupiter is concerned. However, the same planet in Jupiter star 
will be able to activate the cusp sub, star and lordships of Jupiter, 
which are static by nature. For example if Jupiter is sub lord of 
2 and star Lord of 5 and lord of 11 there should be no objection 
to the planet posited in Jupiter star to offer these house results 
as a star signifies This is because the retrograde dignity is a 
dynamic phenomenon and the lordships representation to Jupiter 
â in a house as sub, star and lord of a house is static nature. 



384 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 

Except Sun and Moon, all other five planets will become 
retrograde. 

In fact in the above example horoscope though Jupiter is 
retrograde good results are being experienced by the native. 

Some important matters: 

There is no yoga definitions used in KP and only the benefic 
and malefic effects of results are focused. 

The entire focus is on Dasha effects and it is quite evident 
that only the star and sub levels are taken care. The transit 
results are also based on the star and sub level activation by 
planets transiting in the zodiac divisions prescribed by this 
method. 

This system missed many valuable links in its course of 
scholarly progression and drifted to further divisional approaches 
leading to more confusion. Absolutely it is essential to go in for 
minute divisions provided it does not deviate from the 
authenticated principles. For example if Dasha signifies strong 
trend of evil houses being operated and if there is one house 
amicable to each factor of life through Dasha signification, the 
linked bhukti connecting other positive house may give the 
beneficial results but the trend of the evil houses will definitely 
participate in giving dissatisfaction in the fulfilled matter. Bhukti 
is the deciding factor of the event. In the modern research, the 
scholars advocating the next division that is sub sub lord which 
is actually the 3 rd level of Dasha for short period events like 
interviews, travel, broking business and such shorter interval 
activities. They are right, there are number of issues in the life 
which does not need the sanction of great fortune. Despite a 
negative trend positive efforts can yield results. However, the 
nature of such result and the resultant experience of such short 
term fulfillments can be studied through Sub Sub lord that is 3 rd 
level of time period. Not deviating from the main structure it is 
open to scholars to go in for research in further divisions and 
while doing so the karaka signification of planets need to be 
assessed which gives the whole situation of an event. 



Stellar Based-Naadi System-Method 3 385 



The core concept of the originator of this system introduced 
a structured approach to Naadi method of reading as mentioned 
in earlier paragraph which is based on house star and sub levels 
along with Karakatwa of planets. This concept is fading away in 
modern articles or books on this subject. 

However it cannot be denied that this system has a 
structured approach for horoscope analysis entirely based on 
pure stellar theory and especially it is very much useful in timing 
the event by identifying the Dasha planets. In Dasha system 
Satyacharya uses the Tarabala and Professor KSK uses stellar 
position and its sub position for Dasha analysis. KP astrology is 
condemned by many traditional astrological research scholars 
basing their reasons of authentication of this system by classical 
works though many of their research points on classical works 
have miserably failed in universal application. Right from rishis 
to Acharyas who authored classical astrological works differ in 
many computation and combination aspects of prediction and 
timing in astrology. Due to this there is unlimited scope for 
logical approaches and arguments by scholars. Many of the 
methods introduced by modern scholars do not find place in 
classical texts but in application they stand in maximum cases 
and fail in a few cases. The reverse is also true. Especially in 
modern days intellectual astrological fraternity engaging in group 
discussions on sites have contributed materials which are useful, 
entertaining and at times contradicting stuff based on their point 
of views. It helps some to research further, it hurts biased 
persons, confuses new entrants. Every research is to narrow 
down to reach accuracy level in prediction. Ultimately any new 
system evolved should be logically convincing having its basis 
on authenticated components from classical works. Universally 
it should stand for repeated application. 

Grouping of Houses for analysis of departments of life: 

This is one of the most important contributions of KP which 
is also recently being used in traditional methodology. 
Traditionally a single house was being focused or in yoga two 



386 Roots of Naadi Astrology: A Comprehensive Study 



houses for a particular matter. For instance it was only 7 th house 
which was generally assessed for marriage and 11 th house for 
fulfillment. In KP 2, 7, 11 and 5 th also is being used to assess for 
marriage. But here there is some conflict with the fundamental 
principles, 2 nd house will be 8 th house to 7 th house and the 
relationship between 2 and 11 th will be 4 th and 10 th counted 
from each other. 8 th house is also 2 nd house to 7 th possbily this 
could have been the reason to group 2, 7, 11 for marriage. 
However in the light of classical division of Kama houses 3, 7, 
11 are more convincing to be the right grouping for marriage 
purpose. 3 rd is being house of agreement, 7 th being marital 
matters and 11 th is desire fulfillment and if we consider Bhavath 
Bhava it will be 5 th and 9 th Bhava a progeny progress which is 
the main intention of marriage in Indian culture. In marriage 
ceremony the 3 rd step in the marriage the groom prays to Varuna, 
Brihaspati Indira and Surya to cast off evils and defects of bride 
for a harmonious and long married life with progeny and 
happiness. 3 rd to 5 th is 5 th Bhava which is also signify Veda 
mantra and also progeny factors and 3 rd to 11 th it is Bhagya or 
fortune. Logically it is convincing to group houses 3, 7, 11 for 
marriage and 2 nd house for 2 nd marriage. 

The grouping is based on Dharma Artha Kama Moksha as 
shown below:

Basing on these certain modifications are suggested in 
grouping of houses logically and the table is appended below. 
However the intention is not to contradict scholarly dictums of 
Sri KSK but to append widely experimented modifications to 
benefit further research.

Technically due to stellar divisional computations involved 
in this system and based on the experience narrated by Professor 
himself with regard to Naadi references this system is scarcely 
termed as Naadi system though this type of divisional concepts 
are not found in any of the classical texts. The Dhruva Naadi of 
Satyacharya uses the stellar system within the frame work of 
Tarabala principle and therefore has its creditability as a classical 
work. Planets qualifying through its star position modifying its 
results are also found in some classical texts. 

However using KP system there are books under the heading 
of Naadi astrology which rightly fits the concept. 

The concept here is not only to introduce the system of KP 
and also highlight the Naadi principles hidden in this system. 
Combining some of the classical and Naadi dimensions with KP 
may be very much useful as a comprehensive approach for a 
structured Predictive Naadi Astrology.
