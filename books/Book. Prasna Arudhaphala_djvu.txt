"Cowards die many times before their deaths; 
The valiant never taste of death but once." 

How true these words of Shakespeare in the 
mouth of Julius Caeser were in the case of Revered 
Pandit Brahmasri Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri. Here was a 
valiant man who braved poverty, braved the ridicule of 
the atheists; braved the obstruction of the orthodox, and 
the prejudice against Sanskrit, and with unique and 
single minded devotion rendered a signal service in the 
spread of the supreme Bhaaratiya wisdom. 

Revered Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri, whose 
birth centenary was celebrated in 1978, had a great 
share in the religious and cultural Renaissance since his 
main work was in bringing the valuable treasures 
enbedded in the ancient literature to the attention of the 
general public and making them available in a language 
understood by the layman. It is an evidence of the 
broad culture and a significant sign of the changing 
times that he put before one and all without distinction 
of caste or community of religion, Vedic Madras such as 
the Taitreeya Aaranyakam. He had dedicated his life to 
this noble cause by translating the almost entire religious 
classics into Tamil and publishing more than 50 books 
along with the original texts in Devanaagari script. 

BIRTH AND EDUCATION: 



Born on 5th October 1878 of the couple Rama 
Sastri and Meenaakshi Ammaal at Kadalangudi Village 



6 ( AACHAARYA KADALANGUDI ) 

near Kumbakonam in Tanjaavur District in Tamil Nadu 
(India), he learnt Kaavyas, Naatakas, Alankaaras, 
Vyaakarana, Vedaanta, Astrology and Mantra Saastras. 
His Guru Bhakti was such that in very publication of his 
he got it printed that the rendering was by 
Mahaamahopaadhyaaya Vedaantakesari Brahmaasri 
Paingaanaadu Ganapati Sastri's disciple Pandit 
Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri. 

ROLE OF EDUCATOR: 

In 1908 he started giving discourses at Tirunelveli 
on Advaita Vedaanta. From 1914 to 1916 he gave 
Vedaanta lessons in Travancore Samasthaanam. During 
the period he specialized in the study of and discussion 
on Bhaagavatam and Hindu Astrology. He was 
honoured by the Mahaaraajah of Travancore. On 25th 
July 1910 he was honoured by the Mahaaraja of 
Mysore. While introducing him to the Mahaaraajah, 
Dewaan V.P. Madhava Row remarked: 

"Though young he is a man of exceptionally 
brilliant parts and wonderful grasp of the principles 
of the Vedaanta. I derived much benefit from his 
discourses. What I consider to be a special merit 
in the young man is his spirit of tolerance." 

The Sankaraachaaryaa of Kaanchipuram and 
Sringari Mutts also had conferred titles on him. 

THE TIMES IN WHICH HE EMERGED: 

As the beginning of the century Hindu orthodoxy 
was, to Shelley's words about Catholicism, "only 



(aachaarya KADALANGUD1 ) 7 

adoration, faith, submission, blind admiration, not a rule 
for moral conduct"; and Hindu Dharma was "a passion, 
a persuasion, an excuse, refuge, never a check 
according to the temper of the mind which it inhabited." 
The stalwards of the Hindu fold were unwilling to deal in 
a sympathetic spirit with the growing desire of those 
educated in English schools and colleges to get at the 
rationable of Hindu custom and usages; and in fact, they 
refused to encourage any such quest. 

These led to the depforable result of alienating the 
English-educated Hindu altogether from that interest in 
ancient Indian knowledge which one would gladly have 
seen in their mental equipment and from the observance 
of those rites and ceremonials which from the 
indispensable discipline making for purity of thought and 
body, necessary for any spiritual development. Their 
example easily began to spread this lack of interest 
even among non-English educated men; for the former 
were taken to be the repositories of modern wisdom 
whom it would be unfashionable not to follow. But, 
fortunately, the tide has turned. 

National leaders like Swami Vivekananda, Tilak, 
Aurobindo and Mahatma Gandhi highlighted the salient 
points of India's hoary civilization and glorious culture 
inspired by the spiritual insight of her sages, and showed 
how a departure from which had resulted in her slavery 
to foreign domination. At such a time emerged on the 
scene the great Kadalangudi.

JOURNALIST PAR EXCELLENCE: 

Pandit Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri settled down in 
Madras on 27th November 1917. Without much capital 
on hand he set up his own press and launched his 
monthly journal AARYAMATA SAMVARDHANEE, which 
met a long-felt need of the public. He popularized 
through his journal the rare ancient religious classics 
through the medium of reliable Tamil translation and 
propagated a knowledge of the significance of Hindu 
rituals, method of worship etc. 

GRAND PUBLICATIONS: 

The period 1923 to 1928 saw the publication of 9 
Vedic books. 6 Upanishads. 4 Vols of Brahmasuutra 
Sankara Bhaashyam, 7 Vols, of Srimad Bhaagavatam, 
12 Astrology books and more than 12 Stotra books. 
Each book carried a scholarly perface as lengthy as 
Bernard Shaw's detailed contents and an Index of Slokas 
to be of help to the users of the book; the Rt. Hon'ble 
Srinivasa Sastri echoed the thought of the otehr readers 
when he said Kadalangudi's footnotes were imaginative 
and considerate of the reader's difficulty. 

The value of each book was enhanced by the 
author's collateral references which bring together all 
the learning on the subject and critical commentary 
at once admirable and most helpful. In the astrology 
books judgement based on the author's experience is 
also given wherever there are conflicting schools of 
thought. The meaning of the text is clearly and 



( AACHAARYA KADALANGUpP) 9 

succinctly explained; the exposition is complete and 
authoritative. 

No wonder his books are used for research 
guidance. His astrology books continue to be used as 
basic reference books by Tamil-knowing people all over 
the world. 

THE GREATNESS OF KADALANGUDl's 
TRANSLATION 

Only those who are engaged in translation work 
can realize how arduous the work is; while the difficulty 
of communicating the ideas in one language through the 
medium of another is always difficult, it is still more 
difficult to translate a valuable abstruse work from 
Sanskrit into Tamil. Thiru Vi. Ka. opines thus:- 

"Many will flinch from even undertaking the 
translation of such abstract and scholarly treatises. But 
this is what the learned Kadalangudi Sastriji has dared 
to do in a spirit of dedication and service, regardless of 
praise or blame. And it is wonderful how well he has 
done this superhuman task. Our mind does not permit 
us to state that Aachaarya Kadalangudi Natesa Sastriji is 
working at the translation purely from the standpoint of 
learning. But we can confidently affirm that he is 
labouring also from the standpoint of love that 
transcends all knowledge." 

This swelling flood of translation flows from a 
source full of knowledge and love an it is the bounden 
duty of every Tamilian to drink it... South India was all 



10 f AACHAARYA KADALANGUDI) 

the poorer for want df accurate translation of the great 
classics. But this want has now been supplied and the 
ideas in the classics, made accessible to the Tamil 
public by the Tamil translation so nobly undertaken by 
Aachaarya Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri, that veteran 
scholar. We in the South owe him a deep dept of 
gratitude for this labour of love." 

What is not widely known is that he was a great 
poet; he had left behind him a large number of Sanskrit 
verses which constituted his diary. 

Around 1940 Kulapati K,M. Munshi invited him to 
become Principal of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Sanskrit 
College in Bombay, Kadalangudi declined it with thanks 
since he wanted to be self-employed and enjoy the 
accruing freedom to pursue his studies, 

RAJAJI's TRIBUTE: 



While speaking at Kadalangudi's 'Sataabhishekam' 
function (completion of 81 years 4 months of age 
equivalent to iOO lunar years) at Siva-Vishnu Temple in 
Madras on October 11, 1958 Rajaji (who was of the 
same age) expressed as follows: 

"The public need not bother to arrange another 
grand celebration of my 'Sataabhishekam'. I deem 
it to have been celebrated along with this function 
in honour of the veteran scholar Revered Pandit 
Kadalangudi Natesa Sastri." 

Such was the mutual admiration and affection 
between the two intellectual grants. 



(Dr. K.N.S. ) 11 

HIS END 

The Revered Pandit who laid the Indian public 
under deep obligation to him by publishing and 
propagating ancient works and making the most valuable 
contribution to the study of Advaita Vedaanta, Srimad 
Bhaagavatam, and Hindu Astrology attained immortality 
at the holiest of holy moments: at 11-30 p.m. on 
Mahaasivaraatri in 1961 (on Feb 14, 1961 at the 
Lingaavirbhava Lagna). 

HIS MISSION 

Both in the several books and in his numerous 
lectures he had stood for the consolidation based on the 
vedas of the Hindu Dharma by ensuring social unity 
along with individual purity. He had been and continues 
to be a source of inspiration to many of his disciples 
who have profited by learning the gems hidden in the 
ancient classics, both philosophical and didactic, and 
which have a direct bearing on the practical conduct of 
everyday. 

Dr. K.N. Saraswathy his Daughter and Disciple 

He had no sons and therefore he chose to give 
intensive training in the practice of Astrology to his 
youngest daughter K.N. Saraswathy, and training in 
exposition of epics and Naaraayaneeyam to his eldest 
son-in-law Anantaraama Deekshitar. 

The great Pandit had no patience or time to lose 
with indifferent disciples or those without Intuition, as far 
as astrology was concerned. Astrological study required 



12 ( NOTE ON THE PUBLISHER ) 

more intense concentration, capacity for application and 
intuition. So the only desciple who completed the course 
and internship in astrology under Kadalangudi was K.N. 
Saraswathy. Even after the course he was happy to 
have her as apprentice and collaborator in republishing 
the astrology books. 

Q NOTE ON THE PUBLISHER) 

We are highly appreciative of the expeditious and 
efficient service done by the enthusiastic publisher Mr. 
M.A. Jaishankar. He is grandson of Rev. Pt. Kadalangudi 
Natesa Sastri. He is an Economics graduate with a

PREFACE 



The Science of Astrology is usually divided into three 
categories: calculation, horoscopy and inquiry. Determining 
the rising star at the time of birth and preparing the horoscope 
of the native and on this basis predicting the good and the 
bad effects that may ensue in the course of his life is called 
the art of horoscopy. But the Science of Inquiry (or 'PRASNA') 
is a more intriguing one. 

A man loses his property all of a sudden; how does it 
happen? can he ever recover it? A person hides an object in 
his hand and inquires the astrologist whether he can declare 
what it is. Or he thinks of some object or idea; can the 
astrologist predict its nature, quantity and characteristics? 
That science which solves these enigmas is named Prasna. 
The means by which one is able to determine exactly the 
various configurations of the planets at one particular moment, 
whether in the present, past or future is called the science of 
calculation. All these three aspects of the science of astrology 
had to be mastered, if one is to make predictions correctly. 

Having brought out publications on the science of 
horoscopy by translating ancient classical Sanskrit books on 
the subject, we now undertake the work of transcreating another 
classic entitled Pragnaana Deepikaa which deals with 
predictions in relation to questions asked now. We have 
supplemented this work by quoting from a Tamil classic on 
the subject under the title JINENDRA MAALAI at appropriate 
places.

PRASNA AAROODHAPHALA 

or 

PROBLEM-SOLVING ASTROLOGY 

Chapter I 
INTRODUCTION 

The first few verses of Prasnaaroodha Phala 
(Pragnaana Deepikaa) are an invocation to the deities: 



18 fPrasnaaroodhaphala J 

It is essential to pray to the white-robed, the Moon- 
coloured, tusk-bearing God GaNapati who can clear all 
obstacles in the way. 

I bow to the elephant-faced God GaNapati, beloved 
son of Lord Siva who carries the river Gangaa in his locks 
and the crescent (the Moon) on his head. This God will 
confer the gift of the fruits of all knowledge to the devotee. 2 

I begin to narrate the Science of prediction entitled 
Gnaana Deepikaa which, like a mirror, reflects the truth 
and a knowledge of which is beneficial to the world. 3 

This science has a direct bearing on the following five 
categories, namely, the past, the present, the future, the 



( In troduction \ 



19 



aspects of good and bad planets, and the relative strengths 
of the four Kendras. 4 

It talks of the divisions of 'AarooDha 5 and 'Chhatra' 
the relative strengths of the ascendants, the aspects of the 
signs, the three genders masculine, feminine and neuter and 
also of ancestry and colour. 

Note; Just as planets have aspects, in this science of 
prediction, even signs aspect one another: 5 

A wise man therefore has to take into consideration all 
these indications and to investigate the forms of beasts and 
men, the degrees of planets and their distances, etc. before 
giving the prediction. 6

The science of PraSna (Inquiry,) as narrated in 
GNAANA PRADEEP1KAA considers the peculiarities 
attributed to every Zodiacal sign, whether moveable, fixed 
or common and also the time of enquiry, whether day, night 
or twilight, and (he place and other characteristics. It is able 
to give answers to the following issues, namely, loss of 
articles, hidden things, the idea or object one is thinking 
about, profit or loss, diseases, death, food, dreams, omens, 
past events, weapons, the arrival of armies, flow of rivers, 
rain, commodity prices, state of ships etc. etc. (7 to 10)

and the Sun the crow. 

Note: In another textbook entitled PRASNA

Sun is flag, Mars smoke, Jupiter lion, Mercury dog, Venus 
bull, Saturn donkey, the Moon elephant, and Rahu crow. 40

In this science of Prasna aaroodha Chhatram is defined 
as follows: one has to learn the sign of the Zodiac where the 
enquirer stands, belongs to the Gemini path (see verse 35), 
It is the 6th sign from Capricorn. And if at the time of 
enquiry the ascendant sign is Aries, the Chhatra Raasi is the 
6th sign from Aries, that is Virgo. 4 1

Some others express the view that the time of day,

where the Sun is posited. Others say that movable signs 
mean night; fixed signs, day; and the common sign twilight. 

82-83

The planets in exaltation have the following 
measurements in terms of minutes : 

Saturn 24 minutes; the Sun 12 minutes; Mercury 10 
seconds; Venus 2V 2 seconds; Jupiter 5 seconds; Mars 1 l A 
seconds and the Moon V4 second. 85 

If the planet is in its own house, it means day; in a 
friend's house, 1 month; and in an enemy's house or in 
debilitation, a longer duration. 86 

The 24 hours of the day are divided into 8 Yaamas, 
each Yaama being therefore 3 hours. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, 
Mercury, Venus, Saturn, the Moon and Rahu are transiting 
in the eight directions in this regular order. When the Sun 
has risen in the East, Mars will be in south-east; Jupiter in 
the south, Mercury in south-west, Venus in the west, Saturn 
in north-west, the Moon in the north, and Rahu in the north-

east. In the second Yaama (i.e. 9 a.m. to 12 noon) the Sun 
would have moved to south-east, and likewise all other 
planets would have moved regularly till we find Rahu in 
direct east The directions of the planets will likewise change 
in the 3rd,4th,5th, 6th,7th and 8th Yaamas. The movements 
of the planets in terms of the signs too can be determined 
thus. Each sign is divided into 4 paadas, and the 1 2 signs 
have 48 paadas. In each Yaama every planet has 6 paadas 
to move, ie. in the first Yaama (6 to 9 a.m.) the Sun will 
be in movement in 4 paadas of Aries and 2 paadas of 
Taurus; while Mars will be in 2 paadas of Taurus and 
4 paadas of Gemini and so on for other planets. 87 

From east to north-east are the planets posited from 
the 1st Yaama to the 8th Yaama of the day. The lord of the 
day is the Sun for Sunday, the Moon for Monday, Mars for 
Tuesday etc. In the first Yaama is the lord of the day in the 
east and he passes on to the south-east in the second Yaama 
and so on. At the time of enquiry one has to find out in 
what direction the lord of the day is situated. In the next 
direction would be the lord of the next day and to the next 
is the lord of the succeeding day. That is, if in the first 
Yaama on Sunday the Sun is in the east, the next is the 
Moon in south-east, Mars in the south, Mercury in the

The lords of the weekdays are stated by some to be 
respectively the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
Venus and Saturn. But others affirm (as stated in verse 87) 
they are successively: the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, 
Venus, Saturn, the Moon and Rahu. These planets are serving 
as base to determine past events, current events and future 
events. 

On the day of PRASNA (i.e. enquiry or a question,) 
one has to count the number of signs the Moon is from the 
ascendant sign at the time of enquiry, and it is stated by 
some that it will take as many days for the fruition of their 
desires. Others are of the opinion that the number of signs 
the Navaamsa of the Moon is from the lord of the Navaamsa 
of the ascendant sign at the time of enquiry denotes the 
number of days taken for the fulfilment of their desires. 89

From sunrise to sunset the first hour is called Arka 
Lagna; the second hour is Kaala Lagna and so on; 
alternately, the day is divided into these two Lagnas. And 
these Lagnas have to be posited in the east, south-east, 
south etc. in regular order. From this one can determine at 
the time of enquiiy-which direction it implies either as Arka 
or Kaala Lagna. This direction is to be taken as the Aaroodha 
direction and the lord of the planet there at the time can also 
be determined (according to either the 87th or 89th verse). 

90 

Take for example, the enquiry made at LI. 35 a.m. 
which means that it falls in the Kaala Lagna in the north- 
west direction: Then we have to take this as Aaroodha 
Lagna in the north-west direction. According to the 89th 
verse, the lord of Aaroodha is Venus. One has to find out 
where Venus is posited at the time of enquiry, and the loss 
of property is to be decided in terms of that direction. 91

Here is given some calculation which the student has to 
learn from his teacher. Having found the PRASNA Lagna. 
The Sphuta is to be calculated, and from this figure the 
Sun's Sphuta is to besubtracted. The remainder has to be 
converted into minutes, and the answer written in two places. 
From one figure 159 is to be subtracted. This answer is to 
be divided by three and to the quotient is to be added to 
the number of the week day on which the enquiry is made; 
and the whole is to be divided by 7. The remainder gives 
the number of the planet counted from the Sun onwards 
which is the lord of the Kaala Hora. 

Take for example: The remainder from Prasna Lagna 
Sphuta after subtracting the Sun's Sphuta is 160 minutes 
and the day when the enquiry is made is Wednesday. After 
subtracting 150 from 160, the remainder is 10. If this 10 
is again subtracted from 160 the remainder is 150. Dividing 
it by 3 we get the quotient 50. If this is added to 4, the 
number of Wednesday from Sunday, 54 is the answer. 
Dividing it by 7, we get the remainder 5 - which number 
gives Thursday from Sunday. Hence Jupiter is the lord of 
the Kaala Hora. < 92

If an exaltated sign is rising in the horizon and the Sun

if the Sun is in Aries (his exalted sign,) and aspects the rising

Sun is in his own house and aspects the rising sign, the 
person will be commander-in-chief; if the Sun is in friend's 
house and aspects the rising sign, the person will be one 
attached to the king; if the Sun is in neutral house and 
aspects the rising sign, the person will be a warrior. But if 
the rising sign is in any house other than Aries and is aspected

an ascetic. 129 

If the rising male Raasi is aspected by Venus, the person 
will be of lower class; and in the rising male Raasi aspected

a carpenter, a washerman, or a sculptor. 132 

If aspected by Venus, the person may be a seller of 
snuff or pearl-diver. The caste of the person is to be 
determined by judging the signs and the occupants of the 
signs. From the strength of the different planets, the finding 
of lost articles is to be determined. 1 33

if along with Saturn the Sun is also in Aquarius; the thought 
is about a mad elephant, if Rahu is in Aquarius, it is a

If in Aquarius are posited Venus, the Sun and the Moon, 
the idea is a cow; if Jupiter and the Sun aspect Aquarius, 
it is a pregnant cow; if aspected by Saturn, it is a barren

If Jupiter, Venus and the Sun are in Aries, the idea is

Along with these, the astrologist has to take into 
consideration these five categories of a planet's friend, 
exaltation, own house, neutral and enemy; he has to give 
predictions in accordance with what is stated in verses 127 
and 128. 145

If the Dhaatu Raasis (Aries, Cancer, Libra and 
Capricorn) are aspected by Dhaatu planets (Mars, the Moon 
and Saturn) or become Chhatra Raasis, the thought is stated 
to be about Dhaatus. The same is the case with Moola 
Raasis and Jeeva Raasis too; i.e. if they are aspected by 
Moola or Jeeva Raasis respectively or become Chhatra 
Raasis. Some pandits affirm that even if Moola planets (the 
Sun and Venus) are in Dhaatu Raasis, they are stated to be 
Jeevas. 146 

If Jeeva Raasis are aspected by Moola, planets or 
associated with them, the thought is only about Moolas, If 
the Moola Raasis are aspected by the Jeeva planets, or 
associated with them, the thought is about Dhaatu products. 

147 



Cjhe Findin g of Lost Articles J 69 

As stated above, if the three kinds of Raasis Dhaatu 
Moola and Jeeva are aspected by or associated with any 
of the three kinds of planets, Dhaatu, Moola or Jeeva, 
prediction about the idea thought about should be made 
after considering the strength of the various planets. If other 
planets aspect the Moon, the size of the planets (as stated 
in verses 68 & 69J is to be considered and their respective 
products predicted. 1 48 

One has to take into consideration the qualities and 
attributes of the rising sign, the Aaroodha Raasi, and the 
sign where the Moon is posited and the nature of the planets 
associated with or aspecting these. Then prediction is to be 
made in respect of the idea thought about in terms of 
Dhaatu, Moola, Jeeva, caste colour etc. described in verses 
97 to 101. 149

The loss of an article, the hidden article in the fist or the 
idea thought about are to be predicted thus; If the planets 
are in quadrants (the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th places) and if the 
planets are in their own houses, or in. friendly signs or in 
exaltation or if they aspect the quadrants (the 1st, 4th, 7th 
and 10th places; the desired result will come into effect. 
From the rising Lagna, all ideas about Dhaatus from 
Aaroodha Lagna and thoughts about Moola and from Chhatra 
Raasi everything about Jeeva can be predicted. By studying 
the quadrants (the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses) the idea 
thought about can be predicted by studying the Panapharas 
(the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 1 1th houses), the article hidden in the 
fist can be stated, by studying the Aapoklimas (the 3rd, 9th, 
6th and 12th places) the loss of an article can be traced 
from these, the success of the venture can be determined. 

From verse 122 to verse 152 the methods of 
determining the loss of property or the idea thought about 
are detailed, and one has to apply them appropriately as the 
occasion demands before prediction. 1 50-1 52

it is indestructible and can be found. 

If the Moon is in the 10th house from the Aaroodha 
Lagna there will be increase of profit; if it is in the 4th 
house, the prediction is as stated earlier, i.e. lost property 
can be recovered but if it is in the 7th house, loss of property 
is to be predicted. 1 53 

If the rising Lagna is either in the 1 2th 5 8th or 6th house

is aspected by Saturn and has relations with Mars, the idea is 
about lost property; if the rising Lagna is only having relation 
with Mars, the idea is about strife or conflict; if it is only 
aspected by Saturn, the idea is about thieves or poisoning. 1 56 

If the rising Lagna is either associated with or aspected 
by the Sun, the idea in the enquirer's mind is about a king 
or god; if aspected by or associated with Jupiter, the idea 
is about noble and good things; and if associated with or

178 

If benefics are in the 5th, 7th or 9th place from 
Aaroodha, Udaya or Chhatra Raasi, the lost property can 
be recovered. By determining the condition of the planets,

of lost property can be predicted. 179

consideration the nature of the planets and of those aspecting 
the Aaroodha, Udaya and Chhatra signs. 1 95 

The number of signs separating the Udaya Raasi from 
the house in which the Moon is situated gives the number 
of days by which success will be effected. If the signs of the

indicates disease, and the 8th sign, death. 209 

^ oqrfWR Ttfi «R^l4 ^$sft: I R?o 1 1 

Whatever planets are in association with or aspecting 
the 6th and 8th signs, predictions regarding diseases and 
death are to be made. Even if malefics or debilitated planets 
or inimical planets are posited in or aspecting the 6th; and 
8th houses, diseases would not be cured, nor death 
prevented. 210

If the Moon or Rahu is in Udaya Lagna or in the 6th 
or 8th house, disease will occur due to poisoning or 
witchcraft but will not be cured. Even if the Moon sign in 
Udaya Lagna is in Prishthodaya Raasi, the illness will not be 
cured. 2J1 

In terms of the bodily organs, Aries is regarded as the 
head, Taurus the face, Gemini the arms, Cancer the hands, 
Leo the chest, Virgo the breasts, Libra the stomach, Scorpio 
the armpits, Sagittarius the arms, Capricorn the genitals, 
Aquarius the thighs, and Pisces the legs. In terms of the 
signs, the affected parts of the body can be predicted. 212

In terms of the planets, the bodily organs are distributed

Mercury the arms, the Moon the chest, the Sun the stomach, 
Jupiter the lower portion below the navel, Saturn the thighs, 
and Ketu the feet. 213 



f On Diseases \ 



93 



If at the time of Prasna any sign is rising in the horizon, 
the lost property will be in the place assigned to that sign. 
Likewise, if raalefics are posited in or aspecting or, if weak 
or inimical planets are in any sign, the corresponding parts 
of the body in terms of the sign and planet will be affected 
by disease, 214 

The time taken for cure of the illness will be in terms 
of the days, months, and years of the planets (given in 
verses 84 and 85) aspecting the Moon which sees the 6th 
house. 2 1 5 

If malefics are posited in the 6th and 8th houses from 
the Udaya Lagna, the disease will not be cured. But if, 
however, benefics are there, the disease will be cured. 216 



94 [Prasnaaroodhaphala j 

But there is one special feature to be noted. The time 
taken for cure of the illness will be the number of days 
taken by the benefics to transit the 6th and 8th houses. 

217 

If at the time of Prasna, malefics are in the 7th or 1 1th 
place from the 6th house (called the house of illness), or if 
the Moon is posited in the 6th or 8th house, death is certain. 

218 

<Iwih ^n wlR*<wl<il ^rct *^ i 

If Mars aspects the house of illness (the 6th place), the 
peison will have headache and fever. If Venus aspects it, he 
will get cholera; it Mercury aspects it, he will get boils in his 
armpits. 219 

If the Sun aspects the house of illness (the 6th), the 
person will suffer from stomach-ache; If Saturn aspects it 
he will have wind-diseases or become lame; If Rahu aspects 
it, he will suffer from poisoning; and if the Moon aspects it,

he will have eye-affliction. If Jupiter aspects it, he will have 
piles; and the effects of Venus will be like that of the Moon, 
say some. 220 

If at the time of Prasna, the Upagraha Indradhanus 
aspects or associates with the Parivesha ("another 
Upagraha), the person will be afflicted by leprosy. If 
Indradhanus associates with or aspects the Dhoomagraha 
(another subplanet), the person will be tormented by ghosts 
and devils. 221 

TOT 'TO^^cf^^ sfes^:^ IIWII 

If Indradhanus is associated with or aspects.any planet, 
the person will suffer from epilepsy; and if the Sun is aspected 
by or associated with Indradhanus, affliction by ghosts is to 
be predicted. If Saturn is afflicted by Indradhanus, either by 
association or aspect, the person will suffer from 
consumption; and Mars is similarly affected, the person will 
suffer from malaria, 222 



96 C Prasnaaroodhaphala J 

If at the time of Prasna, Venus is aspected by the sub- 
planets Indradhanus and Praivesha and not by any benefic, 
there will be no cure of the disease. But if a benefic is in a 
friendly house, own house, or in very high exaltation, the 
disease will be cured very soon. 223 

If at the time of the Prasna, anyone of the following 
nine stars is rising in the horizon - Krittikaa, Rohini, Mrigasira, 
Aardraa, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Aasleshaa, Makha and 
Pubba, the parts of the body afflicted will be respectively 
head, forehead, brow, eye, nose, ear, lower lip, chin, and 
finger. 224 

If the next nine stars are rising, namely, Uttaraa, Hasta, 
Chittaa, Swaatee, Visaakhaa, Anuraadhaa, Jyeshthaa, 
Moolaa and Poorvaashaadhaa, the afflicted parts are 



( On Death ")■ 



97 



respectively, neck, chest, breast, stomach, waist, buttocks, 
genital, the scrotum, and the upper lip. 225

If at the time of Prasna, the final nine stars are rising - 
Uttaraashaadhaa, Sravana, Dhanishtaa, Satabhisha, 
Poorvabhadra, Uttarabhadra, Revatee, Aswinee and 
Bharanee, the affected parts of the body are knee, calf, 
ankle, groin, back of the thighs, heel, and toes. 226 

From the stars, the respective affected parts can be 
predicted as above. Finding the star near the Sun the lost 
article can also be predicted, 227 

If a benefic occupies Trikona, Lagna or the 10th house, 
diseases will not afflict. If the planet is debilitated or inimical, 
disease will afflict. 228

If the Aaroodha or Udaya Lagna synchronizes with the 
Chhatra Raasi, i.e. Scorpio for Scorpio, Leo for Leo, Taurus 
for Taurus, and Aquarius for Aquarius, and hence declared 
to be in exaltation, the person concerned about when the 
enquiry is made will not certainly die. 

Note: In Prasna Saastra, if the same Raasi becomes 
Chhatra Raasi to itself, it is stated to be in exaltation. 230

On Death }■ 



99 



If Libra happens to be Chhatra Raasi for Sagittarius (as 
either Aaroodha or Udaya) it is 'stated to be in debilitation, 
and the person's life will be in danger. One cannot be certain 
of death here, but if, however, Sagittarius happens to be 
Chhatra for Libra, death is certain. Likewise, if Gemini is 
the Chhatra Raasi for Aries, it is debilitated, the person will 
be in danger, but in the reverse case Aries being Chhatra for 
Gemini, death is certain. 23 1 

If Virgo is Chhatra for Cancer, it is in debilitation, and 
hence the person's life is in danger. But if Cancer is Chhatra 
Raasi for Virgo, death is certain. If Pisces is Chhatra for 
Capricorn, it is in debilitation and hence life is endangered; 
but if Capricorn is Chhatra for Pisces, death is certain. The 
debilitated Raasi indicates danger to life and no cure of 
disease. But the Mrityudasaa foretells certain death. 232 

If at the time of Prasna, the Sun is strong, death by fire 
is likely; if Saturn is strong, death by hunger; if the Moon 
is strong, death by water; and if Venus is strong, death by 
freezing. 233 



100 C~PrasnaarQodhaphala J 

And if Mercury is strong at the time of Prasna, death 
will take place by snow and storm; if Mars is strong, deatfi 
by weapons; if Rahu is strong, death by poisoning; and if 
Jupiter is strong, death by some disease in the stomach is 
to be predicted. 234 

By finding the malefics in the 6th, 8th or 7th from the 
Moon at the time of Prasna, the nature of death of the 
diseased person is to be predicted. If, as stated above, the 
Aaroodha Lagna happens to be the house of death and 
from there in the 8th place is the Moon aspected by malefics, 
death to the diceased one is to be told by the wise. ■ 

235 - 236 



[ On Death ^ 



101 



If the Sun is at the third place from the Udaya Lagna, 
or a malefic in the 10th place death in 10 days is likely. If 
Venus or Jupiter is in the 3rd place from Udaya Lagna, 
death to the diceased person in 7 days is to be predicted. 

237 

wifeftw: qiqi^ftiRni^fd: t R^ 1 1 

If malefics are in Udaya Raasi or in the 4th or 8th 
place, death in 8 days is likely. If malefic is in the 2nd place 
from Udaya Lagna death in 1 4 days is likely. 238 

If a malefic is in the 1 0th place, death in 3 days is to 
be predicted. If a malefic is in the 7th place from Udaya 
Lagna, death in 10 days is likely. Along with this, one has 
to reckon the days and months given for various planets 
and give the prediction accordingly. 

Note : Some other text books affirm that if the bouse 
of death is a fixed sign, death will be in the native country; 
if it is a moveable sign, death will be in a foreign country; 
and if it is a common sign, death will be in the neighbouring 
country. 239

ON HEAVENLY ABODE 

If at the time of Prasna, the Udaya Lagna is in exaltation, 
the dead man will attain the heavenly abode. If it is in an 
inimical sign the dead man will be reborn as an animal. If it 
is in debilitation he will go to hell. If it is a friendly house he 
will be reborn in a friend's house. If it is in its own house 
he will be reborn among his family or relatives. 240

the vessels in which the meal was prepared, the articles of 
food like vegetables, pulses, etc., their tastes, the guests 



^ On Food y 



103 



with whom the meal was taken, the plates on which food 
was served, the friends of the host and his enemies too - 
all in detail. 241 

If at the time of Prasna, Aries is rising, the food taken 
is mutton; if Taurus, it is beef; is Gemini, Leo or Sagittarius 
is rising 5 it is fish. 242 

If it is Cancer, Capricorn, Scorpio or Pisces, the food 
eaten is ripe fruit; and if it is Virgo, Libra or Aquarius, the 
meal is good rice. 243 

If at the time of Prasna the Sun is rising, the food has 
salty, hot and bitter taste; if it is Mars rising, the food is 
mixed with honey and black in colour. 244 



104 ^ Prasnaaroodhaphata ^ 

If it is Mercury rising, the food is well-spiced and served 
with pickles, 245 

If it is Jupiter the food is served with ghee and sweets; 
if it is Saturn, the food is rye mixed oil; and if it is either 
Rahu or Ketu, the food is made of some grams. 246 

^^I^Mh41^o4vi|^9#^ %pft: I RYU N 

From Jupiter rising one can predict cutlets (or vada) 
and dhall-mixed rice; from the Moon to be predicted tubers, 
flowers and fish; from Venus rising is to be understood that 
the food consists of sweet, milk-products etc. 247

If an odd sign is rising and aspected by benefics the 
food is tasty and refreshing; and if it is a common sign 
aspected by malefics, the food will be moderate and little. 
But some predict that if a common sign is aspected by a

105 



malefic, the food will be old and rotten and; taken on a 
hungry stomach. * 248 

Non-vegetarian food is predicted by the Sun and Mars 
rising; food with butter, milk, curd and ghee if it is Venus, 
the Moon or Rahu rising. 249

If a malefic is posited in a watery sign and (even if) 
associated with a benefic or aspected by it, articles of food 
fried in oil are to be predicted. A wise man by reckoning the 
nature of signs and planets with regard to food articles 
(mentioned in verses 243 — 247), should predict 
appropriately by noting the rising sign and planet at the time 
of Prasna. All considerations have to be taken into account 
before giving a prediction. 250 - 252

dream of temples and storeyed houses. If the Raasi is Taurus 
but aspected by the Sun, the same kind of dream can be 
predicted. 253 

If at the time of Prasna, Scorpio is rising; with the Sun 
and Mars posited therein, the dream will be full of sadness, 
and he may dream about a dead man too. If Gemini is 
rising, he will dream of brahmins and ascetics teaching

If it is Libra rising, he will see kings, gold and merchants 
in his dream. If it is Scorpio, he will dream of bees and 
beasts. He will see bulls but won't be frightened; he will 
drive them away. 257 

If it is Sagittarius, he will dream of flowers. He will get 
ripe fruits in his dream. If it is Capricorn 'rising, he will see 
rivers and girls in the dream. If it is Aquarius, he will dream

258 

If Venus is in the 4th house from Udaya Raasi, he will 
dream of seeing silver vessels. If the Sun is in the 4th, he 
will dream of dead men and of falling from barren trees. If 
the Moon is in the 4 th, he will dream of swimming in the 
sea; and if it is Rahu, he will dream of wine and poison. 

259 

But there is a special point to be noticed; if Venus is in 
Chhatra, Aaroodha or Udaya Raasi, he will dream of white 
mansions; and if Mercury, he will dream of gods. 260

Chapter XVI 
OMENS 

When giving predictions about travel, one must note 
that if a common sign is rising at the time of Prasna, the 
pilgrim will return home because of bad omens. If a moving 
sign is rising he will not travel due to bad omens. 262 

A*£\<& fe4PHl<WI«>tHKI<WI<W: I 

If the Moon is rising in Udaya Lagna, bad omens by 
owls, partidges and pigeons are predicted 263 

If Jupiter is rising, the pilgrim will see crows and long- 
tailed sparrows. If Saturn is rising, he will see a special type 



110 f Prasnaaroodhaphala ^ 

of bird called 'Kulinga' and if Mercury, he will see a bird 
called Tingala'. If the Sun is on the right side of Udaya 
Raasi, he will see the eagle flying on his right side; and if the 
Sun is on the left side the eagle also will be seen on the left 
side. 264 

If a fixed sign is rising at the time of Prasna, he will see 
definite good omens while starting; if a moving sign, he will 
see birds flying cross-wise; and if a common sign is rising, 
he will see omens on the way. 265 

What omens will be seen when planets are in the Udaya 
Lagna? If it is Rahu in the Udaya Lagna, he will see the 
Iguana; if the Moon, he will see partridges; if it is Mercury, 
he will see a land-rat; if it is Venus, he will see a milkmaid 
bringing curd and if it is Jupiter he will see milk and ghee.

by it, the person will have union with a reckless woman. 300 



122 C Prasnaaroodhaphata J 

If the Moon is associated with Saturn in the ] st, I Oth, 
7th or 5th place, the person will in the night have union with a 
sleeping woman who has a thief's appearance. 30 1 

At the time of Prasna, if the rising sign is an odd one and 
its lord too is in an odd sign the person will have sex relationship 
once. But if the rising sign is an even one and its lord too is in 
an even sign, the enjoyment will be on two occasions. 302 

By determining the strength of the rising planet and 
counting its rays or the rays of the planets aspecting it, the 
number of times of sex relationship is to be predicted. 303 

If the Moon, is associated with Mars or aspected by it, 
sleeping in separate beds by the couple due to quarrel is to be 
predicted. If Venus is associated with Saturn or aspected by 
it, there will be quarrel between the couple. 304 



\0n Love and Conjugal Feticityj 123 

The couple's misunderstanding and strife is predicted also 
when the Moon is associated with or aspected by Venus, in 
any one of the places: the 4th ? 3rd, 5th or 7th from the Udaya 
Lagna. 305 

Tf there is any relationship with a malefic in the 7th or 
1 0th house, the woman's sari would be torn. 306 

If Mercury is in the 3rd house the person will lie down on 
the floor due to quarrel with his wife. If at the time of Prasna 
the Moon is in the Udaya Lagna and Mars in the 2nd house, 
the same condition will prevail in the night asstated above. 

307 

If the Prasna is made at the time of the junction of signs 
or the junction of stars, lying awake without sleep due to fear 



124 C Prasnaaroodhaphala J 

of thieves is to be predicted. If the above is aspected by other 
planets, union with widow is possible. 308 

m ^rrft stRpt wtt: wf% ^tRT i 

If during the junction of sign or star is posited Venus or 
Mercury, at the time of Prasna, union with a prostitute can be 
predicted. . If at Prasna time, malefics are aspecting the Moon, 
wherever it may be situated, prediction can be made that the 
wife is loving another person. But if benefics are aspecting the 
Moon, the wife will be friendly and loving to the husband.

Chapter XIX 
OF CHILDREN 

As women ask about the birth of children to them I shall 
narrate the planetary conditions precedent for them. If Rahu 
is in Udaya Lagna, Aaroodha Lagna, or in the Moon 's Lagna, 
conception will take place. 3 1 1

At the time of Prasna, if Jupiter is in the 5th ? 9th or 7th 
place from Udaya Lagna or the Moon's sign, or if Jupiter 
aspects those houses, conception can be predicted, 3 1 2 

If Jupiter gets the influence of benefics, parturition 
(confinement) of the child will be easy; if Jupiter is in debilitation 
or inimical sign, misfortune (death) to the child is to be 
predicted. 313 



126 C Prasnaaroodhaphala J 

If at the time of Prasna the Upagraha Parivesha is in 
Taurus, the woman will be pregnant. From the planets 
associated with Parivesha, the sex of the child in the embryo 
can be determined. If at the time of Prasna, the Moon in 
whatever sign, is associated with a bcnefic, conception will 
take place. 314 

If in the 3rd, 9th and 5th places respectively Venus, the 
Sun, and the Moon are posited, or if the three planets are 
together in any one of the three places, conception will not 
take place. 315 

Sex Determination : 

I will now describe the means by which the sex of the 
child in the embryo can be determined. 

At the time of Prasna, if the Upagraha Parivesha aspects 
the Lagna there will be abortion. 3 1 6

If the Moon is at an odd sign from the Prasna Lagna, the 
child will be male. But the Moon is at an even sign from the 
Prasna Lagna, the child will be female. From the star and sign 
at the time of Prasna, the sex of the child also can be predicted. 

317 

*TFj: E&wrt^lW^M^k^ ^SFR: II3?^II 

If the Sun or Saturn is in the 3rd, 9th, 10th or 11th place 
from Prasna Lagna, a male child will be born. 3 1 8 

If, at the time of Prasna, all the planets are in an odd sign, 
a male will be bom. If all planets are in a neutral sign, a female 
child will be bom. 319 

The time taken for the Moon to transit from the Aaroodha 
Raasi to its 7th place or the number of stars in the signs from 
Aaroodha to the 7th place will give the number of days by 
which the woman will deliver the child. 320

Chapter XX 
OF MISFORTUNES 

Now I will describe the misfortunes that are likely to 
overtake a child. If the Moon is in the 6th place from Prasna 
Lagna, and if a malefic is posited in the 7th place from the 
Moon both the mother and the child will die. But if a malefic is 
there in the 5th or 6th place from the Moon, only the mother 
will die. 321-322 

At the time of Prasna if the Moon is in the 1 2th place, the 
baby's left eye, and if the Sun is in the 1 2th place, the baby's 
right eye will be blind. 323 



f Misfortunes J 129 

If malefics aspect the Sun, the father's death, and if 
the Sun. and the Moon are associated with or aspecting each 
other, the mother's death is to be predicted. 324 

^ cTCFRft il^Jfci^ftflciRrd: 1 1 W 1 1

If at the time of Prasna Jupiter aspects the Sun and the 
Moon, both the parents will suffer from illness. If Rahu is 
posited in the Lagna and is aspected by Jupiter, the death of 
the baby is to be predicted. If the Sun and the Moon are in 
the I2th place, from the Prasna Lagna, both the eyes of the 
childwillbeblind. 325-326 

^nst ott *fWt *h^hw ^Id^R^ n^ll 

If the Sun and the Moon posited in the 6th or 5th place 
are aspected by malefics, death of the parents is certain. If 
Saturn is in the 6th or 5th place, death of the brother, and if 
Mars is there in either of those places, death of the uncle is to 
beprcdfcted. 327 



130 Q Prasnaaroodhaphala "^ 

If benefics are in the Kendras of Udaya, Aaroodha or 
Chhatra Lagnas or if benefics are in friendly, own or very 
exalted, or exalted Vargas all kinds of disaster or accidents 
will be prevented. 328 

If Jupiter does not aspect the Prasna Lagna or the Moon, 
but only malefics are aspecting; the two Lagnas, the child is 
born to a different father. 329

I am now going to tell you all about the ownership and 
fate of knives. If the Moon is associated with Rahu, the knife 
will break. If planets in debilitated or enemy's signs aspecting 
the Moon, the knife will also break, 330

If at the time of Prasna, the Aaroodha, Udaya and

killed by the same knife; or the knife will be taken away by an 
enemy during a quarrel. But if in the above places benefics 
are posited, all goodwill come of the knife. 332-333 

jreffe*? «^iw *rite*% Mmti^S I 

At the time the knife is shown to the astrologist(this is 
called the Khadga Lagna) if a malefic is posited in the 7th 
place from that Lagna, the knife will be broken at its lower 
portion. If malefics are in the 5th or 9th place, the whole knife 
will be broken at its lower portion. If malefics are in the 1 Oth 
and 4th, places, the middle portion of the knife will be broken. 
If in the 1 1 th or 3rd place, the pointed edge of the knife will 
be broken, 334-335 

If planets in a friendly house aspect the Udaya, Aaroodha 
or ChhatraRaasis, the knife belongs to a friend; if planets in 
their own houses aspect the above Raasis the knife belongs 
to the enquirer himself making the Prasna; if planets in exaltation 



f Knives \

aspect the above Raasis, the knife belongs to one higher than 
himself; if planets in debilitation aspect the Raasis, the knife 
belongs to one higher than himself; and if planets posited in 
inimical houses aspect the above Raasis (Udaya, Aaroodha 
and Chhatra), the knife belongs to his enemy. 336 

^Jki^ui «Mi3<u|(^ft: \\^6\\ 

If forward-looking planets (the Moon and Jupiter,) aspect 
the Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra Raasis, the knife belongs to 
the owner (i.e. the person making the Prasna,). If the obliquely 
looking planet (Mars) aspects the above Raasis, the knife 
belongs to another; and if the downward-looking planets 
(Venus and Mercury) aspect the above Raasis, the knife has 
been obtained after defeating the foe, and the knife has fallen 
down and been picked up by the present owner. By taking 
into consideration the various characteristics of the planets, 
the ownership or misplacement of the knife is to be determined. 

Note: This is explained in verses 40 and 50 earlier.

Chapter XXII 
OF SHADOWS AND SHAFTS 

To answer some queries, the shadow of the person 
making the query is measured; and based, on its length certain 
calculations are made and predictions given. Measure the 
shadow, leaving the foot, by your pace, add 28, multiply by 
12. and divide the sum by 1 6. The prediction is given on the 
basis of the quotient arrived at. This is called the Science of 
Salya. 339 

fialya is of 16 kinds. They are: 

(1) the skull (2) bone (3) brick (4) tile (5) firewood 
(6) god's idol (7) ash (8) corpse (9) charcocal (10) ghost 
(11) wealth (in terms of silver and gold) (12) granite 
(13) toad (1 4) cow's bone ( 1 5) dog's bone, and ( 1 6) ghost. 

340 



f Shadows and Shafts j 135 

Ofthese,if(10)(l])(13) and (14) come' together (i.e. 
grain, toad and cow's bone); it is reckoned as excellent 
(Uttama) since the 'Salya' grain is there. But other 'Salyas' 
are reckoned as bad, malefic. 

An example is given here : The ' Salya' is determined by 
the quotient arrived at after the calculation given inverse 339. 
Let us take the length of the shadow as 1 6 paces. By adding 
28, the sum is 44. Multiplied by 1 2, the product is 528. Divided 
by 16, the quotient is 33, remainder 0. Instead of the 
remainder is taken as 16as there are 16 'Salyas'.The 16th 
4 Salya' is 'ghost* -which is bad or malefic. Let us take another 
example by measuring this shadow; we assume it is 1 3 paces. 
By the above calculation we get the final remainder 12, The 
12th Salya is 'granite' which again is bad, By such calculations, 
if we arrive at the remainders, (10) (1 1) (1 3) or (14) i.e. 'grain', 
wealth, load or cows's bone, they are considered as being 
very good. 341 

s[sf RT^t «WWJpf ^T ^Mlfd *TTOT: IIWII 

What the wise men have stated as * Ahi Chakra" I shall 
describe now. By this means, the student can learn about 
wealth, 'Salya' and 'Suunya' (i.e. Zero). 342

The c Ahi Chakra' is drawn thus by 8 lines vertically and 
5 lines horizontally making 28 houses. 343 

^r ^ fcrefcf raft ^r wi^^i^d^ ll^vvn 

These 28 houses have to be filled with the stars starting 
from Krittikaa. Wherever the Moon is found in these houses, 
it is to be noted there is c Salya\ 344 

Taking the star rising in the horizon at the time of Prasna 
as the first, fill up the 28 houses with stars and counting the 
number up to the star where the Moon is, note the 'Salya' 
indicated by that number. 345 

He, who is anxious to find treasure and is searching, should 
make the 'Ahi Chakra' at that place of his search. 346

Thus is formed the Ahi Chakra. Opposite the stars 
Bharanee and Makha rise two branches and in between is 
the hole opposite Krittikaa. In^he Ahi Chakra the Moon is 
posited in 14 houses and the rest belongs to the Sun. 35 1 



^ Shadows and S hafts j 139 

As indicated in the figure, three stars from Aswinee, 5 
stars from Aardraa, 4 stars from Poorvabhadraa and Revatee 
belong to the Moon i.e. Stars belonging to the Moon axe: 
Aswinee, Bharanee, Krittikaa, Aardraa, Punarvasu, Pushyami, 
Aasleshaa, Makha, Poorvabhadraa, Uttaraashaadhaa, 
Sravana, Dhanishthaa, Revatee and Poorvabhadraa. Stars 
belonging to the Sun are the remaining 1 4; Rohinee, Mrigasiraa 
Pubbaa, Uttara, Hasta, Chitta, Swaatee, Visaskhaa, 
Anuraadhaa, Jyeshthaa, Abhijit, Moolaa, Satabhisha and 
Uttarabhadraa. 352 

Find out the star where the Moon is at the time of Prasna 
and the time already gone in that star in terms of 'NaazhigaT 
(i.e. 24 minutes), multiply it by 25, and divide the product by 
60. Leaving the quotient, the remainder is to be counted from 
the star where the Moon is, and the resulting star is called the 
'dinentai'. 353 



140 Q Prasnaaroodhaphalaj 

Again taking the 'Naazhigai' already gone in that star by 
the Moon, multiply by 60 and divide by 45. The quotient is 
again to be divided by 4. The remainder indicates the direction 
in which the Moon will be station at the time of Prasna, taking 
East as 1 , South as 2, West as 3 and North as 4. 

Example: Let us take the Moon is in Mrigasiraa; it has 
already spent 52 Naazhigais there. Multiplying 52 by 27, the 
product is 1404, which divided by 60 gives the remainder 
24. Counting 24 stars from Mrigasira, we get Aswinee, The 
Aswinee star is called dinendu. Again multiplying 52 (time 
already spent) by 60 and dividing it by 45, we get the remainder 
1 ; it means, the Moon is in the East. Likewise the calculation 
is to be made for the Sun. 354 

^s^^ m\%*i "ftfTOPT ^t tot: i 

Having made the tabular statement as described in the 
above calculation, one has to find whether the Sun and the 
Moon are in their own cubicles or in each other's interchanged 
If both the Sun and the Moon are in the Moon's cubicle, the 
person well get a treasure in that place. If both the Sun and 
the Moon are in the Sun's cubicle, the same Salya will be 
noted. If, however, it is otherwise, it means that there is no 
Salya in that place. 355 



^ Shadows and Shafts ^ 141 

If either the Sun or the Moon is in its own cubicle or both 
in their own cubicles, the Salya regarding treasure is to be 
calculated. If it is otherwise, it means there is no Salya. Even 
if the Moon is in its own house, but aspected by a malefic, the 
person will not get the treasure inspite of the fact of his having 
that desirable* Salya'. 356 

If it is a full Moon, the treasure will have a mudraa, (by 
this term, some infer that the treasure will be a large one), and 
if it is a partial Moon, the treasure will be meagre, jf the 
Moon is aspected by the planet, the native of the treasure will 
be of 9 kinds 357 

^t^Fl R«IH^WIW»<lRilJft& ll^ll 

If the Moon arrived at by calculation, is aspected by the 
Sun, the treasure will be gold. But this Moon is aspected by 
the Moon at the time ofPrasna, the treasure will be silver or 
pearl; if the Moon is aspected by Mars, the treasure will be 
copper; if aspected by Mercury, it will be brass; if by Jupiter, 



142 ^ Prasnaaroodhaphala ^ 

the treasure will be gems; if by Venus, it will be bronze; if by 
Saturn it will be iron; if by Rahu it will be lead; and if by Ketu 
it will be tin. 358 

ft WW n^oii ^f ^fefimfl i 

If the Moon is aspected by two or more planets, the 
treasure also will be of a mixed character. If no planet aspects 
the Moon, the treasure too will be nothing. But if all plane 
aspect the Moon, the treasure will be a very large one. 359 

If the Moon is in beneficial sign, there will be gain of 
treasure. But if it is in a malefic sign, there will be no gain, say 
those experts in this Science of Salya, 360 

If the Moon is in the Sun's house the treasure will be in a 
golden vessel; if the Moon is in its own sign, the vessel will be 
of silver or pearl; if in Mars' house it will be a copper vessel; 
if in Mercury's sign, the vessel will be of bronze; if in Jupiter's 
sign it will be stone vessel ; if in Venus's sign, it will be a mudpot; 
if in Saturn's house it will be an iron vessel 361 



f Shadows and Shafts J 143 

The size of the plot of ground where the treasure is found 
can be determined by the 'amsas' (strength) in the Moon's 
sign or by the strength of rays in the planets in that sign. If the 
Moon is in a debilitated amsa, the treasure will be under water. 

362 

If the Moon is in its own exaltation sign, or in exalted 
amsa the treasure will be found easily in the upper layer. If the 
Moon is in its highest exaltation, the treasure will be in still 
higher layers; and if the Moon is in the junction of the signs, 
the treasure will be inside a wall. 363 

The 1 6 kinds of Salyas are determined according to the 
strength of the cubicle in which the Moon dwells. The 
Shadvargas of the Moon give added strength and the number 
obtained by ordinary reckoning is increased tenfold. 364

The length and breadth of the reckoned place must first 
be determined. By multiplying one by the other and dividing 
the product by 20, the quotient obtained is called Aratni. The 
remainder is to be multiplied by nine and the product is called 
Nirisantaanam. Multiplying this again by nine and dividing it 
by 20, the quotient i s to be left out, and the remainder is to be 
taken as Angula. This is called Ratnipraadesamangulam. This 
is the method by which the exact place of the treasure inside 
the earth in terms of Aratni and Angula is determined.

If malefics are in the Kendras, the ascertained Salya cannot 
be found out. But if benefics are posited in the Kendras, the 
Salya will be found there. But if both benefics and malefics 
are in the Kendras, one can only predict that the Salya is 
there. 373

to Mars, one can find in the earth, only an ant-hill. If Jupiter 
and the Moon are in a Kendra and it happens to be a trough 
of a star belonging to Jupiter one can find in the earth either 
gold or the bones of a cow or man.

Now I will tell you calculations about digging wells. Draw 
five lines across and 8 vertically (as stated in verse 3 46) forming 
38 troughs or cubicles.

The stars have to be filled up taking that particular star at 
the time of Prasna as the first. If it is morning, the cubicles 
have to face East first; if the Prasna is made at noontime, the 
cubicles of the South are to face forward; if the Prasna is 
made in the evening, the cubicles have to face West first; if it 
is made after mid-night 5 the cubicles have to face North first 
as in the following diagrams: 382-386 

If the Prasna is made at noon, leave out two troughs 
(cubicl es) in the south-east and from the third beginning with 
Makha star fill up the rest as in the earlier table. If the Prasna 
is made in the evening, leave out two troughs (cubicles) in the 
south-west and from the third beginning with Anuraadha, fill 
up the rest with stars as in the earlier table. If the Prasna is 
made in the midnight, leave out the first two troughs (cubicles) 
in the north-east and from the third commencing with 
dhanishthaa, fill up the rest with stars as earlier. 387-388

The length of half a day is to be divided among 7 stars 
commencing from Krittikaa and they have to be filled up in 
the cubicles as in Table 1 : e.g., If a day is taken as 29% 
Naazhigais (24 minutes make one Naazhigai); half a day comes 
to 1 4 7 / g , and if this is divided by 7 we get for each star 2 Vs 
Naazhigais Which means 5 1 minutes. For the first 5 1 minutes 
from 6 a.m. if the Prasna is made, we. have to take the star as 
Krittikaa. Likewise we have to know which of the 7 stars is 
reigning atthe time of Prasna, between 6 a.m. to 12 Noon. 

389 

In a similar manner, from 1 2 Noon to 6 p.m., the 7 stars 
from Makha to Visaakhaa are ruling, each for 5 1 minutes. 

From 6 p.m. to 1 2 midnight, the 7 stars Anuraadhaa to 
Dhanishthaa are ruling, each for 5 1 minutes; and one has to 
find out which star is to be considered at the time of Prasna.; 
From midnight to 6 in the morning, the 7 stars from Satabhisha 
to Bharanee are to be taken, and calculations accordingly 
made. 

Further at the time of Prasna, one has to determine the 
star of the day according to the almanac, and fix it up in the 
cubicle, starting from Anuraadhaa if it is night from 6 to 12, 



152 C Prasnaaroodhaphala J 

and from Dhanishthaa if it is morning from 1 2 midnight to 
6 a.m. That cubicle is called the house of the Moon's star. 

389-390 

^sH^+18 ^T ^c^wl^l^ \\\\\\\ 



Having constructed this, where the Moon is situated 
(namely the house of the Moon's star), it has to be noted that 
it is a watery place. If the cubicle happens to have a star 
associated with Venus, one has to predict that the place is 
watery. If the star happens to be associated with Jupiter, one 
can predict the finding of gold there. 

• The signs of Libra, Taurus, Cancer, Aquarius, Scorpio 
and Capricorn are stated to be watery signs. If the star 
happens to rise in any one of these watery signs, prediction 
about water being available (for digging wells) in that place 
should be made. If, in that place, the Moon and Venus are 
posited, prediction about a great volume of water can be made. 

391-393 



( Wells ) 153 

If that rising sign belongs to the Mercury group, a little 
water can be predicted. But if Saturn or Sun aspects the above 
signs, there will be no water. If Rahu aspects them, there will 
be water. 394 

If the Chhatra Raasi is above the Udaya and Aaroodha 
Raasis, and is aspected by a watery plane or associated with 
it, water will be found at a deep level. But if an upward- 
looking planet is in that Raasi, the water can be found at a 
higher level. 

Note: The planets in the six signs commencing from that 
where the Sun is posited are called upward-looking planets. 
The planets after the six signs (i.e. from the 7th to the 1 2th) 
are called downward-looking planets. 395 



154 CPrasnaaroodhaphala J 

If malefics are found either above or below the Udaya 
Aaroodha and Chhatra Raasis, there will be no water in that 
place. But if a malefic is in the 4th place from Udaya or 
Aaroodha signs, water will be found at a deep level. 396 

Some astrologists predict that a river will flow in that place 
after 7 or 1 years. The availability of water is to be determined 
by finding out watery or non-watery planets in the place. 397 

If the Moon or Jupiter is posited in a Kendra, good 
potable water is available there. If Venus and the Moon are in 
a Kendra, water will be in plenty even if it happens to be a 
mountainous place. 398 

If the Moon and Mercury are in a Kendra, old salt water 
will be available in that place. If the Moon is in a Kendra to 
the Aaroodha Lagna and is aspected by Parivesha or other 
Upagrahas, water will be at a deep level. 399 



£ Weils j 155 

The depth in which water will be available is determined 
by counting the rays of the respective planets detailed above. 
If Mercury and Venus are associated and posited in a Kendra 
the water will be brackish. 400 

^*M«fl tt^ mmufi ^rracte^nr I ivo? i 1 

Water will be at a middle level (neither too high nor too 
low), if Mercury is in its own signs of Gemini or Virgo. If 
Jupiter is associated with Rahu, granite stones will be in the 
middle level. 401 

^M-a^l ww& ^r^H^ I 

If Rahu is associated with Venus and the Moon, there 
will be gush of water at a deep level. If the Sun or Parivesha 
is there in Sagittarius, the water will be salty in taste. If Saturn 
is associated with Rahu, water will be available at a middle 
level. 402

The kind of soil a place would be, where one wants to 
dig a well is determined thus. If the Sun is there, the soil would 
be barren with saline content; the malefics - Saturn and Mars 
—indicate a soil where only thorns and brambles can grow. 
Jupiter indicates coconut, dates and arecanut groves; Venus 
indicates plantain and creeper-growing expanse; Mercury 
points to jack-fruit-growing soil; Rahu and Ketu indicate 
anthills. 403-404

If Saturn or Rahu is posited in Udaya Lagna at the place 
where one wants to dig a well, one can only meet with termites, 
snakes and other insects. If the rising Lagna sign ts aspected 
by the lord of the Lagna, the place where the well is being dug 
is owned by the person; but if it is either aspected by or 
associated with other planets, the place belongs to another.

Chapter XXIV 
OF ARMIES 

^^ ^T^t VN\: WIT Trfk I IVo^ 1 1 

Now 1 will describe the arrival of armies and the entry of 
the enemy into the county. He who knows the Prasna Saastra 
must predict about the arrival of armies, if the Udaya Raasi 
and the Aaroodha Raasi happen to be in a moveable sign and 
malefics are in the 5th house. 406 

If the Udaya Raasi happens to be in a quadruped or biped 
sign and the lord of the Lagna is in retrograde motion; the 
army will return to its country. 407 

dUWlBlM Jl ^% ^TT ^ f^Rft I 

The enemy will not invade the country, if a malefic is posited 
in the 4th house. 408 



160 Q Prasnaaroodhaphala j 

If Rahu happens to be in Udaya, Aaroodha or Chhatra 
Raasi, or in Kendra, the army will be far away. It will not 
enter the town. It will return home, while it is halfway. 409 

If the Aaroodha Raasi happens to be in any one of the 
signs Aquarius, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, and if in there 4th 
place (Kendra) there is a strong planet, the enemy's forces 
wil l retreat and return home . 4 1 

GiaRl ^fk wRl ^rr *nfcr *r^rcr ir*??n 

If the Udaya Raasi rises in a moveable sign, and happens 
to be also the Aaroodha Raasi, and if Mars, the Sun or Jupiter 
is posited there, or aspects the Raasis, prediction about the 
arrival of a big army should be made. 

Note : The oncoming army is called 'yaayee', and the 
invaded army is called the ' sthaayee '. 4 1 1 

If the lord of the Aaroodha Raasi, or the friend of that 
lord is associated with or aspected by an exalted planet, the

'sthaayee' will be victorious and the 'yaayee' will return home 
defeated. 412 

TTcf ^ feWsf^r RmOJ wit *r^n I 

But there is a speciality in the case of the Chhatra Raasi, 
where the result will be the reverse of the above, i.e. if the 
Chhatra Raasi is strong, the yaayee will be triumphant. But in 
the case of the Aaroodha Raasi being strong, he will be firm in 
his own stand; i.e. the sthaayee will be able to defeat the 
yaayee. 413 

vmt v<*i4\4w\i*&%*Z4 fopfo: i iv?vm 

If the Aaroodha Raasi is debilitated, or associated with 
or aspected by a malefic, the sthaayee will be captured by the 
enemy. But if the Chhatra Raasi is in a similar situation, the 
reverse will happen; i.e. the sthaayee will be triumphant, and 
the enemy will be defeated. 4 1 4

If a benefic is in the Udaya Raasi in the forenoon, the

Udaya Raasi, the sthaayee will succeed. 415

If the Chhatra Raasi, Udaya Raasi or Aaroodha Raasi 
happens to he fierce or associated with a malefic, prediction 
has to be made that there will be a fierce battle imminent for 
the sthaayee. 416 

If the Aaroodha Raasi happens to be a Prushthodaya 
(rising by the hinder part) and is associated with or aspected 
by a malefic, or a malefic is posited in the 1 Oth place, or if the 
Udaya Raasi is quadruped sign, conflict will soon arise. If 
what is stated above is aspected by a benefic, amity and 
friendship will take place. 4 1 7

If the six signs from the Udaya Raasi are occupied by 
benefics, the sthaayee will be triumphant. But if benefics are 
in signs beyond the six adjacent to the Udaya Raasi, the yaayee 
will succeed. That is, if the six signs adjacent to the Udaya 
Raasi are malefics, the sthaayee will be defeated, the yaayee 
will succeed. But if the malefics are beyond the six signs, the 
yaayee will be defeated, and the sthaayee will be triumphant. 
But if both the malefics and benefics are mixed in these si gns, 
friendship will ensue between the two parties, If strong malefics 
are on either side of the Lagna, i.e. in the 2nd and 1 2th places, 
the two rival parties will be equal; i.e. the enemy will have 
scored some successes and the sthaayee some successes* 

418-419 

^rRilRrft: qR*KHMW W ^ I 

The strength of the parties has to be assessed thus: The 
strength of the six signs from the 4th Raasi from Udaya sign 
determines the enemy's strength; while the six other Raasis 
beyond give the strength of the yaayee. Thus is prediction to 
be made in terms of the relative strengths of the planets. 420

Now the effects of planets being in the Udaya Raasi will

Mercury and Venus are in Udaya Lagna, the sthaayee will be 
defeated. 421

Chapter XXV 
ON TRAVEL 

In the interest of all, I am now describing the auspicious 
time for travel. After properly examining the details about going, 
coming, gain, loss, good and bad, the Prasna is to be answered. 

436 

If friendly planets aspect the friendly signs at the time of 
Prasna, the arrival of friends is to be predicted. Likewise if 
weak planets aspect weak signs the arrival of lowly persons 
is to be expected. 437 

If exalted planets aspect the exalted signs, the person's 
travel on official duty is to be predicted. 43 8 



170 C Prasnaaroodhaphala J 

If male planets are in male signs the travel is in relation to 
some work with a man; and if female planets are in female 
signs, the travel is in connection with a woman. Such events 
are to be expected in other places too. 439 

If the Udaya and Aaroodha Raasis are moveable signs 
and are aspected by various planets, travel will be in the 
direction of the respective planets. 440 

If the Udaya and Aaroodha Raasis are fixed and if S aturn, 
the Sun and Mars are posited there or in the 1 0th house, 
neither arrival nor departure will take place. 44 1 

If Venus, Jupiter and the Moon are in moveable signs, 
travel will take place only in one's own interest. 442

If Prasna is in connection with travel, if the rising sign is

beneficial, 443 

If a male planet is in the 2nd or 3rd place from the Prasna 
Lagna, a letter will come with in three days; or a messenger 
will come from the person who has gone on travel. 444

If malefics are in the 6th or 5th place from the Prasna 
Lagna, the man who has gone out will return with sickness.

If the Moon is in Sagittarius, Taurus, Aries or Leo, the 
man of whom one is thinking will return soon. If the Moon is 
in the 4th place, the man thought about will return. 448

If Venus, Jupiter, the Moon and Mercury are in their own 
houses, travel will take place in the direction in which the 
planets are situated. 449 

When the planets reach their own houses the fruits 
(benefits) of travel are to be told. Good and bad effects of 



f On Travel J- 



173 



travel are to be predicted in terms of the strength or weakness 
of the planets. 450 

If malefics are in the 7th and 8th places, the man who has 
gone on travel will be robbed of his property and killed too 
there. 451 

If a malefic is in the 6th place the man who has gone out 
will be imprisoned. If the malefic is in a watery sign, the man 
on travel will come back home after a long time. Good and 
bad effects of travel are to be predicted in terms of the strength 
or wekness of the planets. ' 452

Chapter XXVI 
OF RAINS 

If the Lagna is a watery sign or if it is aspectcd by a 
watery planet, the downpour of rain can be predicted. If it is 
otherwise, there will be no rainfall. 453 

If Venus or the Moon is in a watery sign, there will be he 
heavy downpour; and if Venus or the Moon is aspecting their 
own housecs, or their exalted signs, or posited in their 
Kendras. heavy downpour within three or four days can be 
predicted. If Venus is in the 4th place, rain will fall on the 
same day when the Prasna is made. 454-455 



C Rains j- 



175 



If Venus, Jupiter, and the Moon are in watery signs, or 
aspect the Aaroodha or Udaya Raasi, there will be very heavy 
downpour. 456 

If the ChhatraRaasi is a Prishthodaya sign and is aspected 
by a Prishthodaya planet and at the same time the Pafivesha 
is also seen, heavy rainfall is most likely. 457 

<£fM^fi(d ^*T^*RT ^WIW: 1 Dt\6 1 1 

If Saturn, Mars, Mercury and Rahu are in Kendra, there 
will be no rainfall, but a big windstorm will blow. 458 

^iwl ^<i^£fMwlfd «CW2|<| 

If malefics are associated with benefics in a Kendra, the 
rainfall will be little. If Rahu and Saturn are in Sagittarius at the 
time of Prasna there will be no rainfall. But if benefics are in 
Sagittarius, there will be heavy rainfall. 459 



176 C Prasnaaroodhaphala J 

If the Udaya Lagna is associated with or aspected by a 
planet in exaltation there will be an increase in prices of 
commodities. There will be fall in prices, if it is aspected by or 
associated with debilitated planets. 460 

The prices will be moderate, if the Lagna i s aspected by 
or assocfated with a friendly planet or the lord of the Lagna. 
If a benefic is associated with the Lagnaj, the prices will 
increase; and if a malefic, the prices will fall. 46 1 



^ Ships J 177 

Chapter XXVII 
OF SHIPS 

If Prasna is made about the arrival of ships, the method 
of answering is given below : - 

If the Lagna is a watery sign, and if Jupiter, Venus, or the 
Moon is posited there, the arrival of ships is to be stated But 
if malefics are in the Lagna, no ship will come. 4 62 

If malefics aspect the Aaroodha or Chhatra Lagna, the 
ship will sink. Even if debilitated planets or inimical planets 
aspect the above Lagnas, damage to the ship is to be predicted. 

463 

If the Lagna is other than a Prishthodaya Raasi, and if the 
Udaya Lagna is aspected by its lord, the ship will leave the 



178 C Prasnaaroodhaphala J 

country of destination. When the lord of the Lagna is aspected

If either the Prasna Lagna or the Chhatra Raasi is a 
moveable sign, the ship will arrive soon. If the Moon is in the 
4th or 5th place, the ship will come very soon. If Venus is in 
the 2nd or 3rd place, the ship will arrive. Like- wise should 
other predictions be made after careful investigation. 465

The time when the work will be accomplished is stated 
here:- There are seven Yogas when a work will be 
accomplished successfully: (1) When the lord of the Lagna 
and the lord of the 1 Oth house are in the 1 0th place; (2) when 
the lord of the 10th house and the lord of the Lagna are in 
Lagna; (3) when the Lagna is aspected by the lord of the 
Lagna or when the lord of the 1 Oth house aspects the 1 Oth

house; (4) when the lord of the 10th house is in Lagna and 
aspects the lord of the Lagna; (5) when the lord of the. Lagna 
is in the 10th house and aspects the lord of the 10th house; 
(6) when the lord of the Lagna aspects the 10th house and 
the lord of the 10th aspects the Lagna; and (7) when the lord 
of the 10th aspects the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the 
Lagna aspects the lord of the 1 0th. When the Moon aspects 
any of the above Yogas, certain accomplishment of the deed 
is predicted. 466-470 

Even if these Yogas are not available, when the lord of 
the 1 0th house during his usual transit reaches the Lagna, the 
achievement of the work is to be predicted, says the science 
of Gnaanapradeepikaa, 47 1

If one carefully studies this science and gives his 
prediction after proper investigation, his words will not 
become a lie. This science of Prasna is an ornament to 
the world, provided it is applied rightly. 472
