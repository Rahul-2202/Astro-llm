the history and pr inciples  
of astrology

It is the stars,
The stars above us, govern our conditions.

William Shakespeare, King Lear (1605–06), Act 4, Scene 3.1

Since time immemorial the heavenly 
bodies—luminaries, planets and stars—

have exerted a mysterious fascination upon 
their Earth-bound observers. Even today, 
when the scientific precepts of astronomy 
have come to marginalize (some even say, 
discredit) the astrological beliefs that pre-
vailed for millennia, we remain captivated 
by their ethereal beauty and elusive promise 
of worlds as yet undiscovered. 

Ancient stargazers, who lacked instru-
ments like the telescope with which to 
study the heavens in accurate detail, still 
discerned that certain astral bodies com-
prised fixed formations that moved in pre-
dictable fashion through the night sky, their 
appearance and disappearance heralding the 
changes of season. They believed that the 
universe was geocentric, and that the posi-
tions and majestic progressions of the Sun, 
Moon, planets and stars influenced the lives 
of human beings and all of the events that 
occurred on Earth. This concept is encapsu-
lated in the word “astrology,” a composite of 
the Greek words astron (“star”) and legetin 
(“speak”). It was only through the ground-
breaking work of such later astronomers 
as Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543), who 
first postulated that the Earth did not, in 
fact, occupy the center of the universe, but

a Aries
March 21 to April 20  

Ruling planet: Mars   Element: Cardinal fire   
Symbol: Ram    Polarity: Positive (masculine)   Colors: White, red 

Physical correspondence: Head, brain 
Stones: Amethyst, ruby, diamond

Flowers: Hollyhock, carnation, poppy, thistle, geranium

Aries is traditionally the first sign of the zodiac. Its ascendancy during the first month 
of the Northern Hemisphere’s spring associates it with the burgeoning of life and 

the renewal of solar energy following winter, and thus with new beginnings. The ancient 
Egyptians identified the ram with their creator deity, the Sun-god Amon Ra, who was 
usually portrayed crowned with rams’ horns. According to the Arab astronomer Abumsasr, 
the cosmos itself was created when the major planets were conjoined within the sign of 
Aries. While the Hindu zodiac equates Aries, as Mesha or Aja, with a ram or goat 
respectively, and the Persians termed it “the lamb,” Varak, the Babylonian astronomers 
regarded the sign as either Zappu, “the hair,” or Hungra, “the worker.” The ancient Greeks 
called the ram of their zodiac Krios, and linked it with the golden-fleeced ram, which in 
turn was linked with Ares, the Greek god of war. The golden fleece subsequently adorned 
Ares’s temple at Colchis, guarded by a fire-breathing serpent, until it was later claimed 
by Jason and his Argonauts. The association of this mythical ram with the zodiacal sign 
is confirmed by the shared Greek name for Mars, the ruling planet of this constellation.

It is Aries’s association with the qualities traditionally attributed to the planet Mars—
leadership, courage, aggression, and egotism—that in part defines the personal charac-
teristics of those born under this sign, complemented by those that are suggested by 
the element of fire: heated emotions, vitality, and enthusiasm, but also the potential for 
impatience, impulsiveness, and destruction. And, of course, the headstrong and active 
nature of the ram itself further reinforces these dual associations.

April 21 to May 20

Ruling planet: Venus   Element: Fixed earth   Symbol: Bull    
Polarity: Negative (feminine)   Colors: Pale blue, lilac, pink 

Physical correspondence: Neck, ears, throat   
Stones: Alabaster, topaz, rose quartz, emerald      
Flowers: Lily, lilac, daisy, mallow, poppy, violet

Virtually every astrological tradition has equated the constellation of Taurus with a bull. 
A sign that is governed by the planet Venus, this astral grouping includes the seven 

stars known as the Pleiades, or the “Seven Sisters,” who, in Greco-Roman mythology, 
guarded Aphrodite/Venus’s “pearly gates.” The bull’s association with the goddess of 
sexual love is clear, for this creature not only embodies fecundity and procreative powers, 
but its horns may be said to represent the crescent Moon, and its head the full Moon, 
and the Moon is the preserve and symbol of the Goddess, as is the element of earth that 
governs this sign. Many ancient peoples sacrificed bulls at the time of the Taurean new 
Moon in the belief that the bull’s body and blood gave birth to, and nurtured, all forms of 
vegetal and animal life. It is therefore appropriate that Taurus presides over the seasonal 
period in which spring life burgeons and thrives.

Those born under this sign are said to be influenced by the earthy element that rules 
their birth sign in that they are regarded as practical and materialistic types who have the 
capacity to initiate and steadily cultivate plans of actions, while Venus is said to bestow 
her sensuality, love of pleasure, and artistic affinity upon Taureans. Less positively, how-
ever, the Taurean personality may sometimes be obstinately resistant to change, fiercely 
possessive of loved ones, and roused to spectacular displays of anger when its plans are 
thwarted—all forms of behavior that may be said to be demonstrated by the bull.

d Cancer
June 22 to July 22   

Ruling planet: The Moon   Element: Cardinal water   Symbol: Crab     
Polarity: Negative (feminine)   Stones: Pearl, moonstone, peridot   

Physical correspondence: Stomach, breasts
   Colors: Cream, white, silver-blue, smoky gray

Flowers: Lily, lily of the valley, water lily, white rose

Nearly every astrological tradition equates the constellation of Cancer with a crab. This 
near-universal identification can be explained by the movement of the Sun during 

the period of Cancer’s ascendancy, for it appears to mimic the crustacean’s distinctive side-
ways, scuttling movement on its southern descent. The Greco-Roman myth tells of how 
the mother goddess Hera ( Juno) sent a crab to the aid of the nine-headed Hydra of Lerna 
in its struggle against Herakles (Hercules); Hera placed it in the heavens as a reward for 
its efforts. Cancer, known as the “gate of men,” has enormous cosmic significance, for not 
only does the summer solstice (in the northern hemisphere) occur under this sign, but the 
universe came into being when the planets were aligned within this sign, and some hold 
that the world will end when a similar conjunction is effected. 

Cancer is ruled by the Moon, the preserve of the goddess—the creator and destroyer—
which regulates the ebb and flow of water, the habitat of the crab and the element that 
governs Cancer. The sign’s dual lunar-watery influence confers loyalty, sensitivity, intuition 
and emotional receptiveness, as well as the procreative, nurturing and protective qualities 
associated with the feminine principle. Like the crab, those born under this sign are said 
to possess tenacity, but are also subject to the tendency to withdraw into their shells when 
threatened by others or inundated with emotion.

e Leo
July 23 to August 22   

Ruling planet: Sun   Element: Fixed fire   
Symbol: Lion   Polarity: Positive (masculine)     
Physical correspondence: Spine, back, heart

Stones: Ruby, yellow topaz, tiger’s eye, amber, cat’s eye
Flowers: Sunflower, chamomile, marigold, celandine  

 Colors: Golden yellow, orange

The zodiacal sign of Leo governs the period when the Northern Hemisphere’s summer 
is at its height, when the heat of the Sun is at its fiercest, and this manifestation of 

solar power is probably the reason why so many Middle Eastern astrological traditions 
equated the constellation with the lion, the king of beasts, whose golden mane was said by 
classical poets to resemble the rays of the Sun. The ancient Egyptians venerated the lion 
because the life-giving waters of the River Nile began to rise when the Sun was in Leo, 
while the ancient Greeks, Persians, and Hindu astrologers also unequivocally personified 
the constellation as a lion. The Babylonians, too, envisaged a leonine creature presiding 
over the sign, but in this case it was a lioness or dog, maybe because many of the powerful 
goddesses of the Mesopotamian tradition were strongly associated with these animals. 
Perhaps the most familiar and enduring myth associated with Leo is that of the slaying of 
the Nemean lion by the Greco-Roman hero Herakles (Hercules) —the first of his labors.

The combination of the related influences that cogovern Leo—the brightly burning 
Sun and element of fire that gives life but can also destroy, as well as the magnificent 
majesty of the lion—is therefore said to endow those born under this constellation with 
sunny natures, creative powers, exuberance, enthusiasm, energy, generosity, courage, and 
strength—all qualities that signify leadership potential. Conversely, however, the intel-
lectual independence and pride that are further Leonine characteristics can result in 
egotism, vanity and self-indulgence.

August 23 to September 22

Ruling planet: Mercury    Element: Mutable earth   
Symbol: Virginal woman    Polarity: Negative (feminine) 
Physical correspondence: Intestines, abdomen, and spleen  

Stones: Sapphire, amethyst, carnelian, peridot    Colors: Indigo, navy blue
Flowers: Jasmine, wintergreen, sage, narcissus, cornflower

The astrologies of most traditions identified the constellation of Virgo as a female 
figure who presided over the harvest season. The most ancient personifications of 

this divine woman, however, emphasized her fecundity and, by extension, the fruitfulness 
of the Earth. Like many other peoples, the ancient Egyptians depicted her (like Isis) 
holding an ear of corn; to the Romans she was Ceres, the goddess of corn; and to the 
Babylonians she was the grain goddess. Her virginal aspect was signified by the names 
that the Persians, Greeks, and Hindus gave her, all denoting a maiden or virgin. That an 
earth goddess should be so closely linked with a virginal deity may seem paradoxical, but 
in ancient tradition the universal Goddess was believed to encompass sexual inviolability 
and maturity (that is, motherhood), and thus simultaneously embodied both states. There 
are two Greco-Roman myths that tell of the creation of the constellation Virgo. Virgo is 
also associated with the Virgin Mary, the star-adorned “queen of heaven.”

The personal characteristics bestowed by Virgo reflect apparently conflicting influ-
ences. The element of earth, as well as the constellation’s ancient links with the mother 
goddess, endow Virgoans with stability, orderliness, conscientiousness, practical skills, 
and the potential to reap the fruits of material success. Virginal demureness is paralleled 
by modesty, idealism, and highly developed analytical capacities. The influence of the 
sign’s ruling plant of Mercury denotes quick minds and intellectual curiosity. On the 
negative side, Virgoans are sometimes narrow-minded, overly critical, and unimaginative.

g Libra
September 23 to October 22 

Ruling planet: Venus   Element: Cardinal air   
Symbol: Scales    Polarity: Positive (masculine)   Colors: Pink, blue, lavender 

Physical correspondence: Kidneys 
Stones: Quartz, opal, jade, emerald, sapphire

Flowers: Rose, pansy, foxglove, daisy, hydrangea

The balance or scales that represent the zodiacal sign of Libra are universal to the var-
ious astrological traditions: the Persians, Babylonians, and Hindus all gave it names 

that signify scales. The only notable exception was the symbol used by the ancient Greek 
astrologers, to whom Libra was Zugos, “the yoke.” The constellation’s association with a 
balance (or a primitive yoke with which oxen were harnessed) is explained by the fact that 
Libra dominates the period when night and day are of approximately equal length. Yet the 
image of the scales also has a more spiritual significance, for this instrument is symbolical-
ly related to ancient Egyptian lore, in which a balance was used in Osiris’s hall of judgment 
to weigh the hearts of the recently deceased against the feather of Ma’at, the goddess of 
truth. Some scholars postulate that the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic that symbolized 
Libra—which resembles the sign’s modern sigil—represents the Sun (embodying mascu-
linity) setting over the Earth (signifying femininity), an analogy compatible with both the 
postmortem weighing of souls and the balancing of opposing principles.

The Romans sometimes considered their deity of metal-working and measurement, 
Vulcan, to be present in this constellation, and his consort Venus (known as the morning 
star) is the planetary ruler of Libra. She endows those born under this sign with charm, a 
love of beauty, and a desire to bring harmony, while the element of air that further exerts 
its influence over Libra signifies intellectual affinities, as well as a desire for freedom. The 
zodiacal scales signify a strong sense of natural justice and steady psychological equilib-
rium, but may equally imply flightiness and emotional or intellectual indecisiveness.

Sagittarius
November 22 to December 21 

Ruling planet: Jupiter   Element: Mutable fire   
Symbol: Centaur/archer    Polarity: Positive (masculine) 

Physical correspondence: Liver, hips and thighs
Stones: Garnet, turquoise, amethyst, citrine, topaz   Colors: Blue and purple

Flowers: Wallflower, dandelion, narcissus, lime flower, carnation   

The name “Sagittarius” is derived from the Latin word sagitta, “arrow”, and the 
archer is traditionally associated with this sign. Although the hybrid centaur—half 

man and half horse—is often portrayed as this zodiacal archer, some scholars believe 
instead that they represent scorpion-men. The majority of astrological traditions have 
identified this constellation with an archer, the ancient Greeks, for example, calling 
it Toxotes (“the archer”), and Hindu astrologers, Dhanus (“the bow”). The myth that 
specifically explains the origins of the constellation of Sagittarius tells of the centaur 
Chiron of Magnesia, mentor of Achilles, Pholus and Jason. After his accidental 
wounding by Herakle’s (Hercules’) poisoned arrow he was said to have bestowed his 
immortality upon Prometheus, and in recognition of his noble gesture was raised to the 
heavens by Zeus ( Jupiter).

Paralleling the hybrid nature of the centaur, Sagittarians are said to possess the impet-
uous animal power of the horse and the intellectual capacity of humanity, along with 
the aspirational qualities signified by the arrow. Under the influence of the element of 
fire, Sagittarians often display restlessness and emotional warmth, while the sign’s ruling 
planet, Jupiter, bestows joviality, versatility and a sense of honor. There is risk, however, 
that material concerns may prevail over intellectual wisdom, and that passion, impulsive 
enthusiasm and impatience may hinder a focused approach.

l Pisces
February 19 to March 20 

Ruling planet: Neptune (traditionally Jupiter)   Element: Mutable water   
Symbol: Two fishes    Polarity: Negative (feminine)   Colors: White, mauve, red 

Physical correspondence: Feet 
Stones: Coral, jasper, bloodstone, white opal, pearl, amethyst, moonstone

Flowers: Poppy, water lily, pink, thyme

Many astrological traditions have identified this constellation with a marine creature. 
The ancient Greeks and Persians envisaged Pisces as a single fish, as did Hindu 

astrologers, who linked it to Vishnu’s avatar as a fish, Matsya. It was the Babylonians who 
first conceived of the constellation as a pair of fishes. An ancient Greco-Roman myth tells 
of how the ogre Typhon pursued the goddess Aphrodite/Venus and her son Eros/Cupid 
until they escaped him by transforming themselves into fishes. Because Aphrodite/Venus 
was born from the sea, and since the sign is ruled by the sea god Neptune (who supplanted 
Jupiter following the planet’s discovery in 1846), it is appropriate that the element of 
water governs this sign. It’s also associated with the Moon, whose ability to regulate the 
oceanic tides links it unequivocally with water. The twin curves of Pisces’ sigil mimic the 
crescents that represent the waxing and waning of the Moon. This duality is mirrored 
within the annual cycle, for since Pisces’ realm of influence is the last month of winter, it 
simultaneously looks back over the past agricultural year and forward to the next.

Pisces represents duality, often taken to denote the spiritual and worldly realms. The 
Piscean personality may be symbolically linked to a fish swimming through the water 
seeking enlightenment, but the potential for undirected restlessness and emotional insta-
bility is also indicated. Many iconic representations of Pisces show the two fishes bound 
together by the Nodus, or silver cord, which represents the link to the spirit world, sug-
gesting Pisceans’ dreamy natures.
