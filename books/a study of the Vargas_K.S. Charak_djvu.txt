A Study 
of 
the Vargas 


1 
General Introduction 


Ni extremely important aspect of chart analysis according to the Vedic astrology is the 
onsideration of the vargas which are finer or subtler divisions of a rashi or sign. Each 
rashi is subjected to different sets of divisions for the purpose of constructing the various 
divisional or varga charts. Parashara as well as other authorities on this subject prescrible that 
the lagna chart must be studied along with the vargas for an accurate analysis. Any study of 


the lagna chart without considering the vargas simultaneously is doomed to failure. 


We are all aware that the zodiac, of 360 degrees, is divided into twelve equal segments or 
arcs, each a span of 30 degrees, called rashis or signs. The lagna is that rashi which is rising 
on the horizon at a given time. Twelve different lagnas rise and set in a day of twenty-four 
hours. Each of the twelve lagnas would thus remain on the horizon for an average of approxi- 
mately two hours, with appropriate variations in their duration relevant to the specific signs 
and to the different latitudes. It would mean that any births that occur during a certain span 
of about two hours would have the same lagna and also the same planetary disposition in the 
horoscope (since the planets are unlikely to change their position within two hours). Such 
natives would then be expected to have similar destinies. The facts are, however, different as 
we all know. To circumvent this anomaly, and to effectively differentiate between individuals 
born close to each other in terms of time, this highly sophisticated system of vargas has been 
introduced. No lagna chart must be analysed in isolation with much hope of an accurate 
prediction. It is strongly recommended that the horoscopic analysis should involve a study 
of the relevant varga charts. While the apparent is indicated by the rashi chart, the real lies 
hidden in the vargas. 


Relevance of the Bhava chart 


There are those who strongly advocate the consideration of the Bhava chart, often in prefer- 
ence to the lagna chart, for making predictions. Such Bhava charts are based on the degree of 
the lagna and that of the tenth house. It results in an unequal span of the twelve houses of 
the chart so that the planetary positions also get altered in the Bhava chart. We do not find 
it necessary to grant this place of supremacy to the Bhava chart. We feel that a consideration 
of the vargas is far more important in making accurate analysis of the chart. The varga charts 


are based on accurate calculation of the degree of the lagna as well as the longitudes of plan- 


ets. The relevance of the Bhava chart would also be questionable if the controversy between 
whether to consider unequal house division or equal house division is not resolved. For there 
are some who consider the lagna to extend 15 degrees on either side of the degree of the lagna 
which actually is the Bhava-madhya or the central point of the lagna. It is natural, according 
to them, to consider the extent of half the house (15 degrees) before the degree of the lagna 
and half of it (15 degrees) after it. 


We do not intend to completely disregard the concept of the Bhava chart. The word 
‘Bhava’ does not only mean a ‘house’ of the horoscope but also indicates the subtle, mental/ 
psychological inclinations of an individual. It is likely that the Bhava chart throws light on 
the inner nature of a native. 


Sixteen divisions of Parashara 


Sage Parashara advocates the use of sixteen divisions or vargas, of which the first is the rashi 
or the lagna chart. Each varga is a further subtle division of the lagna. The lagna in a given 
varga chart coincides with the sign wherein the lagna of the natal chart falls in the specific 
varga. The signs occupied by the planets in a given varga chart depend on the longitudes of 
individual planets. It is now relevant here to briefly introduce the sixteen vargas of Parashara 


as follows: 

1. Rashi or the complete sign, an arc of 30°. 
Hora or one-half of a sign, an arc of 15°. 
Drekkana or one-third of a sign, an arc of 10°. 
Chaturthamsha or one-fourth of a sign, an arc of 79:30’. 
Saptamsha or one-seventh of a sign, an arc of 49°:177:8.5”. 
Navamsha or one-ninth of a sign, an arc of 3°:20’. 
Dashamsha or one-tenth of a sign, an arc of 3°. 


Dwadashamsha or one-twelfth of a sign, an arc of 29:30’.

. Akshavedamsha or one-forty-fifth of a sign, an arc of 0°:40’. 
16. Shashtyamsha or one-sixtieth of a sign, an arc of 0°:30’. 


It will be seen that though the lagna chart may not change for a period of around two hours, 


the finer vargas would change with very small changes in the birth time. Thus, if a lagna stays 


4 


on the horizon for a period of two hours (or 120 minutes), its sixtieth division or Shashtyamsha 
(an arc of 0°:30’) would stay unchanged only for 2 minutes. The Shashtyamsha charts of the 
two natives born approximately two minutes apart would thus be different even though the 
lagna chart may be the same. The vargas thus help us differentiate between individuals whose 
basic charts may be the same due to very close times of their birth. Also the lagna chart is 


more gross. Any subtle or refined prediction needs to take into consideration the vargas. 


Some additional vargas 


Adventurers in astrology are wont to experiment with some additional varga charts which 
fall outside the domain of Parashara. These are some of the vargas which are used in the 
Varshaphala or the annual chart of Hindu astrology. Some people claim to have found good 
results from the use of such charts. We feel the Shashtamsha (or one-sixth of a rashi, an arc 
of 5°) and the Ashtamamsha (or one-eighth of a rashi, an arc of 39:45’) may be useful in 
matters of health and disease. An unrestricted use of any of the other vargas of Varshaphala 
in the natal chart, without adequate scientific study of these, is anything but justified. Some 


of the vargas of Varshaphala are also at variance with similar divisions of Parashara. 


Vargas briefly defined 


We now briefly the various vargas in order for the reader to get a clue of how to construct 
varga charts. The varga tables are given at the end as an appendix. 


1. Rashi: This comprises one full sign of 30 degrees. A rashi chart is the basic horoscope. 
Here, the lagna depends upon the sign rising at the horizon at the time of birth. The 
planets are located in the signs which they occupy in the zodiac. 


2. Hora: Here, a sign is divided into two parts of 15° each. This is arrived at thus : 


(a) The first 15 degrees in an odd sign belong to the Sun (or the sign Simha) and the 
second 15 degrees to the Moon (or the sign Karka). 


(b) The first 15 degrees in an even sign belong to the Moon (or Karka) and the second 
15° to the Sun (or Simha). 


According to a Vriddhakarika, the first Hora in Mesha belongs to Mesha and the second 
to Vrisha; the first in Vrisha belongs to Mithuna and the second to Karka; and so on. This 
alternate Hora seems to us of some utility and removes the imbalance that otherwise exists 
in the construction of a Hora chart. The table for this alternate Hora is also appended 
at the end. Suggestions have been made to also adopt alternate charts for Drekkana and 
Trimshamsha but they do not seem justified to us. 


3. Drekkana: When a sign is divided into three equal parts of 10° each, such parts are called 
as Drekkanas. In each sign, the first Drekkana belongs to the same sign; the second Drek- 
kana belongs to the sign fifth from it; and the third Drekkana to the sign ninth from it. 


4. Chaturthamsha: This comprises one-fourth of a sign, being equivalent to 7°30’. Here, 
the first 7°30’ of a sign belong to the same sign, the second 7°30’ (ie., 7°30’ to 15°0’)

belongs to the sign falling in the fourth house from it; the third (15°0’ to 22°30’) to the 
sign seventh from it and the last (22°30’ to 30°0’) to the sign falling tenth from it. 


Saptamsha: A sign of 30 degrees is divided into seven equal parts (of 4°17°8.5” each). In 
odd signs, the seven parts belong to the seven signs falling in regular order from the odd 
sign concerned. In even signs, the first part belongs to the sign seventh from it, and the 


remaining six signs follow in regular order. 


Navamsha: This is the most important of the divisional charts. Here, each sign is divided 
into nine equal parts of 3°20’ each. In movable signs, the first Navamsha belongs to the 
same sign, and the remaining eight Navamshas follow in regular order from it. In the 
fixed signs, the first Navamsha belongs to the sign falling in the ninth house from it. In 
case of the mixed signs, the first Navamsha belongs to the sign falling in the fifth house 
from it. It is said that a planet gives its effect more certainly according to its Navamsha 
than its Rashi position. When a planet occupies the same sign in the Rashi chart as also 


the Navamsha chart, it is called Vargottama, a highly beneficial situation. 


Dashamamsha: Each Dashamamsha division consist of 3°. In odd signs, the first three 
degrees belong to the same sign, the next three degrees to the sign falling next in order, 
and so on. In even signs, the first three degrees belong to the sign falling in the ninth 
house from itself; the next three degrees to the next (or the tenth) sign, and so on. 


Dwadashamsha: This comprises of one-twelfth of a sign, and is equivalent to 2°30’. The 
first Dwadashamsha of a sign belongs to the same sign, the remaining eleven Dwadasham- 
shas fall in subsequent eleven signs in regular order. 


Shodashamsha: Here, a sign is divided into sixteen divisions comprising of 1°52’30” each. 
In movable signs, the first Shodashamsha starts from Mesha; the next one is Vrisha, and so 
on, until the twelfth which is Meena. From the thirteenth Shodashamsha, the order starts 
from Mesha again and proceeds in the same manner until the sixteenth Shodashamsha 
falls in Karka. 


In case of fixed signs, the first Shodashamsha is Simha, and the last Vrischika. In mixed 
signs, the first Shodashamsha is Dhanu and the last Meena. 


Vimshamsha: This is the twentieth division of a sign measuring 1°30’ of arc. In movable 
signs, it starts from Mesha, in fixed signs from Dhanu and in mixed signs from Simha. 


Subsequent Vimshamshas belong to the signs falling in order subsequently. 


Chaturvimshamsha or Siddhamsha: Each of these measures 1°15’. There are twenty-four 
Chaturvimshamshas; they start from Simha in odd signs and from Karka in even signs. 


Subsequent Chaturvimshamshas follow in regular order. 


Bhamsha or Sapta-vimshamsha: There are 27 Bhamshas (of lo 6’ 40” each) in a sign. In 
fiery signs (i.e., 1, 5 and 9) they start from Mesha; In earthy signs (i.c., 2, 6 and 10), 
they start from Karka; In airy signs (i.e., 3, 7 and 11), they start from Tula and in watery 
signs (ie., 4, 8 and 12), they start from Makara. The subsequent order is the usual regular 


order. 


13. Trimshamsha: Literally speaking, it is considered as one-thirtieth division of a sign. 
Actually, however, each sign is divided into five unequal parts, each part belonging 
to one of the five planets from Mars to Saturn. In odd signs, the first five degrees 
belong to Mars, the next five degrees to Saturn, the next eight degrees to Jupiter, the 
subsequent seven degrees to Mercury, and the last five degrees to Venus. This order 
gets reversed in case of even signs where the planets Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn 
and Mars respectively own five degrees, seven degrees, eight degrees, five degrees and 


five degrees, in a sign. 


14. Khavedamsha: This is the one-fortieth division of a sign, measuring 0°45’ of an arc. In 
odd signs, the first Khavedamsha is Mesha; in even signs it is Tula. The remaining divi- 


sions follow in regular order in both cases. 


15. Aksha-vedamsha: Each sign here is divided into forty-five parts, of 0040’ arc. In movable 
signs the first such division falls in Mesha; in fixed signs in Simha; and in mixed signs in 


Dhanu. The remaining divisions follow the usual regular order. 


16. Shashtyamsha: This is the sixtieth division of a sign and measures 0°30’ of arc. Being 
very fine, it needs a very accurate time recording in order to be correct. Sage Parashara 
lays a lot of stress on the predictive utility of this sub-division. In practice, however, it is 
rare to be so accurate in one’s time recording as to find a correct Shashtyamsha. The first 
Shashtyamsha in a sign starts from the same sign. The subsequent Shashtyamshas belong 
to the subsequent signs that follow in regular order. 


Shadvarga and Saptavarga 


While it is desirable to use the finer vargas, up to the Shashtyamsha, in horoscopic analy- 
sis, there is also a disadvantage of it. Very small errors in the recording of birth time could 
significantly alter the disposition of varga charts since their lagnas might change. It is thus a 
general practice to consider six or seven vargas (Shadvarga or Saptavarga) for ordinary purposes. 
Under Shadvarga fall the lagna, Hora, Drekkana, Navamsha, Trimshamsha and Dwadasham- 
sha. The Saptamsha is the additional chart when Saptavarga is considered. All these vargas 
are relatively grosser compared to the other finer divisions. They are less likely to be wrong 


when the recording of the birth time is even inaccurate to some extent. 
How to utilise the varga charts? 


The varga charts need to be looked at in two important ways: 


I. Relative significance: Each varga chart is a finer constituent of the lagna chart. It needs 
to be studied as an independent horoscope like the lagna chart, and its findings integrated 
with those of the lagna chart as well as the other vargas. The disposition of the lagna and 


other house lords in the lagna chart needs to be studied in the vargas. 


Parashara makes four categories of the vargas and provides the relative significance of each 


varga, in each category, on a score of twenty: 


(a) Shadvarga or six divisions

It is evident from the above that amongst the grosser vargas, the navamsha is fairly close 
in significance to the lagna chart. Authorities state that when there is a discrepancy in the 
results indicated by a planet in the lagna chart and the navamsha chart, the indications of the 
navamsha prevail. A navamsha chart must always be examined in all matters, along with the 
lagna chart. If the time of birth is very accurately recorded, one may be permitted to make use 
of the Shashtyamsha which, according to Parashara, is more important than the lagna chart. 


II. Specific purpose: Each varga also possesses a specific significance in that it deals with a 
specific aspect of the life of a native. Parashara attributes the following specific functions to 


each of the sixteen divisions. 


1. Lagna or the rashi chart: Physical well-being of the native. 

2. Hora : Wealth and prosperity. 

3. Drekkana : Brothers and sisters, and their well-being. 

4. Chaturthamsha ‘ Luck, residence. 

5.  Saptamsha : Children, grand children. 

6. Navamsha : Spouse. 

7. Dashamsha : Any specific benefit; profession of the native. 
8.  Dwadashamsha : Father and mother. 

9.  Shodashamsha : Pleasures and troubles from vehicles, horses, 


elephants, etc.

Rashi or the Lagna Chart 


his is the basic chart. The other vargas are only the subtler divisions of the Rashi chart. 
One of the twelve rashis rises on the eastern horizon at the time of birth and is called 


as the lagna. Each rashi has its planetary lord. This is shown clearly in figure 1. 


Fig. 1: Rashis and their planetary lords 


11 


The sign rising in the lagna confers on the native its specific qualities. This is briefly de- 


scribed as follows. 


Different Signs in the Lagna 


Each of the twelve rashis or signs of the zodiac has its own inherent characteristics which it 
imparts to the house it falls in and to the planet that resides in it. Since the lagna is the most 
prominent house of the horoscope and represents the native most intensely, the influence of 
the specific rashi falling in the lagna on the nature, appearance and health of the native is most 
significant. The results of the different zodiacal signs rising in the lagna as given here have been 
taken from the Maanasaagari and compared with those from the Jaatakaa-bharanam. The results 


of the Moon falling in these signs also closely resemble those of the lagna in these signs. 


1. Mesha (Aries) 


Maanasaagari: With Mesha in the lagna, the native has a reddish complexion, a phlegmatic 
disposition, short temper; he is ungrateful, of low intellect, stable, and ever subjugated by his 


wife and servants. 


Jaatakaabharanam: The native with Mesha lagna is extremely haughty, talented, easily angered, 
opposed to his own people while befriending the outsiders, earns name and fame through 
courageous deeds. 


Note: Mesha is owned by Mars. In tune with the nature of its lord, this sign confers on the native 
a short temper, courageous disposition and some arrogance when it coincides with the lagna. 


2. Vrisha (Taurus) 


MS: The native with Vrisha lagna suffers from mental illness, humiliation at the hands of 
his own people, separation from friends, contentious, miserable, injured by weapon, suffering 
loss of wealth. 


JA: The one with Vrisha lagna is prominent amongst the learned, wealthy, devoted to preceptors, 


ready for combat, of stable temperament, brave, a sweet talker, at peace with his ambience. 


Note: Vrisha is a fixed sign and grants stability to the native when it coincides with his lagna. 
It is owned by Venus, a benefic and the preceptor of the demons. Unlike what the Maana- 


saagari states, Vrisha is generally a desirable sign to have in the lagna. 


3. Mithuna (Gemini) 


MS: The native with Mithuna lagna is very fair in complexion, attracted to women, tormented 
by the ruler, an ambassador, of a happy disposition, sweet-tongued, benevolent, with beautiful 


hair on his head, adept in singing. 


JA: With Mithuna in the lagna, the native is given to physical pleasures, charitable, blessed 
with many sons and friends, wealthy, good-natured, closely associated with the ruler. 


Note: Mithuna is a sign denoted by a couple. With Mithuna in the lagna, the native indulges 
in physical pleasures. Being the sign of Mercury, it also confers on the native good speech, a 
charitable disposition and a generally benevolent nature. 


12 


4, Karka (Cancer) 


MS: With Karka rising, the native has a fair complexion, a bilious disposition, tendency to 
fulfil the desires of others, courageous, fond of swimming in running water, very intelligent, 


pious, forgiving, religiously inclined and worthy of being served. 


JA: With Karka in the lagna, the native likes sweets; he is devoted to saints, benevolent in 


nature, restless, likes water sports, extracts the essence of things, and is very kind-hearted. 


Note: Karka is a watery sign. It is also a movable sign, hence the restlessness. Movable signs 
also indicate sharp intelligence. Karka is owned by the benefic Moon which transmits it be- 


neficence to the native. 


5. Simha (Leo) 
MS: The Simha-born has a pale complexion, imbalance of bile and wind (Pitta and Vaayu), 


liking for animal as well as juicy foods, with very sharp intellect, brave and courageous, ever 


wandering. 


JA: The Simha-born is blessed with a slim physique, good looks and courage, indulges in 
physical pleasures, has few sons and relatively poor appetite; he does not consider others’ 


intelligence any match to his own. 

Note: Courage and dominance are the characteristics of the one with Simha lagna. The native 
likes animal food and enjoys wandering in the jungles, mountains and wilderness. 

6. Kanya (Virgo) 


MS: Kanya lagna confers a disposition with phlegm and bile, good looks, thoughtfulness, 
progeny with phlegmatic temperament, a dominant wife, cowardice, illusory practices, and a 
body tormented by physical indulgence. 


JA: Kanya lagna confers skill in amorous pursuits, high talent, learning, skill in all activities, 


an ever-pleasant disposition, and lot of wealth. 


Note: Kanya, ruled by Mercury, is the most intellectual sign of the zodiac. Natives with Kanya 


lagna are inclined towards excessive sensual pleasures. 


7. Tula (Libra) 


MS: A native with Tula lagna has phlegmatic disposition, truthfulness, devoted to worthy 


women not his own, honoured by the ruler, engaged in the worship of gods. 


JA: The one with Tula in his lagna is a skillful businessman and earns money through his 
talent. Stable wealth resides in his house and he never suffers wants. He is renowned in his 


family. 


Note: Tula is the sign for the man of business. Being the sign owned by Venus, the native is 


naturally attracted to the opposite sex when this sign is dominant in the horoscope. 


13 


8. Vrishchika (Scorpio) 
MS: The Vrishchika native is easily angered, attains to old age, honoured by the ruler, highly 


talented, fond of listening to scriptures, and ever engaged in destroying his enemies. 


JA: With Vrishchika in the lagna, the native is courageous, knows the essence of things, but 


directs his thoughts in the wrong direction and is contentious. 

Note: Vrishchika is another sign ruled by Mars. This gives strength and courage to the native. 
Vrishchika is also a secretive sign and indicates crevices and hidden places. 

9. Dhanu (Sagittarius) 


MS: The one with Dhanu in the lagna associates with the king. He is adept in all activities, 
devoted to Brahmins and gods, looking after horses, helpful to friends, has thighs like those 


of a horse. 


JA: Dhanu-born is an intellectual, has legal knowledge, determined, of good looks, talented, 


skilled in the use of weapons. 


Note: Dhanu is a warlike sign. The native with Dhanu lagna is firm in his determination, 


religiously inclined and familiar with the use of weapons. 


10. Makara (Capricorn) 


MS: The native having Makara lagna is contented, very sharp, a coward, inclined to sinful 
deeds, suffering from phlegm and wind, very tall, and cheats others. 


JA: Ugly in looks, a cheat, obstinate, very clever, greedy, and blessed with many children is 
the one with Makara lagna. 


Note: This sign, owned by Saturn, in the lagna tends to make one follow one’s own mind 
and ignore the counsel of others. There is a tendency to hoodwink others unless there are 


favourable neutralising factors in the horoscope. 


11. Kumbha (Aquarius) 


MS: The one with Kumbha lagna is stable, afflicted by windy disposition, drinks lots of 
fluids, ready to die for the sake of his friends, fond of company of women, fond of friends 
and people in general. 


JA: The Kumbha-lagna native is restless, sensual, good in looks, fond of his friends, engaged 


in agriculture, and ostentatious. 


Note: The Kumbha lagna natives are good friends. Kumbha is an airy sign, owned by Saturn 
which itself has a windy temperament. There is a proneness on the part of the Kumbha-born 


to suffer from ailments resulting from an imbalance of Vaata. 


12. Meena (Pisces) 


MS: The one with Meena lagna is fond of water, very humble, eager to physically associate with 


women, very learned, short-statured, aggressive, of bilious disposition, and very renowned. 


14 


JA: The native with Meena lagna is very skillful, of small appetite, not given to sexual excesses, 


restless, blessed with jewellery, deceitful and inventor of many things. 


Note: There are some obvious contradictions in the results indicated by the two classics. It 
may be noted that Meena is a spiritual sign and under appropriate planetary influence can 
take one away from physical and sensual pleasures. The reverse is true, however, when there 
is affliction. 


We have very briefly mentioned about the results of different zodiacal signs rising in the 
lagna. These results are subject to numerous modifications under the influence of varied 
planetary associations, aspects, dashas and transits. To be correct in their assessment, all these 


varied modifying factors need to be taken into account. 


Full results in the middle of a sign 


It is not easy to find a native who exactly fits in the qualities of a sign as described in the 
classics. The reason is likely to be available in the text of the sage Parashara. According to 
Parashara, the middle part of a varga gives its full results. The results decline as the ‘sandhi’ 
or junction of two rashis is reached. Figure 2 shows how the typical results of a sign are 
experienced in the middle of it. 


Fig. 2: Typical results in the middle of a sign; decline toward begining or end. 


15 


There is also some indication that there is an overlap of results at the junctions of signs. 
We are told in Prashara or Horary astrology that a movable sign shows mobility, a fixed sign 
shows fixity while a mutable sign shows both mobility and fixity. The first half of a mutable 
sign (closer to a fixed sign) shows fixity as its nature while its second half (closer to a movable 
sign) shows mobility. It is thus possible that each sign shows its typical characteristics in its 
middle, while there is an overlap of its adjacent signs at the junctional regions figure 3. This 
is likely to hold true in all vargas.

The Navamsha 


he navamsha is supposed to be the most significant of the divisional charts (except of 


course the Shashtyamsha). It is said that the planet gives the results of the navamsha in 


preference to those of the rashi chart in case there is a discrepancy. The promise shown in 


the rashi chart needs to be confirmed in the navamsha (and other vargas as well) if an event 


has to happen. The following factors pertaining to the navamsha may deserve attention:

Navamsha must be used for everything that the rashi chart is used for. 
It confirms or refutes the indications of the rashi chart. 


Vargottama navamsha, i.e., same sign in the rashi chart as well as the navamsha chart, 
in case of the lagna or any of the grahas has special significance. A vargottama planet is 
particularly strong. Vargottama planets raise the status of the individual. 


Pushkara navamsha is a special navamsha which is equivalent to a vargottama navamsha. 
When more planets occupy the vargottama or Pushkara navamshas, it elevates the status 


of the individual. 


. The navamsha sign of the Atma Karaka is known as the Karkamsha lagna. It gives specific 


clues to the analysis of a chart. 


Navamsha-Tulya Rashi: The houses in the rashi chart wherein the navamsha lagna and 
the planets according to their navamsha rashi positions would fall give us the Navamsha- 


Tulya rashis of the lagna and the planets. This has important bearing on prediction. 


Navamsha is used. specifically in the determination of Amshayu (Navamshayu), a standard 
method of calculation of longevity. 


It has its special utility in the areas of marriage, relationships, and all that is concerned 


with these aspects of life. 


A special ominous navamsha is the sixty-fourth navamsha. This is the navamsha that falls 
exactly in the eighth house from the natal Moon. Some people consider the sixty-fourth 


navamsha also from the lagna as well as the Sun. 


Results of the Karkamsha 


Atma Karaka (AK) is that planet which is the farthest advanced in degrees in any sign. It is 


17 


a highly significant planet and its location especially in the navamsha is of paramount 
importance. The sign in which the AK is placed in the navamsha is known as the Karka- 
msha. Considering the Karkamsha in the navamsha chart as the lagna, with the remaining 
planets in their usual navamsha position, gives us the Karkamsha chart. Analysis of the 
Navamsha chart from the Karkamsha lagna (ignoring the actual navamsha lagna) gives 


interesting results. 


Karkamsha in different rashis 


Karkamsha coinciding with different rashis gives the results as follows: 


Mesha : Trouble from rats and cats; worse if there is malefic aspect. 

Vrisha : Comfort (benefit!) from quadrupeds (cattle). 

Mithuna : Skin disease, itching. 

Karka : Fear of water. 

Simha : Fear from wild animals. 

Kanya : Skin disease, obesity, fear of fire. 

Tula : A trader; one who deals in garments. 

Vrishchika : Fear from serpents; pain in mother’s breast. 

Dhanu : Fall from a height. 

Makara : Benefit from watery animals (fish, etc.) and birds. 

Kumbha : One who engages himself in the construction of water reservoirs, ponds, 
wells. 

Meena : Salvation. 


Different planets in Karkamsha 


Here are the results of the different planets when they become AK or occupy the Karkamsha 
lagna (along with the AK). 


Sun : The Sun in Karkamsha ensures for the native a high status in the service 


of the ruler. 


Moon : Learned; enjoys life. Aspect of Venus on this Moon increases the extent of 


wisdom and enjoyment. 


Mars : One who carries a weapon; earning from fire-related pursuits; knowledge 


of liquids (chemicals). 


Mercury : Adept in sculpting. 
Jupiter : Engaged in noble deeds; scholarly. 
Venus : Long-lived, sensuous, serves the ruler. 


18 


Saturn : Engaged in activities appropriate to his status. 


Rahu : A thief; carries weapons; makes implements of iron; versed with the use 
of poisons. 

Ketu : Dealing with elephants: a thief. 

Gulika : Gulika in Karkamsha lagna aspected by the Moon causes loss of money 


through theft, or the native is a thief himself. 


Pushkara Navamsha 


The following navamsha in the different rashis are considered as Pushkara navamsha 


(figure 4): 


Pushkara navamsha 


19 


Signs Navamsha 


1. Mesha, Simha, Dhanu - 7th, 9th 
2.  Vrisha, Kanya, Makara - 3rd, 5th 
3. Mithuna, Tula, Kumbha - 6th, 8th 
4, Karka, Vrishchika, Meena — Ist, 3rd 


Planets in Pushkara navamshas give good results. The more the number of planets in Push- 
kara navamsha, the higher the status of the native. In a way, planets in Pushkara navamshas 


give results equivalent to vargottama planets. 


Rashi-Tulya Navamsha 
The following is the applicability of this principle. 


¢ Superimpose the navamsha positions of planets on the rashi chart. 

¢ Retain the rashi chart lagna. 

* See the houses in the rashi chart that the planets from navamsha occupy. 

¢ Prosperity and happiness if planets populate the good houses of rashi chart. 
¢ Suffering and misery if adverse houses are inhabited. 


When more planets in the navamsha chart coincide rashi-wise with favourable houses (ken- 
dras, trikonas, eleventh house, second house) of the natal chart, good results are produced. 


Status of planets in navamsha 


The planets give their results according to their status in the navamsha, in preference to their 
status in the rashi chart in case of any discrepancy. If a strong planet in the rashi chart gets 
debilitated in the navamsha, its dasha proves adverse. Similarly, if on the other hand, a weak 
planets gains strength in the navamsha, it yields good results. The rashi chart is ‘apparent 
the navamsha ‘real’. 


Chart-1 belongs to a female native, born on November 28, 1962, at 1:0 hours IST, at 30°N22', 
76°E46'. The Sun as the lagna lord occupies the fourth house, in a friendly sign. This Sun 
gets debilitated as the tenth lord in the twelfth in the navamsha chart. The native got a seri- 
ous setback in her professional work with the onset of the Sun dasha (from April 6, 2005 
onwards). The Sun is debilitated in the Dashamsha too.

Dashamamsha 


he Dashamsha chart is the tenth house magnified. It appears to us that this varga has not 
been given enough importance by Parashara. It is likely that the profession or Karma was 
decided in the days of Parashara primarily according to the lineage of the individual. So not 
enough stress was required to be given on this aspect. In the world of today, the Dashamsha 
seems to have attained quite a significance so that, and it is our considered opinion, this chart 


must be studied in all cases along with the rashi and the navamsha charts. 


Ruling deities of the Dashamshas 


The ruling deities of the Dashamamshas as mentioned by Parashara appear quite appropri- 
ate to a native’s inclinations and may even be used in chart rectification. These ruling deities 
starting from Indra and ending at Ananta rule the ten Dashamshas when the lagna is odd. 
When the lagna falls in an even sign, the ruling order is reversed (staring from Ananta and 
ending at Indra). The implied meaning of these deities are given in the accompanying table 
(next page). 


Navamsha and Dashamsha 


As hinted above, it is worth while to study both the Navamsha and the Dashamamsha together, 
along with the rashi chart. In the chart discussed above, the Sun is debilitated both in the 
Navamsha chart as well as the Dashamsha chart. The dasha of the Sun gave her a setback in 
her profession. In the Dashamsha, a debilitated Sun aspects the lagna. 


Jupiter’s aspect on the luminaries 


Jupiter’s aspect on both the Sun and the Moon, either in the Navamsha or in the Dashamsha 
chart or in both, has a special significance. Natives who are fortunate enough to have this in 
their charts tend to rise high in their field of work, earn renown and serve as examples for 


posterity. 


In chart-2 (Bill Gates; October 28, 1955, at 21:05 hours at Seattle, 47°N36'23", 
122°W19'51", USA), Jupiter aspects (or associates with!) both the luminaries, in both the 
Navamsha and the Dashamsha charts.

The Hora 


he classical Hora chart considers the position of planets in only two signs, Karka 

and Simha, the signs of the two luminaries. In case of Chart 2 (Bill Gates) discussed 
above, the Hora chart (Chart 3) would show that there is a predominance of masculine 
planets in the Sun’s Hora and that of feminine planets in the Moon’s Hora. This is con- 
sidered to be desirable. 


The alternate Hora chart appears to be more balanced. The fourth and ninth lords oc- 
cupy their own houses. The lagna lord, debilitated with a cancellation of debilitation, in 
the seventh associates with the third (and eighth) lord to aspect the lagna and to highlight 
the courage and effort involved in the rise of the native. The ninth (and the second) lord 
associates with the fifth (and the sixth) lord in the ninth house forming a potent yoga for 
wealth. Saturn also aspects the eleventh lord Moon in the sixth house, one more indication 
for enough effort involved in the process of acquiring wealth.

Another important point which is significant here is that the Sun as the twelfth lord is 
exalted in the eight house and aspected by a strong Jupiter from the fourth house. This 
explains the millions that the native has spent on charities the world over.

An Overview of the Trimshamsha 


Trimshamsha or ‘one-thirtieth’ of a rashi 


Literally, a Trimshamsha means one-thirtieth of a rashi. However, actually it involves the divi- 
sion of a rashi (or 30 degrees) in five unequal parts. Each of these five Trimshamshas in any 
rashi belongs to a specific planet, from Mars to Saturn. The Trimshamsha stands in contrast 
with the Hora. Where as only the Sun and the Moon own the Horas, these two luminaries do 
not own any Trimshamsha. In odd rashis, the five Trimshamshas are owned by Mars, Saturn, 
Jupiter, Mercury and Venus in this order, and the span of these five Trimshamshas is 5°, 5°, 
8°, 7° and 5° respectively. In case of an even rashi, the ownership is reversed so that the five 
Trimshamshas are ruled by Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, in this order. The span 
of these Trimshamshas is accordingly reversed, and is 5°, 7°, 8°, 5° and 5° respectively. 


The Trimshamsha chart is used to decipher the miseries that a native is destined to suffer. 
This chart contrasts with the Hora in that, whereas the Hora has only the luminaries as the 
rulers, in case of the Trimshamsha the luminaries do not figure at all. The Trimshamsha finds 
special use in medical astrology. Traditionally, the Trimshamsha has also been employed to 
make judgement of female horoscopes. The stress is usually laid on the decipherment of the 
character of women through this particular varga chart. It may, however, be used with equal 


relevance to the charts of male natives. 


We shall briefly deal with the Trimshamsha as far as it pertains to the natal lagna, primarily 
as described by Parashara. According to the sage, the results to be described hereunder apply 
to the lagna or the Moon, whichever is stronger. The stronger of the lagna and the Moon, 
in any sign, could fall in the Trimshamsha of any of the five planets (from Mars to Saturn), 


and on this the results would depend. 


1. Lagna/Moon in a sign of Mars 


When the stronger of the lagna and the Moon occupies a rashi owned by Mars (Mesha/Vr- 
ishchika), and falls in the Trimshamsha of Mars, the girl born is wicked and associates with 
other men even when young. In the Trimshamsha of Venus, she tends to develop extramarital 
relations. She is an illusionist if the Trimshamsha is that of Mercury, servile if that of Saturn, 
and chaste if that of Jupiter. 


27 


2. Lagna/Moon in a sign of Mercury 


When the stronger of the lagna and the Moon occupies a sign of Mercury, i.e., Mithuna or 
Kanya, the results of different Trimshamshas are thus: in a Trimshamsha of Mars, deceitful; 
in a Trimshamsha of Venus, sensual; in that of Mercury, blessed with many qualities; in the 


one of Saturn, infertile; and in that of Jupiter, saintly. 


3. Lagna/Moon in a sign of Venus 


When the stronger of the lagna and the Moon occupies a rashi owned by Venus, i.e., Vrisha 
or Tula, the results of different Trimshamshas are as follows: Trimshamsha of Mars, immoral; 
Trimshamsha of Venus, virtuous; Trimshamsha of Mercury, highly skilled; Trimshamsha of 


Saturn, undergoes remarriage; and Trimshamsha of Jupiter, virtuous. 


4, Lagna/Moon in the sign of the Moon 


Karka is the sign owned by the Moon. The placement of the stronger of the lagna and the 
Moon in Karka, in a Trimshamsha of Mars, makes the lady self-willed. In a Trimshamsha 
of Venus, she is immoral; in that of Mercury, she is versed in sculpting; in that of Saturn, a 


killer of her husband; and in that of Jupiter, blessed with many virtues. 


5. Lagna/Moon in the sign of the Sun 


Simha is owned by the Sun. The placement of the stronger of the lagna and the Moon in 
Simha, in a Trimshamsha of Mars, makes the female native an excessive talker, while in a 
Trimshamsha of Venus she is chaste. In the Trimshamsha of Mercury, she has a masculine 
appearance; in that of Saturn, fallen; and in that of Jupiter, chaste. 


6. Lagna/Moon in a sign of Jupiter 


Jupiter owns Dhanu and Meena. With the stronger of the lagna and the Moon occupying a 
sign of Jupiter, the Trimshamsha of Mars confers on the native numerous virtues. When the 
Trimshamsha is that of Venus, she is unchaste. In a Trimshamsha of Mercury, she is learned. 
When the lagna or the Moon falls in a Trimshamsha of Saturn, she is disinterested in sexual 


union; and when in a Trimshamsha of Jupiter, she is virtuous. 


7. Lagna/Moon in a sign of Saturn 


When the stronger of the lagna and the Moon falls in a sign of Saturn, i.e., Makara or 
Kumbha, and its Trimshamsha lord is Mars, the native is servile. She is learned when the 
Trimshamsha belongs to Venus, and a sinner who sexually associates with wicked individuals 
when it belongs to Mercury. When the Trimshamsha happens to be owned by Saturn, she 


associates with a wicked individuals; and when it is owned by Jupiter, she is chaste. 


Comments: It will be seen that the classic of Parashara mainly concentrates on the character of 
women when dealing with the Trimshamsha chart. As we have pointed out earlier, the same 
principles can be extended to the charts of men. It will also be noted that Trimshamshas of 


Jupiter generally confer virtue and chastity on the native. Mutual interactions of Mars and 


28 


Venus in Trimshamsha enhance the sexuality of a native which may not be as much of a sin 
in the modern world bathed in the western culture as it was in those ancient times of Para- 


shara. The readers may derive their own conclusions about these aspects. 


The results of the lagna and the Moon occupying different signs and falling in the various 
Trimshamshas may be tabulated below (Table 1).

The Shashtyamsha 


he Shashtyamsha is the most important of the Varga charts. However, its utility gets lim- 

ited by the necessity of a very accurate recording of the birth time. The sages have given 
specific nomenclature to the sixty Shashtyamshas as described below. This material is not in 
the available editions of the Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, the classic on Vedic astrology, and 
certainly not there available to the English knowing astrologer. The information given below 
has been kindly provided by Dr Suresh Chandra Mishra who discovered it in the old hand 
written version of the BPHS lying amongst the astrological notes of his father. 


Key Words for the Shashtis 


The Shashtyamsha gives important clues about the nature of an individual and about his 
profession. It can be used for finer rectification of the birth time. We give below the names

useful to the student of astrology.

If must be noted that the meanings of the various key words as given above are the implied, 


and not the literal, meanings. The readers may be able to expand these further. 


Method of Counting 


Counting may progress in a direct manner or in a reverse manner, without consideration of 
the rashi falling in the lagna. Sage Parashara mentions the words ‘Krama’ and “Vyutkrama’ to 
indicate the counting in the direct as well as the indirect manner. The relevant line of the 


shloka is: 
waIcrdvda aie: weyag a 
That is: Consider the keyword in the Shashti in the direct as well as the 


reverse order. 


This would give us two chocies in each case, one from the direct manner and the other 
from the reverse manner. One of these would be the most appropriate for the native. Some 
guidance may be taken from the planetary disposition in the natal chart to match the actual 


Shashti.

Tables for the Shashtamsha (one-sixth division) and Ashtamamsha (one-eighth division) 
are being appended here just for the sake of completion. They are not from Parashara and 
find their use in the Tajika system only. Some people use them in medical astrology. More 


research is needed before we can recommend them for such use.
