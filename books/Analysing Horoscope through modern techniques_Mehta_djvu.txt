About The Book 


It has been my experience as teacher of Astrology in Bhartiya 
Vidya Bhawan that students find it difficult to comprehend various 
rules of astrology and fail miserably in giving correct predictions. 
As aresult they get frustrated and discouraged. 

Moreover, most of the books on astrology available in the 
market, and some of these are good books, have not been able to 
keep pace with fast changes taking place in the world. For example 
dozens of new professions and branches of science have opened 
up, but there is hardly any reference about this in major books. In 
Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan under guidance of KN Rao lot of serious 
researches are going on in various topics of astrology. This book 
has taken this into considerations and has published the latest tech- 
niques and results of these researches. 

This book has specially been written taking into considerations 
needs of students to comprehend astrology and be able to give 
correct predictions in shortest possible time. I have made a step by 
step approach to explain intricacies of astrology. I am sure students 
will find this book rewarding. 

There are new articles hitherto unpublished on mundane as- 
trology. The book contains rules for foreign travel, owning houses 
and assessment of intelligence and wealth, career counseling and 
pitfalls in marriages etc. and above all how to assess the personal- 
ity and character. The book has been result of years of hard work 
and research. I was much encouraged to write this book after the 
success of my two earlier books on astrology, "Planets and Travel 
Abroad" and "Ashtak Varga - its concept and Application" which 
have gone into second edition. 

Any comments and remarks for improvement of the book will 
be gratefully accepted.

Preface to the Third Edition 


It is very heartening to know that the first two editions of 
the book were well received and sold out in record time. Numerous 
letters of appreciation received by the author have vindicated 
K.N. Rao's comments in the foreword of the first edition that this is 
easily the best book in the market on the subject. 


This has encouraged me to revise the new edition and add 
new chapters on Yogni Dasha and Mundane astrology. The chapter 
on Vimshotari Dasha has been thoroughly revised and rewritten in 
the light of new researches of K.N. Rao. The chapter on Yogas 
has also been thoroughly revised and chapter on marriage has been 
revised in the light of new researches. 


I am sure that the students of astrology will find this book a 
great asset which will improve their predictive ability to a very great 
extent.

Foreword 


The most notable feature throughout of this book by 
Shri M.S. Mehta is the interweaving of yogas, the examination of 
their strength and the dasha as a useful and effective predictive 
tool for astrologers. 


Eighty or more years ago, when books on the predictive 
techniques of Hindu astrology were written such interweaving was 
always missing. Even in the best of well-structured books which 
have come out in the recent decades, there is lot of vagueness and 
unsynthesised approach inspite of impressive compilation. 


A book that should come out now with so many people knowing 
astrology has to be an advanced one, combining three features: 
yogas, dashas and transits of planet to show why what has happened 
or is happening had to happen. It is not an easy task even if the 
scheme of the book is to cover all the twelve houses of a horoscope 
and show it. But the success of Shri Mehta is very commendable 
and comes out as its most striking feature. 


All this became possible because for years now Shri Mehta 
has been studying, writing and teaching scores of students as a 
result of which his insightful understanding stands out in this book. 


This is easily the best book on the predictive techniques of a 
horoscope with a balanced approach to the judgement of each house. 
Yet, one must remember, learning through books has its own 
advantages and limitations. All such learning must be supplemented 
through personal experience to appreciate and depth of the superb 
techniques of Hindu astrology.

Acknowledgment 


This book would not have been possible but for the guidance 
and encouragement of Shri K.N. Rao who is not only a great teacher 
but is also a great philosopher and saint. He has been the guiding 
light of hundreds of students whom he initiated into astrology and 
showed them the light of Jyoti, the real meaning of Jyotish. This 
light has been burnt will ever be the guiding star of life of hundreds. 
With his own humble way of living, dedicated teaching and preaching 
of astrology, Rao has not only become a legend but has set an 
example in the great traditions of our gurus and Mahatmas which is 
the real contribution of India to the world. 


Mr. Rao who is author of twenty-nine books of astrology is 
the editor and founder of Journal of Astrology, a prestigious magazine 
devoted to research and has written hundreds of articles which 
have been published all over the world. He has rediscovered the 
ancient truths hidden in our classics and many of his rules like that 
of double transit of transit of Saturn and Jupiter have become law 
and are quoted by the savants of Astrology. His predictions about 
the chaos and devastation taking all around us in the present day 
world which is the result of "entry of Rahu/Saturn in Rohini,‚Äù have 
become classical examples of the truth and veracity of Astrology. 
The communal riots in Gujarat have come no surprise to the persons 
who have read his earlier predictions given years in advance. The 
failure of Monsoon this year inspite of the earlier claims of India 
Meteorological department that rains would be normal in 2002, are 
testimony to the truths of great science of astrology and the 
predictions about which was given by Rao in classes and in articles 
much in advance. He is the founder of School of Astrology in 
Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan which to-day has over a thousand students 
has become the largest school of Astrology in the world. I have 
made full use ofhis researches and have quoted liberally from his 
books and articles in my book to make astrology instructive and 
inspiring. 


Above all his most important contribution is kindling of the 
light, the showing of Path on which to tread to achieve happiness 
and eternal bliss. That has been his major contribution for which 
we are indebted to him and in all my humility I dedicate this book to 
him, if some of the students and I am sure there would be many, 
are benefited by this book and find the inner meaning of Astrology, 
I would be amply rewarded. 


I am also thankful to Narinder Sagar and his son Saurab who 
have given me all the cooperation in publishing this book.

Introduction 


How to Read a Horoscope ? 
(important Factors) 


To be able to give predictions accurately one has to be familiar 
with the rules and also have faith in astrology, one‚Äôs Guru and God. 
The mere surrender to Divine and belief in religion and spiritual 
values will increase the predictive ability. 

Judgement of a horoscope needs great skill. Years of teaching 
experience has shown us that beginners get frustrated quickly as 
the predictions do not follow mathematical rules as a result even 
after studying astrology for years they are still confused as to the 
significance of first lord in the third house or role of Sun in the fifth 
house etc. The predictions have all the tendency to go wrong. The 
students get discouraged quickly and they start losing interest in 
this divine and spiritual subject. It is not only the students who get 
frustrated but the astrology also gets discredited in the process. 

Keeping in view these difficulties we have devised a course 
of lessons aimed at making a person conversant with the art of 
reading horoscope in an easy and concise way in the shortest 
possible time. 

Following important steps should be taken before starting 
delineating the horoscope. 

Step 1. To study the horoscope you must have following three 
charts: 

a. Birth Chart or Rasi Chart: This is also known as main 
horoscope or Janam Kundali. 

b. Chart treating Moon as the Lagna: This is important, as 
according to Maharishi Parasara horoscope should be studied 
not only from the ascendant but also from Moon treating it as 
Lagna. This has been made clear in Shloka 11 chapter 14 
of Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra. For example if we have 
to judge wealth, we should study second house from the birth 
chart as also second from Moon. If the result 
is positive from both Lagna and Moon; there is going to be 


Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


plenty of wealth. If the second house from Lagna shows 
wealth but second from Moon does not give a good picture 
then wealth will be moderate and so on. In still getting 
greater accuracy we should treat Sun as Lagna also. 
Navamsa and Relevant Varga Charts: Navamsa is an 
important divisional chart. No prediction should be made 
without consulting this. Its utility and other related matters 
have been discussed in a separate lesson on Vargas or 
divisional charts. 

General Rule: Planet favourable in Rasi but weak in 
Navamsa, either debilitated or in enemy house or in 
evil houses minimize good effects of Rasi. If planets 
improve in Vargas they give good results in Rasi chart. 
If planet is strong both in Rasi and Navamsa it is fully- 
capable of giving excellent results. 


d. Chart of the Dasha Scheme: It is no use giving prediction 


Step 2. 


unless you have the Dasha scheme before you. A 
horoscope may have all the Raj Yogas but if the proper 
Dasha does not come good Yogas rarely give fruit 
Another important principle is to treat Dasha lord as Lagna 
and evaluate other houses accordingly. For example second 
house from the Dasha lord will represent wealth, third 
brothers, fourth property and so on. This is important 
principle as given in Phala Deepika. 

General Assessment of the Horoscope - Signs Rising: 
You must feel the horoscope and the horoscope should be 
ready to tell its own story. See how many planets are exalted 
or aspecting their own houses. These houses are 
strengthened and give the full results of their signification. 
In this you should concentrate on the sign rising and the sign 
in which Moon is located. All Rasis have their own 
characteristics and have their story to tell. For example Virgo 
is an intellectual sign but not so strong to resist diseases. A 
person with Virgo rising will lie down in the bed on even 
slight indications of bad cold, whereas a person with Aries 
sign rising will be still active and moving around even when 
he is running temperature of 100 degrees. Maladies of 


Step-3. 


Introduction 3 


ordinary nature do not bother him. He has tremendous 
stamina to resist these. A separate chapter has been 
devoted to signs rising and their results. This can be seen 
in the separate volume of this book. "Astrology - Basic- 
Facts". These should be memorized. 

Ascertain the placement of the planets, and in which 
types of Rasis they are placed If majority of planets are 
in movable or char Rasis, the person is fond of travelling, 
his ideas change and in course of time he travels a lot. If 
majority of planets are in fixed or Sthir Rasis person is of 
conservative ideas and is of fixed habits. He normally stays 
at one place and is good at making factories and works at 
a regular and constant place. Majority of planets in dual or 
Dwishbhava Rasis give result in between. The person 
are sometimes here and sometimes there. They do not 
have fixed ideas which are liable to change. Again check 
placement of planets in different type of Rasis. If majority 
of planets are in fiery Rasis the person has great initiative, 
his ideas arc high and he aims to achieve great things in 
life. Majority of planets in earthy sign make one practical 
and industrious, in airy signs intelligent and fond of reading 
and in watery signs emotional, receptive, intelligent and of 
unstable mind. 

Planets in Kendras or Trikonas: 


Check the position of planets. The best place for benefits 
is Kendras and Trikonas. Here the planets become very 
strong. And strong benefits are necessary to give you 
maximum comforts in life. Ifthe planets are in Kendras 
and are in their own signs they give rise to Mahapurush 
Yogas of prosperity. 

The malefics in Kendras unless they are exalted or in their 
own houses become strong to give trouble in life. For 
example malefics in the fourth house will destroy peace of 
mind, are not good for accumulating property as also are 
bad for mother. Similarly malefics in the 7th house will 
destroy married life. 

The best place for malefics are 3, 6 and 11 houses (not 


4 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


their lordship, which makes them evil). They are extremely 
good here. 

d. A horoscope in which benefics are in Kendras and malefics 
are in 3, 6 and 11 is considered to be a strong horoscope 
and generally person rises very high in life. 

Step 4. Raj Yogas Present in the horoscope. 

After this, have a look at the placement of planets and the type of 
Yogas these are forming. The more Raj Yogas in the horoscope, 
the greater the prosperity and rise in life. Because of the importance 
of the subject a separate chapter has been devoted to Yogas. It has 
been our observation that the combination of Kendra and Trikona 
lords form the most powerful Raj Yoga. Without these Yogas it is 
not possible to achieve high status in life. 

Step 5. Strong and Weak Planets 

Astrology is nothing else but deciphering the results of strong and 
weak planets. A strong Sun gives a high status in life, makes one a 
leader, gives fame, wealth and prosperity, whereas a weak Sun 
give all type of problems including loss of reputation and wealth, 
struggle and strife. A strong Mars makes you fearless, takes you to 
the top of profession, and gives land and property, whereas weak 
Mars gives accidents, quarrels, various diseases, violent murders 
and massacres. 

Signification of each and every planet should be clearly 
understood and committed to memory. We have dealt with this 
subject exhaustively in a separate chapter. 

Broadly speaking the signification of each planet is given 
below, but before that we must know when is the planet strong and 
when it is weak. Because these will give diametrically opposite 
results. 

The, exact strength of a planet can be known through working 
of Shad-Balas and use of Ashtak Vargas. However, where it is not 
available or where the time is short the following thumb rules should 
be applied for strong and weak planets respectively. 

Strong Planet 
A Planet is Strong if it is; 

a. exalted 

b. is in its Mooltrikona sign/own house, in friend's Rasi. 

c. is conjunct with or aspected by benefics.

details in chapter on Vargas.) 
it is not debilitated, combust, or in the first or last 5 degrees 
of a Rasi. 
it is not in Mrityu Bhaga. 
According to Parasara the last 6¬∞ ofan odd Rasi or 
first 6¬∞ ofan even Rasi deteriorates the strength ofa 
planet to do good. Here planets are known to be in Mrityu 
Bhaga. 
in Ashtak Varga it is associated with more than 4 benefic 
points. 
it is not in 6th, 8th or 12th house. 
Important: Good place for benefics is Kendra and Trikonas 
and for malefics are 3rd, 6th and 11th houses.

A strong and well-placed planet leaves his imprint on the character 
of the person. In this regard primary credit goes to Lagna lord/ 
planet placed in Lagna, 10" lord or planet placed in 10‚Äù. 


Sun 

Strong Sun gives qualities of leadership, kindness; generosity makes 
one free from disease, gives energy and wealth. It gives nobility of 
mind, loyalty, truthfulness, fearlessness, glory, success and victory. 
According to Phala Deepika, Sun gives fame courage and 
magnetism. A good Sun not owning 6, 8 or 12 and owning a Kendra 
or Trikona placed in 1* is a great source of strength. In the natural 
zodiac it is lord of auspicious fifth house, which represents Purva 
Punya, Karmas of the past life. A strong Sun is a great factor for 
success in life. 

Weak Sun makes one egotist, fond of flattery, gives false pride, 
vain glorious, and fond of exaggeration. 


Moon 

Moon makes one kind humane, sympathetic extremely generous, 
emotional, fond of travel, romantic, imaginative and exposed to public 
life. They fall in love for the sake of love, without self-seeking. 
That is why they make good writers. It is Karka for mind and gives 
mental strength and prosperity. 

Weak Moon makes one unstable, unreliable, shifty wandering, moody, 
without any aim. 


Mars 

Strong Mars gives courage, initiative, daring warmth of feeling and 
truthfulness. Person with strong Mars especially in Lagna or on 
Moon sign know no fear. Gandhiji was born with Chitra rising, Lagna 
lord in Lagna with Mars. He had great energy and moral strength, 
which cannot make him defeated. (See Horoscope of Mahatma 
Gandhi P-27) Weak Mars tends to encourage quarrels and strife, 
violence destruction, and proneness to accidents. It makes one 
lawless, licentious and thief, ready to commit rape and murder. 


Introduction 


Mercury 

Strong Mercury makes one intelligent, humorous and quick-witted. 
It gives new knowledge, honours in sports and profits in business. 
With Venus it gives talent for music. 

Weak Mercury makes one nervous especially with Rahu, shifty, 
gives mental derangement and skin trouble. 

Jupiter 

Strong Jupiter makes one cheerful, hopeful generous, just incapable 
of lasting resentment, disposed to grandiose schemes, social, easy 
going and sympathetic with magnetic personality. Gives eminence 
in every thing. Grants wisdom and Sadgati. According to Jatak 
Parijat, Jupiter in the 4‚Ñ¢ gives Sukhmeva (only happiness). 
Jupiter is Karka for Dharma, religion, compassion, spiritualism, inner 
Gyan, truthfulness and righteousness, if well placed in the horoscope 
is gift from God. Placed in Lagna, where it gets directional strength 
and aspects, 5 and 9* houses, the houses of Purva Punya and 
good fortune, it washes away hundreds of sins. According to Brihat 
Parasara Hora Shastra Jupiter in Kendra is a great protector. 

Ill placed and weak Jupiter leads to exaggeration, extravagance, 
high living and bragging. In the first house it makes one self indulgent, 
fond of food and makes one corpulent. 

Venus 

Venus makes one elegant, artistic, refined, cultured and social. He 
appreciates the things of beauty which is joy forever. Strong Venus 
makes one handsome, gives sex appeal and personal magnetism 
and makes one interested in music, art, dance and fine arts. 
Weak and afflicted, makes one pervert, unclean and disorderly. It 
spoils happy married life and causes delays in marriage. 

Saturn 

Saturn makes one philosopher and melancholy. Thrifty, careful 
cautions and slow. Patient and enduring, steadfast in devotion. has 
strong likes and dislikes. Copies foreign customs. 

Afflicted and weak Saturn makes one mean, morbid and cruel. 
Extremely selfish, unfortunate and neglected. 

Step 6. Role of Dusthan Houses 

According to Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra 6, 8, and 12 houses are 
Dusthanas or Trika houses. These houses are evil with a negative 


12 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


role and have adverse implications for the chart. 
The 6th house even though is an 'Upachaya‚Äô' house is the house of 
debt, diseases and enemies. 
Eighth house is the house of death, accidents, chronic diseases, 
thefts, suffering, humiliation and obstacles. 
The twelfth house relates to expenditure, destruction, loss and 
downfall. 
Not only these houses are evil but lords of these also have propensity 
to do evil. Malefics in these houses cause untold misery and are 
weaknesses of the chart. 
Signification of a Bhava suffers if its lord is in 6, 8 or 12. Similarly 
lords of 6, 8 and 12" destroy the signification of house with which 
they combine or associate. For example if Lagna lord is in 6, 8 and 
12 and is afflicted with the conjunction or aspect of malefics, health 
would suffer. Similarly placement of lord of two i.e., lord of wealth 
in 8th, 6th or 12this not auspicious and good for wealth. Same will 
be the result if lords of 6, 8, or 12 are in Lagna or 2nd house or for 
that matter in any house. This applies to all the houses. 
Note: No Bhava should be treated as bad because 
all Bhavas are part of a divine scheme and have a 
certain function to perform. Sixth Bhava is good 
to achieve victory, eighth Bhava is important part 
of Moksha _ triangle and is good for awakening 
kundalini, and is also necessary for deep 
researches. Twelfth Bhava is essential for achieving 
Moksha or salvation. 
Step 7. Nakshatras 


Nakshatras have an important role to play in prediction. Memorize 
the placement of Nakshatras in each Rasi. We have a separate 
chapter on Nakshtras giving an easy rule to memorize them, their 
lord etc. Generally if the planets are in the Nakshtras of benefic 
planets or in their own Nakshatra they get strengthened. 
Nakshatras are important otherwise also. Bharni Nakshatra is not 
considered auspicious. Bajpai - Musharaff talks were held in Agra 
during last visit of Pakistan's President of India. These talks were 
held under Bharni Nakshatra and hence were doomed to failure. 
Again K.N. Rao's world famous predictions that entry of Saturn in 


Introduction 13 


Rohini Nakshatra leads to war and world wide calamities has come 
truemany times. When Saturn was in Rohini Nakshatra World Trade 
Center in USA was given a devastating blow by the terrorists on 
11th September 2001. And rest of the events, war in Afghanistan, 
overthrow of Taliban regime, bankruptcy of Argentina, famines, 
fires and floods in various parts of the world, Indo Pakistan border 
clashes etc. are testimony to the truths contained in classical books 
and vindication of Hindu astrology. 

Step 8. Dasha Scheme 

The Dasha scheme allotted at birth is result of one's Karma. If one 
gets good Dasha like Dasha of benefic planets, of Lagna lord or 
lord of nine in the beginning of life, one has initial advantage. The 
education is good and as a result the prospects for a good job 
increases. 

In this connection Dasha of the 5th lord should be watched as Sth 
house represents Karmas of previous life. If this lord is afflicted 
and this Dasha comes in life, this could be a troublesome period as 
the bad Karmas of previous life are going to bear their fruit. 

The best Dasha of life are Dasha of an exalted planet, Dasha of 
tenth lord and Lagna lord. 

JL Nehru the famous late Prime Minister of India got the right 
Dasha at the right time. He got Dasha of unafflicted Moon, his 
Lagna lord in 1948 and later that of strong 10th lord Mars, who is 
aspecting its own 10th house. He was catapulted to the post of 
India's first Prime Minister in August 1947 and to glory and fame 
bypassing the claims of Sardar Patel. His tenth house was very 
strong being aspected by its own lord and three benefics Jupiter, 
Mercury and Venus. 

Step 9. Combination of Good Houses with Evil Houses 
Please remember that there are two types of houses in the horoscope 
Group I 

Houses 1, 4, 7 and 10 (Kendra Houses), 5th and 9th (Trikona 
Houses), 2nd (house of wealth) and 11th (house of gain). 

Group I 

Houses 3rd, 6th, 8th and 12th 

The combination of houses in type 1 with each other give good 
results like wealth etc. and are called Dhana Yogas. For example 


14 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


combination of 1 st lord with 4th or 7th lord or with 5th or 9th lord 
with 2nd and 11 th lords are considered good and are wealth giving 
combinations. Similarly, combination of 5th lord with 4 or 2 or 11 is 
good. 
In the same way combination of any of the lord of 3, 6,8 or 12 with 
any lord in group II is good and gives wealth. This also constitute 
Vipreet Raj Yoga e.g. combination of 3rd lord with 6th or 8th or 
12thlord/house is good. 
But combination of any of the lords in group 1 with any of the lord 
in group 2 gives evil results. Similarly combination of any of the 
lords in group 2 with any lord in group 1 leads to evil and is called 
‚ÄòDaridra‚Äô or poverty giving Yoga. 
Step 10. Planets in their own houses or aspecting their own 
houses do good : 
According to Phala Deepika houses associated or aspected by their 
own lords or benefics or planets owning auspicious houses produce 
good results provided they are not associated or aspected by 
malefics. These good effects will be insured even when the planets 
are debilitated or combust. Supposing Saturn is posited in the eighth 
house in its own Rasi Capricorn then even though Saturn is a natural 
malefic planet and has the tendency to spoil all the houses where it 
is located, but since in this particular case it is in its own house it will 
give all the good results of the eighth house. It will bestow native 
with long life, give sudden gains and inheritance and protect him 
from diseases and accident. But since this Saturn is also lord of 
nine, it as lord of nine in eight will spoil the signification of 9" house, 
for example he will not be so luckly, there will be obstacle on the 
road to success, it might cause problems for father during its Dasha 
etc. Now take another case for Virgo Lagna here Saturn is lord of 
five and six, a good house and a bad one. Supposing it is posited in 
the fifth house then even though it is malefic but just because it is in 
its own house it will give all the benefits pertaining to this house like 
native will have good children, he will be well educated, will be 
lucky in lottery, romances etc., but since it is also lord of six, there 
will be some hindrances and obstacles, education will be there but 
not so high; children will be born but not many and so on. 
Step 11. Ownership of Good and Bad houses 
If a planet is lord of both a good house and a bad one then for the 


Introduction 15 


assessment of his overall effects see in which house its Mooltrikona 
sign is located. If it is located in a good house overall effects will be 
good. For example in Gemini Lagna Saturn is lord of eight and nine. 
In this case Saturn's Mooltrikona sign is in ninth an auspicious house, 
therefore, overall effects of this Satum will be good. But in case of 
Virgo Lagna where Saturn is lord of 5th and 6th, its Mooltrikona 
sign is in the sixth. Therefore, Saturn of this Lagna will be overall 
malefic in nature, but it will have its good effects of lord of five 
also. It will give education but not so high etc. 

Step 12. Judgement of a Particular House: 

For judgement of any house the following three factors are to be 
taken into account; 

a. House 

b. House lord/ its dispositor - Dispositor is the lord of Rasi 
where the planet is located, e.g., in the horoscope on next 
page the dispositor of Moon is Mars, as Moon is in Scorpio 
Rasi whose lord is Mars. Not only the planet should be 
strong, its dispositor should also be strong i.e. should not be 
in 6, 9 or 12 or debilitated/combust etc. 

c. Karka - For example if we have to study the fourth house 
we will have to see the condition of the 4th house, its lord 
and Karka. Fourth house represents many things, property, 
mother, vehicles etc. For property we will see the condition 
of Karka for property which is Mars, for mother Karka is 
Moon and for vehicles Venus. 

House 

A house is strong if: (a) It is aspected by its own lord or has its own 
lord placed in it. (b) has benefic planets or is aspected by benefic 
and (c) is in 'Shubhkartari' Yoga. 

i. A house is considered weak if it has malefic planets or is 
aspected by malefics and is under Pap Kartari Yoga. 
For example if second house has benefic planets or has the 
aspects of benefic planets it will give wealth, the face will 
be beautiful and speech would be charming. And if 2nd 
house has its own lord or has the aspect of its own lord 
wealth would be there, its quantum will be depending upon 
presence of other Yogas for wealth. Similarly, the malefic 
planets will spoil the effects of 2nd house. 


Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


it, Lord of the House: A strong lord of the house will promote 
the effects of the house. We have already explained the 
results of strong and weak planets. 

Example: An exalted fourth lord will give much property 
if the Karka Mars is also strong. 

ill. No prediction should be given unless you have taken into 
consideration the condition of Karka also. For example to 
predict about marriage you will consider not only 7th house 
and 7th lord but also its Karka Venus. A strong and well 
placed Venus is necessary for a happy and successful 
married life. 

iv. According to Phala Deepika malefics should not occupy 5, 
9,4, 8 and 12 from a house. 

Example: This is the horoscope of a famous musician Dr. 
Balkrishna Murali. We will study the condition of the mother: 


For giving predictions about mother we will study 4th house, 4th 
lord and Moon and one more factor 4th from Moon. This is an 
additional tool: for father we will also see 9th from Sun, for children 
5th from Jupiter, for brothers 3rd from Mars and for wife 7fh from 
Venus and so on. 

Fourth House: Let us study the fourth house first. Fourth house is 
vacant and has no benefic or malefic aspect. 

Fourth Lord: 4th lord is Jupiter which is with a malefic Sun and 
aspected by Saturn. The fourth lord is heavily afflicted.

Introduction 17 


Karka: Karka for mother is Moon. Moon is debilitated and is in the 

12th. It is in Pap Kartari Yoga and is aspected by Mars. Thus Karka 

is totally afflicted and is powerless to protect the mother. In Ashtak 

Varga it has only three Bindus and hence is very week. In Navamsa 

also Moon is afflicted by Mars and 8th lord Mercury. 

Fourth from Moon: The fourth from Moon is Aquarius sign which 

is aspected by Saturn. The fourth lord from Moon is Satur and is 

aspected by Sun and Mars. Fourth house and fourth lords are badly 
afflicted. 

Result: Balamurali lost his mother when he was quite young. 

Other Points to be remembered are : 

1. According to Phala Deepika if the house under examination 
is in the 6th, 8th or 12th from the Lagna, that house is 
destroyed. The same will be the result if that house is occupied 
by lords of 6, 8thor 12th. The house concerned will, however, 
flourish if it is aspected by a benefic. 

2. Malefics occupying the 6th, 8th and 12th house with reference 
to Lagna or other house under examination cause the 
destruction of that house, according to Phala Deepika. 

3. "Whichever house is occupied by the lord of Lagna gains in 
prosperity and well being. The good effects of such houses 
are enhanced if their lords are associated or aspected by the 
lords of Lagna" - Phala Deepika. 

4. According to Phala Deepika Shloka 41, Sun and Moon are 
declared to be auspicious even when they own the 8th house 
i.e. for the people born in Makara and Dhanu they are 
respectively auspicious. This is because the Sun becomes the 
creator for person born in Makara, while the Moon becomes 
the owner of the house in which Jupiter lord of Dhanu is 
exalted. 

5. Lord of any house under consideration should not be in 3rd, 
5th or 7th Nakshatra reckoned from Janam Nakshatra. The 
third Nakshatra from Janam Nakshatra (nakshatra in which 
Moon is located at birth), is called Vipat Tara, 5th is Pratyari 
whereas 7th Nakshatra is called Vadha Tara. The lords of 
these Nakshatras are evil according to Phala Deepika. 


Chapter | 
First House or Lagna 


Body and Personality 

The first house is known as Tanu Bhava. It represents: 

1. Body, its form, colour, complexion etc., 

2. Personality. 

3. General prosperity, 

4. Beginning of life, childhood. 

5. Health and character. 
According to sage Sattyacharya first house shows stay in foreign 
land, good and bad acts, place of residence, Balarishta or death at 
a young age, happiness or unhappiness. 
Uttara Kalamitra assigns 33 significations to the first house, among 
these are body limbs, hair, happiness, fame and freedom from ill 
health. 
‚ÄòThe body, its complexion, its characteristics, fame, qualities, 
happiness or unhappiness, residence abroad, splendor, strength and 
weakness are known from first Bhava,‚Äô says Jatak Parijat. 
According to the same book ‚Äòthe more auspicious the rising sign is, 
the longer will one live and be happy, and be in the good books of 
the rulers. According to K.N. Rao, Lagna, Moon and the Sun are 
three tripods on which a horoscope stands, if all the three are strong, 
the horoscope becomes powerful, and person is renowned, gets 
well recognized and may even achieve international fame. Phala 
Deepika is also of the view that strength of a horoscope depends to 
a great extent on the strength of Lagna, Sun and Moon. 
Role of Navamsa 


Features and nature of a person are known from the lord of rising 
Navamsa at his birth or from powerful planet occupying Lagna. Its 
complexion is known from the Navamsa occupied by Moon. All 
good and evil in life ofa person are known from Lagna as per Jatak 
Parijat. 

‚ÄòWith Sun in its own Navamsa and Moon in its own sign, native 
becomes a king‚Äô - Phala Deepika 

Importance of Lagna (Ascendant) and Lagna Lord 
The role of Lagna lord cannot be over emphasised. A strong Lagna 
lord assures success in life. It is likened to engine of train of one's 


Ist House 19 


Destiny. The more powerful the engine, smoother is the journey of 
life. According to Jatak Parijat ifthe rising sign is aspected by its 
own lord, one will be master of riches, be a genius and would bring 
good name to his family. 

Strong Ascendant Lord 

It is said that a person rises in life in proportion to the strength of 
Lagna lord. The mere occupation of Lagna by benefics or aspect 
of benefics is harbinger of good fortune. Lagna with benefics or 
aspected by functional benefics bestows great fortune in all walks 
of life. 

Vargottam Lagna adds additional strength. 

If the Lagna lord is placed in a Kendra along with a lord of Trikona 
or conjoined with lord of 10 native will enjoy prosperity and long 
lease of life. 

Lord of Lagna and lord of 8 both strong aspected by benefics give 
long life. 

According to Phala Deepika if lord of Lagna is strong the native 
becomes famous, will be happy and prosperous. If, however the 
lord of Lagna be placed in 6th, 8th, or 12th or is debilitated or in the 
sign of a malefic the native will be miserable and live in undesirable 
place. He will lead a sickly life. (This could be true only if Lagna 
lord is afflicted). According to the same book if Lagna lord is exalted, 
person will be a king provided it is not in 6th, 8th or 12th. 

Health 

Parasara says that, if Lagna lord is well placed and is placed in 
Kendras or Trikona the native will enjoy good health. The health 
suffers if Lagna lord (i) is placed in 6th, 8th or 12th. According to 
same authority if Ascendant lord along with malefics occupies 6th, 
8th or 12thhouse and is devoid of the conjunction or aspect of a 
benefic, the native will have short life or will have no issue. (ii) is 
combust (iii) is debilitated (iv) is in enemy's sign (v) has lost in 
planetary war (vi) if there are no benefics in Kendras (vii) if malefics 
are not in 3th, 6th and 11th (viii) if Moon has no Pakshabala, is in 
6th, 8th, and 12th and is badly afflicted by malefics. While malefic 
planets are not considered good in 8th house, the Saturn as Ayush 
Karka (significator of long life) gives long life in 8th house. For 
strong health and long life Lagna lord should be stronger than 8th 
lord. 


20 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Afflicted 1st House 

a. The health of the person is not good if the first house is with 
malefics or has the aspect of malefic planets and 

b. Is in Pap Kartari Yoga. 


Bad Dasha 

a. Dasha of the malefic planets or lords of 6th, 8th and 12th 
are not conducive to good health. 

Note: Only one factor cannot give bad health. If Lagna lord 
is in Oth, 8th, and 12th and is also afflicted by the aspect/ 
association of malefics. only then the health suffers. 

b. Aspect on Lagna lord: malefic aspect causes problems 
for the health, while aspects or conjunction with benefic planets is 
good, says Parasara. 

// there are malefics in the first house the birth, infancy or 
youth becomes traumatic. Body and personality is obscured, 
disfigured or problematic. 


Handsome Personality 

Benefic in Ascendant makes one handsome, while malefics are 
not conducive to good looks - Parasara. 

According to Stree Jatakam if second and twelfth lords are benefic 
and join Lagna with no malefic planets, body becomes beautiful. 
Aspect of Moon or Venus on the first house or their strong placement 
in kendras give a handsome personality. 


General Prosperity 

According to Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra, Lagna lord, Jupiter, 
Venus, Mercury in Kendra and Trikonas, makes one healthy, wealthy 
and successful. 

Lagna lord in a movable sign and having aspect of benefics also 
gives fame, wealth and happiness. 

Lagna lord in 12th in its own Navamsa causes Vimal Yoga which 
brings luck, prosperity and influence. (see horoscope of Nargis Dutt). 
According to Prassan Reed 6th lord in 12th as also Lagna lord 
makes one rich. 

Lagna with/aspected by its own lord is a major Raj Yoga because 
it gives one an initial advantage in life.

First House 

This is a good combination for fame and riches. The person enjoys 
good healt and has a long life. He is generally a success in life. He 
will be thoughtful and intelligent. 

However, if Lagna lord is afflicted with malefics it will cause bad 
health. According to Parasara he will be fickle minded, will have 
two wives and will be immoral. 
Second House 

This is a combination for earning money by self-efforts. One is 
learned, happy, good natured, religious minded and honourable. He 
also looks after his near family and relatives and is generous. 

He is successful in business and has great power of observation. 
Third House 

This is a good combination for artistic abilities. One is courageous, 
respectable, fortunate, intelligent, happy, famous as a musician artist 
or a mathematician. 


Ist House 23 


Lagna lord in 3rd house gives vigour and spirit. According to Parasara 
one will be equal to a lion in valour, will have all kinds of wealth and 
will be intelligent and happy. 

If the lord is afflicted it will give opposite results, his vitality and 
strength suffers. 


Fourth House 

This is a good combination for wealth and prosperity as Lagna is a 
Kendra as well as Trikona, so association of Lagna and fourth 
house causes Kendra Trikona Raj Yoga. It is good for fame, riches 
and good education. This combination is good for prosperity to 
mother also. The health of the person is good. 

According to Parasara native is blessed with paternal and maternal 
happiness, has many brothers and will be lascivious and charming. 
The fourth house represents mind and the Lagna is body. Person 
becomes involved with his personality and tries to look handsome 
and attractive. 


Fifth House 

Lagna lord in the 5th is always auspicious. It is again a combination 
of Kendra and Trikona. It makes one famous, liked by rulers and 
makes one very intelligent and gives artistic abilities. 

According to Bhavarth Ratnakar for Aries Lagna Mars in 5 gives 
fame during its Dasha. 

And Jatak Parijat says ‚ÄòIf the Lagna lord is in 5th or 9th, or with 
lord of 5,9 or Lagna, father of the person is a famous man‚Äô. 

In the horoscope of Dr. Rabindra Nath Tagore, first lord is in the 
Sth exalted. 

Lagna lord in 5 is always auspicious-But Parasara says that it does 
not give much happiness from sons and first child may not live 
long. (This may only happen if the lord is debilitated or afflicted.) 


Sixth House 

If the Lagna lord is strong it may give a high rank in the army, or 
may take one to medical profession where one may prosper. 
However, Lagna lord in the sixth with malefics or having aspect of 
malefics is not good for health. One will also be troubled by his 
enemies. 

According to Bhavarth Ratnakar if birth is in Aries sign and Mercury 
Mars are in the 6th one gets wounds, skin eruption and small pox in

will be liquidated in the dasha of the first lord. 

If the lord is well placed, body will be healthy and person will be 
fond of sports. 

Seventh House 

While it is good for general health and prosperity as Lagna lord 
aspects its own house; it may some times give two marriages. Lagna 
lord in movable signs in the 7th house may give much travelling 
also. 

Eighth House 

If Lagna lord is strong it makes one learned, popular and with a 
religious bent of mind as 8th is an important part of Moksha triangle. 
Otherwise, one with Lagna lord in the eight with malefic aspect/ 
association gets chronic and incurable diseases. According to 
Parasara he will be sickly, thievish, extremely wrathful, a gambler 
and interested in others‚Äô wives. 

According to Bhavarth Ratnakar one is lucky in Aries Lagna if 
Moon and Mars are in Ascendant or in eight. 

Prashar says he will also have knowledge of occult powers. 

If the Lagna lord is strong one gets unexpected wealth, lottery, 
legacy and money through speculation. 


Ist House 25 


Ninth House 

It is an excellent combination of kendra and a trikona. One is very 
intelligent, lucky, rich with religious bent of mind and gets inheritance 
from father. According to Parasara he will be fortunate, dear to the 
people, devotee of Lord Vishnu (means religious), skilful, eloquent 
speaker and will have wife, sons and wealth. 

This is good for father also as he is famous truthful and charitable. 
If the lord is debilitated or afflicted it brings bad results, person will

in Kendra or Trikona promotes wealth, whereas 2nd lord in 6,8, 

and 12 is not good for wealth. 

The 2nd lord in eleven and 11 lord in 2 are good for wealth. 
According to same authority 2nd lord with a benefic, and 

Pan ‚Äòatamsa (6 times in own Vargas) makes one rich without much 

effort.

Lord of two in different Houses 
In the First House 
If the Second lord is in the first house, is strong and is with benefics, 


2nd House 33 


one makes wealth through his own efforts. If it is weak and has 
malefic aspects there will be expenditure. 

According to Phala Deepika if there are benefics in the second 
house and second lord is in Lagna the native will be rich with a 
handsome face. He will have many good qualities and will come 
from a prosperous family. . 


In the Second House 

It is good for wealth, if not afflicted. The malefic aspects disturb 
married life and causes problems-in the immediate family, with wife, 
mother or father. 

It has been observed that malefic in the second house give science 
as a subject, and if well fortified, person achieves academic 
distinction as 2/8 axis relates to deep researches. 


Third House 

If well fortified, money will be made through art, drama music or 
with the help of brothers. The malefics will destroy wealth, and one 
of the reasons would be through brothers. The native could be a 
businessman, quarrelsome and proud. If it is Sun relations with 
brothers are not good. If it is Mars then his moral standards are not 
good. If Saturn he may have no brother. 


Fourth House - 

With benefic Yogas wealth would be generated through property, 
mother, agriculture, conveyance, lands, education and vehicles. He 
gets inheritance, is truthful and kind. Malefic Yogas will destroy 
wealth through above sources. 

If 2nd lord is debilitated in the 4th house, it could mean loss of 
property - if Saturn is involved it could mean theft. 


Fifth house 

Well fortified and with benefics wealth will be made through lotteries, 
speculation, temples and mutts, government, and children. With 
malefics the wealth will be destroyed through above causes.

Well fortified it means wealth through medical profession, enemies 
and opponents (may also mean through sports and competitions), 
litigation, theft and races. It could also mean black-marketing, 
cheating and deceit.

trust, forgeries, perjuries and subsequent prosecution.

'Upchayas' houses (3, 6, 10, and 11) are auspicious. 


Seventh House 

Wealth through foreign sources, business in foreign countries; earns 
through partners, wife and women, if its dispositor in the birth and 
Navamsa charts is female planet. 

If afflicted this could mean wastage of money on gratification of 
Sex. 


Eighth House 

It means combination of wealth with inheritance though it may also 
mean disappearance of inherited wealth if afflicted. 2nd lord in 8th 
also aspects its own house hence is good for wealth. Also loss as 
8th is involved. 

If afflicted means no happiness from wife. 


Ninth House 
It is a good combination for wealth as wealth and good fortune 
combine. It also means wealth through father. 


Tenth House 

Learned, wealthy, money through honest means. Money through 
service, commerce, trade, religious means, lectures etc.

money is earned through money - lending, bankers, and trade and 
through elder brother. 

Twelfth House

government servant, money through foreign sources. Also 
expenditure, lack of wealth if afflicted.

squander his money‚Äô - says Satya Jatakam.

Example Queen Elizabeth 21.4.1926 
a. Inthe horoscope of Queen Elizabeth, lord of 9 from Lagna 
is Mercury. It has been allotted 8 Kalas. The lord of nine 
from Moon is Jupiter who gets 10 Kalas. Add 8 and 10 
together, and you get 18 Kalas. 
. Divide 18 by 12 and you get a remainder of 6. 
c. Count 6 from Moon. This is Sagittarius, the 12th house 
which in this particular horoscope is Indu Lagna. 
Some of the astrologers use Jaimini system for computing Indu 
Lagna, and make use of Jaimini aspects. In this Kalas (rays) or 
units are the same. But the method of counting 9 is different in odd

and even sign. If Lagna/Moon are in the odd signs counting is direct, 
if in even signs counting is indirect. Aspects used are Jaimini and 
not Parasari. In Jaimini system, movable Rasis (Aries, Cancer, Libra 
and Capricorn) aspect fixed Rasis (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and 
Aquarius) excepting adjacent ones and vice versa. The dual Rasis 
(Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces) aspect one another. The 
aspect of Rasis means planets in it. 

The more planets aspect Indu Lagna, the better is the results for 
wealth. 

In horoscope of Queen Elizabeth, Lagna is even sign so the counting 
would start in the reverse direction from Lagna. Counting 9 in this 
way from Lagna, you get sign Taurus whose lord is Venus. Venus 


2nd House 43 


gets 12 Kalas. 

Moon is also in even sign counting would be again in reverse 
direction. Nine counting in this way brings us to Scorpio, whose 
lord is Mars. Mars gets 6 Kalas. Add 12 and 6 we get 18. Divide 
18 by 12 and you get a remainder of 6. Since Moon is in the even 
sign counting 6 in reverse direction brings us to Aquarius which is 
Indu Lagna as per Jaimini rule. Aquarius is fixed sign and has the 
aspect of Aries, which has exalted Sun, and Cancer having Moon. 
The sign Capricorn being adjacent to Aquarius does not aspect it. 
Two powerful luminaries aspect Indu Lagna. 


How to interpret Indu Lagna 


1. Combination for immense Riches 

1H Indu Lagna occupied or aspected by many benefic 
planets give lot of wealth in their Dashas. Even aspect 
of one benefic is good for this purpose. This is known 
as Koteshwar Yoga. Here the role of benefic planets 
has been emphasised. A benefic planet in Indu Lagna 
during its Dasha would give much wealth. A planet in its 
own house or exaltation sign makes one millionaire. 

ii) | Exalted malefic (Saturn, Sun and Mars) planets in Indu 
Lagna give immense riches towards the end ‚Äî 
Koteshwar Yoga. Even malefics in this Lagna give 
wealth, though not so much. 

iii) Even one benefic planet in Indu Lagna aspected by 
benefic or malefic gives plenty of wealth. ¬∞ 

iv) Occupied by pure malefics it gives moderate wealth. 

v) AMll planets situated in it or aspecting this Lagna give 
wealth during their Dashas. : 

vi) Also planets situated in trines or quadrants (trikona and 
Kendras), from this Lagna give wealth during their 
Dasha -Antardasha. 

vii) Ithas been observed that Jupiter in transit, when it comes 
in Kendras from this Lagna gives property, wealth and 
happiness. 

viii) The planets situated in 3, 6,8 and 12 from this Lagna 
destroy wealth. 


44 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


ix) Indu Lagna aspected by debilitated malefics is not good 
for finances. Similarly, Indu Lagna neither aspected nor 
occupied by planets is not good.

of 2nd and 11ithhouse/lord from this Lagna. This will 
give a good idea of the level of prosperity.

How to judge financial prosperity from Sarvashtak Varga 


1. If 9th, 10th, 11 th houses and Lagna, all have more than 30 
Bindus each, the financial prosperity is assured; Conversely 
these houses having less than 25 Bindus entail poverty. 


Mukesh Ambani

the person enjoys all material happiness and is prosperous. 
Add the Bindus in Lagna, 2nd, 4th, 9th, 1 Oth, and 11 th from 
Lagna. If this total is more than 164, the person will be 
prosperous. 

The 12 houses are divided into 4 groups; 

Bandhu: 1, 5and9 

Sevaka: 2, 6 and 10 

Poshak: 3, 7 and 11 

Ghatika: 4, 8, and 12 

If Poshaka figures are higher than Ghataka figures, the 
person is wealthy. 

If Sevaka is higher than Bhandhu the person will always 
be subservient to others. 

If Lagna lord has exchanged places with the 4th lord or its 
lord has connections with this house, the person will be as 
wealthy as a king. 

All the seven planets if associated with 6 to 8 Bindus in 
their own Ashtak Varga bestow plenty of wealth to the 
individual. The results are accentuated if planets are exalted 
(with the exception of Saturn in Lagna), or are in own or 
Mooltrikona houses, and occupying Kendra or Trikona 
houses. 

Dispositor of Jupiter if well placed in Kendras or Trikonas 
and has more than 4 Bindus in Jupiter's Ashtak Varga 
bestow great riches. 

If Jupiter is having more than 4 Bindus and is associated 
with Venus in a Kendra or Trikona the native becomes 
highly prosperous. 

Venus with 5 Bindus in Aries or Scorpio and aspected by 
benefics give wealth, prosperity and vehicles. Position in 
Kendra or Trikona gives better results.

gives birth to stillborn brother/sister. This prediction should not be 
given if benefic aspects are there.

give a Nakshatra (counted from Aries) or its trines, the transit of

birth will be in middling family. Weak 4th lord shows birth is in poor 
family or early childhood is disturbed. 

2nd House 

He is wealthy and derives much happiness from his relatives and 
mother. 

If lord is afflicted opposite results will be there. 

3rd House 

If the lord is strong he has wealth by self effort and is a man of 
character, But 3rd is 12th from 4fh and hence placement of 4th lord 
here is not good. Person has a worried mind, his business is not 
steady. He is discontented and has no saving.

highly educated, has a sharp mind. He is rich with houses and 
property. Is long lived and children are also happy with good 
inheritance.

4th House in the Horoscope 

It represents in childhood, mother home, property and education 
portrays the type of upbringing and comfortable living. A good 4th 
house and 4th lord become 'sine quanon‚Äô for a prosperous childhood. 
In adulthood, a happy married life is known from the conditions of 
4th/7th house and their lords. A classical example of timing and 
quality of married life is given by K. N. Rao in his book Astrology 
Destiny and the wheel of Time‚Äô. 


When asked about the prospects of the marriage of the girl about 
whom the parents had got disillusioned and were almost reconciled 
to the fact that this girl would never be married as she was 


i. getting old and fat. 
ii. had no educational qualification. 


iii. and parents had hardly any money to offer as an incentive 
for a handsome dowry. 


4th House 67 


Rao replied that the girl would be married very soon and with a 
man having lot of property. 
Please see the following horoscope. 


This girl was passing through Mahadasha of Moon, Vargottam and 
the Antar Dasha of Mars, Lord of Lagna aspecting 10th house. 
Moon has also the aspect of 5th lord Sun and 10th and 11th lord 
Saturn. With strong Gaj Kesari Yoga and a strong 4th house/4th 
lord she was bound to find happiness and property, which could 
only be found in her husband's home. As the luck would have it, a 
rich landlord of U. P. was looking for a match for his middle-aged 
son who had dislike for fashionable girls and wanted a plain looking 
and not too educated a girl to be his wife. So the destiny brought 
them together and catapulted this girl into a rich family with all the 
paraphernalia of wealth and property. Such is the power of a strong 
Vargottam 4th lord. 


Ownership of Palatial Houses 

Some people are born very lucky, ‚Äòwith a silver spoon in the 
mouth‚Äô, as they say, and bring also a great deal of good luck to 
their parents. The nature is kind to them and they live all their life in 
luxury and idyllic surroundings, with palatial houses and related 
paraphernalia. See the horoscope of Pundit Jawahar Lal Nehru. 
K.N. Rao, in his book The Nehru Dynasty‚Äô has dilated on this 
subject and says that while Nehru, a pampered child was surrounded 
by luxury, with a private swimming pool and tennis court as yet 
he was born when his father was not so rich and used to live in 
locality of poor people, Rao gives astrological‚Äô reasons for Nehru 
subsequently living in luxuries and grandiose building by stating that 


68 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


‚Äòwith Mercury and Venus in Libra in the 4th house, he was destined 
to live in a luxurious house. In Mercury-Venus period of Nehru, his 
father moved to a better locality and in Mercury-Rahu (1897-1900) 
the family shifted into famous Anand Bhawan. Mercury in the 4th 
house is well understood for this change, the 12thin the 4th being 
the combination for change of residence. Why the Rahu sub period 
had to be significant can be understood if it is seen that Rahu in the 
12th house is in the 4th from 9th. The 9th house is the father and 
4th from 9fh house with Rahu in it aspected by Jupiter had to give 
to Nehru's father a grand mansion, Anand Bhawan. 


It may also be noted that 4th house has 30 benefic points in 
Ashtak Varga and its lord Venus is extremely strong in its 
Moolatrikone sign with 6 points. Mars, the Karka for property is 
again strong with 6 points. However, it is in the enemy house. This 
may be the reason that unlike modern politicians he did not go on 
amassing huge landed assets. 

From Jaimini angle the 4th from Karkamsa, Lagna, Dhanu, 
has the aspect of Mars, strong Jupiter and exalted Rahu - again a 
good combination for owning palatial houses. 

Maharishi Parasara in Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra has laid 
emphasis on the strength of the 4th house/4th lord and its placement 
in Kendra and Trikona. Sarvarth Chintamani has in addition linked 
9th house and position of a benefic in 3rd house also. Combination 
with 10th lord provides multistoried buildings. It has also laid emphasis 
on the Kendra position of lord of Navamsa occupied by 4fh lord. 

Position of Mars, Karka for property and houses is also very 
important. 

According to Sanketa Nidhi if Mercury is in the 4th, house 
would be artistic, with Moon new and Jupiter gives strong and durable 
houses. Sun and Ketu flimsy, Saturn and Rahu old, Venus lovely 
and Mars gives a building prone to fire. 

Jatak Tatwa says that 

1. Moon and Venus in 4th house give multistoried house. 
Planets in exaltation in 4fh house - same results as above. 
Ketu and Mars - brick houses. 
Jupiter - a house of timber. 
Sun - a hut of grass. . 
Lord of 9 in Kendra, 4th lord in his own, exaltation or 
friendly Rasi or exalted planet in 4 give beautiful houses. 


AMRwWN 


4th House 69 


7. Benefic in 3rd, 4th lord and lord of Navamsa of 4th lord- 
strong multiple storied house with compound. 

8. 4th lord and 1 Oth with Moon and Saturn give a most pleasing 
house. 

9. Lagna lord and 4th in 4th - gain of house in most unexpected 
manner. 

10. 4th lord in 10th and 10th lord in 4th with Mars - strong

property. 

12. 4th lord strong in own house or in 3, 6, 10, 11 (Upchhaya 
houses) aspected by benefics, gain of much property. 

The classical Yogas for acquiring houses are 

1. Vichitra Saudha Prakra Yoga 

Lord of 4fh and 10th together with Saturn and Mars-the person 
acquires innumerable mansions. This four planet combination is 
rather rare. ait 

2. Uttam Griha Yoga - 

Lord of 4 should join benefics in Kendra or Trikona. If Lagna lord is 
not strong see from the Moon. 

Jaimini Astrology and Houses 

1. If4th from Karkamsa Langa is associated with Moon and 
Venus one lives in palatial house. If there is Sun in the 4th 
from Karkamsa, house is made of grass. Mercury in such 
a condition gives commercial building. Aspect of Mercury 
means good furnishing also. With Saturn and Rahu there is 
house of stones, rocks etc. Mars or Ketu again gives house 
of stones. In case there is Jupiter in 4th from Karkamsa 
the house is made of wood. 

2. All Raj Yogas, Mahapursh Yogas and Dhana Yogas formed 
with Moon - Sunapha, Anapha, Gaj kesari, Chander Mangal 
and Adhi Yogas are important. 

3. Role of Vargottam Lagna and Vargottam planets in the 
horoscope together with exalted planets, in Mooltrikona signs 
etc. add luster to the horoscope. 

4. Role of 4fh house/lord and Karkas for property Mars and 
Jupiter in Kendra Trikona invariably provides one with a 
house. Venus the great benefic has special role to play. 


70 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Deep Scrutiny 

1. Check the placement of Jupiter, Venus and Mars and ensure 
that they are placedin a good place, i.e. in Kendras, or Trikonas. 
Houses are made in the Mahadasha of Jupiter, Venus or Mars. 
For timings in transit Jupiter should be in 1, 4,8 or 12 houses. 


Happiness of having a house should be judged from 4, 8, and 11 
houses. Good Nakshatras promise happiness. 


fe GN 


5. Jupiter has a major role to play. If it is exalted, in Mooltrikona or 
own house, in 1, 4, 8 or 10, promise of having a house of one's 
own - a good house - becomes certain. 

6. Though Jupiter is a significator for a, house, if such a Jupiter is 
associated with Rahu, Saturn, Jupiterian promise of a house is 
fulfilled, but an old and dilipidated house is the result. 

7. If Jupiter and Venus together establish relationship with 1, 4, 8, 
10 houses, promise of a good house is assured. 

8. Saturn and Sun in 4th house, mean worries for house most of 
one's life. 

9. Saturn and Sun combined in the 4th, can also mean good house 
as a tenant. 

10. Moon in the 4, farm or farm house. 

11. Venus in 4, house with a garden. 

12. Exalted Saturn-good or many houses. 

13. Rahu in 4, or own Nakshatra person is deprived of house. 

14. Ketu in 4 buy and sell farms and make profit. 

For living house should be in the East, hospital in the West, and 

garden and place of entertainment in South. 

Mr. Rao who is a pioneer in modern researches in Astrology 
has laid great emphasis on examination of Chathurthamsa as if it 
were the main chart. This has given excellent results. In this Lagna, 
Lagna lord, 4th house, 4th lord and placement of Mars, Jupiter and 
Venus are to be seen.

Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


4th lord Moon is exalted in the house of wealth and is also 
Vargottam which is being aspected by 9th lord Jupiter from 
the 10th house. Jupiter is having Neech Bhanga Raj Yoga 
and incidentally is with 2nd lord Venus. So, there is connection 
between property, wealth Karmasthan and father. (9th 
house). 

Karka Mars is aspecting 4fh house from the 9fh house 
Again a connection with father's property. 

Saturn lord of gains is aspecting its own 10th house from 
8th house of inheritance. And Sun lord of 5th is aspecting 
its own house from house of gains. Sun is also with lord of 
courage Mercury. Mercury is also 6th lord so he will have 
fierce opposition in the building of projects. 

He reached the climax of his career as a builder when 
Jupiter entered Capricorn (Makar) from where it aspects 
the 4th house. Saturn at this time was aspecting exalted 
4th lord Moon completing the picture. 

From Karkamsa Lagna, 4th house is Virgo whose lord is in 
the house of gains with 5th lord aspecting it's own house. 
This means that his sons are actively involved in his 
construction activities. 

Karkamsa Lagna as well as 4th from it is being aspected 
by Mars from the 9th house. Mars is Karka of property as 
well as Lagna lord. As also lord of 8th it shows again 
inherited property. 

It is interesting to note that fabulous amount of wealth was 
generated during the Mahadasha of Mercury, lord of guts 
in the house of gains with the 5th lord. In Chara Dasha it 
was the main Dasha of Vrishbha with exalted 4th lord Moon 
aspected by most powerful Raj Yoga of Atma and Amatya 
Karka. It was because of this Yoga that he has hundreds 
of persons employed under him. 

During Mercury-Ketu and Mercury-Venus he made 
maximum amount of money. The 4th house of 
Chathurthamsa was aspected by both Ketu and Venus.

There is connection of 3rd, 4th and 11th, which is again 
fortified by aspect of exalted Mars from the 10th who 
again has its dispositor Saturn in the 8th aspecting its 
own 10th house. Incidentally 10th lord is also lord of 11 
in 8fh (house of inheritance), and is in turn aspected by

of 10th and 11th lord. Exalted Rahu always generates 
great deal of money like 'Kubera‚Äô. 

Now let us confirm this from Jaimini angle 

1. AK, Mars is exalted, is in a Kendra and has the aspect 
of AMK Saturn, assuring high status and dignity. It was 
in the chara Dasha of Aries when AK was in the 10th 
exalted with aspect of Amatya Karka that he got a very 
high position in the government of India. 

2. Karkamsa Lagna is Virgo. The 4th from it has the aspect

aspect). Ashtak Varga. 


4th House 75 


In Ashtak Varga the 12thhouse has 32 benefic points as against 27 
in 11th, showing more expenditure and less income. 12th has also 
more Bindus than Lagna which has only 27 points. 
Use of Karkas 
Fourth house represents many things like property, mother, vehicles 
etc. For studying mother one should see the fourth house, its lord

Mother: Mother has a great importance in the upbringing of 
children. There is a Jewish saying: "God could not be every where,

we will study the fifth house. Parasara calls fifth house as house of 
intelligence as also of learning and Maharishi Jaimini uses 5th house 
for education. Fifth house also denotes talent, devotion to God 
learning, and wisdom.

Jaimini Sutras Jupiter joins Karkamsa or the fifth from Karkamsa, 
one is all rounder and knows many branches of knowledge, well 
read in sciences and author of various works. He becomes a

and knowledge.

good for education. 

Mercury and Venus in 5th house gives success in academic career. 
The disposition of Moon on the cusp of Ascendant or on the cusp 
of 5th house denotes flair for Music and poetry.

Lagna one is clever in Sankhya Shastra, learned in languages, 
poetry, drama, and has great proficiency in music. 
Venus denotes, penance, religious austerity, devotion to God and 
Spiritual austerity. 
Ninth house/lord and 5th house/lord favourably placed are good 
for devotion to religion. 
Venus also rules over Divine qualities. If it is in 5th or as lord of 5th 
is in nine gives divine inspirations.

of the couple to procreate children. Formulae has been given to 
determine Beeja Sphuta in case of males and Kshetra Sphuta in 
case of females to ascertain potency/sterility etc., in the couple. If 
Beeja (male) is weak and Kshetra (female) strong children may 
be born late in life after undertaking remedial measures/medical 
treatment etc.

Denial of Children 

Yogas that Deny Children 

This has been discussed in details in Chapter 14 of the book "Planets 
and Children" by K. N. Rao. 

In brief the Yogas that deny children are as follows : - 

1. Beeja/Kshetra Sphuta should not be associated with 8th lord, 

Mercury, Saturn or Rahu. Nor these sensitive points should 
have affliction both in Rasi and Navamsa charts. 

Rahu in the 5th house in the Rasi of Mars or Rahu in the 5th 
aspected by Mars. 

Conjunction of Rahu with the 5th lord. 

Rahu in Lagna, Mars and Jupiter in the 5th. 

Rahu and Mercury in the 5th. 

According to Mantreshwara conjunction of 5th and 7th lords 

or exchange between them denies children. (This is true in 

some cases only.) 
7. Weak Jupiter, weak Lagna lord, weak 5th and 7th houses deny 
children. This is known as "Anapathya Yoga‚Äù. 

8. Lagna lord and 5th lord in 6th, 8th or 12th with Jupiter debilitated 
and Mercury and Saturn in 5th. 

9. Saturn in 5th aspected by Moon. 

10. 2nd, 5th and 7th lords conjunct in one house-Navamsa lords of 
these planets malefic and also occupying malefic signs. These 
combinations in classical books have been dealt with under the 
head curses of snakes, father, mother, brothers etc. 

It has been observed that if Rahu, 5th house/5 th lord and Lagna are 


AWPw

afflicted it is due to curse of father. If Moon and 4th house are 
afflicted it is due to the curse of mother. 3rd house/lord and Mars

VI - Sex of Children 

1. 5th house 5th lord planet aspecting or posited with them and 
Jupiter normally give a clue to ascertain the sex of child. This 
should be examined from, Rasi Chandra Lagna Navamsa and 
Saptamsa charts. 

2. Use can also be made of ‚ÄòPutra Pada‚Äô and 5th from Beeja/ 
Kshetra Sphuta. Putra Pada is as many houses away from 
5th lord as 5th lord is from the 5th house. 

3. Sun Mars and Jupiter are male planets, Moon Venus are female 
and Saturn and Mercury are eunuchs. Their association with 
5th house 5th lord give a clue to the sex of a child. 

4. Also see whether 5th house/lord fall in masculine or feminine 
Rasis. All odd Rasis are male and all even signs are female. 

5. Retrograde planets give unpredictive results. 

6. Dashas are also indicative of the sex of children. Dasha of a 

male exalted planets give normally birth of a son. 

5th lord in 5th favourably disposed gives number of sons. 

5th lord in exaltation or occupying a Kendra or Trikona gives 

many children. 

9. Mercury and Ketu in company of Sun in a male sign behave 
like male planets. Planets in association with male planets in 
male Rasis give sons. 

10. Moon in the 5th house normally gives a daughter as a first child. 

11. According to Sarvarth Chintamani the children should be 
considered from the 5th, 7th and 9th houses. 

12. According to Jatak Parijat malefics in 6th, 8th and 12th from 
5th house are not conducive to birth of sons. 

13. The sex of first child should be studied from the 5th house, the 
second from the 7th and 3rd from the 9th. 

Lesson No. 7 

Birth of Worthy Children 

5th house, 5th lord, Karka Jupiter and position of Sun enable one to 

find whether one will get worthy children or not. 

1. Jupiter as the Sth lord and Sun well placed give children. 

2. Strength of the 5th lord and its placement in Kendra and 
Trikona is pointer to happiness from children. 

3. Jupiter's aspect on the 5th house or the Sth lord and 5th 
house having benefic aspects give birth to children who 
bring a good name to parents. 5th house should be assessed 
from Chandra Lagna also. 


o x4 


5th House 10l 


5th lord's association with 6th lord give birth to a child 
who is hostile to father. Likewise association of 5th lord 
with 8th and 12th lords gives similar results. In this due 
care should be taken to assess benefic aspects and other 
mitigating circumstances like placement of good Lagna lord, 
luminaries and presence of other Raj Yogas. 

Malefic effects on 5th house/5 th lord give birth to children 
who become source of mental torture and agony 

This point has been highlighted by K.N. Rao in his 
monumental work "Karma and Rebirth". See the following 
horoscopes of an illustrious couple, a father and a mother

Note the position of 5th lord Jupiter, placed in the most 
powerful Kendra, the tenth. 

There is no affliction to the 5th house. 

The 5th lord Jupiter is also aspecting the 9th lord Moon in 
the 2nd house, the house of Kutumba. 

The Moon in turn is aspected by the Lagna lord and exalted 
4th lord ensuring Raj Yoga and happiness. 

5th house from Moon Aries is aspected by the 9th and 
10th lords from Moon, Sun and Mercury, making a powerful 
connection between Poorva Janama and Karma.

5th lord Jupiter is in the 10th again, the Karmasthan with

5th house is unafflicted. 

5th from Moon is aspected by its own lord Mercury having

Sixth House 


(House of Debt Diseases and Enemies) 
"Shatru. Bhava" 


This house deals with 

Diseases. 

Trouble from enemies. 

Injuries and wounds. 

Litigation. 

Sorrows and worries. 

Maternal uncle and cousins. 

Armies. 

Debt. 

Accidents. 
. Servants. 
. Misfortunes and ill luck. 
. Ill fame. 
. Clothes. 
. Dishonour. 

15. According to Parasara this also deals with step mother. 

This house also deals with senses. In female horoscope, loose morals, 
miscarriage, abortion, come under purview of this house. 


Sixth is also an Upachaya (Houses of elevation) house, 
others being 3. 10. and_ 11. As an Upachava 6th gives beneficial 
results also but its Dusthana results are not disallowed from showing 
up. 

Human life exists so long as it can withstand onslaught of 
hostile forces of nature outside. Strength of inner attributes withstand 
competition from outside. Weak attributes meet defeat and in 
consequence suffer pain physically and mentally. 

Sixth house and planets relating to 6th show weakness or 
strength of the native, his opportunities and limits to fight against 
foes and misfortune. 

In the modern world where the struggle for existence is acute, sixth 
house must be strong to give you all the material advantage and 
crush opposition but it should be weaker than Ascendant. 
If lord of six is stronger than Lagna, person loses to

competition. 

Malefics in the 6th House 

Malefics in the 6th are considered good, and show strength of the 
horoscope, but they should not be afflicted while benefics are 
considered wasted. However, if three afflicted malefics planets 
are located or aspect the 6th or 8th house, person remains sick 
since birth and suffers due to machination of enemies and undergoes 
monetary losses. 

Benefics in the Sixth 

Benefics in six are considered wasted because the best position for 
them is Kendras where they become strong and give material and 
monetary advantage to the person concerned. However, they save 
one from diseases, debt and litigation. Strong Moon with more than 
5 Bindu (benefic points of Ashtak Varga, makes a man millionaire 
(Horoscope of Henry Ford). According to Bhavarth Ratnakar. Moon 
in six makes one intelligent and in third fickle. 

Good benefics, not afflicted in a good Rasi give good results. Jawahar 
Lal Nehru had Jupiter in the 6th House in its own house from where 
it aspects the 10th house. He rose very high in life - of course there 
were other combinations also. 

Venus in the 6 and 12, gives wealth.

116 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Planets in the 7th house: 
Sun 

Sun and Mercury are very bad in 7. Life is not happy - even 
when exalted. 

According to western astrology, Sun in the 7th gives ambitious 
partner and is good for social and financial position. Well aspected 
gives harmony and happiness in married life. 

In Vedic astrology Sun is a malefic planet. It causes strained 
relations with wife, mentally depressed, little profit in business - 
causes insomnia. Not good for business. 

Delays marriage. There is no happiness and pleasure in married 
life. Has two wives. Travels broad. Is fickle minded, ugly and sinner. 

If Sun is in his own sign or strong, is loyal to his wife or if the 
Sun is in the enemy sign or in depression or has ill aspect he is 
polygamist. 

The results of Sun in Aries. Leo and Capricorn in the 7th 
house are not favourable. It means late marriage with difficulty and 
also two marriages, it brings dishonour to the husband. 

In Gemini, Libra or Aquarius, gets good education, expert in 
law and administration, promotes music, law and literature. Has 
few or no children. In feminine signs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, 
gain in business. Fights election. 

In Cancer. Scorpio and Pisces makes doctors or engineers. 
Wife of the native will be impressive, good at public dealings, good 
hostess, and helpful. She is good looking but tight fisted. 

Sun in seven gives ego problem for spouse, too proud but also 
tactful to keep spouse happy. 

Moon 

Exalted and full Moon gives a beautiful and charming wife. 
Native himself is handsome and rich. Gain from sale or purchase, 
roving on land and foreign trade abroad. He is kind and always 
travelling, dominated by his wife or other women. 

Gain from voyaging, trade, speculation; water products, 
partnership, land, grocery shop, hotel industry, commission and 
insurance agents. 

If Moon is debilitated, aspected or associated with malefics 
wife remains sick and there is no peace and happiness in life.

litigation. 

Venus - Moon - It indicates more than one wife, vain, sexy, weak, 
discontented and jealous.

of Saturn from the first gives loose morals, homosexuality and bad 
health. Litigation or partnership involves loss. 

Mercury 

Sun and Mercury are very bad in seven. Life not happy - 
even when exalted.

intelligence is good to be in a Kendra. The wife is beautiful. If it 
does not conjoin with the Sun, she is most attractive. He is unfit for 
sex pleasures with her. Feels defeated and shy.

According to Bhavarth Ratnakar "Saturn in the second or 
Rahu in 7th gives two marriages.‚Äù It should be understood clearly 
that this would only happen when Rahu is afflicted by malefics. 
Rahu on its own or with benefics becomes harmless and may even 
give good results. 

See two horoscopes below 

Horoscope No 1: Rahu did not do any damage. 

In this horoscope even though Rahu is in the 7th from Lagna 
and 2nd from Moon, it could not do any harm to the marriage as 
Rahu is having aspect of Jupiter. Lagna lord is in its own house 
giving strength to the horoscope. 

Horoscope A : 


Horoscope B: In this horoscope the lady lost her husband at an 
early age. Rahu is afflicted by Mars but has no benefic aspect. 


7th House 121 


Ketu 
Danger from journeys and water. Want of happiness from partner 
or she is wicked. Native himself is immodest, loss of wealth, fear of 
enemies or thefts. Adulterous, deserted by partner. Ailments of 
intestines and seminal troubles.

Factors which give happy married life 
Parameters 
Planets/Houses Involved

the house of marriage. 7th from Moon and 7th from Venus

2. 5th house - house of romance - Purva Punya - house of 

progeny. 

3. Lagna and Lagna lord.

The affliction of the 12th house/lord by malefics especially 
if they are lords of six is not good. Six represents diseases, 
debt, thieves and enemies. Afflicted Saturn gives a reserved 
nature and frigidity. 
4th house - house of happiness - Sukhisthan. 
2nd house of Kutumbha (immediate family). 

Moon as Karka of mind.

It should be in 'Shubh Kartari‚Äô Yoga and should not be

It should be strong in Bhavabala 

It should be strong in Ashtak Varga and should have more 
than 30 Bindus in Sarvashtak Varga. 

It should be aspected by benefics. 


Karka Venus 
Karka for marriage is Venus. According to Phala Deepika wife 


may die 
i) If Venus is sandwiched between malefics. 
ii)  Ifthere are malefics in 4, 8 and 12 from Venus. 
iii) If Venus is associated or aspected by malefics. 
"To give good results it should be strong. For Venus to be strong it 
should be 
(i) Exalted 
(ii) in its Mooltrikona sign/ own house. 


(iii) 


In Kendra Trikona: The planets in Kendra Trikona become 
strong. Venus if it is in Kendra from Lagna or Moon and is 
exalted or in its own house gives rise to Mahapurush Yoga 
known as Malviya Yoga which gives all type of happiness 
and prosperity. Venus in the first house gives handsome 
personality and romantic life. Since it aspects 7th house the 
native loves his wife. In the second house Venus gives a 
good family and a dutiful wife. It also gives sweet speech, 
which is contributory factor for marital harmony. Venus in 
the fourth gives mental happiness and in the fifth a romantic 
disposition. In the 7th it gives nuptial happiness. In nine it 
gives good luck and happiness and in ten and eleven it gives

(v) Should be strong in Bhava Bala 

(vi) it should be strong in Ashtak Varga, having more than five 
Bindus in its Ashtak Varga. 

(vii) Should not be combust. 

(viii) Should not be hemmed in between malefics. If it is hemmed 
in between benefic planets it gives rise to Shubhkartari 

Yoga which adds to it strength. 

(ix) Should not be in 6, 8 or 12 or trik houses. 
(x) Should not be in Mrityu Bhaga. 
xi) A Vargottam Venus gives good results. 

The debilitation of Venus can be ignored if it is in Kendra 
or Trikona. Sun is the worst enemy of Venus in marital matters. If 
two are together in fiery signs (excepting Sagittarius) there are 
chances of marriage going wrong in their Dashas. 

If Venus is exalted in Navamsa it gives a dignified wife, if 
Vargottam she is cultured. 

Similarly position of Mars should be examined.A retrograde 
Mars and that which is debilitated or aspected by malefics causes 
problems in marriage. 

Examination of Navamsa 

If the Navamsa occupied by lord of seven is benefic and lord of 

seven is also associated with benefics, it shows a good and happy 

married life. 

Placement of Lagna Lord / Moon vis a vis 7th lord and Venus: 

Lagna lord and Moon should be well placed (means they should 

not be in 6, 8, and 12 position) with respect to 7th lord and Venus 

for mutual harmony otherwise there will be frustration and 

discontentment. 

Marital Discord 

Affliction to 7th house and 7th Lord creates marital 

disharmony. 

1. | Seven and five houses should not be sandwiched between 

malefics. This is a no marriage combination also. Seventh 
house is the house of marriage and 5th house is the house of 


124 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


romance, Purva Punya and progeny. Any affliction to these 
houses is not good for progeny. If the seventh house is 
afflicted by Rahu, Sun and Mars, wife is dominant and 
quarrelsome. 

2. Lord of 1 or 7 should not be in 6, 8 and 12 from each 
other. This is likely to destroy the mental harmony. Lagna 
represents the individual, 7th represents his marriage. Both 
lords should be in harmony. See the two horoscopes below: 

Lady's horoscope 


In the horoscope above Lagna lord is Venus. Lagna lord or Venus 
in this case represents herself. This is placed in the third house. 
The 7th lord is Mars which represents her husband is placed in the 
10th house. Venus and Mars are in 6 and 8 positions from each 
other. If you count from Venus, Mars is in the eight and if you count 
from Mars Venus is in the 6th. This is known as 6/8 position and 
causes disharmony. In this horoscope herself (Venus) and her 
husband Mars (7th lord) are not in harmony with each other, which 
means they will not have a happy married life or will not stay 
together. 


Note: This is one of the factors causing disharmony in married life 
and should be used with caution. 


7 th House 135 


See another horoscope. This is horoscope of a male. Lagna 
lord is Mercury which is in the fourth house. Seventh lord 
is Jupiter which is in the eleventh house. Lagna lord and 
7th lord are in 8/6 and 6/8 position from each other. This 
boy did not have a happy married life. 

Horoscope : 


It has been observed that if this combination exists in the 
horoscope, it causes disharmony in the first marriage only. 

3. Capricorn Lagna, Saturn in the first aspecting mutually 
debilitated Mars in the 7th house gives loose morals. 

4. Satur in Lagna or 7 house in Pap Kartari Yoga gives 
unconventional marriage or marriage under compulsion. This 
is so called marriage of convenience. In this there is big 
role of Saturn and Ketu over Venus. 

5. 7th lord in 6 delays marriage in women but in 8 disturbs the 
marriage or gives serious mishap. Jupiter's aspect dilutes 
but does not nullify. 

6. In Aquarius Lagna Sun is the lord of seven. It should not be 
in the 6th where it denies marriage unless favourably 
aspected and Moon strong. 

7. In case of females afflicted 5 house aspected by weak or 
seriously afflicted 5 lord causes pre-marriage extra marital 
relations, especially when 7 lord is in 12, 8 or 3 (8 from 8) in 
7th house. 

8. Lord of Lagna weak, aspected by malefics in 7, gives more 
than one wife. In its Dasha/antra may cause her death 
also.

The combination of 5 and 7 lords is not good for marriage 
and. children. 


. Mars and Rahu in 8 may cause loss of husband in their 


Dashas. However. Jupiter's influence on 7th protects Ist 
Marriage. 

If lord of 7th is in 5 or 9, he will be married to a very 
fortunate lady. Though this is Raj Yoga. Kendra lord in a 
Trikona, Mantreshwar says lord of 7 in 5 makes one lose 
wife or children. 

Weak 7 lord in 9 in women's horoscope disturbs marriage. 
It may lead to divorce or judicial separation. This 
combination cancels engagement and leads to last minute 
change of groom. 

Mars in the horoscope represents sexual drive. Any 
affliction to it causes disturbance to married life. In women's 
horoscope if Mars is combust she cannot control her 
husband. 

Saturn and Venus in 8 or 10 with no benefice aspect. Or

Condition of Venus 
Venus is pointer to sexual life of native and kind of partner one is 
liable to get. Venus in favourable position ensures a happy married

Malefics in 4, 8, 12 from Venus are not good. 

According to Parasara malefics should not afflict Venus.

good for happy married life. In Aries and Scorpio, the signs 
of Mars causes immoral life and loss of reputation. In 
Cancer it makes the wife over indulgent and passionate. In 
Gemini especially Navamsa she is oversexed.

show the character of wife)

Venus in Aries: immoral, liaison with other women, loss of 
reputation. Immoral life further indicated if the sign is in twelve. 
With malefic influences becomes debauchee. Wife aggressive 
and cruel and has masculine tendencies. 

Aries is the male sign of Mars, a planet of aggression and 
force. Venus here is not happy and conducive to healthy sexual 
life. It gives lustful tendencies and excites carnal passions. It 
gives a wife that is haughty and quarrelsome. 

Venus in Taurus and Libra: if no malefic aspects are there 
wife is beautiful and dutiful and is fond of music and dancing. 
Venus in Gemini makes native oversexed. Many astrologers 
are of the opinion that Venus in Gemini causes a second marriage 
or disturbs married life. It may deny the satisfaction from 
children. However, wife is intelligent, learned, eloquent and 
fond of fine arts. 

Venus in Cancer: diseased body, passionate, overindulgent. 
Wife emotional and inconsistent. Person inclined to wine and 
women. :

artistic, a benefic aspect between Venus and Saturn gives a sober 
wife. But if the combination is malefic is bad and ends ultimately in 
divorce. 


128 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Benefic combination with Jupiter, wife virtuous and beautiful. 

With Sun makes her sexually active. Wife has royal tinge in 
the family. 

With Moon mood of sex and inconsistent. 

With Mercury intellectual sex. Thoughts of native colored with 
sex. Wife intelligent and young. 

Mars - Venus physical aspect of sex. Native very sexy. Wife 
haughty and youthful. 

Venus - Rahu secret love affairs. 

Venus-Ketu hypersensitive in sex. 

Rahu-Ketu under benefic influences gives a charming wife, 
though happiness in marriage is disturbed. 

These results are subject to influences of other planets. 

If afflicting planets are inimically disposed results get changed. 
If Mars afflicts, native is of loose character and wife cruel. If 
Mercury does so, he is fond of obscene literature and wife has 
confused intellect. 


Venus in Different Houses 

1st House: Native is romantic, loves his wife. If it is afflicted 
with Mars in the sign Scorpio there is physical craving and no 
refinement. 

2nd House: Good family with dutiful wife. If afflicted greedy 
for money and good food. 

3rd House: unsatisfactory wife. 

4th House: flirt if afflicted. 

5th House: Romantic, too much given to female company, 
much desire for sex and gaiety. 

Afflicted by Mars too much passionate. With Saturn or in 
square to Saturn sorrow or disappointments in love. 

6th House: Immoral. 

7th House: marital happiness but as Karka for marriage it is 
not considered good (Karka in its own Bhava destroys marriage - 
however it has been observed that this rule does not apply to Venus 
in seven unless afflicted by malefics). 

It is said that Venus as lord of seven if afflicted makes one 
nymphomaniac having uncontrolled sexual urges. 


7th House 129 


8th house: illicit relations. If Venus is in trick houses wife is 
generally ill especially if it has no benefic influence. 

9th house: domestic happiness. This is good position for Venus. 

10th house: Good marriage. 

11th House: romantic. 

12th House: fond of sexual pleasures. If afflicted it is not 
good for happy married life. 


Unhappy Marriage 
1. Sun opposition or conjunct malefics-marriage disturbed 
especially in females and if afflicting planet is 7th lord. 

2. Sun, opposition, square to Moon no harmony - if afflicted worse. 

3. Jupiter 12 to Venus might make first marriage unhappy one, 
but Jupiter in second to Venus gives capable and devoted 
husband. 

4. Role of Venus: Venus is Karka for pleasure and comfort of 
married life. With Venus in its own house one has tendency to 
be over indulgent in sex but with one partner only. 

Venus in the enemy house gives little happiness from sex and 
matriage. A debilitated Venus may give only low born person 
as a partner. 

5. Luminaries Sun and Moon are enemies of Venus . If Moon is 
second to Venus and Sun is in the 12th to Venus there is no 
pleasure from married life. 

6. Venus Mars and Rahu is a combination for elopement with 
another person. 

7. Moon Venus opposition is not considered good for happy married 
life. ‚Äô 

8. Venus is Karka for love and sex and Moon is Karka for mind. 
Both should not be afflicted by Saturn or Mars.

significator of Marriage Venus is in these Rasis. When Venus 
is in dual rash and dispositor of mutable signs is exalted, 


7th House 133 


there are good chances for remarriage. 

Note: For second marriage Venus as Kalatrakarka should 
be strong in the horoscope. It should be exalted, in its own 
house, Vargottam, etc. If it is debilitated or otherwise 
afflicted second marriage does not happen. In the case of 
female horoscopes second marriage only happens if Mars 
as Karka for husbands is strong and other conditions and 
circumstances are there. In the case of 2nd marriage for 
Hindu girls predictions should be given with caution, as 
majority do not favour second marriage after death of first 
husband because of social conditions prevalent.

Marital Infidelity 

Following are the combinations garnered from various 
classical books which may lead to marital infidelity. However, before 
applying these rules it may be understood that no one combination 
can make a person immoral in sexual behaviour or steadfast in 
marital fidelity. The horoscope should be seen as a whole to arrive 
at any firm conclusion. 

Role of Venus : 

1. Venus should not be afflicted especially when it establishes a 
role with 7th house. If Venus is afflicted by Saturn the person 
does not care for moral customs and may have relations outside 
the caste. The affliction by Mars leads to uncontrolled sexual 
desires. Rahu's affliction leads to scandals. 

If Venus is in Ascendent debilitated or in interplanetary war and 
is also present in Lagna of the Navamsa the sexual desires 
become uncontrollable. 

2. Affliction of Venus by debilitated planets or planets in 
interplanetary war especially when 7th house is involved. 

3. Venus in Gemini Rasi: A large number of articles have been 
written on the role of Venus in Gemini Rasi. It is held that Venus 
in Gemini Rasi causes married unhappiness unless there is 
exchange of Rasi between Venus and Mercury. Venus in Gemini 
Navamsa gives problems after marriage and may lead to extra 
marital relations. However, it should be understood that this is a 
classical combination for artists and musicians also. 

4. Seventh eighth and ninth houses in a horoscope either from Lagna 
or from Moon should not be consequently occupied by malefics. 
This causes disturbance both before or after the marriage. 

5. Location of Saturn in 7th house in Navamsa chart gives 
unconventional marriage and also disturbs marital harmony. It 


136 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


may lead to post marriage marital infidelity. 
6. Interplanetary war between first and 7th lord is not good. 
7. In the female horoscope the placement of 7th lord in the 
9th is not considered good. It may lead to erratic sexual 
behaviour of husband. The husband may have two wives 
or have illicit relations outside marriage. It is called Saptni 
Yoga or Avaklatra Yoga. 
In female behaviour also there may be tendency to have many 
relations outside marriage if the lord is heavily afflicted. 

8. There should not be malefics in the 8th from Lagna, Moon 
or Venus. Eight is the house of sexual acts and should be 
free from affliction. 7 

9. Afflicted Mars also disturbs married life as it represents 

husband in a female chart and sexual drive in a male 
horoscope. 

10. The presence of Saturn in the 9th house is not considered 
good even when exalted or in a friendly house. It disturbs 
marriage. 

Opposition to Marriage: 

To judge whether there will be opposition to marriage always 
consult Varga chart Chathurthamsa or D/4. 

Also see Dasha scheme. If Rahu is misplaced say in 
Antardasha it is in 6, 8, and 12 from the Mahadasha lord the girl 
will run away from the house to get married. If Dasha - Antar 
Dasha lord are in Trikona reconciliation will take place. D/4 shows 
disturbance at home. In girl's horoscope check Dasha / Antar / 
patyantar at marriage and see from D/4 whether there is change in 
house or not, 4/10 house afflicted or not. 

See whether (Darakarka) is in 8th it will cause problems. In 
transit when Jupiter, Sat/Jupiter aspect Darakark time of marriage 
has come. (Jaimini aspects) 

Venus is comfortable in airy-earthy signs. Its debilitation can 
be ignored in Kendra-trikona. Sun is worst enemy in marital matters. 
Two together in fiery sign except in Sagittarius-marriage crumble 
in operating period of sub lord. Sub lord is more important. 

Lagna and Moon should be harmoniously placed from 7 / 
7 lord. 

Adverse placement of Moon or Lagna from 7/7 lord - and 
Venus are main factor for disharmony. Kendra, Trikona, 3/11 are 
good positions. 

Moon with 7/ Jlord and Venus direct or indirect association 
is cause for happy married life. 


7th House 137 


Operative period of sub lord is important- if enemy of Lagna 
or Moon and weak and afflicted contact with 7/7 lord or Venus is 
not good. - See Transit also if malefics planets are involved. 

Planets in seven-influence marriage, pay special attention to 
Lagna lord if in 7, and planets with it. 

Whatever Lagna, Sun and Moon have spiritual and mental 
base and as such are important. 

In male, Venus and Moon should not be afflicted. 

In female Saturn should not afflict Mars and Sun and Venus. 

Benefics in 9 house bring help from relations of wife. Malefics 
cause trouble. 


Mangali Dosha or Kuja Dosha 

The concept of Mangal Dosha or Kuja Dosha is the most dreaded 
and most misunderstood concept in matching the horoscopes in 
Astrology. The untrained and unskilled astrologers misuse this to 
the hilt and as a result many a parents of the prospective brides or 
grooms have sleepless nights in finding the right matches for the 
daughters and sons. As the conditions stand today, finding right 
matches for would be brides is an arduous task where women are 
paraded like cattle for the scrutiny of would be bridegrooms. As it 
is, the parents of the girls have difficult time in finding right matches 
for the daughters, the concept of Kuja Dosha compounds the 
problem by restricting the choice, thus adding to their miseries. As 
a result they have sometime to falsify the horoscopes thus 
compounding the problems and making. It still worse. 


It is very interesting to note that classical texts on Jyotish 
hardly make a reference to the Kuja Dosha. They only make a 
passing reference to results of Mars in different houses. 

What is Kuja / Mangali Dosha 

Kuja or Mangal is another name for Mars, the most malefic planet 
in the horoscope. It is said that if it is located in houses 2nd, 12th, 
4th, 7th and 8th house in the horoscope of a girl it will lead to the 
death of the husband or if it is in the horoscope of a male it will kill 
his wife. The basis for this is following Sanskrit Shloka: 


Dhanvyaye or patale jamitre or ashtame kuja: 
Strinma bhartri vinashach bhartarunam strivishanam 


which means if Mars is in the 2nd, 12th, 4th, 7th and 8th house in 
the horoscope of a female, the death of the husband will occur. 


138 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Similarly placed in husband's horoscope leads to death of wife." 
Some scholars are of the opinion that 1st house should also be 
included because from here Mars aspects the 7th house. 
These houses have to be judged from 1) Lagna, 2) Moon (it is 
alternate Lagna and represents mind and 3) Venus, as Venus is the 
Karka for sex. 

The Dosha is strongest from Venus, little less strong from 
Moon and least strong from Lagna. 


Why these houses : 
1. Mars in the Ist House: it is bad because from here it aspects 
the 7th house of marriage, the fourth house of mental peace and 
eighth house of longevity of marriage (as it is 2nd from 7th, the 
house of marriage). 
2. Mars in the 2nd House: The second house represents 
Kutumba or family. From here it also aspects the eight and hence it 
is bad for longevity of marriage. 
3. Mars in the 4th House: Fourth rules domestic happiness or 
peace of mind, from here it aspects 7th house. 
4. Mars in the 7th House: The 7th house represents house of 
marriage, or husband/wife. 
According to Phala Deepika with Mars in the 7th, person wanders 
on roads and loses his wife. 
According to Saravalli the subject's wife dies, he will be unhappy 
and leads a sinful life. 
5. Mars in the 8th: Eight represents longevity of husband or wife. 
It is also house of 'Mangalaya‚Äô (Saubhagya). 
Mars in the eighth house has been universally condemned in the 
astrological literature. It is supposed to give following results 
i) It is said to effect the longevity of the person or the spouse. 
ii) Accidents, injuries to the person may happen. 
iit) One gets hindrances in all walks of life. It is said that well 
placed planets in Kendras and Trikonas are not able to give full 
effect because of the placement of the Mars in the eighth. 
Exceptions : 
1) For Kanya (Virgo) Lagna Mars in its own house gives a 
long life. 


7th House 139 


2) For Mesha (Aries) Lagna. Mars again gives long life. 

3) For Mithun (Gemini) it is exalted and again gives long life. 
However, according to K.N. Rao. Mars in the 8th also gives 
landed property, being significator of land in the house of 
inheritance. 

ii) It gives some additional source of money (fair or unfair means) 

iii) There is some injury or accident. 

iv) In married life it gives some problem relating to health of self, 
spouse or children. 

6. The 12th represents Say anna Sukha, pleasures of bed or 
sexual enjoyments. Mars from here aspects the 7th house of 
marriage. 

Therefore, the placement of Mars in these houses is detrimental to 

the spouse and hence is known as Kuja Dosha. 


Cancellation of Kuja Dosha. 

i) It is believed that if such a Dosha is found in both the 
horoscopes of bride and bridegroom the Dosha gets cancelled. 

ii) If one of them has Mars in Lagna, the 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th or 12th, 
and the other Saturn, Rahu or Ketu in any one of the above 
houses then too the defects gets cancelled. 

iii) It is also believed that this Dosha does not operate after 28 
years of life. 

Unfortunately, the family Pundits attach too much importance to 

this one factor in matching of horoscopes whereas there are many 

other negative or positive factors to be assessed before an 

announcement is made about the compatibility . It has been observed 

that in hundreds of horoscopes there is no kuja Dosha yet the 

marriages have broken down or spouses have died. Similarly there 

are horoscopes where Kuja Dosha is present yet the couples have 

had long happy married life. 

What is important is that horoscope should be seen in totality and 

other factors for a happy marriage life should be assessed. For 

example in choosing the match for a girl the emphasis in the 

horoscope of would be bridegroom should be 

1) He should have a long life 

2) He should be able to financially support the family. 

3) He should be of sound morals 

4) Married life should be happy 


140 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Similarly for choosing a bride the emphasis should be on 

i) High morality and good looks. 

ii) Behaviour and capacity for adjustment. 

iii) Happy married life. 

iv) Belief in religion and traditional values. 

v) Ability to look after children and give them fine upbringing. 

vi) Long, disease free life. 

While matching horoscopes the basic astrological principles must 

be kept in view. These are 

ry) Benefics in Kendras and Trikona are good and promote 
happiness. They also give long life. 

ii) Malefics in 3, 6 or 11 promote happiness by lending strength 
to the horoscope, keeping in check the manifestation of 
negative factors. 

Dr. B.V Raman's view as given in his book "Electional Astrology‚Äù 

is quoted here for guidance. 

"Granting that Kuja Dosham is a factor whose occurrence should 

not be ignored, there are antidotes which are not generally known 

to the rank and File of Hindu Astrologers.‚Äù The exceptions as stated 
by him are: 

1. In the 2nd house Mars is not bad in the signs of Mercury that 

is Gemini and Virgo. 

2. In the 4th Mars does not give rise to. "Mangal Dosha‚Äô in its 
own signs Aries or Scorpio. 

3. Inthe 7th Mars does not give any Dosha in the signs of Cancer 
and Capricorn. 

4. In the 8th it does not give rise to Dosha in the signs of Jupiter 
Le. Sagittarius or Pisces. 

5. In the 12th house there is no Dosha in the signs of Venus i.e. 
Taurus or Libra. 

6. According to him there is no Kuja Dosha in the sign Leo or 
Aquarius. And Dosha is counteracted by the conjunction of 
Mars and Jupiter or Mars and Moon. 

7. Mars does not confer Dosha, if it is exalted or is in its own 
house or its exaltation Navamsa. It is harmless in Cancer or 
Leo. 

‚ÄòShantis' to be prescribed: Many shantis or remedial measures 

are prescribed for 'Manglik‚Äô Girls especially of Ashtam Mangal. 

These are Kumbh Vivah. Savitri and 'Mangal Gauri Vats". These 


7th House 141 


should be performed under proper guidance. 
Let us test these rules by giving some examples

7th House 13 


Unpleasant Results of Mars in the 4th house : 

1. All classical books have condemned Mars in the 4th house 
unless it is exalted or in its own house when it gives rise to 
Mahapurusha (Ruchaka) Yoga. It destroys domestic happiness. 

2. It is the strongest negative factor of a horoscope. It hinders 
the flow of other effects or good Yogas. 


3. There is no happiness from friends. 

4. Nagging financial troubles, bad house to live in which may catch 
fire. 

5. Is cruel, lacks in gratitude, is troublesome to parents and is in 
debt. 


The horoscopes were matched properly, there was no death of 
spouse. The marriage lasted even after 20 years of marriage. 
Though the defects were cancelled out, yet the marriage was not 
happy. The husband says wife is mentally unbalanced (see fifth 
house). They had a bitter and acrimonious married life with all charm 
of married life missing and eventually decided to separate and live 
apart. 

Conclusion: It has been a very unhappy marriage. Mars in the 
4th house of both (cancelling Dosha) has given them sufficiently 
long married life. But it has been married life with all bitterness and 
quarrels because the 7th house/lords are also afflicted.

Matching of Horoscopes for Marriage 


Before matching of the horoscopes it is necessary that both 
horoscopes of the girl and boy be individually examined as regards 
7th and 8th house. In this particular emphasis should be given to the 
role of Venus, the Karka for marriage and Mars the significator of 
energy, force or sexual drive. It is also necessary to examine 4th 
house for mental peace and happiness and 5th house for ability to 
procure children. Many a marriages are floundered for lack of 
children. Horoscopes should also be scrutinized for a healthy and 
long life his horoscope is good for earning decent amount of money 
to be able to support the family. 


In brief following points should be observed in individual 
horoscopes: 

1. Seventh house and seventh lords should be free from major 
afflictions. 

Venus should not be afflicted. 

Fourth house, the house of happiness should be strong. 
There should not be major affliction to the 5th house. 
Horoscopes should be matched for Kuja Dosha. 

In male horoscope it is necessary that he should have good 
earning capacity.

i) Aadi Nadi has Nakshatras Ashvini, Ardra, Punarvasu, U Phalguni, 
Hasta, Jyeshta, Moola, Satabhisha, Poorva Bhadarpad 

ii)Madhya Nadi: Nakshatras are Bharni, Mrigsira, Pushya, P Phalguni, 
Chitra, Anuradha, Poorvaashada, Dhanishta, Uttarabhadrapad. 
iii)Antya Nadi has Nakshatras Krittika, Rohini, Ashlesha, Magha, 
Swati, Vishakha, Uttar Ashadha, Shravan and Revati. 

Boy and girl should not belong to same Nadi. If they belong to 
different Nadis give 8 points. 


If bride belongs to Bharni Nakshatra and boy belongs to Chitra 
Nakshatra it is same Nadi and is called Nadi Dosha 

Exceptions: If boy and girl have same Janam Rasi but different 
Nakshatra there is no Nadi Dosha. Example both have their Moon 
in Gemini, one is born in Ardra Nakshatra but other is born in 
Punarvasu Nakshatra, hence there is no Nadi Dosha. 

In case both are born in same Nakshatra but different Rasi, still 
there is no Nadi Dosha For example both are born in Krittika 
Nakshatra, but one is born in Aries Rasi and other in Taurus - 
hence there is no Nadi Dosha. Krittika, one in Aries other in Taurus 
no Dosha. 


111) Both may be born in same Nakshatra but in different Charnas 
even then there is no Nadi Dosha. 


7th House 151 


Boy's Nakshatra immediately after girl's Nakshatra is considered 
inauspicious, For example boy's Nakshatra is Pushya whereas girl's 
Nakshatra is Punarvasu. 

This matching is not enough.

One should see longevity of both from their individual charts 
See also Longevity from each other chart. Any combination 
for widowhood in one‚Äôs chart must have a similar combination 
in other chart which will cancel out the Dosha 

Examine in both the horoscopes houses 2,4, 5,7 and 12Twelfth 
house for pleasures of the bed. 

Dasha in both charts are important and must be analyzed. 
Kootas should be analyzed in the end only. 

Match house wise Dosha. If Mars is in the 7th house of a 
horoscope, it is important that it should be in the 7th in other 
horoscope also. 


Marriage - Destructive Nakshatras 

Dr. Raman in his book MuhUrata says "It is common belief that 
girls born under the influence of certain destructive Nakshatras 
bring out the death of certain relatives of husband." 


l. 


For example girl born in Jupiter's Nakshatra Vaishakha Libra 
(3) and Scorpio (1) brings destruction of husband's younger 
brother, so an effort is made to find a groom who has no 
younger brother. Even when the horoscope is good it is rejected 
on this ground. 

However, it should be noticed that only last quarter of Vaishakha 
is evil and not the other three Padas. 

Birth in Moola and death of father-in-law: Boy or girl in 
the first quarter of Moola Nakshatra (in Sagittarius Rasi) is 
supposed to cause death of father-in-law. But birth in last three 
quarters of Moola is beneficial. 

Birth of a girl in Ashlesha (Cancer Rasi) is supposed to cause 
death of mother-in-law. It should be noted that only first quarter 
is bad. 

Girl born in Jyeshta is supposed to cause death of elder brother 
of husband. Again only first quarter is bad. 


From first column downwards find the birth Nakshatra of girl. From that point horizontally trace boy's Nakshatra. This gives you total point.

Sins. 
Intrigues and scandals. 
Enmity. 
Death, sudden and untimely, cause of death, total

committed in past births. 
9. Calamities, Stealing. 
10. Secret enemies. 
11. As 2nd from 7th, shows earning of wife. 
12. Obstacles. 
13. According to sage Sattyacharya, this also deals with 
enemies. 
14. Accusations, intrigues and scandals. 
15. Interest in occult sciences. 
16. Diseases of secret parts and generative system. 
If 8th lord aspects its own house and also 1 1thhouse it 
gives victory over rivals. 
Eighth house rules longevity or duration of matriage. 
Cluster of planet in 8 especially benefics give much wealth 
8th forms part of Adhi Yoga.

"Whenever, 8th lord is stronger than Lagna and the 10th 
lords, native is subject to scandal or disgrace‚Äù. - R Laxmanan 
8th lord in different Houses 
The placement of 8th lord in any house excepting its own house 


NANA WN 


Sth House 155 


does not give good results. It is basically a lord of hindrances. 
Eighth lord with Markesh in any house causes death accident. In 
malefic houses 3, 6, 8 and 12 this could mean self created death or 
suicide. Even in malefic Rasis/ houses this could mean suicide. 
1st House 

According to Parasara 8th lord in the first makes health suffer, 
gives wounds and makes a person detractor of gods and Brahmins. 
It also gives (i) poverty (ii) debt (iii) bad health and (iv) displeasure 
of govt. superiors. 

This rule does not apply to Aries and Libra Ascendants where 
lord of eight and Lagna are the same. In Aries it is Mars and in 
Libra it is Venus. The lords of eight in these cases will not damage 
the house but will give good results like health of the native will be 
good, he will have legacies and a long life. Similarly in Pisces 
Ascendant, the eighth lord Venus will be exalted in the first House 
and the person will be rich, handsome with a commanding 
personality and long life. 

Strong eight lord in Ascendant gives long life. 
2nd House 
He will have problems of eye, tooth. Will have no time to eat good 
food. According to Parasara he will be devoid of physical vigour 
and will possess little wealth and will not regain lost wealth. But 
eight lord in two will be aspecting its own house the eight and 
hence in that case will give inheritance, hidden wealth and long 
life. 

This position is not good for family life where the wife and 
children will be separated in case other factors are there. 
3rd House 
Third is 8lh from 8th ie. in the third house it is very conducive to 
long life. But aspect of 8th lord on 9th may ruin the prospects of 
father as aspects of 8th or 6th lord carries dangerous implications. 
Native may have Enmity with his father, problem with brothers 
fears, and mental anguish. According to Parasara he will be devoid 
of vigour and will have no servants. 
4th House 
Will cause problems for mother. May be he is devoid of mother or 
his mother does not have good health. There will be no finances 
and peace of mind. It will be a problem to have a house, lands or 
conveyances. Vehicles will be stolen or there might be accidents. 
Will be betrayed by friends. 


156 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Fifth House 
According to Parasara native will be dull witted. He will have few 
children and be long-lived and wealthy. 

Commenting on this Girish Chand Sharma in Brihat Parasara 
Hora Shastra says 

"That the native having this combination will be prompted 
to study history, ancient languages like Greek, Latin, or Sanskrit 
because the eighth house is the house of dead objects and the fifth 
house is the house of education. In Gemini and Virgo Ascendants, 
the 8th lord being placed in the 5th house will be in his sign of 
exaltation. In the Leo and Aquarius Ascendants, the 8th lord, being 
placed in the 5th house, will be in his own sign. Therefore, benefic 
effects will be gained in these Ascendants, in Pisces Ascendant 
this combination makes the native a mining engineer." 
6th House 


In case the 8th lord is placed in the 6th house, the native will win 
over his opponents, will have a diseased body and in childhood he 
will face danger through snakes and water. 

The danger of snakes will be potent if Rahu is also involved, 
as Rahu is Karka for snakes. In modern times snakes could also 
mean poison or poisonous drugs. The persons who die of wrong 
administration of drugs have this combination. 
7th House 
Native will have two wives and if it is in conjunction with a malefic 
there will certainly be loss in his trade. 

It is not clear as to the meaning of two wives. In modem 
times it is not possible to have more than one wife. Most probably 
this will apply after the death of first wife or after having divorced 
first wife. Since the 8th lord spoils the significance of 7th house it 
certainly means the first marriage is on the rocks. 

This is also a combination for separation or divorce. "In 
the ending of any marriage the role of 8th house or planet in 
the 8th is well known" - K.N. Rao 
8th House 
Will be long lived. If the 8th lord is weak, the longevity will be 
medium and the native will be a thief, be blameworthy himself and 
will blame others as well. 
9th House 
Native will be betrayer of his religion and a heterodox, he will be 
the husband of a wicked wife and will steal others wealth. 


Sth House 157 


10th House 

Lack of paternal bliss, will be a talebearer and be bereft of livelihood. 
These predictions should not be given if there is a benefic aspect. 
11th House 

Will be devoid of wealth, be miserable in boyhood but happy in later 
life. Conjunction of 8th lord with benefics will give a long life. 
12th House 

If the 8th lord is situated in the 12th house, the native will squander 
his wealth on evil deeds, be short lived, more so if it is in conjunction 
with a malefic planet. 

Planets in 8th House 

Phala Deepika. "If malefics tenant Trikas from any Bhava they 
destroy the Bhava in question. If they are benefics their benevolence 
is much reduced.‚Äù 

Sun 

This is not the good position for natural significator of soul to be. He 
is crafty impostor and lewd. His life is hard and difficult. Travels 
widely and associates with low women. Eats unscrupulously. 
Squanders his wealth on women and by thefts. Secret vice brings 
infectious diseases and poor health. Neither can he make other 
people's life happy, nor his own. Meets with sudden death. 

The native is handsome, indolent, prodigal, spendthrift, travels 
wide and is quarrelsome. Weak eyesight, has few children, violent 
sick and hard working. Early death. Wandering aimlessly without 
food and business. Legacy from superiors. 

Diseases: piles, sudden death due to heat, fever, bile or 
weapon, the father of the native dies. In a female chart husband 
may die first, vice versa, in a male chart. 

Wife or husband spend thrift. If in sign Aquarius inheritance. 
Same results in Taurus. In Leo extravagant. 

Moon 

Fear of chronic diseases and strong enemies. kings, thieves. In a 
malefic sign makes one short lived. If in own sign or of Venus or 
Sagittarius or of Mercury suffering from asthma, eye diseases, chills, 
rheumatism and epilepsy. Indigestion, hernia, j aundice, piles, diabetes, 
dysentery and blood poisoning. Intelligent, of charitable nature, 
imposing personality and jovial. In Cancer and own sign native is

the day and Moon is in dark half or if birth is in the night and the 
Moon is in bright half. The Sun should not be within 30 degrees

either side of the Moon. 

Short Life and Mode of Death: Moon in the last day of 
the dark half or too close to Sun gives short life. 

It indicates death in public place, by drowning, shipwreck, 
road accident, public calamity. Separation from family members 
due to wife. 

If well aspected inheritance from women or from mother's 
family. Tendency of occultism is heightened -gives psychic powers. 
Is a great yogi, and devotee if Moon is in Aquarius. Gemini, Libra 
or Cancer. 

In Aries, Leo and Sagittarius inherits great wealth. 

Mars 

This is not a good position for Mars. Officers with Mars in the eight 
take lot of bribe and are not caught. In women's horoscope it may 
mean death of husband as it is 8th from 7th. According to Chamatkar 
Chintamani if Mars is in Lagna, other benefics like lupiter or Venus 
placed in the house of fortune become ineffective. Friends become 
enemies, all efforts become useless. Even brothers and sisters 
behave like enemies. Gives misfortune in business. 

Mars in the 8th house indicates violent or sudden death. In 
watery signs death by drowning, in fiery signs death by fire or 
violence, in airy signs death by mental affliction or accidental air 
journey. 

Diseases; In eight it gives incurable diseases, vulgar speech, 
venereal diseases, disorders of blood and ulcers. Leper, ugly and 
viscious. Biliousness, kidney, bladder trouble if Mars is in malefic 
sign or is aspected by malefics. Initially glutton, later on indigestion, 
malaria, hemiplegia and blood pressure. 

If Mars is aspected by Sun. Moon and Satur it gives a 
short life. Well placed Mars gives success in Hatha Yoga and makes 
one a politician. 

Mercury 

Mercury gives wealth and fame; it is part of Adhi Yoga. It gives 
longevity, good reputation and wealth. He is famous for his qualities, 
liked by women. If the Sun is in the vicinity of Mercury enjoys royal 
favours and public reputation. Truth loving, honours the guests and 
has a distinguished personality. Gets wealth from the state. Famous 
and rich. Has land and property. End is peaceful. 

Afflicted ungrateful, vicious, sexy, liar and ailing. In female 
chart worries due to financial difficulties with husband and partners.

8th House 159 


Diseases given by Mercury: Afflicted by Mars and 
Saturn it gives brain or nervous disorders. Acute pain in thigh or 
stomach. Short life if debilitated or in enemy sign. 

Jupiter 

Asura Yoga 

Whenever Jupiter or for that matter Venus or both occupy the eight, 
the Yoga known as Asura Yoga is cause. 

Result: One becomes mean, talebearer, will spoil other's 
work, and will be self-interested. He will be head-strong, do vile 
acts and will become miserable. Yoga is more malefic when planet 
is debilitated or retrograde. 

He will be unhappy, generous and long lived (benefic in 8th 
give long life). May do ignoble things, but pretends to be noble. 
Suffers from colitis. Has peaceful death.

As a natural benefic its position in eight is not good excepting a 
benefic in the house of longevity gives a long life and as a benefic 
its aspect on 2nd house of wealth is good, where it also forms part 
of adhi Yoga. But as Karka for marriage its relegation to eight is not 
beneficial for a happy married life. Venus afflicted by Saturn may 
cause impotency and unclean habits.

Saturn 

As a natural malefic it is not good in the 8th house. Its aspect on 
tenth is not good for profession, on 2nd is not good for wealth and 
on 5th is not good for progeny. But as Ayush Karka Saturn in the 
&th gives long life. 

Suffers great loss of wealth, sudden separation from own people.

loss of wealth and health. 

Lives in a foreign land.

death in old age. Gain by marriage or through business partnership 
or legacy.

Chapter IX 
Ninth House 


House of Dharma, Father and Long Journey 


The name given to 9th house is Bhagyasthan and Dharma which 
means place of fortune and religion. As such this house deals with: 
1. Fortune, prosperity. 
2. Righteousness, preceptor (teacher, Guru). 
3. Father, grand children. 

Western astrology treats 10th house as the house of father 
as it is opposite to the fourth which is house of mother. However, in 
Hindu astrology 9th house is the house of Guru as well as father. In 
ancient India father was the Guru as such 9th house is being treated 
as house of father. Observations have also shown that treating 9th 
house for father gives better results. However, longevity of the 
father may be seen from the 10th house as it is 2nd from nine. 

4. Intuition and forethought. 

5. Dharma, religion, sympathy, godliness, places of worship. 

6. Fame, charities, leadership. 

7. Long journeys and foreign travel. Purva Punya. 

8. Metaphysical studies, law, philosophy, science and 

literature. 

9. Lasting fame, charities, leadership. 

10. Imagination. 

11. Higher education. 

12. Knees.

Early Death of Father 

Sun is significator for father for day birth, while Saturn is treated as 

significator for father for night birth.

soon leads to death of father. This rule does not apply if there 
are benefic aspects. This will be more likely if houses involved 
are 9th or 10th. 

2. The child's father and paternal grand father will die early if 
Sun is in the ascendant with Mars and Saturn without benefic 
aspect of Mercury, Jupiter and Venus - Phala Deepika. 

If Sun is hemmed between two malefics or is conjoined with malefics 

one born in day time loses his father early. This may also happens if 

Sun has Mars and Saturn in the 8th without benefic influence. 

In the case of night birth if the 8th from Saturn is occupied by Mars 

and Rahu or Sun it is not good for the longevity of father. Hence 8th 

from Sun for the day birth and 8th from Saturn for night birth should 
be free from malefic influences. 

If the Sun/Saturn is in movable Rasi the father may die from poison 

or weapons. He may also be away at the time of birth of child.

Tenth House 


House of Karma, Honour and Fame 


The tenth house is Karamasthan and deals with: 

1. Means of livelihood, profession. 

2. Rank, authority, command. 

3. Fame, if lord of ten is strong, tenth house has aspect of 
benefic planets or is hemmed in by benefits, one becomes 
famous and has good reputation. Malefic planets here give 
ill repute and make profession suffer. 

4. Honours and titles from the ruler. 

5. Pilgrimage. 

6. Reputation and responsibilities. 

According to Uttarkalamitra tenth house also deals with 
i) Work with the government.

In Western astrology 1 Oh house is house of father as it is opposite 
to fourth, the house of mother. However, in Vedic astrology generally 
the 9th house is treated for father as 9th house is House of Guru 
and in ancient times father was Guru. Sage Parasara treats 9th 
house as house of father. But since 10th is second or ‚ÄòMarka‚Äô for 
9th sometimes father's longevity is also seen from 10th house.

Role of Education and Modern Professions 

In the competitive world of today the high academic career becomes 
sine qua non of a good and lucrative profession. Before a judgement 
is pronounced on the profession it becomes necessary to determine 
the academic background and achievements of the person 
concerned. For this we will study the Fifth house and its lord. Though 
Jatak Parijat assigns education to the 4th house and discusses the 
combination that give rise to great learning, but Jatak Parijat also 
calls 5th house as house of intelligence. Parasara, however, mentions 
5th house as dealing with learning and high intelligence. In Jaimini 
the 2nd and the 5th house are referred to as dealing with education 
and learning. 


Uttarkalamitra and Sarvarth Chintamani give education to the 2nd 
house. It may be so because the second house deal with Kutumbha 
or early childhood, so this house deals with earlier part of education. 
The fourth house represents mind and its lord is Moon. If mind is 
not sound there is hardly any scope for receiving good education. 
In natural Zodiac 4th house has been assigned to Moon which is 
Karka for mind, hence the importance of this house for education. 
Modern professional courses will have to be judged from the fifth 
house/lord. In natural zodiac it is house of 'Purva Punya‚Äô' and its 
lord is Sun who represents Atma, the things divine. Sun is giver of 
light and Karka of success and fame. Hence importance of the 5th 
house and 5th lord/karka for success in day to day fife. 

Jupiter - is Karka for 9th house, wisdom and religion. 

For judgement of high academic achievements the important planets 
are Sun, Mercury. Jupiter and Moon. Saturn becomes necessary 
for giving perseverance and ability for hard work.

How to Study Profession from the horoscope 

(Based on article published in Journal of Astrology April - 

June 2000 by K.N. Rao) 

The profession is judged by locating the key planet which is either; 
i. Tenth house, lord of tenth house, planets in the 10th house, 


aspects of planets on the 1 Oth house. Tenth house should 
be seen from Lagna, Moon and Sun, whichever is the 
strongest. Bhatotpala and Gargi are of the opinion that tenth 
house from Lagna and Moon both should be studied as a 
person may have income from various sources and not 
merely from the stronger of the two. 


ii. Lord of Navamsa of the 1 Oth lord, again from Lagna. Moon 


and Sun whichever is the strongest. 

Planets influencing Lagna, lord of Lagna. 

Planets involved in making Yogas with Moon and Sun like 
Sunapha, Anapha, Vasi, Vesi etc. They will tell us the source 
of income. 

In addition notice should be taken of following. 

Second and eleventh houses show nature and quantum of 
income The planets placed here indicate nature of wealth 
earned. 

Fifth house to study the pattern of education and the 
intelligence of the person concerned. Fourth house is also 
important: pleasure derived from the profession. Rahu and 
Ketu axis in the 4th sometimes show profession in 
engineering. Fourth is also seen for education. 

Dashas and Antra Dashas prevailing give us a clue. 
Study of Yogas: Yogas are also important. Important Yogas 
will give clue lo nature of profession. Saraswati Yoga will 
make a person inclined to fine arts. Presence of Lakshmi 
Yoga and strong eleventh house will make one involved in 
business. 'Nabhas' Yogas also give a indication to the nature 
of profession. 

In prediction special significance is attached to Uppachaya 
houses, 3. 6, 10 and 11. Planets in them assume special 
power. That is why benefics in 3, 6, 10 and 11 give birth to 
‚ÄúVasumati Yoga‚Äô, which gives plenty of wealth. For the 
people who are in service the 6th house gets additional 


188 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


importance as it is 9th to 10th and 10th to 9th house. 
6. Use of Jamini Astrology in determining profession and extent 
of rise. Here Uppada and Karkamsa Lagna are important. 
7. In addition to Rasi chart use will be made of Vargas 
especially Navamsa and Dasamsa. Navamsa should be 
read for all type of predictions and Dasamsa especially for 
profession. 
Sources of Income and Profession: 
According to Varahamihira, see (10th from Lagna, Moon and Sun) 
and find out which is strongest of the three. This would show 
profession. This also applies to lord of the Navamsa of 10th lord if 
there is no planet in the 10th. Out of the three, Lagna, Moon, or Sun 
the planet whoever is strongest will suggest the profession. If it is: 
Sun

Mantras (e) Wool (f) Grain (g) Juices

doctors, scents, ambassador, law suits, ruby, metal works. Trees, 
timber, forest, fire, firearms. If Sun is exalted money is earned by 
self-acquisition. Banking auditing and stock exchange. 
State Services, administration and management. Persons in authority. 
A strong Sun in the 10th house, aspected by benefics raises a person 
to great social, political and economic heights by his own effort. 
A weak Sun aspected by malefics leads to many obstacles and 
frustrations in life. 
Connection of Sun with Saturn is not a good combination, and causes 
difficulties in career especially if Sun is within 7¬∞ of Saturn. 
Good aspect of Saturn makes one a high government officer. Sun 
in Scorpio may make one a famous doctor. 
Sun-Moon - Political Science, psychology, metaphysics. 
Sun-Mars: Politician, diplomatist, army, government servant, iron 
steel industries, sugar refining, agriculture, jute mills.

may be confusing. In such cases help should be taken from the 
method used by Jaimini. Here Atma Karka, Amatya Karka and 

Karkamsa Lagna become the focal points. This method is being 

explained separately.

Timing Promotion or Confirmation in Service 

These are important principles taught by K.N. Rao and taken from 

his book 'Ups and Down in Career‚Äô. 

Laws: 1. In every horoscope analyze the Yogas first. 

In case of pronouncing judgement on promotion or elevation 

in status first see how many Raj Yogas are there in the 

horoscope. According to K.N. Rao these Raj Yogas are nearly 

25. The more such Yogas are present in the horoscope the greater 

is the rise. If majority out of these are present, the person 

rises to dizzy heights. 
2. When some of these are present, combinations are capable 
of bestowing glory and enhance the status of the person. 

Double Transit : 

When the above two conditions, i.e. the presence of Yogas and 

operation of favourable Dasha, Antardasha are operative double 

transit phenomenon should be brought into consideration. This double 


200 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


- transit phenomenon is a favourable transit of Saturn and Jupiter 
as follows. 
(a) Jupiter: In transit, Jupiter should be aspecting the Moon or 
the 10th house from Moon or the Lagna. The transit of 
Jupiter in a trine from Lagna or the Moon is also a 
favourable position but importance should be given to Jupiter 
in the 10th from Moon or from Lagna or the Jupiter's aspect 
on the 10th house from the Moon or the Lagna. 
(b) Saturn: Satum should be aspecting the 10th lord whenever 
anything important is to happen. Saturn's aspect on the 
10th lord should be treated as only a part fulfillment of the 
promise.

Jupiter: At the time of her elevation, Jupiter was in the 1 Oth from

Saturn: Saturn from Scorpio was aspecting her 10th lord Jupiter in

Gain and Loss of Power 

According to Varahamihira. 

"The person gets the royal power in the Antardasha of the most 
powerful planet who combines in the 10thor of the Ist. He loses 
that power in the Antardasha of the planet who is unfriendly or 
Neecha house because such period is called Chidra Dasha. Then 
he must seek protection from a powerful king.‚Äù Varahamihira 
Take a planet in the first or 10 and whichever is the stronger predict 
acquisition of power during that Antardashaa. If there are no planets 
in the first or the tenth find out which of the lord is strongest and 
ascribe the power to him during his Antardasha. Such kingly power 
or office will be lost when the Antardasha of a planet, which 
occupies an unfriendly or debilitated Rasi, intervenes. 

This is called Chidra Dasha, which means accident or misfortune 


202 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


as well as hole, and therefore he gets into unfortunate position by 
losing his power. 
Obstruction in Career 
1. IfKalasarpa or Kemadruma Yoga has anything to do with 
10, 9, or 6 or their lords there is obstruction in career. 
2. Combination or mutual exchange of Mars and Saturn, Sun 
and Saturn, lords of 12 or 10, 8 and 10 create obstructions. 
3. Afflicted lords of 6,9 and 10 or when they are in 'Papkartari‚Äô 
Yogas. 
Transfers 
In natal or horary astrology houses 1,4,7 and 10, the four Kendras 
are involved in transfers. 
Ascendant is personality, 4th his welfare and affliction to 10thhouse 
is transfer. 
Chatturthamsa should always be considered. 
(Greater auspicious results occur in the major period of 3rd 
lord than in 10th lord if both are related- Bhavarth Ratnakar 
- see horoscope of Narsimha Rao) 
Three Dashas are considered important, of (i) 10th lord, ii) Lagna 
lord, iii) exalted planet. 
According to Parasara following results are expected in the Dasha 
of 10th lord. 
Dasha of the Strong 10th lord 
If lord of the 10 is exalted in an angle or a trine and be in the 
company of Jupiter, one will be endowed with worthy deeds. 
According to Parasara if 1 Oth lord is without strength one will face 
obstruction in work. 
One will gain in royal patronage and in business if 1Othlord is in 
conjunction with benefic planets. Opposite results will happen in 
reverse situation. 
Adverse Combinations 
i) Weak 10th lord - "If the 10th lord is in the 8th along with 
Rahu, the native will hate others, be a great fool and will do 
bad deeds." Parasara 
ii) Malefics in 10th - If the 10th and 11th are occupied by 
malefics one will indulge in bad deeds and will defile his 
own men. 
Lords of 10 and 3, combination-deprived of fortune in Dasha of 10 


10th House 203 


lord but will enjoy fortune in Dasha of 3rd lord. - Bhavarth Ratnakar. 
"When the 10th Bhava is inauspicious person will be void of honour 
or pride‚Äù. Jatak Parijat. 
Dasha Scheme; 
Dasha scheme is the unfolding of our Karmas. What is happening 
to us is nothing else but as depicted in the Dasha scheme. If one 
gets good Dashas of benefic planets or of good lordship like 5 or 9 
or 10 early in life one is bound to have good education. Dashas of 
lord of 6, 8 and 12 will disrupt education. 
For finding education related professions concentrate on 5th house, 
its lord, Karka and Dasha scheme. This will give very good results 
in determining profession. If lords of Mahadasha, Antar and 
Patyantra Dasha are linked with 5th house, the education is bound 
to be good. The planets Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu give technical 
oriented education. 
Fame Giving Combinations 
Strong 10th Lord and benefics in the 10th 
Planets in the 10th house have a great say in giving success and 
imparting a moral tinge as also give one rank and status. 
According to Parasara if 11thlord is in the 10th and the 10th lord is 
strong and there is aspect of Jupiter one gets fame. 
Other combination for fame according to Parasara is 10th lord in 
9th, Lagna lord in 10th and Moon in the 5th house. 
According to Phala Deepika if a benefic planet is placed in the 10th 
house or if the lord of the 1 Oth house is placed in Kendra Trikona, in 
its own sign or sign of exaltation, or when lord of Lagna is posited in 
the 10th house one becomes very famous. He is also engaged in 
meritorious deeds. He is fortunate like a king and has long lease of 
life. 
Combinations for Performance of Meritorious Deeds 
1. If four planets are placed in 10th house including lord of 
ten this gives birth to Sanyas Yoga. 
2. Many benefic planets in tenth house, Jupiter and Mercury 
in 10th house one perform meritorious deeds. 
3. Moon in 10th house and lord of ten strong one takes dips in 
holy Ganges 
4. IfRahu or Sun are in the 10th one bathes in Ganges. 


204 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


5. Meena or Pisces Rasi in the 10th Bhava and with Mercury 

and Mars one gets final emancipation. 
High Status 

1. If 10th lord from Lagna, Sun and Moon are inter related. 

2. Sun in 10 exalted or own house. 

3. Benefics in 2nd, 10 and 11 - financially very well off. 

4. Presence of Raj Yogas in the horoscope and their operative 
period, especially combination of Kendra Trikona lords. 
Mahabhagya Yoga, Rasi Parivartan Yoga, Neech Bhanga 

_Raj Yoga and Vipreet Raj Yogas. 

5. Use of Jaimini Astrology- Saturn or Mercury in 10th from 

Karkamsa Lagna are fame givers. 
Study also 2, 9 and 11 houses, wealth, luck and gains 
2nd for wealth, 9th for fortune and 11 for gains. 
Jupiter in 2 or 11 is promise of good money. 
Karka planets for crime are Rahu. Mars, Saturn and Ketu. Moon 
and Mercury should not be influenced by them. Tendencies 
intensified by Rahu - Saturn, Rahu Moon, and Rahu Mercury. Saturn, 
Rahu, Mars in 10 produces criminals, anti social, pickpockets, rapists, 
murderers, dacoits. 

Profession - Doctors 

The profession of medicine and curing people of diseases is 
considered to be noble profession. 'Vedo Narayano Hari‚Äô (doctor 
is god) 
According to Puranas God was born as Dhanvantari during the 
churning of the Milky Ocean, holding pot full of nectar to cure 
humanity. Charak and Sushruta were other names in the field of 
curative medicines or of medicines treating body Kava (body) and 
Vajikarna (rejuvenation). 
Emphasis on social service to humanity has changed these days to 
that of financial gains. From pure caring and looking to root cause 
of diseases the emphasis today is super specialisation and most 
expensive laboratory tests. The young and intelligent are now 
thinking of this profession for financial gain and status symbol rather 
than humility and social service. The change in emphasis would 
also mean change in planetary influences, so while basic combination 
in classical books relating to drugs might be the same the mental 
inclination as given in classical books may shift from role of Jupiter 


10th House 205 


as benign factor to aggressive role of malefics like Mars, Saturn 
and Rahu. 
In physicians or the persons who heal there is great deal of variety 
today. There are homeopaths, Ayurveda, naturalpathy cures, persons 
who care through Yogas etc. Then in medical profession also there 
are various branches like dermatology, heart specialists, urologists,. 
gynecologists, child specialists, neurosurgeons, oconnologists, doctors 
dealing with physiotherapy, management of public health etc.

below :

becomes important. Then there should be connection between 5th

between all these factors.

Profession - Business 


Business means money earned through own efforts via trade. A 
person will do business only if he has or is able to earn much profit. 
For which education is not so much important as business sense. 
1. So the businessmen will normally have plenty of Dhana Yogas 
and their 11thhouse would be strong. The 7th house is traditionally 
known as house of business and so is Tula Rasi. Tenth house will 
be involved in any case as it deals with occupation. A strong 10th 
house gives the ability to pursue right profession at the right time 
and make a success of it. The houses 2 and four are for accumulation 
of wealth. Their combination with 5th and 11 houses are good for 
wealth. If 5th and 12 houses are weak and so are Mercury and Sun 
there is tendency to accumulate money through illegal means. A 
weak Mars and a weak Saturn strengthen this tendency. This could 
be neutralized by a strong Jupiter. 


For the persons who make big empires in business and create new 
industries all the three Lagnas. Ascendant. Sun and Moon are very 
strong. These are the people who make new industries and roll in 
millions. 

The weak Lagna and weak Chandra Lagna are major handicaps 
for a person who wants to set up his own business. 

A weak Sun or Surya Lagna means lack of energy, poor stamina 
and vitality. It also means lack of initiative and gives a habit of 
dependence on others. They can't take vital decisions in life and 
avoid responsibilities. 

If one of the Lagnas is weak it should be compensated by the 
strength of the other. 

2. Businessmen must have plenty of enterprise, for this a strong 
Mars is necessary. 

3. Businessmen must be lucky also. They need a strong 9th house. 
4. Mercury is traditionally the planet of commerce. This should be 
strong. Venus has a role too, as it is also Goddess of wealth. 

5. A strong Jupiter is necessary for luck and a strong Saturn for 
perseverance and ability to do hard work. 

For persons who deal in jewellery combination of Venus Moon is 
necessary as it represents Jewellery. (Mercury Moon conjunction, 


10th House 247 


opposition or placement in 2/8 houses involves losses.) Rahu 
Mercury in | Oth house represent sudden gains as also sudden losses. 


Combinations given in Classical Texts 


1. According to Phala Deepika "Moon in Libra aspected by Venus 
makes one a trader. 


2. According to Hora Sara Moon in Libra makes the native clever 
in business. 


3. Again Moon in Virgo gives success in business. 


4. According to Jatak Tatwa Moon and Mars together promote 
business. 


5. The 10th lord in a Kendra, Trikona or in 1! house and aspected 
by benefics make the native a merchant trader. 


6. Maharishi Parasara has described Mercury and Moon belonging 
to Vaishya caste meaning those who deal with trade and agriculture. 
Mercury is significator for trade and Moon for agriculture. The 
planets Venus and Mercury belong to "Rajo Guna" meaning 
attached to worldly enjoyments. They represent desire longing and 
attachment. Thus Mercury and Venus give desire for earning money 
and enjoying so called good things of life including sexual 
attachments. 


7. According to Parasara Saturn belongs to "Shudra‚Äù class or 
meaning service in modern times. Its aspect on 1 Oth or 10th, lord is 
not good for starting one's own venture unless Saturn is strong. 


8. In classical books 'Dhana Yogas' have been defined. These 
have been given in a separate chapter on judgement of financial 
prosperity 

9. If there are five or more planets in the visible half, houses 7 to 12 
and 10th house and 10th lord is not aspected by Satum normally 
one is self independent in business. 

Same results occur if five or more planets are in 10, 11,12, 12 and 
3rd houses from Lagna. More than five planets in this position 
show the person has capability to pursue an independent vocation. 
10. There should be good Raj Yogas of Kendras and Trikonas 
combinations, which add strength to the horoscope.

Atma Karka 

Sun as natural Atmakarka 

Parasara: Out of all the Karkas Atmakarka is the most important 
and has the prime say on the native just as the king is the most 
famous among the men of his country and is the head of all affairs 
and is entitled to arrest and release men. 

Just as the Minister cannot go against the king, the other Karkas 
cannot predominate in the affairs of the native. If the Atma Karka 
is adverse, other Karkas cannot give their benefic effects. Similarly 
if Atma Karka is favourable, other Karkas cannot predominate with 
their malefic influences. 

Observations: Jaimini Atmakarka Sun the natural Karka for soul is 
normally very strong in the horoscopes of the blessed ones. 

Atma Karka is the most powerful planet. It is like the Sun around 
which other planets revolve. If the Atmakarka is in exaltation or

be liberated, will live in holy places and will get Moksha.

Parasara: If the fifth lord is in the 9th, native will be prince or equal 
to prince, will author treatises, be famous and shine in his race. 
Placement of 5th lord in 9th is good for authors. 

Vairagya 

‚ÄòVairagya' should be the base on which the whole edifice of 
spiritualism stands. Mahatma Budha would have become a great 
king Chakarvartin - king of kings if Vairagya was not in the 
horoscope. According to Adi Shankar Acharya state of Smadhi is 
easy for those who have intense Vairagya. Smadhi comes easily to 
the people who can control their mind. From Samadhi comes true 
Knowledge, from true knowledge one gets liberation and from 
liberation one gets bliss. 

Vairagya is result of Saturn, Rahu, on mind or the 4th house and 
Moon (Karka for mind.) 

In hundred per cent of the cases Moon had the aspect of Saturn, 
Mars or Rahu or in Rasis of Mars aspected by Saturn or vice 
versa. See this in drekkan as also in Navamsa. 

Role of Moon 

Moon occupying the drekkan of Mars and receiving aspect of Saturn 
is combination for renunciation. 

Moon, Ketu, Saturn, Jupiter, form a powerful combination for a 
Mahatma. If this combines with Atmakarka Sun, it gives knowledge 
of the Self attained through Bhakti. 

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu - (Radha Krishan Bhakti) In horoscope of 
Chaitanya. Moon the 12thlord (Sanyas) of the horoscope and Karka

Special Role of Ketu as Karka for Moksha and Spiritual bliss. 

In houses 5, 9, 12 from Lagna or Moon 

1) Dispositors of Rahu and Ketu should not be related for 
spiritual uplift. 

2) Ketu in the 5th and 9th kindles the power of mind. It should not 
be afflicted and its dispositor should be well placed. 

3) Ketu gives best results for spiritual upliftment with lord of Lagna.

Men/Women with a Mission in Life 


(Taken from an article by K.N. Rao published in Journal of Astrology 

October - December 1998). 

Whether a person is with a Mission or not can be proved by applying 

following tests. 

A good Second House 

The second house is the house Nivam or the house of ethical conduct. 

Malefics in it show either no mission or deceit in the guise and the 

pretensions of a Mission. 

"Tf the second lord is conjunct with malefics and if the second house 

has malefics, such a person indulges in backbiting, is a liar, and 

becomes a patient of Vaat Roga.‚Äù Parasara 

A good tenth House 

Parasara says again ‚ÄúIf there are malefics in the 10th and !1th 

houses the person indulges in lowly deeds and becomes hostile even 

to his kith and kin." 

If the 10th lord is debilitated or if there is malefic in the 10th house 

and there is malefic in the 10th from 10th or 7th house, one performs 

lowly deeds. 

After applying these tests, examine the following 

1. There should be benefics or benefic influences on the 2nd 
house. This will include the association of Yoga Karka planet 
for a particular Lagna and the 2nd house. 

2. Connection of Jupiter or benefics with the 1 Oth house/lord. 

3. Connection of Jupiter or benefics with the 10th house or the 
10th lord from Moon. 

4. Connection of Jupiter or benefics with the 10th house or 1 Oth 
lord from the 10th lord of birth horoscope. 

5. Connection of Jupiter and benefics with 10th to 10th house/ 
lord. 

Remember: If the 10th lord from Lagna is debilitated and / or the 

2nd house has malefics the suffermg of the person resulting from 

evil Karma will be endless.

Fall from Power 

Crisis in Career 

(Taken from Journal of Astrology April - June 2003 - A research 

done under guidance of K.N. Rao) 

The crisis or set back in career may come under following 

circumstances; 

1. Placement or association of 10" lord in 6", 8th or 10* house. 

2. In some cases Dasha Antar Dasha of 5" lord or planets placed 
in 5* house as 5" house is 8" from the 10". 

3. Dasha Sandhi or Dasha Chidra can show a change in 
career whether for good or bad depending upon the planets 
concerned. 

4. Transits of planets particularly Saturn or Rahu in the 5" or the 
10* house from Moon or Lagna. Transit of Saturn in the 10" 
house in case of politicians gives a fall. In other cases it may 
bring about a crisis in career. 

5. Saturn - Venus or Venus Rahu period must be carefully 
scrutinized. 

6. Dasha, Antar Dasha of afflicted or debilitated lords. 

7. Dasha of a retrograde planet or a planet aspected by retrograde 
planet can cause upsets in career. 

8. Saturn's aspect or transit over natal Sun can both be good or 
bad. 

9. Check from Jaimini angle Char Dasha /antar Dasha. The 
Dasha/ Antar Dasha of Rasis Leo or Sagittarius can be Rasis 
of fall or Rasis of rise in life. Pay attention to Atma Karka, 
Karkamsa Lagna and Gnati Karka ,

Principles relating to profession or career 

10th and 11thhouses from Lagna, Sun, Pada Lagna and Karkamsa 
Lagna should be seen; 10th for the nature of rise and | 1th for the 
extent of rise. 


ith House 269 


a) If 11 th has more benefic points than 10, rise in life is great. 
Greater the difference greater is the rise. If the difference 
is more than 4 or 5 Bindus are more, the person is 
extremely lucky in life. In the horoscope of Pt. Nehru, the 
10th has 26 points and 1 1thhas 35, a difference of 9 Bindus 
- it means the Dame luck would always be kind to him. 
b) Ifthe 10th house is strong (28 or more Bindus), but II is 
weak, at some stage there has been a stagnation in career. 
c) A very weak 10th house should not be interpreted as bad 
if II is strong enough as it is capable of lifting the native. 
Variation . 
Satur is the significator for profession, and is the planet of masses, 
public adoration, mass hysteria, and elections. Apply all these rules 
to 10th and 11th from Saturn also. In case of politicians and 
bureaucrats who have a godfather this is a must. 
In case of those who have powerful relations placed as 
administrators etc. the 10thand 11th from Sun should also be seen. 


Chapter XII 
Twelfth House 


House of Loss, Expenditure, Foreign Travel and Mysticism 


The twelfth house is the last house of the Zodiac and is known 
as the house of loss. It is also House of destruction, expenditure 
and downfall. According to Phala Deepika, if lord of 12 is placed in 
any house, its signification suffers. Similarly, if lord of any house is 
placed in twelfth, the things represented by this house undergo a 
loss. For example if lord of four is in twelve it could mean loss of 
property (though in some cases it could also mean residence abroad). 
Similarly lord of seven in twelve would cause delay or problems in 
marriage. 

In Vedic Astrology the 12th house to every house is its house 
of loss. For example the 12th from 9th house is 8th and hence it's 
house of loss to the ninth house or house of loss to house of fortune. 
(‚ÄòBhagya‚Äô) 

The twelfth house also represents Meena Rasi or sign Pisces 
in the natural Zodiac. The owner of this sign is Jupiter, the Preceptor 
of Gods. Venus gets exalted here in the form of Love of Divine 
and Heavenly bliss. The Mercury is debilitated here. This sign is 
also a mystical sign, the sign of spiritualism. The placement of 
Jupiter in Navamsa in Pisces leads to Moksha. Jaimini astrology 
also assigns great significance to this Rasi as placement of Jupiter 
here as Karkamsa Lagna or to the placement of a benefic in the 
12th from it leads to ‚Äòfinal bliss.‚Äô 

The twelfth house represents 

1. Maturity of mystical. 

2. Losses and theft. 
According to K.N. Rao lords of 6,8, 12 cause loss of 
prestige and money if lords of 2, 11 and 12 are also afflicted. 

3. Extravagance 

4. Expenditure. Since this house is primarily a house of 
expenditure, if 12 lord is placed in benefic Vargas money 
is spent in honourable way. With malefics the expenditure 
is on vices like wine, women, illegal gratification, gambling 
etc. With benefic aspects father takes good care of wants 
of the native 

5. Confiscation, embezzlement. Association of 12 lords with 
malefics causes a tendency to cheat, embezzle and 
misappropriate money. 


12th House 271 


6. Sayan Sukh (pleasures of bed). 
7. Hospitals. 

8. Jails. 

9. Left eye, feet. 


10. Residence in foreign countries. 
11. Final emancipation or Moksha. 
12. Downfall. 
13. In female horoscope twelfth house is indicator of character 
and sensual outlook. 
This house has its positive aspect also, besides granting emancipation 
and residence abroad, Jatak Parijat says that if lord of 12 is strong, 
the native has his own wealth (self-acquired), lives long and is 
happy. 
Benefic Aspects / associations:- Benefic aspects on 
the 12th house means residence abroad, good fortune, and delightful 
journey. 
Aspects/ association of benefics shows religious fervor, 
devotion, piety charity and dedicated life. 
According to K.N. Rao Mahatmas are inclined 
to leave their bodies in the sub periods or sub 
sub periods of 9th or 12 lords' 
Malefic aspect, and Pap Kartari Yoga, leaves country for fear 
of government, vagrant life and denies pleasures of bed. 
In the Dasha of lord of twelve one experiences debts, 
expenses, and unhealthy and wicked company. 
If 12th lord is weak and is aspected by 6th lord, money is 
spent on litigation relating to property, misappropriation etc. 


Mars and Saturn in Lagna 12, or second house is a combination for 
accidents. 
Planets in 12th House 
Sun: According to Maharishi Parasara Sun in the 12th for Libra 
Ascendant makes a person live for hundred years, meaning it gives 
him a long life. 
Generally if the Sun is in the 12ththere will either be no conception 
Vandayaa or if other influences predominate birth of first child will 
be in the middle ages. 
Afflicted Sun 
Afflicted Sun - Weak eyesight, not good for spiritual progress, 
immoral life, not successful in life, health suffers. 

According to Jatak Bharnam relations with father suffer.

12th House 2715 


Leo Lagna: lord of twelve Moon is in Lagna aspected by 
Saturn and Mars. Though this is a combination for Sanyas also, the 
health of the native suffers. In the words of K.N. Rao, "Swami 
Parmanand Saraswati whose childhood name was Mrinal 'Kanti, 
was an ailing child whom no one could cure, was taken by his 
father to the sacred Ganges river, dipped him thrice and prayed" 
Mother, you decide either to save or kill him,‚Äô Child Mrinal recovered 
but a damaged liver was his lifelong companion. 


Twelfth lord in the first makes one handsome, sweet tongued, 
gives weak constitution, makes one feeble minded. In movable and 
dual Rasis it gives travel abroad. 

Sixth lord and 12thlord in Lagna give long life provided 8th 
house is not afflicted. It is also a combination forjail and living 
abroad. 

Exchange of Lagna lord and 12th lord is not good. Person is 
disliked by people. He is miser with no intelligence. 

12th lord in I and Kendra Trikona having malefics only one 
leads a poor and dull life. 
12th lord in Second. 

Defective eyesight, disturbed family life, no timely meals. 
Talks ill of others, gossip. If lord is benefic and strong, one will be 
a tactful speaker. 

In case Jupiter as 12th lord is placed in Aquarius - a spiritual 
sign, it produces Yoga of Renunciation. 
3rd House 

Ear problem, not good for younger co-bom, incompetent writer, 
timid. 
4th House 

Mental worries, not good for mother, bad relation with relatives. 
Not a good house to live, problem with conveyance. 
5th House 

Religious minded, pilgrimages. Problem with or getting 
children. See'the following horoscope of Dr. Bali Ram Hegdewar,

In this horoscope the 5th house of children from Lagna as 
well from Jupiter has the !2thlord Mars with the 6th and 1 1thlord 
Venus and aspected by Saturn from eight. To this may be added the 
Sth aspect of Ketu. Now see the strength of 5th house from the

planet, and has the aspect of 9th lord or Atma Karka, one donates 
fabulous amount of money on charities. 

Weak minded, thinks he is miserable.

enemies. 

If afflicted, unhappy, sinful, hates mother, immoral,

leads a poor life. 

Combinations for Travel Abroad 

This has been dealt in detail in my book "Planets and Travel Abroad‚Äù. 
Following is a gist of combinations for travel abroad. 

Houses Involved 

First House 

According to sage Satyachari if lord of the first house is in 7th and 
associated with a benefic, the native would live in a foreign country 
and die there. 

Third House 

Third house represents short journeys. Ninth lord in the third means 
travel abroad for pilgrimage. This combination is common in Muslim 
pilgrims who travel on "haj" abroad. 

Fourth House 

Fourth house is the house of residence. Affliction to this house 
takes a person abroad for settlement. 

Seventh House 

This house also deals with residence abroad. Lord of nine in the 
7th house means seeking fortune abroad. 

Eighth House 

This normally involves journey by sea in connection with sickness. 
Travel by sea has been replaced by air travel. 

Ninth House 

Ninth house signifies long journey. 9th lord in 9th with Rahu makes 
ones father famous in foreign country. Ninth lord in the 12thmeans 
living in Guru's Ashram abroad. 

Twelfth House 

Twelfth house has been given a major role for residence in a foreign 


278 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


country. 

Role of 12th Lord: Twelfth lord in Lagna in common sign 
means lot of travelling. If it is with 6th lord and 8th house is afflicted

property abroad.

Settlement Abroad ‚Äî Snap Shot Prediction 
The inhibition Hindus had in earlier decades about going to foreign 
countries after crossing the "seven seas" has vanished. A common 
question being asked of astrologers these days relates to settlement 
abroad. A snap shot method for giving quick predictions is given 
below with illustrations. However, like other snap shot methods, it 
has its limitations. This rule has, however, been widely tested and 
generally found to be accurate. 

The parameters are 

1. Fourth house/lord, its affliction from the Lagna. 

2. The role of Rahu/Ketu and its connection with the 4th house 
and/or the 4th lord. 

3. It has been observed that whenever fourth house/lord is 
afflicted or fourth lord is ill placed (6,8 & 12) in ahoroscope, 
person leaves his native place to settle abroad. 

4. If some how or the other, Rahu/Ketu are also involved 
then residence abroad becomes almost a certainty.

Chapter XIV 


Transit 
Result of Transit of Planets with special reference to 
Ashtak Varga 


It should be remembered that results of transit cannot take 
precedence over those promised in the birth chart. The birth 
horoscope is the main important chart containing the Dasha scheme 
binding us all in the grand design of Karma. The whole scheme of 
destiny is nothing else but the unfolding of Karmas. The good or 
bad events that occur in our life are the fruits of our Karmas. 

For example if children are not promised in the horoscope 
then, howsoever results may be good in transit Jupiter and Saturn's‚Äô 
aspect on 15 axis), birth of children must not be predicted. In fact 
transits should be given secondary importance to main events 
promised in Dasha scheme. 

While primary importance is given to transit of planets from 
Moon, the transit should also be considered from Lagna. 
However, all the great ancient Acharyas emphasize that transits 
should be considered from Moon only. 

In judging the results of transit following factors should be 
considered. 
I ‚Äî Transit of planets in good and bad houses 
In considering whether a transit is good or bad, the position of 
planets from Moon at the time of birth is taken into consideration in 
Vedic Astrology. Mantreswar states in the book Phala Deepika, 
that among all the Lagnas the Moon's Lagna is the most important 
for assessing the effects of transits. The sign where Moon is posited 
at birth is important, and is called the radical sign of Moon, which 
is also known as Chandra Lagna, or sometime as Rasi. 
Good Position for transit of plariets with respect to radical 
Moon. 
Sun: gives good results while transiting 3,6,10 and 11 positions 
from radical Moon. In other houses it gives malefic results. 
Mars: gives good results while transiting in 3,6, and 11. In other 
houses it is bad. 
Saturn: Also gives good results while transiting 3,6 and 11 houses 
from radical Moon while it is bad in other houses. 


Transit 293 


It will thus be observed that malefics Sun, Mars and Saturn 
give benefic results while transiting 3,6 and 11 from radical Moon. 
In addition Sun is good in 10 also as it gets directional strength 
there. 

Moon is also good in 3, 6 and 11 from her radical position as also 
in 7 and 10th Benefics Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are good in 2 
and 11 also. 

Mercury is good in 4,6, and 8 and 10. (as also 2 and 11). 
Jupiter is good in 5,7 and 9 in addition to 2 and 11. 

Venus is good in all houses except 6, 7 and 10. 

Rahu and Ketu: Rahu in transit acts like Saturn except in 10th 
from radical Moon where it gives great gains. Ketu gives results 
like Mars. 

They are good in 3,6, 10 and 11 from Moon. 

II‚Äî Good and had results of Planets

I1J‚ÄîPoints of Obstruction or Vedha 
When a planet transits through a sign whether favourable or not, if 
there is another planet moving at vedha point the effects of transit 
will not be felt. 

Following are the benefic and Vedha points of each planet. 


Transit 295 


Suppose Sun is transiting over the third house, it is bound to give 
good results, but if a planet is simultaneously also transiting the 9th 
house no good results would be produced. Conversely if a planet is 
transiting over 9th house, and simultaneously another planet is transiting 
on the third house, the evil results will not be felt.

It may be noted that there is no Vedha between Sun and Saturn, as 
Sun is father of Saturn. Similarly there is no vedha between Moon 
and Mercury, as Moon is father of Mercury. 

IV ‚ÄîA planet when transiting in a Rasi with more than 30 Bindus 
gives excellent results. Similarly, a planet transiting in a Rasi which 
in its own Bhinashtak Varga has more than 4 Bindus gives auspicious 
results. 

V ‚Äî A planet while transiting a Rasi ofits exaltation or in its own 
house behaves well, whereas while transiting in its Rasi of 
debilitation is destructive. Saturn entered its Rasi of debilitation on 
17 April 1998. The results had been disastrous on a global scale. 
Fires, floods earthquake wreaked havoc all around. Economies of 
South East Asia tumbled. Floods submerged the whole country of 
Bangladesh. NATO bombarded Yugoslavia on an unprecedented 
scale. The exodus of refugees from Kosova reminded one of 
barbaric Middle Ages of murder, arson and loot. In India the stability

of the government was threatened by withdrawal of support by 
Jayalalitha, and a vote for confidence in government of Bajpai was 
tabled on the floor of the house on 15.4. 1999, which was defeated 
by one vote and Bajpai government, had to resign. There were 
other causes also - the entry of Venus, Lagna lord of horoscope of 
independent India, in Taurus/Gemini and its affliction which has 
been discussed in detail in my article in Journal of Astrology. In the 
sign Mithun, in the Bhinashtak of Moon representing mind, in the 
independent horoscope of India, there is no Bindu. 
VI ‚Äî Sade Sati 
‚ÄòSade Sati‚Äô, is a Hindi word meaning seven and a half. In astrological 
term it means a seven and half year period of transit of Saturn in 
the 12th, Ist and second place from the location of Moon in the 
birth horoscope. Since normally Saturn stays in a Rasi for two and 
a half years, this covers a total period of 7-1/2 years. 

Let us illustrate with an example:- In J.L. Nehru, horoscope 
Moon is located in Cancer, his period of Sade Sati would start 
when transiting Saturn enters Gemini, which is the 12th house from 
Cancer. Here it stays for 2-1/2 years, it then moves over to Cancer 
the Ist house from Moon and latter on after again 2-1/2 years 
sojourn in Cancer goes to Leo. This 7-1/2 year would end when 
Saturn completes its stay in Leo. Saturn stays in Gemini, Cancer, 
and Leo for a total stay of 7-1/2 years in the three crucial Rasis 
12th, 1st and 2nd from Nehru Chandra Lagna. This is the period 
known as Sade Sati. 
Mr. Katwe's definition 
A Maharashtrian astrologer late Shri Katwe states that when Saturn 
is within 45 degrees from natal Moon, Sade Sati would begin and 
would end when it moves again 45 degrees away from Moon. There 
is some substance in this theory, as suppose Moon is located in Aries 
at 27 degrees, then would the period of Sade Sati start when Saturn 
enters Pisces, the 12th sign from Aries, or would it be more appropriate 
for it to start when it reaches 12 degrees Pisces or 45 degrees before 
Moon? According to Katwe period of Sade Sad starts at the time 
Saturn enters at 12 degree Pisces and ends when Saturn completes 
12 degree Gemini and not when it enters Gemini. 
Result of Transit of Saturn in 12, 1 and 2nd house from 


Transit 297 


Moon. 
There is no mention of word Sade Sati in classical books of 
Astrology yet the very mention of this word sends jitters through 
the spines of millions of naive people. It is said to cause "Chattar 
Bhang" (loss of protectors). It is a common superstition that during 
the first round of Sade Sati of Saturn: 
i) People lose their grandparents. 
ii) In the second round they lose their parents and 
iii) In the third round, if they are lucky to live this long they 
often lose their own Lives. 
While there is no mention of word Sade Sati in any of the classical 
books yet mention has been made of ill effects of Saturn during 
transit through 12, 1 and 2nd houses of Moon. Let us see what 
these books have to say about this transit. 
Practically all the books agree that transit of Saturn in all 
the houses except 3, 6 and 11 from Moon cause evil. Saturn is a 
malefic planet and is Karka for limitation, hindrance, delay, death, 
murder, rape, sexual perversion, separation, pain and agony. It causes 
loss of money, theft and poverty. It makes one dull, morose and 
gloomy. 
Result of transit of Saturn on the 12th house from Moon 
Mantreswar in Phala Deepika states that Saturn in transit from 
12th house to Moon does not give any gain in business, causes loss 
of wealth through enemies and sickness to wife and son. Similarly 
other results are Ist from Moon ‚Äî ‚Äòdiseases and performance 
of funeral rites' 2nd from Moon ‚Äî Loss of wealth and children. 
Is Period of Sade Sati dreadful? 
According to traditional astrologers, besides ‚ÄòAshtam‚Äô Shani this is 
the most dreadful period; instances are cited; 
i) Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on 30th January 1948, 
during his period of Sade Sati 
ii) Indira Gandhi lost her mother in her first Sade Sati and her 
husband and father in her second Sade Sati. She also 
became a Minister in the cabinet of Lal Bahadur Shastri 
during same period. 


298 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


As against this 
i) J L Nehru has his Moon in Cancer. In 1947 when he 
became the first Prime Minister of India, The Saturn was 
transiting in Cancer. 
ii) | Shrimati Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister in January 
1966, when she was running her Sade Sati. 
iit) | Morarji Desai's Sade Sati proved very lucky for him. In 
his second Sade Sati he became a cabinet Minister in 
Maharashtra, and in third Sade Sati he became Prime 
Minister of India. 
In Journal of Astrology, April - June 1999 issue a brilliant deep 
study of results at‚Äô Sade Sati has been done under guidance of 
K.N. Rao. This proves beyond doubt that the period of Sade Sati 
cannot be bad if 


i) The operative Dasha / Antar is beneficial 

ii) If 12th, 1 st and 2nd houses from Moon have more than 30 
Bindus each in the Sarvashtak Varga, the result of this 
transit would be beneficial. This was the case in Nehru's 
horoscope. 

iii) fin the Bhinashtak Varga of Saturn it has more benefic 
points in these houses the results of this transit cannot be 
bad. 

iv) The results would again be not bad if Satum is transiting 


through own/friend's house etc. 

v) See also the Nakshatras surrounding Moon. If these are 
beneficial, results of Sade Sati cannot be bad. 

vi) Aspects of other planets should also be taken into 
consideration. Benefic aspects give excellent results, while 
malefic aspects cause evil. 

VIl‚Äî Transit through Nakshatras 
Natal Star: The natal star is the Nakshatra in which Moon is located 
at the time of birth. In the horoscope of Nehru the Moon is in 
Cancer Rasi at 17 degrees. 5! minutes, in Ashlesha Nakshatra of 
Mercury (number 9). This is his birth Nakshatra or natal star. 
Phala Deepika has given in details the results of transits of 
various planets in different Nakshatras. This view is at variance 
with that given by other authorities. According to them the transit of 


Transit 299 


planets in 3rd, 5th and 7th Nakshatra from the birth Nakshatra and 
their trines (12 and 21; 14 and 23, and 16 and 25) cause misery in 
life. The 3rd Nakshatra is known as Vipat Tara (star), whereas 5th 
is known as Prathiram and 7th is called as Vadha Tara. When 
benefic planets transit these Nakshatra the results are not good, 
but when malefic planets move over these stars the results are 
very bad, especially when these are associated or aspected by 
malefics, or are in retrograde motion or become combust. 

The results of transit of various planets, as given in various 
classical works are as follows: - 
Sun is malefic in Ist, 14th, 16th, 19th, 1 st and 23rd Nakshatra from 
birth Nakshatra. It is good in others. 
Moon is malefic in Ist, 19th, 21st and 23rd Nakshatra from birth 
Nakshatra, in others it is benefic. 
Mars is malefic in Ist 3rd, 5th, 7th, 12th, 14th, 19th and 21st 
Nakshatra from Janam Nakshatra, in other places it is good. 
Mercury, Venus and Jupiter are bad in Ist, 3rd, 7th, 10th, 12th, 
and 27th star from birth Nakshatra. They are good in other places. 
Saturn, Rahu and Ketu: Their transit in Ist, 7th, 10th, and 27th 
Nakshatra from birth Nakshatra is evil. It is good in others. 
According to Mantreswar the transit of Saturn, Rahu and Ketu in 
1 st, 9th, 1 Oth, 11 th, 26th and 27th Nakshatra from Janam Nakshatra 
is bad. 


VIN‚Äî Transit in Kakshaya 
This is an important concept in Ashtak Varga. Each Rasi of 30 
degrees is divided into eight equal parts of 3¬∞ 45'. The lords of 
these kakshaya are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, 
Moon and Lagna in that order. A planet while transiting in a kakshaya 
whose lord has contributed a Bindu (this can be ascertained from 
Prasthar Chakra of each planet) gives good results, while in 
transiting in a Binduless kakshaya evil results are manifested. 
There is another concept of interpretation of results. 
Suppose Saturn in transit reaches the kakshaya of Mars, and Mars . 
has contributed one Bindu, then the result of transit in this kakshaya 
will not only be good, but Satur here wilt give the results of its own 
signification as also that of Mars. This has been illustrated with 


300 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


examples in the chapter on kakshaya in my other book. 
IX ‚Äî Temporal Benefic and Malefic for different Lagnas 
While judging the result of transit of a planet its lordship must be 
taken into account whether it is benefic or malefic for a particular 
Lagna. This concept is peculiar to Vedic Astrology and has been 
elaborated by Maharishi Parasara in Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra. 
In this connection following principles should be memorized; 
i) Lagna Lord is always Benefic ie. Mars for Aries and 
Scorpio Lagnas and Satum for Cancer and Aquarius are 
benefics. 
ii) Lord of 5th house and lords of 9th house are always 
auspicious. 
iit) Mars for Cancer, and Leo Lagnas, Saturn for Lagnas of 
Venus, Taurus and Libra, and Venus for Lagnas of Saturn 
Capricorn and Aquarius are Yoga Karkas, being lords of 
Kendra and Trikona. - 
iv) Malefic lords of Kendras cease to be malefics, and benefic 
lords of Kendras have Kendra Adhipati Dosha and do not 
give benefic results. 
X ‚Äî Aspects 
The aspects during transit are also important. Benefic aspects on a 
transiting planets give good results, while malefic aspects may prove 
disastrous. 
XI ‚Äî Retrograde Planets 
A retrograde natural benefic planet transiting a favourable house 
enhances the signification of the house, while transiting in an 
unfavourable house the results will be less destructive. 

A retrograde natural malefic becomes more destructive. 
If it is transiting through a good house, meaning 3,6, and 11 etc.; its 
good effects are decreased. If it is transiting through an 
unfavourable house its results become malefic. 
XII‚Äî Dasha in Operation 

i) Dasha of a benefic planet ‚Äî A benefic planet whose 
Dasha is running, while in transit, passing through a 
favourable house gives benefic effects to the maximum. 
In evil houses the benefic effects are reduced. 


Transit 301 


ii) | Dasha and transit of malefic ‚Äî Transit in malefic houses 
make the results worse, whereas the transit through benefic 
houses reduce the harmful effects. 

XII ‚Äî Effect of Combustion 

Planets when transiting through favourable position from Moon if 
become combust (get obstructed by Sun rays), or get eclipsed by 
Rahu/Ketu cannot give good results, whereas they give bad results 
in transiting through unfavourable houses in similar circumstances. 
The planets get combust in their nearness to Sun within certain 
specified degrees. 

The Mercury gets combust ifit is within 3 degrees from Sun 


The Moon gets combust if it is within 12 degrees from Sun 
The Mars gets combust if it is within 17 degrees from Sun 
The Jupiter gets combust if it is within 11 degrees from Sun 
The Venus gets combust if it is within 9 degrees from Sun 

The Saturn gets combust if it is within 15 degrees from Sun 


XIV ‚Äî Pap Kartari Yoga 

Ifa planet, while transiting, gets hemmed in ‚ÄòPap Kartari Yoga‚Äô, its 
good effects are diluted in favourable houses, and in unfavourable 
houses its evil effects gets accentuated. 

XV ‚Äî Shubh Kartari Yoga 

In Shubh Kartari Yoga the results are opposite. 

XVI ‚Äî While transiting, the position of other planets should also 
be taken into account. The placement of benefic planets in 4th, 8th, 
and Sth and 9th from its position is good, whereas malefic planets 
cause evil. These rules are similar to what have been prescribed 
by Parasara in judgment of Dasha/Antardasha. 

XVII‚ÄîIn passing through the first 10 degrees of a sign, Mars and 
Sun give immediate results. Transits of slow moving planets, Saturn 
and Jupiter are held to be most powerful. The two and half-year 
results should be judged from Saturn, the yearly results from Jupiter, 
the monthly from other planets and daily results from Moon. 
XVIII ‚Äî Treating each planet as Lagna for transit results. 
Phala Deepika, a respected old treatise on Hindu astrology has 
propounded the principle that for assessment of transit results the 


302 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


placement of each planet in the birth horoscope be treated as Lagna 
and results of various houses assessed accordingly. This will be 
clear from following example. 
XIX ‚Äî while transiting over a sign having no Bindus in its Ashtak 
Varga, a planet will give very bad results, which may even, entail 
loss of life. But while transiting over a house with 7 or 8 Bindus 
excellent results would be forthcoming like high government job or 
substantial profit in business. 
XX ‚Äî Timing result of transit 
According to Phala Deepika the good or bad results will occur 
only when a planet crosses the degree of its longitude in the birth 
horoscope. For example if in the birth chart Jupiter is at 15 degrees 
in Aries and it is transiting in Scorpio having 8 Bindus then the good 
effects of this house will be forthcoming only when Jupiter reaches 
15 degrees. 
XXI ‚Äî The effect of the house will be promoted even when a 
malefic occupies his own house. If a planet were in his sign of 
debilitation or in his enemy's house, the house occupied will be 
damaged. 
XXn ‚Äî "If a benefic happens to own a Dusthan (6, 8 or 12), it will 
destroy the house occupied by him even when he may be occupying 
his sign of exaltation, malefic in exaltation will do good to the house 
occupied by him if it owns a good house.‚Äù Phala Deepika. 
XXIII ‚Äî The transit of planets in houses containing more Bindus 
is productive of good. This rule does not apply to houses 6, 8 and 
12, for performance of auspicious functions.

Dasha 
How to Interpret Dasha 


There are many types of Dasha prevalent for delineation 
of a horoscope. Parasara himself mentions about 32 Dashas. But 
the most popular Dasha in Kaliyuga is Vimshottari Dasha. The 
other Dashas in vogue are Ashttotari and Yogini. 

A Vimshottari means hundred and twenty. This is the total 
years allotted to all the planets representing 120 years of a full 
span of man‚Äôs life. While applying Vimshottari Dasha it is necessary 
to follow Parasari principles, which have been summarized as below. 

1. Lords of Lagna, and Trikonas (Sth and 9th houses) are always 
auspicious. : 

2. Lords of Kendras and Trikona when combined give Raj Yoga * 
of a high order. 

3. In the Rasis of Venus, (Taurus and Libra) as Lagna, Saturn is 
Yoga Karka, while in the Rasis of Saturn, (Capricorn and 
Aquarius) as Lagna, Venus is Yoga Karka. Similarly for the 
Rasis Cancer of Moon and Leo of Sun as Lagnas, Mars is 
Yoga Karka as these are lords of Kendra and Trikona. 

4. Lords of 3, 6 and 11 are evil. 

5. Lords of 8 and 12 are neutral and give result according to 
planets they are associated with. 

6. If a benefic planet is lord of two Kendras it ceases to be 
benefic. 

7. Similarly, malefic lord of two Kendras shed malevolence but 
act in a benefic manner only if they are also lord of a Trikona. 

Auspicious Planets for various Lagnas 

1. Aries: Jupiter and Sun are auspicious as they are lords of 9 and 

5 If there is relation between Jupiter and Saturn then Jupiter ceases 

to be benefic. 

Mars as Lagna and 8th lord and Moon lord of four are neutrals. 

Venus becomes Marka if associated with malefics. Malefics 

become Markesh by association with Saturn. 

Jupiter and Sun combination make Raj Yoga even though Jupiter is 

also lord of twelve. 


304 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


2. Taurus: Saturn and Mercury are good and Saturn alone is Raj 

Yoga Karka. 

Saturn Mercury combination is very good, as both are Trikona lords. 

Mercury does not become Marka by owning two, as it owns 9 

also. 

3. Gemini: Venus alone is auspicious. Moon does not become 
Marka if not associated with malefics. Mercury plus Venus is 
Raj Yoga Karka. Mars and Saturn are Markas. 

4. Cancer: Mars is Raj Yoga Karka and Jupiter is good. Saturn 
is ‚ÄòMarka‚Äô. 

5. Leo: Mars is Raj Yoga Karka and Jupiter is good. Mercury 
and other malefics are ‚ÄòMarka‚Äô. 

6. Virgo: Venus alone is auspicious and is not a ‚ÄòMarka‚Äô even 
when it owns 2nd. Mars and other planets are 'Marka‚Äô. - 

7. Libra: Saturn Mercury is good. Moon-Mercury is Raj Yoga 
Karka. Mars is ‚ÄòMarka‚Äô. 

8. Scorpio: Jupiter - Moon is good. Sun- Moon is Raj Yoga karka. 
Jupiter by owning 2 is not ‚ÄòMarka‚Äô. Mercury and other evil 
planets are Markas. 

9. Sagittarius: Venus is only evil planet. Mars ‚Äî Sun are good, 
Sun Mercury is Yoga Karka. Saturn is chief Markesh. 

10. Capricorn: Only Venus is Raj Yoga Karka. Venus Mercury is 
good. If Venus conjoins Mercury it makes extra ordinary Raj 
Yoga. Mars may become Markesh. 

11. Aquarius: Venus is good and Yoga Karka Jupiter Moon and 
Mars are evil. 

12. Pisces: Mars and Moon are good. Mars plus Jupiter are Yoga 
Karka. Mars does not kill but Saturn and Mercury do. 


Important Factors for Interpreting Dasha system 

1. The important dashes of a person's life are as per Parasara, 
Dasha of Lagna lord, 10th lord and Dasha of an exalted planet. 
2. Adverse Dashas 

i) The 4th Mahadasha from birth, if it happens to be of Saturn or 
ii) The 6th of Jupiter or 

iii) The 9th Mahadasha of Rahu or Mars give unfavourable results. 
This is inspite of the planet having good lordship. 


Dasha 305 


If a person is born in Dasha of Mars, Saturn's Dasha will be fourth, 

For one born in Venus Rahu Dasha will be fifth and Jupiter Dasha 

will be sixth. For one born in Ketu Dasha, Mars's Dasha will be 

fifth from him. 

iv) Other Dashas that are bad are Dasha of a planet who is placed 

in the last degree of a sign. 

v) Dasha of lord of 6, 8 and 12. 

3. The Dasha of a planet moving towards its exaltation point is 

called Arohini Dasha‚Äô. This Dasha is auspicious and will bring 

good results. 

4. The Dasha of a planet after attainment of the exaltation point 

moves towards debilitation is called ‚ÄòAvrohini Dasha‚Äô. This Dasha 

causes unhappiness and misery. If the planet is in exaltation, own 

or friendly sign the Dasha gives moderate results, 

Malefic in the Fourth 

If any malefic planet during the major Dasha of that planet and 

Antra occupies the 4th place from a malefic planet one may lose 

one's house and property. 

a) IfMars occupies the fourth there is possibility of fire, accident, 
sudden death of cattle or sudden danger. 

b) IfSaturn is there pain in the chest, headache or diseases due 
to nervous system. 

c) Sun: displeasure of government, problem in career, loss of 
money and property. 

d) Rahu, diseases due to poison, theft. 

Planets in 1/7 axis 

These Dashas and Antra Dasha are not favourable excepting, Mars 

Moon opposition. Saturn and Jupiter in 1/7 give good results, Mars 

and Jupiter also are good in one and seven. 

Beneficial Dashas: 

The following Dashas are considered to give good results 

I. Dasha of an exalted planet if it is strong in Shadbala would 
give extremely good results in the form ofhealth, wealth and 
happiness including high status. 

2. The Dasha of a planet who is strong in Shadbalas, is in its own 
house, or in a friend‚Äô house gives good results. This Dasha is 
known as 'Shubh Dasha‚Äô.

Dasha of a planets who is strong in Ashtak Varga having more 
than five benefic points in its bhinAshtak Varga or placed in a 
Rasi with more than 28 benefic Bindus. 

Planet who is exalted, in its own or friendly house, gets 
debilitated in Navamsa or is in inimical sign in Navamsa gives 
mixed results in the first half and favourable results in the second 
half. 

The house aspected by its lord gives good results during its 
Dasha. 

Dashas of the planet who are involved in Raj Yogas give good 
results. Combination of Kendra Trikona is a Raj Yoga of a 
high order. 

According to Laghu Parasari Dasha of a planet associated 
with the lord of the 5th or 9th is also auspicious. Similarly Dasha 
of a planet with benefic is good and gives wealth. 

Dasha of Lagna lord if associated with lord of 5 and 9 give Raj 
Yoga. 

According to Laghu Parasari Dasha of lord of 10 occupying 
the 9th house confers fame, prosperity and happiness. Same 
are the results if lord of 10 is associated with lord of four. 
Dashas of the lords of six and that of seven become auspicious 
if they occupy 10th house or are associated with the 10th lord,‚Äô 
according to Laghu Parasari 

Dashas of the planets owning two Marka houses, 2nd and 7th 
(Venus for Aries and Mars for Libra) give good results if they 
are in the 4th or associated with 4th lord. 

"Lords of 6, 8, or 12 associated with lords of five give auspicious 
results‚Äù- Laghu Parasari 

Dasha of lord of 4 in 10 or of lord of 10 in four is auspicious. 
Dasha of planets associated with lord of five and ten confer 
power and authority. 

Dashas of lord of 5 in 10 or of 10 in its own house confer 
wealth and power. 

Dashas of lord of 9 associated with that of five gives children 
and authority. Same are the results of lord of 4 with 10. 

If the planets Rahu and Ketu are in angles having relation with 
lord of Trikonas or in Trikona having relation with lord of 
kendras they give auspicious results. Rahu in the 5th is said to 


Dasha 307 


be most malefic for progeny unless it has relation with lord of 
trine or angle. 

18. If an exalted or auspicious planet occupies 5, 6, and 7 places 
from a planet, it gives auspicious results. 

19. Similarly a planet in 4th exalted or in its own house gives good 
results. 


Adverse Dashas: (See also Dasha Chidra at the end this chapter) 
Dasha Chidra: Taken from Varahamihira Brihat Jatak 

The person gets the royal power in the Antardasha of the most 
powerful planet who combines in the 10th or in the first. He loses 
that power in the Antardasha of the planet who is unfriendly or 
Neecha house because such period is called Chidra Dasha. Then 
he must seek protection from a powerful king. 


Take a planet in the first or 10 and whichever is the stronger 
predict acquisition of power during that Antardasha. If there are 
no planets in the first or the tenth find out which of the lot is strongest 
and ascribe the power to him during his Antardasha. Such kingly 
power or office will be lost when the Antardasha of a planet, 
which occupies an unfriendly or debilitated Rasi, intervenes. 

This is called Chidra Dasha, which means accident or misfortune 
as well as hole, and therefore lie gets into unfortunate position by 
losing his power. 


Note (Dasha Chidra is also the beginning of a new Mahadasha or 
ending of an old Mahadasha. These represent, changes in one's 
life.) See previous page. 

Other bad Dashas are: 

1. Dasha of a planet conjoined with a malefic is bad. 

2. Dashas of malefic planets give adverse results. 

3. Dasha of a planet who is weak in Ashtak Varga and debilitated 
is bad and confers losses. This is known as 'Rikta Dasha‚Äô. 

4. Dasha ofa planet who is at the lowest point of debilitation or in 
enemy's Navamsa or in inimical sign is called Arishta Dasha‚Äô 
(period of misfortune). One loses health, wealth and name. 

5. Avrohini Dasha proves most in-auspicious if the Dasha lord is in 
inimical or in debilitation sign or in the Navamsa of the same sign. 
6. Dasha of retrograde planets give unpredictive results. In medical 


308 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


astrology they give adverse results and are not good for health. 

8. The planet in last degrees of sign is not capable of giving good 
results. 

9. Dasha of a planet with ‚ÄòMandi‚Äô is not good. 

10. Planets placed in 3rd, 5th or 7th Nakshatra from Janam 
Nakshatra give adverse results. 

11. Planet aspected by malefics or in Papkartari Yoga or combust 
does not give good results. 

12. Dashas of the lords of 6, 8 and 12 are inauspicious. According

How to Interpret Dashas: 

According to Laghu Parasari all the planets good or bad, when 

in their Dasha and their own Antra Dasha do not give good or bad 

results according to their nature. Even a Marka planet does not 
become a killer in its own Antra. It may not give any effect but 
some effect, however little it may be, would be felt. 

According to Parasara treat Dasha Nath as Lagna. If there are 

malefics in 5th, 8th and 9th from the sign having running Dasha 

their Dashas will be troublesome. 

Results of Antardasha Lord 

1. If lord of the Lagna is posited in its own Navamsa, 
Dwadasamsa, or Drekkan, the Antras are going to be 
auspicious. Similarly if it is also placed in its own Trimsamsa or 
that of its friend, results will be good. 

2. Ifthe lord of the sign in whose Navamsa the lord of Lagna is 
posited is occupying the Navamsa, Drekkan or Dwadasamsa 
of a friend and is aspected by a friend, its Antra is said to be 
auspicious. 

3. The Antra of a planet occupying the Navamsa, Dwadasamsa 
or Drekkan of the 5th and 8th lords are auspicious. Similarly 
Antra of a planet occupying Navamsa, Dwadasamsa or 
Drekkan of the 4th house is good. 

4. During the Dasha of benefics not related to Yoga Karka and 
Antardasha of one of the Yoga Karka, and Patyantra Dasha 
of other good planet, auspicious results are generally 
experienced. During Dasha of related planets good results in 
full are witnessed. 

5. Even malefics (lords of 6,8, and 12) having relation with the 
Yoga Karka planets give good results depending upon their 
strength and relation with Yoga Karka planet in their main and 
sub period. 

Inauspicious Dasha 

I. Dashas of the lords of 6, 8 or 12 are inauspicious. 

2. Ifthe lord of the Marka associates with that of 6th or the first, 
its Antra brings fever. 


Dasha 315 


3. Similarly, the Antra of the Lagna lord associated with lord of 
six will cause diseases as per the characteristics of the 
Shadvargas of the planet in the Rasi of which Lagna lord is 
located. e.g. in the Shadvargas of Moon it will cause dyspepsia 
etc., in that of Mars blood disorder etc. 

4. In the Dasha of lord of 6 and Antra of a Markesh there is 
danger from arms and chances of great suffering. 

5. If Rahu, Ketu, Saturn or Mars are associated with Markesh 
and occupy the 8th, their Dashas and Antras cause diseases. 

6. Ifthe Lagna lord and lord of 6 are associated with the lord of 
8 or Markesh their Antras cause harm. Lord of malefics may 
cause death whereas benefics give sickness. 

Special Results of Dasha and Antradasha of Venus and Saturn: 

According to Uttarkalamitra if Saturn and Venus are both strong 

and become Yoga Karka results of their Dasha and Antardasha 

are very unfavourable. (Strength means exalted, own house, 

Vargottam etc.) 

Under such condition the native will be as good as a beggar even 

though he may be rich like Kuber. 

But if one is strong and another is weak the native will enjoy good 

results according to character and strength of stronger planet. 

If both of them be weak and are posited in 6, 8, and 12 or one of 

them is situated in 6th or 8th place or another, or they own any 

Dusthan or are posited there or associated with lord of Dusthan 

the results of their Dashas or Antardasha will be exceptionally 

good. 


Dasha of the 9th lord 
Based on an article "If Luck is strong.......... " by K.N. Rao 
(Published in Journal of Astrology July ‚Äî September 2001) 


According to K.N. Rao if a strong and favourable Dasha comes in 
one's life one becomes an achiever and even a historical figure. "A 
strong 9th house and 9th, lord and / or ninth lord or the Navamsa 
condition of the ninth lord, make so much difference to the strength 
of a horoscope if the primary condition of the Lagna or the Lagna 
lord not being weak exists. In this scheme of things the fifth house and 


316 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


the 5th lord too must figure because it is 9th from 9th"' 

In fact, Vargottam Lagna, Vargottam Moon, exalted planets 
in birth horoscope or the Navamsa and a good Dasha scheme help 
one overcome many adversities and make one rise high.

Vimshottari Dasha 
There are many types of Dasha prevalent for delineation of a 
horoscope. Parasara himself mentions about 42 Dashas. But the 
most popular Dashas in Kaliyuga is Vimshottari Dasha. Among 


318 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


other Dashas in vogue are Kaal Chakra, Ashtottari and Yogini. 

Vimshottari means hundred and twenty. This is the total years 
allotted to all the planets representing 120 years of a full span of 
man‚Äôs life. 

While applying Vimshottari Dasha it is necessary to follow Parasari 

principles, which have been summarized as below. 

1. Lords of Lagna, and Trikonas (fifth and 9* houses) are always 
auspicious. 

2. Lords of Kendras and Trikona when combined give Raj Yoga 
of a high order. 

3. In the Rasis of Venus Taurus and Libra, Saturn is Yoga Karka, 
while in the Rasis of Saturn Capricorn and Aquarius, Venus is 
Yoga Karka. Similarly, for the Rasis Cancer of Moon and Leo 
of Sun Mars is Yoga Karka as these are lords of Kendra and 
Trikona. 

4. Lords of 3, 6 and 11 are evil. 

5. Lords of 8 and 12 are neutral and give result according to 
planets they are associated with. 

6. Ifa benefic planet is lord of two Kendras it ceases to be 
benefic- Kendra Adhipati Dosha. Similarly, malefic lord of two 
Kendras shed malevolence but act in a benefic manner only if 
they are also lord of a Trikona. 

7. Lords of houses 2 and 7 and planets posited in them or aspecting 
them become Markas if the time of death has come. Saturn 
and Rahu also become unqualified Markas if Dashas of lords 
of two and seven does not come at the predestined time.

Interpretation of Dasha - Important Principles 
While interpreting the results of Dashanath KN Rao has taught 
an important principle which is normally overlooked by ordinary 
astrologers. The principle is to treat the dashanath as lagna and 
predict accordingly. According to Rao put your finger on the 

Mahadasha planet and read the chart from there." This rule is based 

on principles enunciated by Parashara and classical book 

Phaladeepika. 

Emphasizing the role of making dasha lord as lagna Parashara 
writes " The placement of Mars in kendra, trikona or in the 3" and 
11"house from lord of Mahadasha ( Rahu in this particular case) 
there will be gain of red cloths, journey, meeting with the king, 
prosperity to children, abundant goodness from God etc" 

Similarly, according to Phaladeepika "Whichever house 
reckoned from the lord of Mahadasha is occupied by lord of the 
sub period, it is only the result arising from that house that will come 


oa 


320 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


to pass in that sub period, and if the lord of the sub period happens 
to be the 6" 8‚Äù or 12" from Mahadasha lord , the result will be 
most unpleasant, while the remaining houses will give favourable 
results. 

This principle will be clear from following example given by 
KN Rao in his book, "Timing Event through Vimshottari Dasha‚Äù. 


110, 1938 
ll:42 a.m, 


Dasha 321 


Analysis of the Horoscope 

Good technical Education ; 

For education to be good see the dasha scheme, This will also 
tell you whether the education is technical or not. 

Examine it from Lagna (the 5" house has Ketu aspected by 
Mars) which in turn is aspected by Saturn. This promises technical 
education. 

Now see the dasha scheme: At the age of 11 he got the dasha 
of Mars which is in the 10‚Äù house of distinction with directional 
strength aspected by Saturn. This confirms technical education. 

Mahadasha of Rahu : Rahu is in the 11", a good position to be 
in and is with Sun lord of five and Mercury lord of 7 and 10 making 
a Rajayogas. This dasha is bound to be good. From Rahu debilitated 
Jupiter having Neecha Bhanga Rajyoga is in the 4* and Saturn 
fourth and 5" lord from Rahu is in the 6" from Rahu. That shows 
success through competitions. 

Now see from Moon: Rahu is with 10* lord Mercury with 
Sun which shows government service. 

Now examine the condition of Saturn the sub-period lord.Saturn 
is in Kendra from birth lagna and in the house of Jupiter which has 
been praised by Uttarkalamitra. It is aspected by Mars, 5* lord in 
the 10" house. Then from Rahu it is in the 6" house of competition 

: from Moon it is the 5" and 6" lord in the 7", a Kendra which has 
been describes as the place of pad praptthe position giver. Most 
important is the next sub- period of Mercury the 7" and 10" lord. 
This showed both high position and marriage. 

in navamsa Rahu is in the 11 ‚Äúhouse again and Saturn is in 
the 7" house of padprapti and marriage. From Rahu in navamsa 
Saturn is in a trine aspected by Jupiter and is with Mercury, the 5" 
lord also receiving the aspect of Jupiter from the 5" house. The 
best feature of navamsa is that Jupiter aspects Mercury, Saturn 
and Rahu and the Moon from the third house. Rahu period was 
bound to be good. 

While discussing the Mahadasha of Jupiter , Rao states that 
next period of Jupiter would be comfortable but not as good as that 
of Rahu. Because it is debilitated. But being involved in an exchange 
with Satum it must have been a period of making property. "What 
must have remained towards the end "of Jupiter period is an 
undistinguished record. See it in three ways: 

From the debilitated Jupiter in the birth horoscope, Rahu is in 


322 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


the 10" house with 6" and 8* lord, though Mercury here as the 9‚Äù 
lord could have prevented the ruination of his career. 

In the navamsa Rahu in the third house is being aspected by 
8* and 12" lord from Jupiter. In the dashmansha, Rahu is with the 
8* and 12"lords- hardly good for rise in power. 

Now the next dasha of Saturn aspected by Mars, the 12* lord 
in the birth horoscope, shows some controversy, bad confidential 
reports or lackluster performance as a result of which he would be 
overlooked for promotion. There were chances that person would 
be transferred to some public sector undertaking particularly where 
there was some construction or house building activity. Saturn in 
the 4* shows houses , Mars represent lands and being the twelfth 
lord a deputation as well, a deputation which may necessitate his 
retirement from service. 


The tenth lord of navamsa is in the 8* house while 10" lord of 
dashmansha is aspected by Sun from the 8* house. In such cases 
early retirement becomes beneficial. 


Role of debilitated Planets in the Horoscope : 

One should not be afraid of debilitated planets in the horoscope. 
It has been observed that in majority of the horoscopes of celebrities 
there are one or two debilitated planets. In the horoscope of world 
famous sitarist Ravi Shankar, Moon is debilitated in the 6* house. 


Moon is in Anuradha nakshatras which has been praised in 
classical books as conferring Rajyoga. The debilitated planet in three 
six , eight and twelve houses is also good as per principles of 
Parashara. In Ravi Shankra's horoscope the Saraswati yoga is 
visible from lagna as well as from Moon. This yoga of art, music 
and high learning is formed when three benefic planets Venus, 
Mercury and Jupiter are in 2‚Ñ¢ house, trines or Kendras from lagna 
or Moon. Saraswati is goddess of learning, music and fine arts. 


Another horoscope of world known figure and a Noble Prize 
winner is that of Albert Einstein who has two debilitated planets 
Moon and Venus. 

Moon is again in the 6* house in Anuradha Nakshatra 
conferring Rajyoga. Mercury gets Neechabhanga Rajyoga by its 
association with an exalted planet Venus. This horoscope has again 
Saraswati Yoga both from lagna as well as Moon which according 
to Phaladeepika gives intelligence, mathematical skill as well as 
artistic ability, talent etc.

Dasha Chidra 

(Based on article written by K.N. Rao in Journal of Astrology 
~ April - June 2001) 

Every Mahadasha represents a major change from one set 
of circumstances while Antardasha in Mahadasha shows changes 
within pattern set by Mahadasha. 

Generally the change of a Mahadasha and the beginning of 
another is a landmark remembered as a Dasha Chidra. Some of 
the astrologers stress negative and disastrous changes only. 
However a change is a change. 

The changes in the Dashas could be of four kinds. 

a. From benefic to benefic 

b. From benefic to malefic 

‚Ç¨. From malefic to malefic 

d. From malefic to benefic. 

This will be visible in the changes from last Antardasha of the 


324 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Mahadasha ending the beginning of the new Mahadasha whose 
Antardasha will be the same as that of Mahadasha lord. 
Examine the Following: 

1. House lordship of the Dasha lords - of ending or beginning of

Taken from Varahamihira Brihat Jatak 

The person gets the royal power in the Antardasha of the 
most powerful planet who combines in the 10th or of the Ist. He 
loses that power in the Antardasha of the planet who is unfriendly 
or Neecha house because such period is called Chidra Dasha. 
Then he must seek protection from a powerful king. 

Take a planet in the first or 10 and whichever is the stronger 
predict acquisition of power during that Antardasha. If there are 


328 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


no planets in the first or the tenth find out which of the lot is strongest 
and ascribe the power to him during his Antardasha. Such kingly 
power or office will be lost when the Antardasha of a planet, which 
occupies an unfriendly or debilitated Rasi, intervenes. 


This is called Chidra Dasha, which means accident or 


misfortune as well as hole, and therefore he gets into unfortunate 
position by losing his power.

by its own lord Moon. 
Special Results of Dasha and Antradasha of Venus and Saturn 


According to Uttarkalamitra if Saturn and Venus are both 
strong and become Yoga Karka results of their Dasha and 
Antardasha are very unfavourable. (Strength means exalted own 
house, Vargottam etc.) 

Under such condition the native will be as good as a beggar 
even though he may be rich like Kuber. 

But if one is strong and another is weak the native will enjoy 
good results according to character and strength of stronger 
planet. 

If both of them be weak and are posited in 6, 8, and 12 or one 
of them is situated in 6* or 8* place or another, or they own any 
Dusthan or are posited there or associated with lord of Dusthan 
the results of their Dashas or Antardasha will be exceptionally 
good. 

Saturn and Venus Dashas as given by Kalidas in 
Uttarkalamitra. Venus and Saturn in their mutual sub periods give 
good results if they are in 6, 8 and 12 from each other or in 


Dasha 365 


conjunction in such houses, with one or both debilitated or a malefic 
for the horoscope. 

As ‚ÄòJupiter‚Äô states in his book, 'What the stars foretell‚Äô, this 
rather amusing and seemingly paradoxical operation of Venus and 
Saturn is an " exception to the general rule." But Venus and Saturn 
are close friends as is obvious that each one is Yoga Karka in 
other's sign. Venus is Yoga Karka in Capricorn and Aquarius Lagna 
and Satur is Yoga Karka in signs with Lagna of Venus, Taurus 
and Libra. 


Born of wealthy parents. Venus is debilitated. Saturn 
retrogrades in Aries. He was a very high-ranking officer and person 
of repute. He made much money and rose very high in Saturn 
Venus. Saturn is Yoga Karka from Chandra Lagna. 


Chapter XVI 
Yogini Dasha 


Yogini Dasha is very popular in northern India. Some of the 
astrologers steeped in ancient tradition use only Yogini Dasha. On 
this basis they seem to give some very accurate predictions. 
According to Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra, Yogini Dasha was 
revealed by Lord Shiva to Goddess Parvati. There are 8 types of 
Yoginis which are in the following order. Their total operative period 
is 36 years. At the end of this cycle the next cycle starts again in 
the same order and this continues. 


Sr. No. Yogini Lord Period 
1 Mangala Moon 1 Year 
2 Pingala Sun 2 Years 
3, Dhanya Jupiter 3 Years 
4, Bhramari Mars 4 Years 
5. Bhadrika Mercury 5 Years 
6. Ulka Saturn 6 Years 
7, Siddha Venus 7 Years 
8. Sankata Rahu 8 Years 


According to classical texts the planets, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, 
Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Venus and Rahu have been evolved 
respectively from Yoginis, Mangala, Pingala, Dhanya etc. 


Yogini is a Nakshatra based Dasha. The Mahadasha of 
each yogini starts with itself and follows in a regular order as 
above. 


Calculation of Yogini Dasha 


Note down the Nakshatra number in which Moon is in the 
birth horoscope. Add three to the number (there are 27 Nakshatras. 
Eight Yoginis are to be rotated amongst them. If we divide 27 by 
eight, remainder is three) and divide by eight. Remainder gives the 


be 


Yogini Dasha 367 


number which represent the Yogini operative at birth as per order 
in the table above. 


Example: 

Suppose in a horoscope the Moon is in LIBRA Lagna at 16¬∞ 
40". It is, therefore in Swati Nakshatra whose number is 15. Add 3 
to no 15 and you get 18. Divide 18 by 8 (no of Yoginis). This gives 
a balance of 2. The second yogini as per table above is that of 
Pingala. 

In this horoscope of Mother Teresa, Moon is with 26 degrees 
in Aries. It is in Bharani Nakshatra whose number is 2. Add three 
to 2 and you get five. Since the figure is less than 8 we will let it 
remain the same. The 5th yogini at birth as per table above is 
Bhadrika whose lord is Mercury and whose duration is 5 years.

Calculation of Dasha and Antardasha 
Balance of Dasha at birth. 

1. Moon is in Bhami Nakshatra at 26¬∞. The total length of 
Bharani Nakshatra is 26¬∞40‚Äô. It has still to cross 26¬∞ 40‚Äô - 26¬∞ = 
0.40‚Äô in this Nakshatra. The Yogini at birth is Bhadrika or No. 5 
whose duration is 5 years. Total length of Bhadrika is 13¬∞ 20‚Äô. 

For the total duration of 13¬∞ 20‚Äô or it has a balance of 5 years. 
So to arrive at the duration in 40 minutes, multiply 40 by 5 years 
and divide by 13¬∞ 20‚Äô or 800 minutes.

Chapter XVII 
Nakshatras 


Zodiac of 360 degrees has 27 Nakshatras or fixed Stars. Each 
Nakshatra has a span of 13¬∞20". It is further divided into 4 parts 
each of 3 degrees, 20 minutes. Each part is also called a Charan 
or Pada as also Navamsa. Nakshatras are important in the sense 
that the whole scheme of Parasari Dasha system is based on position 
of Moon at time of birth in a particular Nakshatra. 

The main source of information on Nakshatras are Vedas, 
Puranas, Mahabharat and occasional reference in classical books 
on Astrology, mainly Jatak Brihat of Varahamihira. Nakshatras are 
fertile field for research as some of the great secrets of Astrology 
are hidden in them. Knowledge of Nakshatras is a must for 
Muhurata or for choosing auspicious moments. 

Birth Star 

In Hindu Astrology Birth Star is called ‚ÄòJanam‚Äô Nakshatra. 
This is the Nakshatra in which Moon is located at birth.‚Äô Jyotishis' 
of old school give great importance to this factor. 

According to other school of thought ascertain whether the 
Moon or Ascendant is strong. The Nakshatra in which stronger of 
the two is posited is known as ‚ÄòJanam‚Äô Nakshatra. Still others take 
lord of Ascendant in place of Ascendant and compare it with Moon 
to see which is stronger of the two. 

The Nakshatras have a great importance in predictive 
astrology. The placement of lord of a house in 3rd, 5th and 7th 
Nakshatra from Janam Nakshatra is considered as evil. Though 
sometimes their importance is overstated yet with our present 
knowledge we should be very cautious in pronouncing judgement. 
Horoscope has to be seen in totality and is not to be condemned 
just because birth is not in an auspicious Nakshatra. 

Some Misconceptions 

Some misconceptions from the ancient times are being scrupulously 
followed by the traditional astrologers. According to whom the birth 
in following Nakshatras are considered inauspicious. 


386 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


For Girls 


For children of female sex birth in the following Nakshatras are 
considered inauspicious. , 

Ardra, Ashlesha, Satabhisha, Pushya, Moola, Chitra, Jyeshta 
and Krittika. These girls unless otherwise suitable are supposed to 
bring death, strife, sorrows after marriage. 


Boys 


Male children born in the mother's Nakshatra bring death to father, 
while those born in fathers Nakshatra lead to mother's death. This 
rule does not apply to girls. 


Gand Mool Nakshatras 


Special Importance has been attached for births in Ashlesha, 
Magha, Jyeshta, Moola, Revati, and Ashvini which in Hindu 
Astrology are known as "Gand Mool Nakshatras". They are 
considered inauspicious both for boys as well as girls. These 
Nakshatras are Nakshatras of Mercury and Ketu and occur at the 
conjunction of signs 4, and 5 (Cancer and Leo), 8 and 12 (Scorpio, 
and Sagittarius), 12 and 1, (Pisces, and Aries). 

According to Hindu Jyotish, Sandhi - strength of a juncture 
point is weakened because of the intermingling or transition of two 
different energies. 

Gandanta (end of the cheek) portions of the Nakshatra is 
another type of sandhi which is considered inauspicious. These 
portions are 

1. Last Pada 30¬∞20' of Ashlesha, Jyeshta and Revati 

(Nakshatras of Mercury) 

2. And first Pada or 3020 of Ashvini, Magha and Moola 

(Nakshatras of Ketu) 

Gandanta is particularly bad because it is a double sandhi, a 
juncture of two Rasis as well as two Nakshatras. Planets located 
at these points are very weak and supposed to cause major problems 
in life unless proper remedial measures are taken. 

These Nakshatras are supposed to cause following harms

According to some pundits there are 28 Nakshatras. This 
additional Nakshatra has been allotted number 22, thus shifting 
number of the rest of Nakshatras. Revati will thus get number 28.

I, 10 and 19 belong to Ketu. Nakshatras 2,11 & 20 belong to Venus

VARGAS 


Zodiac consists of 360 degrees or 12 Rasis of 30 degrees each. 
Each Rasi or sign is further subdivided into number of divisions. 
These divisions are called Vargas. 

Vargas are basic tools available to Vedic astrologers for 
predictive purposes. The success of Hindu astrology over all other 
systems available in the world goes no small measures to this division 
of Rasi into Vargas. Basically Vargas are used to measure the 
strength of planets. As it is well known principle of Astrology that 
only strong planets are capable of giving good results. The weak 
planets not only fail to deliver results of their signification but also 
spoil the results of the Bhava where they are placed or the Bhavas 
over which they transit. To give a small example the 5th lord, 
represents, among other things, education. If this 5th lord of the 
birth horoscope keeps repeating in various Vargas in its own house, 
sign of exaltation or in friend's house the achievements in the 
educational field of the person concerned would be really high. 

KN Rao is the first astrologer in this century who has used 
Vargas with stunning effect for giving accurate predictions. His 
use of Saptamsa for birth of children has been highlighted in his 
book "Planets and Children." 

While Maharishi Parasara has divided the Rasi in 36 
(Shodasvargas), the Vargas that are commonly used are as follows:

Importance of Vargas 


1. 


In the golden age of Hindu Astrology the Vargas had a 
considerable importance. No predictions were given without 
consulting the relevant Varga charts. In this material age, 
because of hankering after money and paucity of time the 
modern so called astrologers rarely use Vargas. That is why 
the results are generally not good. The only Varga that is 
being considered is Navamsa. With the new scientific study 
of astrology introduced by K.N. Rao the use of Vargas is 
being revived with remarkable effect. 
Basically the Vargas are used to measure strength of the 
planet. A strong planet who is well placed in Dasvargas gives 
excellent results. In Navamsa if a planet repeats itself in the 
same Rasi, is known as Vargottam. A Vargottam planet gives 
more or less as good results as that given by an exalted planet. 
Various names have, been given to planets if they keep 
themselves repeating in their own signs/signs of exaltation in 
Dashavargas. 
In Dashavargas (ten Vargas) if a planet 
a) repeats itself twice is known as Parijat 
b) repeats itself thrice is known as Uttam 
c) repeats itself four times is known as Gopura 
d) repeats itself five times known as Simhasan 
e) repeats itself six times is known as Parvata 

repeats itself seven times is known as Devalokan 
g) repeats itself eight times is known as Brahmloka 
i) repeats itself nine times is known as Airavata

repeats itself ten times is known as Sreedham 

An Uttam 5th lord makes a person highly educated, a Gopura 
makes one learned and gives great name and fame, while 
Simhasan makes him a Minister or an advisor. 

Vargas gives us great help in studying various aspects of 
life, like wealth, marriage, children, profession etc. 

During his Dasha or Antardasha if a planet is free frorr 
malefic aspects in most of the Vargas it gives excellent 
results. 

If an exalted planet becomes debilitated in Shadvargas or is 
placed in enemy's house it does not give good results. 

In contrast to this if a debilitated planet becomes exalted or 
is placed in own/friend‚Äôs house improves its position. A 
Vargottam debilitated planet also gives good results. 

Lagna Vargottam and two or three planets Vargottam give 
riches and prosperity. 

The Lagna Navamsa lord assumes great importance in 
prediction. Its association aspect with other planets becomes 
auspicious in giving good results. 

If Lagna lord of Rasi and Navamsa are both strong and have 
benefic association, life becomes smooth and prosperous. 
Similarly Lagna lord of Rasi and Drekkan, if well placed, 
give a successful career. 

According to Phala Deepika if the benefic planets be 
endowed with strength in Shadvargas, the native would lead 
a happy and prosperous life. 

According to same book if the Ascendant falls in a malefic 
Rasi in the Shadvargas, the native will be short-lived and will 
be poor and miserable. This will be compensated to some 
extent if the dispositor of ascendant is strong. In such cases 
person will be happy, prosperous and of high status. 
According to Hora Ratnam planets in various malefic 
divisions in Sapt Varga produce a cruel person, while in 
benefic division they produce a kind hearted and benign 
person. 

The Vargottama planet in Navamsa acts like exalted planet 
and gives excellent results. 

A debilitated planet or placed in enemy Rasi in Vargas gives 


Vargas 407 


trouble some time during its Dasha. 

16. Ifa debilitated planet in Rasi chart becomes exalted or 
is placed in friend's house in Navamsa then he does not 
give bad results. 

17. An exalted planet does not give good results if it 
becomes debilitated in Navamsa. If there are many 
planets in Shadvargas who are aspected with own 
Navamsa Pati (lord) or in the Rasi of Navamsa Pati 
(ord) then their Dasha brings happiness and gives 
good results. Even such malefic planet do not prove to 
be troublesome. 

18. Ifin Shadvargas, in majority of cases Lagna/lagna lord 
has benefic combination then life becomes happy and 
prosperous otherwise opposite are the results. 

19. Ifthe Lagnesh of Rasi chart and that of Navamsa are 
strong and have benefic aspect then the life is successful 
and prestigious. 

20. Ifthe lagnesh of Rasi chart and that of Drekkan are in 
good condition and strong that is they are aspected by 
benefics etc. then the person has a successful career, 
creates goodwill and happiness all around. 

21. Ifa planet is debilitated in both Rasi and Navamsa then 
it becomes Vargottam and gives good results. 

22. Malefic planets in Rasi chart improve their results if 
they are well placed in Navamsa. 

In the light of above let us discuss various Divisional Charts. 
1. RASI 

This is the basic and most important chart, which is also known 
as birth horoscope. It is different from the word Rasi normally 
used in Hindu astrology which denotes the sign in which Moon is 
placed at birth. 

It should be clearly understood that this chart is of basic 
importance. What is not promised in this chart and the Dasha 
scheme cannot be given in other charts. 

If the children are denied in the birth chart and are not promised 
in the Dasha scheme, then howsoever, the other charts may be 
good, birth of children will not occur. So is the case with other 
facets of life.

From Hora is judged wealth, prosperity and second house 
signification. 

It is the division of a sign in two parts of 15 degrees each 
in odd signs 1,3,5,7, 9and 11,the first 15 degrees go to the Hora of 
Sun, while the last 15 go to the hora of Moon. In even sign 2,4,6, 8, 
10 and 12 this process is reversed. The first 15 degrees go to 
Moon while last 15 degrees go to Sun. 

In the above horoscope Lagna is in odd sign with less than 
15 degrees, hence it is in the hora of Sun. The Sun is in even sign 
with more than 15 degrees therefore it will be placed in Sun's hora. 
Moon is more than 15 degrees and is in even sign therefore it will 
be in the hora of Sun. Mars is in even sign with more than 15 
degrees therefore it will be in hora of Moon. In the similar manner 
Mercury will be in the hora of Sun while Jupiter will be in the hora 
of Moon. Venus with more than 15 degrees is in odd 
sign, therefore it will be in the hora of Moon. Saturn with 
more than 15 degrees is in the even sign therefore it will be in

of Moon. The final picture will be as follows.

Moon: Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Rahu, Ketu 

Sun: Lagna, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Saturn 

Sun's Hora 

According to Varahamihira if malefics are placed in Solar Hora in 
odd signs one becomes famous, undertakes great work, possesses 
strength, wealth and great personal attraction. 

The male planets, Sun and Mars and Jupiter to some extent 
give good results in Sun's Hora. Some astrologers are of the opinion 
that Jupiter should be better placed in Moon‚Äô Hora as in Sun's hora 
it gives diseases of liver and upper abdomen. Benefics and female 
planets give best results in Moon‚Äô hora. Signification of a planet 
suffers ifit is in a wrong hora. 

1. Sun and Mars, if placed in odd Rasis and in Sun's hora, 
give much courage and strength. It gives success in politics 
and high rank and give plenty of initiative and drive. 

2. Atma Karka (the planet which has the highest longitude 
minus Rasis in the horoscope), give spiritual development 
in Sun's hora. 

3. Majority of planets in Sun's hora, and Lagna in Moon are 
good for financial prosperity. 

4. Planets in odd signs and Sun's hora are good for material 
things, they give much self confidence, but disturb mental 
peace. 

5. The planets here have the tendency to give riches through 
fair or foul means. 

6. Mercury in Sun's hora give break in education if other 
combinations are also there. 

7. Similarly Moon in Sun's hora disturbs peace of mind and 
gives emotional disturbance. Here aspects on Moon should 
also be taken into account while giving prediction. 

8. Venus in the hora of Sun may give weak sexual life and 
disturbed married life if other combinations are there. 

9. 5th lord and male planets in the hora of Sun give male 
children. 

10. The signification of a planet suffers if it is in a wrong hora. 


410 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Note: It has been observed that in the horoscopes of notable 
Spiritualists Sun is in Moon‚Äô hora while Moon is in Sun's 
hora. The significance of this will be discussed in greater 
detail in a separate paper. 


Hora of Moon 

According to Varahamihira if benefics join the lunar hora in even 
signs, the person becomes tender hearted, handsome, happy, popular, 
intelligent and polite speaker. 

1. Benefics and female planets give best results in Moon's 
hora. They make a person handsome, give attractive 
personality and make one popular with other sex. 

2. Benefics in Hora Lagna make one fortunate, wise, 
intelligent, jovial and give a magnetic personality. 

3. Even sign in Ascendant and hora of Moon give money 
with less labour and effort. 

4. Venus in Moon's Hora gives sweet behaviour, attractive 
personality and company of women of high society. Other 
combinations should also be checked. 

5. Mercury here gives good intellectual power and high 
academic education. 

6. Jupiter in even sign and hora of Moon give high rank and 
sometimes service in financial field. 

7. Sth lord in even sign in the hora of Moon give female children. 

8. It should be clearly understood that Sun, Jupiter and Mars 
are very powerful in the first half of odd sign, and Moon, 
Venus and Saturn give best results in 2nd half of even sign. 

3. Navamsa 

This is the most important Varga. Much of the credit of success of 
Hindu Astrology goes to Navamsa. This chart should be treated at 
par with birth horoscope and chart with Moon as Lagna No 
prediction should be given in any sphere of life, particularly on 
marriage without consulting this chart. This chart clearly shows 
the strength and weakness of planets. 

Navamsa is basically consulted for married life, temprea- 
ment, character of the spouse, timing of marriage, happiness and 
marital tensions. It also gives useful clue in practically all spheres 
of life. Each sign of 30 degrees of the zodiac has been divided into 


Vargas 411 


nine parts consisting of 3 degrees and 20 minutes. This has 
correlation with one fourth part of a Nakshatra consisting of 13 
degrees, 20 minutes, and is called a Pada constituting again 3 
degrees 20 minutes. (Nakshatras are 27 in number, and if we divide 
thezodiac of 360 degrees by 27, we get arc of one Nakshatra 
equal to 13¬∞20'.) 

There are various methods of making a Navamsa chart. 
Here we give the easiest one, so that these could be easily 
memorized. 

Since each Navamsa consists of 3¬∞20", first ascertain which 
Navamsa a planet or Lagna is by seeing its longitude. For example 
Ist Navamsa is from 0 to 3¬∞20', second from 3¬∞20‚Äô to 6¬∞40', 3rd 
from 6¬∞40‚Äô to 10¬∞, 4th from 10¬∞ to 13¬∞20' and so on. Remember 
3rd Navamsa finishes at 10¬∞, 6th finishes at 20¬∞, rest is easy. 

Example: Planet is having longitude of 22¬∞40‚Äô. Since 6th 
finishes at 20¬∞ and one Navamsa is of 3¬∞20‚Äô, planet is in the 7th 
Navamsa. Now start counting as follows: 

i) In movable Rasis (1,4, 7 and 10: Aries, Cancer, Libra and 
Capricorn) the counting starts from Rasi itself ie. where 
the planet is located. 

ii) In Fixed Rasis (2,5,8 and 11) the counting starts from 9th 
place from its location 

iii) In dual signs (3, 6, 9, 12) the counting starts from the 5th 
position. 

Example 

In Mahatma Gandhi's horoscope Lagna is 11 ¬∞56' in 4th Navamsa 
and is in movable Rasi therefore the counting will start from this 
Rasi (Libra). The 4th from Libra is Capricorn. Hence, Navamsa 
Lagna will be in Capricorn. Sun in dual Rasi Virgo is in the 6th 
Navamsa. In dual Rasi the counting starts from the sign 5th from 
it. 5th from Virgo where Sun is placed is Capricorn. 6th from 
Capricorn is Gemini. Sun will therefore be in Gemini Navamsa. 
Moon with 28¬∞ 15‚Äô is in 9th Navamsa and is placed in movable Rasi 
Cancer The counting will therefore start from the Rasi itself. 9th 
from Cancer is Pisces. Moon will therefore be in Pisces in Navamsa 
chart. Mars with 26¬∞23' is in 8th Navamsa in movable Rasi Libra. 
Therefore counting will start from Libra itself. 8th from Libra is 
Taurus. Therefore Mars will be in Taurus Navamsa. Similarly other 
planets should be placed in Navamsa chart in the manner explained 
above.

The Navamsa chart would take the following shape. 


Moon Rete ¬•en 
Mars 


Navamsg 


Mahatma 


II Method: First ascertain as above the number of Navamsa planet 
is in. Then with the help of chart shown, add number given in each 
Rasi. This will be the sign in which planet is located. 

Example: 


In Mahatma Gandhi's horoscope Lagna is in the 4th Navamsa in 
Libra. From the above chart we find that there are six points in 
Libra. Adding 4 and 6 we get number 10 which is Capricorn. Lagna 
will, therefore, be in Capricorn. Sun is in Virgo in the 6th Navamsa. 
Virgo has 9 points in the chart above. Adding 6 and 9 we get the 
number 15 or 3 which is sign Gemini. Sun will, therefore, be in 
Gemini Navamsa. Moon with 28¬∞ 15‚Äô is in the 9th Navamsa in 
Cancer. Cancer has 3 points. Adding 9 and 3 we get the number 12 
which is sign Pisces. Moon will, therefore, be in Pisces in Navamsa 
chart. Mars is in Libra in the 8th Navamsa. Libra has 6 points 


Vargas 413 


therefore adding 8 and 6 we get figure 14 or 2 which is Taurus. 
Mars will, therefore, be in Taurus Navamsa. Similarly workout the 
position of other planets. 
Remember: The planets in the first Navamsa in movable Rasis, 
Sth in fixed Rasi, and 9th in dual are Vargottam. It means these are 
in the same Rasi in Navamsa as in the birth horoscope. 
Importance of Navamsa 
According to Phala Deepika if lord of the Ascendant is strong in 
Navamsa one attains all types of happiness. 

According to Hora Ratnam status about the lost article is 
to be obtained from Navamsa. 
Vargottama Navamsa 
The meaning of Vargottama planet has been explained. The first 
Navamsa of a movable sign, middle one of the fixed sign and last 
one of the dual sign are called Vargottam. According to Hora 
Ratnam one bom with such a Navamsa Ascendant will be the 
chief of his race, means he will be very prosperous. 

There are various variations of Vargottama planet. It can 
be Vargottama in 
Exaltation 
Mooltrikona sign 
Own sign 
Friendly sign 
Enemy sign 
Debilitation sign 
The power to do good decreases in descending order. The question 
now arises as to what type of results a Vargottam debilitated planets 
give. Opinion is divided here, but we are inclined to agree with 
those who believe that a Vargottam debilitated planet is capable of 
causing lot of mischief. 

1. In Vargas this is the most important chart. No prediction 
should be made without consulting Navamsa charts and it 
should be read as birth chart. South Indian astrologers attach 
great importance to this Varga and do not give any 
prediction without consulting this chart. 

The relative value allotted to Vargas in Shadvargas by classical 
writers are 

Rasi 6

414 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Drekkana 4 
Navamsa 5 
Dwadasamsa 2 
Trimsamsa 1 


According to this Navamsa is almost at par with the birth chart. 

2. It shows strength and weakness of planets. Debilitated 
planets may become exalted in Navamsa and hence may 
improve its position and vice a versa According to ancient 
texts a debilitated planet, if exalted in Navamsa, gives the 
result of an exalted planet. However, it will be more 
appropriate to say that its position is improved and does 
not give the bad results it is supposed to give. 

3. To see the strength of the horoscope, count the number of 
Raj Yogas in the birth horoscope. Compare these with those 
in Navamsa. If the number of Raj Yogas do not substantially 
decrease, the strength of the horoscope stays. But if the 
number is substantially decreased the horoscope does not 
remain as powerful as it is supposed to be. 

4. If lord of the ascendant is strong in Navamsa, this becomes 
a great asset, and the personality of the person becomes 
impressive and prosperity increases. According to Jatak 
Parijat appearance of the person can be determined 
according to the lord of ascendant in Navamsa or the 
strongest planet placed in the ascendant of the birth 
chart. Lord of the ascendant in Navamsa would in this case 
become very important if it is also strong in birth chart. 

5. In determining profession 
Normally profession is judged from lord of 10th in the birth 
horoscope, 10th from Lagna, Moon or Sun whichever is 
strongest. But this will give correct results in only 50 per 
cent of the cases. Still better results can be obtained from 
the lord of Navamsa of the 10th lord. 

64th Navamsa 

In medical astrology lord of the 64th Navamsa is evil and causes 
trouble in its Dasha/Antardasha. 

Calculation 

Place the degree of the Moon in the sign 8th from it, and determine 
the Navamsa of that sign. The lord of that Navamsa is lord of 64th 
Navamsa, and along with planets falling in Navamsa chart, act as 
malefic. 


Vargas 415 


In the usual Navamsa chart, the sign falling in the 4th house 

from Moon happens to be 64th Navamsa. 

Example: Mahatma Gandhi's horoscope 

In this horoscope Moon is in Cancer with 28¬∞ 15‚Äô.Place this degree 
28¬∞15‚Äô in the sign 8th from Moon i.e. in Aquarius, and determine its 
Navamsa. Since this is 9th Navamsa in a fixed sign (Aquarius), in 
Navamsa Chart it would be placed in Pisces. (Counting would 
start from 9th from Aquarius which is Libra. 9th from Libra is 
Gemini). If we see the Navamsa chart we find that 4th from Moon 
is Gemini. The Lord of Gemini is Mercury, which is lord of 64th 
Navamsa and hence evil. 

7, Navamsa and Marriage 

Navamsa chart is utilized in timing of marriage, j udging the quality 
of married life, looks and behavior of partner, character," mental 
and physical characteristics of spouse, matching of horoscopes, 
divorce death and separation. 

TI) Happiness in Marriage 

importance of Navamsa Lagna and 7th lord of birth chart. Married 
life is happy if Navamsa Lagna is exalted, is in its own sign and is 
aspected/ conjunct with benefics. It is still better if 7th house/ 7th 
lord of Navamsa chart is also studied. 

Sun Moon opposition in 1/7 axis means continuance 
bickering. Saturn, lord of scarcity in 12 mean denial of beds/sexual 
pleasures. 

Looks and behavior of wife/husband 
See the condition of Lagna/lord in Navamsa and planets it is with, 
if it is with Moon wife is beautiful and vivacious. 

i) With Venus beautiful and artistic. 

it) With Mercury knowledgeable and witty. 

iti) With Jupiter religious and pure type. 
Sun gives haughty, Saturn mean, Mars aggressive and angry, Rahu/ 
Ketu unreliable, cheat and low minded spouse. 
Most of the astrologers use 7th in Navamsa Lagna to get description 
of husband ‚Äòand wife, both mental as well as physical- Moon is 
mainly concerned with mental characteristics. 
Matching of Horoscopes 


Lagna or the Moon of the spouse matches with Rasi occupied by 
lagna/ Moon in the Navamsa of native.

4 Drekkan (D-3) or Decanates 

Each sign consists of 30 degrees, which is divided into three parts 
of 10 degrees each, 1 to 10 degrees are in the IstDrekkan, 10 to 
20 degrees in second and those which are from 20 to 30 degrees 
belong to third Drekkan. Planets/Lagna falling in the first Drekkan 
belong to sign itself, the second Drekkan are in the sign 5th from it 
and the third Drekkan is in the sign 9th from it. 

Example: Mahatma Gandhi's horoscope 

In this horoscope Lagna is of 11 ¬∞56', hence it is in the 2nd Drekkan 
and, therefore, it will belong to sign Sth from it. The sign 5th from 
Libra is Aquarius, therefore the Lagna of Drekkan would be 
Aquarius. Sun with 16¬∞55‚Äô is again in 2nd Drekkan. Therefore in 
Drekkan chart it will be in sign Sth from it which is Capricorn. 
Moon with 28¬∞ 15' is in 3rd Drekkan in sign Cancer. Therefore in 
Drekkan chart it will be placed in the sign 9th from it which is 
Pisces. Similarly other planets should be placed in Drekkan chart. 
In the case of Mahatma Gandhi the Drekkan chart would be as 


follows: 


According to Phala Deepika if lord of Drekkana of Ascendant is 
strong, person will derive all types of happiness and he will be 
"king". According to this if the rising Drekkan be in his own Varga, 
or associated with benefics or be in his own exaltation .or friendly 
house, the person will be endowed with good qualities, clever, long 
lived, merciful, wealthy, widely renown with all comforts.

derived from them.

2. It also shows the number of sisters/brothers of the person 
concerned. 
3. According to Varahamihira in Brihat Jatak if Moon is in 
his own or friendly Drekkan the person will be handsome 
and virtuous. If the Moon is in other Drekkan person will 
get the characteristic of the lord of Drekkan. This is the 
opinion also of Phala Deepika. according to which person 
will be handsome as well as rich. 
4. If the Moon is in serpent Drekkan the person will be 
vindictive and excitable. The serpent Drekkans are Cancer 
II and II Scorpio I and II Pisces II If Moon is in armed 
Drekkana person is fond of killing or murdering. If the 
Moon is in bird Drekkan, person is fond of travelling. The 
definition of these Drekkana is given below. 
5. Nature of death is ascertained through 22nd Drekkan. 
The lord of 22nd Drekkan is death inflicting. Its lord during 
its Dasha, if other factors corroborate, can be fatal or can 
give serious health problems. 
6. Malefics in rising Drekkan and trines If Saturn is in 
the rising Drekkan and malefics are in other Trikonas, 5th 
and 9th places, it indicates a diseased body. Mars in place 
of Saturn in rising Drekkan denotes death, while Sun in 
such a situation indicates disease, deformity or death. Use 
of Drekkan is also made to locate nature of disease‚Äù. 
Saravalli. 
How to Calculate 22nd Drekkan 
In the Rasi chart place the degrees of Lagna in the sign 8th from it. 
Ascertain its Drekkan in the normal way. The lord of the sign 
where this Drekkan falls is lord of 22nd Drekkan. In the normal 
Drekkan chart the lord of 8th house is lord of 22nd Drekkan. 
The ascendant is of 11 ¬∞5 6' of sign Libra. Place these degrees in 
8th sign from Lagna which is Taurus. Count from Taurus, since it 
is in the 2nd Drekkan, the Drekkan would fall in the sign 5th from 
it or in Virgo. If we see the Drekkan chart of Mahatma Gandhi we 
find that in this chart the 8th sign from Lagna is Virgo. The lord of 
Virgo is lord of 22nd Drekkan and hence is evil. 

(In the normal Drekkan chart lord of 8th is lord of 22nd 
Drekkan.) 

In all those cases where violent death has occurred 
involvement of Saturn, Mars Rahu Ketu would be there on 22nd

drekkan or Lagna of Drekkan chart would be afflicted with these 


planets. 

In the case of violent death of Mahatma Gandhi there is

4. Sex of Younger Brother 
If third house in Drekkan is a male sign and is occupied/ aspected 
by male planets and Mars is also strong a younger brother is born. 
5. Auspicious moments to start journey 
Journey should not be made in Ayudh Drekkan as its effects would 
be defeat, litigation and loss. This rale can also be applied to sports 
teams embarking on ajourney to participate in world sports like 
test matches etc.

10. Liberal Interpretation of Slokas 

Varahamihira describes the first Drekkan of Sagittarius as ‚ÄòFace 
of a man with body of a horse holding a big bow.‚Äô This could be 
interpreted to mean a person of tremendous energy on the move 
always in execution of his plans. Experience has shown that persons 
bom in first Drekkan of Sagittarius have these qualities to a great 
extent. 

Profession 

Brihat Jatak in Adhyaya 23, Sloka 6, "If Saturn aspects Drekkan 
sign occupied by Mercury while in Kendra from Lagna, native is 
an artist." 

Medical Astrology 

If rising Drekkan is in middle and Saturn is in the 6th normally 
there is a backache to native. 

Similar would be the result if in Navamsa both 6, and 8 are 
afflicted. Lagna of D-12 will show what kind disease a person 
suffers from, airy, watery, fiery or earthy. 

5. Chaturthamsa (D - 4) 

This chart is seen for fate, destiny or 'Bhagya', movable and 
immovable property and conveyance. Good use has been made of 
this chart in predicting construction or owning of houses. See my 
article in "Journal of Astrology‚Äù, July, 1999. 

Each sign of 300 is divided into 4 parts of 7¬∞30". First part 
of planets/lagna falling from 1¬∞ to 7¬∞30' falls in the sign itself. 2nd 
part from 7¬∞30' to 15¬∞ fall in the sign 4th from it. The third part 15¬∞ 
to 22¬∞30‚Äô falls in the sign 7th from it. The fourth part 22¬∞30‚Äô to 30¬∞ 
degrees falls in the sign 10th from it. 

Example 

In the case of Mahatma Gandhi's horoscope Lagna is of 11¬∞56' 
which is 2nd part hence the counting will start from the sign 4th from 
it. 4th from Libra is Capricorn. Hence the Lagna of Chaturthamsa 
would be Capricorn. Sun with 16¬∞55‚Äô is in 3rd part in Virgo, hence 
counting would start from the sign 7th from it. The 7th from Virgo is 
Pisces. In Chaturthamsa chart Sun would be placed in Pisces.

6. Saptamsa (D-7) 

This divisional chart is seen for children, happiness from them, 
their sex, and other related matters. See K.N. Rao's Book 'Planets 
and Children‚Äô for the effective use made of this chart. Each sign of 
30 degrees is divided into 7 parts of 4¬∞ 17‚Äô each. In odd signs counting 
starts from the sign itself whereas in even signs counting starts 7th 
from the signs where the planet or Lagna falls.

In case of horoscope of Mahatma Gandhi Lagna is in odd sign with 
11¬∞56' that is 3rd part the sign 3rd from Libra is Sagittarius hence 
the Lagna of Saptamsa would be Sagittarius. The Sun with 16¬∞55‚Äô, 
is in 4th part. Since Virgo where Sun is located is even sign the 
counting would start in the sign 7th from it. The 7th from Virgo is 


422 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Pisces and 4th from Pisces is Gemini Sun would therefore be in 
Gemini in Saptamsa chart. Similarly the position of other planets 
should be worked out. The Saptamsa chart in case of Mahatma 
Gandhi would be as above. 

Ifin Saptamsa Lagna is in odd sign and is aspected/conjunct with 
benefic planets, son gives pleasure and happiness to father. 

If Lagna is even sign and is aspected by benefics etc. 
daughter is source of pleasure to father. 

If instead malefics aspect Lagna etc. opposite are the 
results. To see the Saptamsa chart you must study the condition of 
lagna lord and 5th lord. If they are strong and well placed that is 
aspected by benefics etc. then the children will give all type of 
pleasures to the parents and achieve name and status. 

According the Mansagri if in Lagna of Saptamsa, there is 
Moon or any other benefic planets then the person concerned strong 
(Prakarmi), famous (Pratapi), co-operative (Sahyogi) and is a 
warrior (Sahasi). He is friendly type and spreads happiness all 
around. 

If any planet is at the last saptamsha and is in own house 
and exalted then the person concern is fond of horse riding and 
does many dangerous things. This type of person lives away from 
friends and brothers. 

In the Dasha of exalted and benefic planets in Saptamsa 
the person proves to be lucky and receives the recognition from 
the king. 

If in the 3rd house of Saptamsa there is Sun, Mars or Jupiter 
then the person becomes rich by honest means. 

The exalted and strong planets in Saptamsa during their 
Dasha give money and happiness. In case they are debilitated or 
weak they give opposite results. 

7. Trimsamsa 
This chart is seen for 
i) miseries and happiness. 
ii) evils or Arishta‚Äô

With Saturn in its awn Trimsamsa becomes sick, loses his wife, is 

of loose character, has houses and servants and is unclean. 

Jupiter in his own Trimsamsa gives wealth, happiness, education, 

reputation and enjoyment. 

Mercury in its own Trimsamsa gives intelligence, education poetical 

ability, eloquence, art and enterprise. 

Venus in its own Trimsamsa gives charming personality, wealth, 

children, health and sex. 

Sun and Moon in Trimsamsa of Mars make one cruel and warlike. 

1. Ifthe Lagna or Moon is in the signs of Mars, Aries or 

Scorpio, then Trimsamsa in Jupiter is considered good and 
makes one virtuous. In signs of other planets it is not 
considered good.

If the Lagna or Moon is in the signs of Venus, Taurus or 
Libra, then Trimsamsa in the sign of Venus makes one

questionable. 


3. If the Lagna or Moon is in the signs of Mercury, Gemini or 


Saturn 


6. 


Virgo, then Trimsamsa in Mercury makes one noble, in 
signs of Jupiter, virtuous, in sign of Saturn impotent, in the 
signs of Venus adulterous and promiscuous. 


If the Lagna or Moon is in Cancer, then Trimsamsa in 
Mercury makes one fond of Music and Art, in Jupiter noble 
in Mars does what she likes. 


If the Lagna or Moon is in Leo then Trimsamsa in Mercury 
makes one masculine and in Jupiter noble. 


(Adulterous) 


If the Lagna or Moon is in Sagittarius, or Pisces then 
Trimsamsa in Mercury makes one fond of Music and Art, 
in Jupiter noble, in Venus immoral. 


If the Lagna or Moon is in the signs of Saturn, Capricorn 
or Aquarius then Trimsamsa in Jupiter gives a loving wife. 


According to Varahamihira in case of females if birth or 
Moon falls in the house of Mars and occupies the Trimsamsa 
of Mars. Saturn, Mercury or Venus, the girl will be immoral, 
dancing woman, double hearted or sinful respectively. 


9. Again, according to Varahamihira if birth or Moon falls in 


signs of Venus and occupies the signs of Mars she becomes 
immoral, in Saturn she marries a second husband while

i) The age of parents 

ii) Their social and financial standing 

iii) The amount of happiness one can derive from the parents. 

iv) To study higher consciousness and provides a link between 
the past and future lives. 

How to Study this Chart 
See the condition of Lagna, Lagna lord, 4th house/lord, 9th house/ 
lord. If the Lagna has benefic association and aspects, one is going 
to derive all types of pleasures from the parents. 

In addition to this study the Dwadasamsa chart along with 
chart. If the Lagna of the Dwadasamsa chart is in birth chart in 

i)  Lagna - it is good for health, wealth and prosperity of 
parents. 

ii) Its placement in 6, 8 and 12 of birth chart show that one is 
not going to derive any benefit from father. Same would 
be the condition if this planet is debilitated, combust or 
associated with malefics. 

ii) Ifit is exalted, in its own house, associated with benefic 
planets, it is lucky both for parents as well as the individual 
concerned and all help and happiness from parents would 
be forthcoming.

HOW TO READ THE CHART 

For education we normally see the 4th and the 5th houses. See the 
condition of these houses/lords not only in birth chart but also in 
Chaturvimshamsa chart. If they are also well placed in this Varga 
educational achievements will be high. See also the condition of 
the Dasha lord during the age when education career is being 
pursued. It will give you good idea regarding progress of education. 
Their placement in 6,8 or 12 or aspect by malefics would show 
interruption in education.

14, Khavedamsa (D-40) 

Also known as Chatvarimshamsa is seen for studying the auspicious 
and inauspicious effects of horoscope on the native. Each sign of 
30 degrees is divided into 40 parts of 0¬∞ 45' each. 

For odd signs counting starts from Aries and even signs 
from Libra. Suppose Moon is in Capricom at 3¬∞ 25'. It is then in 
the 5th part. As Scorpio is an even sign the counting would start 
from Libra. 5th from Libra is Aquarius where Moon will be placed 
in Khavedamsa chart. 

15. Akshvedamsa (D_ -45) ; 
This chart is seen for character and conduct of the native and also 
for the general auspicious and inauspicious effects. Each sign of 
30 degrees is divided into 45 parts of 0¬∞ 40' each. Counting starts 
from Aries in movable signs, from Leo in fixed signs and Sagittarius 
from dual signs. Suppose Mercury is in Cancer 11 ¬∞50' degrees in 
18th division. Cancer is movable sign, therefore counting would 
start from Aries. The 18th from Aries is Virgo where Mercury 
would be in Akshvedamsa chart. : 
16. Shashtiamsa Chart (D-60) 
Is seen for general auspiciousness and inauspicious indications. 
Each sign of 30 degrees is divided into 60 parts of 0¬∞30 each. 
Ignore the sign position of the planet. Multiply the longitude of the 
planet by 2. Ignore minutes and divide the degrees by 12. Add 1 to 
remainder. The resultant figure may be counted from the sign where 
planet is posited. 
Example 
Suppose Saturn is in Aries at 13¬∞ 10‚Äô. Multiply by 2 and we get 
26¬∞20". Ignore the minutes and divide the degrees by 12, we get 2 
as remainder Add 1 to this and we get 3. Counting 3 from ARIES, 
the sign where Saturn is located we get Gemini, the sign in which 
Saturn will be placed in Shashtiamsa. Its lord is Mercury. 

Maharishi Parasara has given the names of Shashtiamsas 
which are read in direct order in case of odd signs and in reverse 
order in case of even signs. Presiding deities are benefic or malefic 
as their name suggest. Each Shashtiamsa is of 0¬∞ 30'. The names 
of presiding deities are:

of Kubera, one becomes very wealthy. Ifthe 7th lord is a benefic 
planet in the shashtiamsa of Nirmal, wife is pure. Similarly 7th lord 
as Venus in the Shashtiamsa of Chandramukhi makes her extremely 
beautiful Similarly iflord of a house is in malefic shashtiamsa, the 
signification of the house suffers.

Yogas and Planetary Combinations 


What are Yogas 
Yogas in Astrology mean planetary combinations, which may give 
good or bad results depending upon the nature, condition and strength 
of the planets. 
Raj Yogas 
The Raj Yogas are the planetary combinations that give rulership, 
ministership, high rank and status. The planets/houses that are 
involved are Lagna/lagna lord, the Sun, 10th house and its lord, 7th 
house as itis 10th from 10th. According to Sarvarth Chintamani, 
2nd house should also be considered for bestowel of Raj Yoga, as 
this is 5th from 10th. 

A native becomes ruler, Minister, Prime-Minister and 
President, if above houses and lords are strong. 

Lagna lord strong and aspecting Lagna is a major Raj 
Yoga. Even a debilitated planet aspecting Lagna gives Raj Yoga. 

According to Parasara even if a single planet aspects the 
natal Ascendant, or Hora Lagna or Ghatika Lagna, the native 
becomes a king. 
Importance of Shadvargas 

If the ‚ÄòShadvargas" (Rasi, Navamsa, Hora, Drekkan, 
Trimsamsa and Dwadasamsa) of the Ascendant is occupied or 
aspected by one and the same planet, a Raj Yoga is formed. 
Raj Yogas: 

According to K.N. Rao, Raj Yogas of highest type are 
nearly 25: 

i) When majority of these are present in the horoscope 
one rises to dizzy heights. 

ii) If some of these are present rise is to middle level. 

iii) If these are few rise in life is ordinary. 

Strength of Yogas and proper Dashas are also important. 

Dasha: Any planet connected with 10 house/ lord or 7 
house/ lord gives honour and position provided it is well placed. 
Prominent Raj Yogas 

1. Lords of 2 and 5 in 2, or 5, or in 9 and 10. 
2. Lord of 2, and 11 in 10. 
3. Rahu in 4,5,10, and 11. Gn his Dasha)

4. Venus and Moon in three. 
5. Jupiter as lord of 9 in eight. 
6. Conjunction or aspect of lords of 9, and 8.- in period of 
8th lord. 
7. Neech Bhanga Raj Yogas. 
KENDRA TRIKONA RELATIONSHIP 

According to Parasara the Kendras or angles are known as 
Vishnu Sthan' (house of Lord Vishnu), while Trikonas are called 
‚ÄòLakshmi Sthans' or (houses of Goddess Lakshmi). If lord of 
Kendras establish relationship with a Trikona lord, it leads to Raj 
Yoga of a very high order. 

Lakshmi is the consort of Lord Vishnu the supreme god. Any 
relation between Trikona and Kendra lords has the blessings of 
both Sri Vishnu and Lakshmi and is very auspicious throughout the 
life of a person. 

Following are the conditions under which these connections 
between Trikona and Kendras are established. 

1. Exchange between the two. 2. Mutual aspect. 3. Conjunction 
In addition to this, though to a lessor degree, is the relation if the 
two are in their own houses. 

These relations may also be checked from Navamsa also. 

Most important Raj Yoga is the connection of lords of 9 and 

10. This is also known as Dharam Karam Adhipati Yoga. 10this 
the most powerful Kendra and 9th is the most powerful Trikona. 
Uttar Kalamnita highly praises this Yoga. 

Kendra Trikona combination is so important that it overcomes 
slight blemish of lordship of 3, 6, 8. 

Relation of 4 and 5 lords makes one Minister or advisor to an 
institution and is also prosperity giving Yoga. 

The following Raj Yogas are taken from Uttarkalamitra. 

Relation between 9th and 10th lords from 10th house from 
Lagna. This means relations between 6 and 7 houses. 

Relation between 9th and 10th lords from 9th house from 
Lagna. This means relations between 5 and 6 houses. 

Relation between 9th and 10 lords from Sun. 

Relation of lord of Rasi where Moon is located to Lagna and 
Navamsa lord of Moon.

Note: 


10. 


According to Parasara relationship between Atmakarka 
planet and Lagna is one the best Raj Yoga. If placed in 
one Rasi it makes a man very fortunate. 

Definition of Atma Karka .The natural Atma Karka or 
significator of soul is Sun. However, the term used here 
is as per Jaimini Astrology. Here Atma Karka is the 
planet which has attained the highest longitude in the 
horoscope. To measure longitude we omitrasi in which 
planets are placed. The 5th planet in descendant order 
in longitude from Atma Karka is known as Putrakarka. 
According to Dr. B .R. Raman Navamsa Lagna and Atma 
Karka in the same sign cause a powerful Raj Yoga. 
Three planets in exaltation make one very learned; three 
in own house a Minister; three debilitated an idiot, three 
exalted in Rasi but occupying evil Navamsa make one 
unhappy and wicked.‚Äô ‚Äî Chandrakala Nadi 

(The Tamil Jatakalankara says that one with 3 debilitated 
planets becomes a slave/ servant of a famous person.) 
If Atmakarka is in a benefic Rasi / Navamsa the native 
will be wealthy. If there are benefics in Karkamsa 
Lagna, he will be king-Parasara. 

Arudha Lagna and 'Darapad' in mutual Kendras or 
Trikonas or 3/11 from each other. The definition of these 
Karkas which are used by Jaimini is given at the end of 
this chapter. 

If two or all of Bhava Lagna, Hora Lagna, Ghatika 
Lagna are aspected by exalted planets. 

If the above three ascendants, their Drekkans and 
Navamsas or the above Lagnas and their Navamsas or 
Drekkans are aspected by a planet. 

Arudha Pada benefic sign with Moon while Jupiter in 
2nd house. 

Even one among the 6, 80r 121ords in debilitation aspect 
the ascendant there will be a Raj Yoga. 

Lord of 2nd, 4th, 10th or 11th aspect the ascendant, 
while Venus aspect the 11th from Arudha Lagna as 
Arudha Lagna is occupied by a benefic.

Neech Bhanga Raj Yogas 

Neech means debilitated, Bhanga means breaking. When a Yoga 
neutralises the effect of a debilitated planet it is known as Neech 
Bhanga Raj Yoga. This becomes effective under following 


conditions. 


1. 


If the Rasi of the lord where the debilitated planet is 
located (this is known as the dispositor of the 
debilitated planet), is exalted in the horoscope, it gives 
rise to 'Neech Bhanga‚Äô Raj Yoga. 

Example: Jupiter gets debilitated in Capricorn Rasi. 
If in a horoscope it is debilitated, i.e. is in Capricorn, 
then if in that horoscope lord of Capricorn i.e. Saturn 
is exalted, it gives rise to Neech Bhanga Raj Yoga. 
If a debilitated planet is in conjunction with another 
planet who is exalted, the debilitation gets cancelled. 
Example Venus as debilitated planet is placed in 
Virgo, but it is with Mercury who is exalted there - 
the debilitation gets cancelled. Same would be the 
position if Saturn as debilitated planet is with Sun in 
Aries, or Sun in Libra is with Saturn. 

According to 'Kumar Swamyan‚Äô, a celebrated book 
on astrology in Tamil, this is only cancelled if the 
planets are in Kendra from Moon. 


If dispositor of the planet (lord of the sign), where 
debilitated planet is located is in its own sign, even 
then the debilitation is cancelled. 

According to Phala Deepika if the debilitated planet 
is aspected by the lord of the house in which it is 
located, even then the debilitation is cancelled. 
The lord of the sign in which a planet is debilitated 
should be in Kendra to Moon or Lagna. 


Results: Neech Bhanga Raj Yoga gives as good a 
result as an exalted planet, but not without some 
kind of initial trouble or scandal.

Yoga. The person bom in this Yoga will spend little and 
save much money. He will be good to everybody, he will 
be happy and independent and will have respectable 
profession or conduct and will be well known. 
Debilitated lords of 3, 6, 8 or 12. 
According to K.N. Rao, lords of houses 3, 6, 8 or 12, if debilitated, 
give rise to Raj Yogas. 
The other Raj Yogas are 
(i) Jupiter in Lagna, Mercury in any Kendra aspected by 
Lagna lord. 
(ii) Jupiter in 5, 7 or 9 aspected by Lagna lord-person is as 
2% lucky as aking. 
(ui) Saturn exalted or in any Kona house aspected by 10th 
lord. 


1. Rasi Parivartan Yoga 

This is a very powerful Raj Yoga. It occurs when two planets change 
Rasis with each other. It does not matter whether the planets aspect 
each other or not. The interchange between good houses give 
excellent results. The interchange between 3, 6, 8 and 12 houses

gives rise to birth of a king who will conquer his enemies and observe 
religious rites and be learned. If in addition an exalted planet is in 
the second house in aspect to another exalted planet, a Koteeswara

a Lakshadheevra. or less powerful person is bom.

Jatak Parijat which are called Panch Mahapurusha Yogas. These 
are formed when the planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and 
Saturn, are in Kendra from Lagna or Moon in their own sign or 
signs of exaltation. Sun and Moon are excluded as their importance 
as Lagnas has been recognized. Their strength itself is an important 
factor in Predictive Astrology. Rahu Ketu do not count as these 
are shadowy planets. In these Yogas importance of planets in 
Kendras is emphasised where they become extremely powerful. 
On top of that if they have additional strength, being in their own 
houses or in exaltation signs they give excellent results.

From Lagna 
i) Lagan Adhi Yoga or Chandra Adhi Yoga 
According to Varahamihira if benefics occupy the 6, 7 and 8th 
houses from Moon, the Yoga is known as Adhi Yoga. A person 
bom in this Yoga will become a general, a minister or a king, and 
will be in enjoyment of great pleasures and wealth, with subdued 
enemies, long life and free from disease and fear. 

Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra "Should the benefics be in 
6, 7 and 8 from Lagna devoid of conjunction /aspect of malefics, 
Lagan Adhi Yoga is produced making one good person, learned in 
Shastras and happy." It also speaks of benefics in 6, 7 and 8 from 
Moon causing this Yoga. 

These benefics, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus may be together 
in one sign, or distributed in two, or three signs, in any way. 

Vaidyanath restricts Lagan Adhi Yoga to the condition that 
6, 7, and 8 should not be occupied or aspected by any malefic nor 
should a malefic occupy the 4th the house of happiness. 

It may be noted that 6,7, and 8th are the 9th, 10th, and 11th 
from 10th (all indicative of wealth and reputation). This Yoga 
guarantees commanding position for the native. 


Yogas and Planetary Combinations 443 


Adhi Yoga is a Raj Yoga. For it to be effective, it is desirable, 
that three benefics are strong and well placed ,not combust, eclipsed 
or debilitated and not combined with malefics. And Moon should 
be strong and full. 

Though it is a simple Yoga, Adhi Yoga is all the same a 
great Yoga, giving wealth position and power. 

Strength of 6 and 8 gives success in medical profession. 

In Chandra Adhi Yoga mental side is more involved and it 

rules out mental afflictions. 
ii) Amala Yoga- 

This Yoga is formed when there is a benefic in the 10th 
from Ascendant or from Moon. This benefic should be without any 
malefic aspects. A pure Amala Yoga gives lasting fame for years 
to come. 

According to texts with this Yoga one is honoured by the 

king, has power, is pious-charitable and virtuous and helpful to others. 
iti) Vasumati Yoga-Benefics in 3, 6, 10, 11 - give great wealth. 
iv) Lagan Adhipati and Dhanadhipati, lord of 1 and 2, related 
to each other 4 kinds of Dhanayogas are formed. 
Vv) Parijat Yoga: Normally a planet is strong if in addition to it 
being strong itself, its dispositor i.e. lord of the Rasi in which it is 
located is also strong. (A planet is strong if it is exalted, is in its own 
house, in Kendra Trikona, in friendly Rasi aspected by benefics 
etc.). In Parijat Yoga, which is a powerful Raj Yoga the emphasis 
is in second dispositor of Lagna lord being strong. 

It goes like this, ascertain the Rasi -in which Lagna lord is 
located. Call it A‚Äô. See in which Rasi the lord of A‚Äô has gone. Call 
it‚ÄôB'.If lord of 'B‚Äôis in a Kendra, Trikona or in its own house or in 
exaltation sign Parijat Yoga is caused. 

Another version; 

Ascertain the Rasi in which Lagna lord is placed. Again 
call it A‚Äô. Locate where the lord of A is posited in Navamsa. If it 
is in Kendra, Trikona own house or exalted, Parijat Yoga is caused. 

Result: Possesses elephants and horses- meaning is very 
rich, generous, and respected by the government. 


444 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


If Parijat Yoga is combined with Sanyas Yoga the person 
is widely respected and recognised and holds spiritual authority 
over hundreds and thousands. Even kings pay homage to him. 

It is better if there are no planets in 6 and 8 because it 
makes one free from enemies and debts. 

It is more of a wealth giving Yoga rather than political 
power giving Raj Yoga. 
vi)Parvata Yoga: 

This Yoga is formed if benefics are in Kendras while, 7 and 8 are 
vacant or occupied by benefics only. 

According to Phala Deepika Lagna lord should be in Kendra, 
Trikona, exalted or in its own sign. 

Result: modest, virtuous, famous king. 

b) According to Jatak Parijat this Yoga is formed in two ways. 

i) benefics in angles; 8 and 12 free, one planet in 9 strengthens this 
Yoga. 

ii) Lagna lord and 12 lord in mutual angles and aspected by friendly 
planets. 

The Tamil edition of Parasara Hora describes this Yoga in two 
forms, benefics in Kendras and 6. Alternatively benefics should be 
in angles and ninth house. 

There is another version of Parvat Yoga given in Phala 
Deepika according to which the dispositor of Ascendant lord should 
be in his own sign or Mooltrikona sign identical with an angle or 
trine from Lagna. 

According to Jatakadesa Marga if Lagna, 7th or 10th are 
occupied by planets while 8 and 12 are unoccupied this Yoga is 
formed. There is no mention of benefics or malefics in angles. 
Hora Sara has an jdentical version. 

Thus benefics in angles give most potent results which 
take place in their Dashas.

be watched as these may not be pleasant times.)

each other. 

According to Parasara, if Jupiter is in an angle from the ascendant 
or from the Moon and be conjunct or aspected by another benefic, 
avoiding at the same time, debilitation, combustion and inimical sign, 
Gajkesari Yoga is formed. One bom in this Yoga will be rich, 
virtuous, intelligent, will have many virtues and will please the king. 

Phala Deepika calls angular position of Jupiter between 
Moon and Jupiter as simply Kesari Yoga ,the effect of which will 
be the victory over enemies, intelligence, good speaker, long life, 
famous and rich.

formed by Jupiter in an angle from the Moon. This is common type 
of Yoga .Second type of Yoga is when Moon is aspected by Mercury 
or Venus while the aspecting planet is not debilitated or combust. 

Kumar Swamyam, famous Tamil classic states that Moon 
should be waxing while Jupiter should be in 4th or 10th from Moon. 
The constituent Rasis are Taurus, Pisces, Aquarius or Sagittarius, 
meaning Jupiter should be in Aquarius while Moon is in Taurus or

The rank and file of the practicing astrologers scare the 
clients to the hilt by giving dreadful predictions about the 
result of this Yoga. 


454 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


It is our experience that undue importance should not be given 
to this Yoga and the horoscope should be seen in totality. 
How Formed? 

If in a horoscope all planets are located between Rahu and 
Ketu, this Yoga is caused. 

Supposed Results: 

If this combination occurs in the annual mundane chart of a 
country it will strike disaster. It will bring war and destruction 
unparalleled in history. Country will face defeat and its people will 
go through an agonizing time. War, starvation, diseases and 
epidemics would follow. 

In individual horoscopes it will destroy the family of the person 
concerned. He will face much hardship. His property and wealth 
will disappear and his career may come to an end. His relations 
and friends may be the cause of sorrow and abandon him. 

No reference has been made in classical books about this 
Yoga and if horoscope is strong otherwise, the Lagna lord and lord 
of nine are strong, benefics are in Kendra Trikona, malefics are in 
3, 6 and 11 and adequate good Raj Yogas exit with proper Dashas 
one may ignore harmful effects of this Yoga. 

Dr. Raman is of the opinion that this Yoga is defunct. 

1. Ifa single planet is with Rahu or Ketu or outside the axis 
of Rahu and Ketu. 

2. The evil gets neutralized if the Lagna is between Rahu & 

Ketu. 

However evil gets intensified ifLagna is between Ketu and 

Rahu. 

It is also the opinion of some of the astrologers that this is not 
operative if planets are hemmed between Ketu and Rahu, others 
hold different view. 

21. Matsya Yoga 

Benefics in Lagna and the 9th house. Mixed planets in the 

5th and malefics in 4 and 8: 

Result: Astrologer, kind, virtuous, strong, beautiful, famous, 

learned and pious. 

Note: According to some versions malefics should be in 9th 
and not benefics. According to Jatak Parijat malefics should be in 


Yogas and Planetary Combinations 455 


the 9th and Ascendant. 

But Parasara insists that benefics should be in Lagna and 
ninth house 

Combination For Theft 

Following houses Planets are involved. 

1. House of Wealth - Second House. 

2. House of Gains - Eleventh House. 

3. House of theft- Sixth House. 

4. House of Loss - Twelfth House. 

5. Malefic Planets Saturn, Mars, Rahu/Ketu. 

6. Lord of 6, 8, and 12. 

Theft occurs when lords of 2/11 are in 6 and are connected 
with Mars / Saturn. 

When lords of 2 and 6 are aspected by malefics, Mars/ Saturn. 
22. Kahala Yoga 
1. According to one version lords of 4 and 9 posited in Kendra from 
each other while Lagna lord is strong. 
2 According to this 4th lord Jupiter should be in angles while Lagna 
lord is strong 
3. According to another version 4th lord should be in its own sign or 
sign of exaltation and should be conjunct with 10th Lord. 
Result: The person is energetic, adventurous, cunning, has an army 
and is lord of few villages. 
Mantreshwar puts Kahal Yoga as differently, according to which 
dispositor of Ascendant lord should be in exaltation or own sign 
identical with a trine or an angle. This makes a man kind, noble, 
prosperous and benevolent. 


Nabhas Yogas

Mundane Astrology Chapter III 
Ruling Signs of Countries 

Ptolemy, who is the father of the Western Astrology, 
has divided the whole world into various signs. Other 
astrologers subsequently modified this list. While this list cannot be 
depended upon, experience has shown that by and large this gives 
accurate results. Ptolemy's distribution in 2nd century A.D. was 
more or less Nirayana as Aynamsa was at that time one or one and 
a half degrees. 

Varahamihira has devoted two chapters in assigning 
constellations to various regions of India and some adjoining 
countries. These have been allotted on the basis of Nakshatras or 
constellations, which more or less have stood the test of time. The 
scheme on which this has been divided is known as Koorma 
Chakra, which has been described separately. 

Ruling Sign of India: 


1. Since Varahamihira's time India comes under the sign Capricorn. 
There is no doubt that Capricorn governs some parts of Northern 
India. Dr. B. V. Raman, however, considers Virgo to be India's 
ruling sign as Virgo (Kanya) symbolizes Kanyakumari, the southern 
most tip of India. 

2. Delhi the Capital of India is governed by the sign Scorpio (Vrischik). 
3. India got her independence on !5thAugust 1947 at midnight. At 
that time the sign rising was Taurus (Vrishab). The independence 
horoscope of India is given separately. The story behind time chosen 
is given by K.N. Rao in an illuminating article "How Hindu 

Astrologers Saved the Nation", in Journal of Astrology July‚Äî 
September 1997. 

4. India was declared a Republic on 26th January 1956 in Bharani 
Nakshatra. The sign rising was Meena and the horoscope is given 

separately. 

USA: 

Astrologers differ, but more or less majority allots Gemini (Mithun) 
as the ruling sign of the Independence Day of 4th July 1776. The 
timings of holding the convention at Philadelphia are not certain. 

KN. Rao thinks the mling sign could be Leo as it is giving better 

results. This has been discussed by him in the article in Journal of 

Astrology in the issue of January ‚Äî March 2002.

Mundane Astrology Chapter V 
Mundane Astrology- Important charts and Principles 


Following factors must be considered. 


1. Horoscope of the country concerned. For India the 
horoscope of Independent India 14/15 August, 1947, 00:01 AM, 
New Delhi. Lagna Taurus or Vrishabha. 


2. Any thing relating to Constitution, Republic Day Horoscope 
26.01.1950. Lagna Meena or Pisces. 


3. Horoscope of Hindu New Year which sets the trend for full 
year. Chaitra Shukla Paksh Prati Pada. New Moon‚Äî. Sun and 
Moon are in Meena Rasi. This date has to be referred to from 
Panchanga. For the year 2002 the date was 13th April 00:51 hrs. 
The Lagna was Dhanu. This would give a fairly good picture of 
what is to come in the year under review. 


4. Entry of Sun in movable Rasis, 1, 4, 7 and 10. (Mesha 
Karka Tula and Makar). The entry of Sun in cardinal points 
Rasis Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn is important. Horoscopes 
of entry time in these Rasis be made and result assessed. Entry of 
Sun in rest of Rasis is also made use of. This is known as Surya 
Vithi or time & entry of Sun in all the 12 Rasis, representing 12 
months of the year. 


5. Horoscope of the New Moon and full Moon every month to 
see immediate results. This will give results with reference to 
particular country, each fortnight. 


For example the lunation takes place in Makar Rasi and Rahu and 
Saturn are there. Then the country represented by Makar suffer 
greatly. Its people are discontented and restless, nation as a whole 
faces bad times, Cabinet is shaky for that particular month. During 
the same month this lunation might have taken place in the 10th 
house of some country which shows there might be death of the 
President or Prime Minister. Lawlessness will prevail and there may 
be signs of revolution. If the combination occurs in the 5fh house 
there would be set back to educational system and entertainment 
industry in the third house. of some country would disrupt rail system 
and communication. In 2nd house of another country there will be 


Mundane 497 


financial chaos, retrenchment and falling exports. Thus the evil effects 
will happen all over the world in one form or the other. 

6. Planetary Cabinet 

Seven planets change portfolio every year. These portfolios are 
kings, Prime Minister, commander in chief, lord of vegetation, lord 
of minerals, lord of juices, grain, cattle etc. The planet which is 
king in one year may becomes Prime Minister next year. These 
details are given in Panchang of each year. 

7. Role of Sun, Moon and Mars 

The Sun and Moon are generally royal planets; if in any year either 
of these do not become the king, then royalty suffers. Similarly 
Mars is permanent commander in chief. If in any year he does not 
become the commander in chief, the army and navy in that year 
suffer. All these details must be considered. The affliction to Royal 
Planets set a trend for the events affecting government each year. 


8. Role of Eclipses 


Eclipses (graham) play a great role in national astrology. The 
influence will be exercised for a period of six months before and 
six months after the appearance. The effect of eclipses will be felt 
in countries where these are visible. If two eclipses, one solar 
and one lunar, occur within 14 days, there will generally be 
national disaster like war, assassinations etc. 


There were two eclipses in March 1914 within 14 days, and 
Suryanarain Rao predicted the outbreak of the World War I. 
Eclipses have great significance in Mundane Astrology. 

Eclipses also affect leaders and nations. 

Eclipse take place along Rahu /Ketu axis. 

9. Comets 

Appearance of Comets and directions in which they appear should 
be considered. The countries represented by the signs in which 


comets appear normally suffer. Varahamihira of Brihat Samhita 
has written in details about it. 


498 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


It has been recorded in history that when large comets made their 
appearance great misfortunes have fallen in the shape of 
earthquakes, famines, and wars. 

In 1903 a comet was discovered in the sign Aquarius which 
represents war and in 1905 an important event in the form of Russo 
Japanese War took place in which the Japanese defeated the 
Russians .It was an event of most importent significance in which 
a European Nation was for the first time defeated by an Asian 
country. This was presage for rise of nationalism in the most of 
Asia and Far East. 


Prior to appearance of Haley Comet whose return occurred in 
1910, there were great changes in the world like earthquakes and 
famines followed by Chinese revolution of 1911. 


It is said that comets appearing in the east presage the birth of a 
New Prophet, in the west in cardinal signs they show trouble as 
they represent wars and invasions. The comets appearing in the 
signs representing particular countries show trouble in that part of 
the world. 


10. Earthquakes 


This is a fertile subject for study and research. Following principles 
should be noted: 


1. Result of eclipses in fixed signs in Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and 
Aquarius especially in Taurus and Scorpio. In this connection it is 
important that some planets like Saturn form an aspect to point of 
eclipse. 


2. These are also the result of conjunctions of planets if they take 
place in the fourth house of a nation. 


3. Jupiter in Taurus or Scorpio forming an evil aspect with Mercury. 


4. Earthquakes happen if there are many planets in the four cardinal 
Rasis, Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn. 


5. The timing of the new Moon is important.

This js the horoscope of Independent India useful for giving 
prediction about all type of national events. 

The day 15th August, 1947, chosen for Independence Day 
was most inauspicious. There was a combination of five planets 
with Sun and Saturn in Cancer or Karkha. Moon was weak and 
Rahu was in Taurus, a source of wars and bloodshed as has been 
discussed later in separate articles. 


500 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


In 1947, when the English rulers had decided to grant independence 
to India on 15th August Hardeo Sharma Trivedi, a famous Astrologer, 
and publisher of Shri Vishwa Vijay Panchang (almanac) in Hindi, 
and Surya Narain Vyas of Ujjain, told Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who 
was later became first President of India that it was not an 
auspicious day. When it became necessary to stick to 15 August, 
Hardeo Sharma Trivedi chose midnight for three reasons. 

1. Moon would have entered Pushya Nakshatra a ‚ÄòMahan‚Äô 
Nakshatra, most favoured for Muhurata. 

2. It should be midnight at Abhijit Muhurata calculated as follows 
Sunrise on August 15, 05 hrs. 33 min., 31 Seconds 

Sunset 18 hrs. 57 min., 31 Seconds 

Time for next sunrise counted from Sunset 10 hrs. 36 minutes Half 
of which is 5:18 Add to sunset time. This comes to midnight 12 hrs. 
15 minutes. 

24 minutes before or after 12:15 is Abhijit Muhurata. 

3. Lagna rising would be Taurus or (Vrishabha), a fixed sign, 
favoured for foundation of buildings etc. 

Sir Woodrow Wyatts has mentioned the names of these astrologers 
in an article on May 1988 in the Central page of the Times, London. 
"This is how the Indian astrologers saved the nation.‚Äù (Pakistan 
has already broken into two because of their not believing in Astrology 
and choosing movable or Char Lagna.)

2. In Republican Horoscope, Mars and Ketu at 16¬∞ each aspect

3. In the independence horoscope, !Othlord Saturn is conjunct with 
4 other planets and Moon weak. It is Sanyas Yoga in the house of 
preaching. Luckily Moon is in Pushya Nakshatra which is a saving 
grace. Fortunately there is also Gajkesari Yoga. 

In Republican Horoscope, 10th lord Jupiter, is debilitated in 11 th 
house with 6 and 8 lords. It explains why we had so many, 
amendments to the constitution some of which atrocious. We 
put restrictions on Hindus by Hindu Code bill but none on Muslims 
for marrying 2nd time. During Rajiv Gandhi time in 1985-86. Shah 
Banu judgement given by Supreme Court was nullified by 
amendment. 

5. While in the case of Independent India we have two Yoga Karka 
dashas of Saturn and Mercury Republican horoscope was the worst. 
It started with Ketu Dasha, followed by most unfortunate Venus 
and Sun lords of 8 and 6. 

6. Republican Horoscope has three retrograde planets.

The soli ‚Äî lunar new year commences from the time of Chaitra

In the Indian independence chart, Venus is the Lagna lord. It has 
been observed that whenever Venus is afflicted the whole nation 
suffers. For example at the time of death of Mahatma Gandhi 
Venus was aspected by Mars and was squared by Jupiter the 8th 
lord. Ketu had also 5th aspect on Venus. See the horoscope below.

Importance of Mundane Astrology 


In Uttarkhand Section of Padam Purana there is reference to 
the explanation given by Lord Shiva to Rishi Narada about role of 
Saturn, both in mundane as well as individual horoscopes Saturn 
had reached the end of Krittika Nakshatra (10 degrees in Taurus) 
about to enter Rohini. King Dashratha was warned that this would 
lead to terrible famine and also war. 

Dashratha reached Shani Yuga, he was greeted by Satum 
and is told that as a result of Saturn's nature all would be destroyed. 
Somehow Dashratha was saved. Saturn was happy with Dashratha 
as later had paid him respect and praised him to ask for a boon. 
Dashratha asked Saturn to save the world from the agony of wars 
and famine. Dashratha recited famous Neel Shani Stotra

Chapter IX 
Planetary Cabinet and King (Raja) of the year / Cloud etc. 

To predict events for the annual year it is necessary to 
make Planetary Cabinet for the particular year. 
King of the Year : 

There is some controversy regarding choosing king of the 

year. Various Indian Panchangs (ephemeris) use different 
systems. The most acceptable principle is that Lord of year should 
be the lord of the day on which Hindu New Year starts. (Hindu 
New Year starts on Chaitra Shukla Paksha Prati Pada as explained 
earlier). For the year 2003, the Hindu New Year started on April 1, 
at 24hrs 49 minutes (see page 22 of Lehri's Indian Ephemeris). 
This according to English calendar is 2" April, 2003 which is 
Wednesday. Raja or King for 2003 would be Mercury, lord of 
Wednesday. 
However, according to "Kalaprakasika", an ancient classical text 
the Raja or king of the year is the planet which is mling the day 
(day of the week) on which Sun enters the first point of Aries. 
For example for the year 2003 the Sun entered Aries on 14" April 
2003 at 11 hr 47 minutes. On 14" April it was Monday. The lord of 
Monday is Moon. Hence the Raja or King of the year would be 
Moon. But this method of choosing lord of the year does not find 
favour with other school of thought. The accepted principle is to 
make Mantri or Prime Minister lord of day on which Sun enters 
Aries. 


Mantri or Prime Minister: The Minister is decided on 

the basis of the planet which rules the day on which on Sun enters 
first point of Aries. In 2003, Sun entered Aries on April 14 at 11 hrs 
47 minutes which was Monday. Hence Prime Minister for 2003 
was Moon. 
Lord of Paddy Crops is decided on the basis of the planet 
which rules the day on which Sun enters firs point of Cancer. Sun 
entered Cancer on July 16 at 26 hrs 13 minutes. It was Wednesday 
(sunrise to next sunrise). Lord is Mercury.

Lord of Fruits and Vegetation is decided on the basis of the 
planet which rules the day on which Sun enters first point of Libra. 
In 2003 this was on 17 October 22 hrs 32 minutes which was 
Friday. The lord was Venus. 

Lord of Mineral kingdom is decided on the basis of the planet 
which rules the day on which Sun enters first point of Capricorn. 
Sun's entry in Capricorn was on 14 January 2003, at 17 hrs 25 
minutes which was Tuesday. Lord of the day was Mars. 

Lord of Clouds is decided on the basis of the planet which 
rales the day on which Sun enters first point of Ardra. Sun entered 
Sunday June 22 at 14 58. The lord is Sun. 

Lord of Corns is decided on the basis of the planet which 
rules the day on which Sun enters first point of Sagittarius. Sun 
entry into Sagittarius was on Tuesday 16 December 2003 at 12 hrs 
59 minutes. Lord is Mars. 

Lord of Fluids is decided on the basis of the planet which 
rules the day on which Sun enters first point of Gemini. 

The Sun entered Gemini on Sunday, 15 June at 15 hrs 19 minutes. 
The lord was Sun.

Mundane-Rasi Sanghatta Chakra 
- Nakshatra Sanghatta Chakra 


Taken from article by K.N. Rao "Prism of a Prediction‚Äù. 

Use of Chakras in Mundane Astrology 

In the Padma Purana there is the story of Lord Dashratha 
being warned by astrologers that Saturn's entry'in Rohini (Taurus 
10¬∞ to 13¬∞20') cause devastating war. 

India was involved in both world wars 1914-18 and 1939- 
45 when Saturn was in Rohini. And in 1971 there was war with 
Pakistan. 

It has been observed that when other malefics like Rahu 
Ketu transit in Rohini and are aspected by Mars, war or war like 
situation takes place. In the months of May and June 1984 
concentration of planets in Rohini aspected by Mars opened a 
chapter of blood stained history in Punjab. 

In the context of Punjab problem it may be seen that no war 
or war like situation can take place unless Saturn. Mars and Rahu 
meet and plan out scheme of destruction. 

An important Chakra prescribed by lord Shiva which 
a great Mahatma had recommended to K.N. Rao _ is 
Sanghatta Chakra of two types, one for the Rasi. Other for the 
Nakshatras. 

Many a times when Parasara aspect seem to be absent, 
Chakra aspects ignite. In the 30th May 1984, eclipse it would 
appear that Saturn and Rahu not mutually aspecting each other 
but now look at the Sanghatta chart.

For a war or war like situation to break out Mars and Saturn 
must join. If the aspects of Parasara exist even then they must be 
reexamined through Chakra aspect for precision. So the following 
may be seen. 


Mundane 515 


a) In October 1962, Saturn Ketu in Capricorn and Mars Rahu in 
Cancer fully aspected each other. On October 20 they were 
fully conjunct at 11 degrees. War with China broke out.

b) In 1965 August-September Rahu was in Taurus, Mars in 
Libra and Saturn in Aquarius. Apparently Mars and Saturn 
were not aspecting each other but on Sanghatta Chakra 
the aspect is full. War with Pakistan broke out.

Chapter XI 
Conjunction - Opposition of Planets 


(Based on Articles by K.N. Rao) 

In mundane astrology conjunction of heavy planets is 
extremely important. These indicate great events and changes and 
* are turning points in the history of nations. Whenever, Saturn, Jupiter, 
Mars, Rahu/Ketu, any two planets conjoin or come in opposition or 
are in Kendra from each other important events happen. 

I Saturn Jupiter is the most important conjunction which occurs 
every 20 years. The first conjunction falling in each triplicity is 
known as "Great Mutation" has a very important and lasting effect, 
and when the places of other conjunctions, eclipses, and lunation 
which occur after it fall thereon, or in opposition thereto, major 
events are triggered. 

Results of this Conjunction: 

1. Dr. B.V. Raman observes that U.S.A President elected under 
or about the time of this combination dies in office. Instances have 
been given of death of President Garfield, Abraham Lincoln, 
President Roosevelt and President Kennedy. 

2. In recent history on 8 August, 1940, the Saturn - Jupiter 
conjunction took place in Aries. Both the planets become retrograde 
and again became conjunct on 10 October 1940. The results were 
1. Intensification of Civil Disobedience movement in India which 
ultimately led to India's independence 

2. Attack on Russia by Hitler. 

3. Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. , 


Attack on Pearl Harbour, 7 November 1941 


Conjunction-Opposition of Planets 519 


Again this conjunction took place in 1961 which had far 
reaching implications. In India the Chinese started nibbling at Indian 
territory which ultimately led to the humiliating defeat of India in 
October 1962. 

In Unites States there was a great fiasco at ‚ÄòBay of Pigs‚Äô 
and there was great confrontation of USA with Russia over missile 
crisis in Cuba and both the countries came very much close to a 
nuclear war. 

There was birth of great Civil Rights movement for grant 

of equal rights to black Americans who lived there in pitiable 
conditions since the era of slavery . 
Rest of the world saw end of colonial era. New states won their 
freedom. The Americans suffered a humiliating defeat in Vietnam 
According to K.N, Rao it is necessary to remember that dramatic 
changes do not happen immediately after the conjunction or 
opposition of Saturn and Jupiter. It is only when Mars conjoins or 
aspects it, the process appears very dramatic, violent and is 
remembered as a historical landmark In 1989: September - 
November, Saturn and Jupiter opposed each other (Saturn in 
Sagittarius and Retrograde Jupiter in Gemini), accelerated the 
process of historical world changes. The collapse of Berlin wall 
and break up of the Soviet Union. In Russia it gave birth to 
Pereestroika and Glasnost, the reforms initiated by Secretary Mikhail 
Gorbachev

Sun, Saturn, Moon and Rahu were within 1 degree and there was 
exact conjunction of Saturn - Rahu on 21 January 1991 in 
Capricorn. The air attack of US forces on Iraq began. 


Gulf War 1991 


In India Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated on 21 May 1991. There 
was opposition of Jupiter, Mars with Saturn. 
II According to Kumaraswamiyam "If Saturn, Mars and Rahu 
conjoin or oppose each other, there will be heavy loss of human life 
all over the world.‚Äù The conjunction of Mars and Jupiter occurs 
every twenty seven months, conjunction of Mars and Saturn about 
every two years, conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn every twenty 
years etc. These conjunctions have serious repercussions in the 
signs in which these take place and their effects last for considerable 
time 
Ill-Saturn Rahu Conjunction, Opposition and Kendras 
position from each other: 
Rahu Saturn is an evil combination. This is the combination of two 
destructive energies and bring much misery in the world. Rahu is 
also a Muslim and a foreigner. Indian History is replete with the 
instances when this combination has brought misery to Hindus on 
an unprecedented scale. 

Mohammed Bin-Qasim invaded Sindh in AD 711-712, 
defeated King Dahar. "For three days the inhabitants of Debacle 
were ruthlessly slaughtered. The local temple was defiled and

atrocities were committed in the sacred city of Mathura. This city 
was studded with magnificent temples. The city had an aura of 
grandeur. Muslim historians had estimated the worth of temples 
hundreds and crores of rupees in those days. It is estimated that 
masons must have taken 200 years to complete them. Among the 
large number of idols in the temple, five were made of pure gold, 
the eyes of one of them were laid with two rubies worth one hundred 
thousand Dinars, and other had a sapphire of a very heavy weight. 
All these five idols yielded gold weighing 98,300 Miskals. The idols 
made of silver numbered 200. The city has been said to be raised 
to the ground and all temples set ablaze. The idols of gold and 
silver were looted. The choicest of women were raped and carried

be followed by Venus Saturn from 5.7.2002 to 3.9 2005. 
Interpretation of Mahadasha of Venus: Advent of TV. 
Telecommunication revolution in India as Venus as Lagna lord is 
making excellent Raj Yogas with Yoga Karkas Saturn as also with 
lord of 2" and five as also with lord of wealth and 5" house 
Mercury which has led to phenomenal progress of IT industry and 
India earning huge reserves of foreign exchange. In telecom sector 
India has become one of the most advanced countries in the world. 

There is also great progress in film industry with films like 
Lagaan and Devdas becoming big hits in the international arena. 
Today Bollywood is vying with Hollywood in glamour, name and 
fame. 

This Dasha has also seen Indian girls earning world beauty 
titles and great strides in producing jewellery and fashion designs. 

Since Venus is with Saturn there is departure from the 
traditional values. There will be much exposure of sex and fashion 
shows. Indian women will break away from traditional shackles 
and take important roles in music, dance drama, TV, films and 
beauty contests. 

The Dasha of Venus as Lagna lord would have made India 
one of the most progressive states but for the fact that Venus is 
combust. Its closeness to Saturn has also given diseases like Aids 
and addiction to drugs etc. 

Venus is also the 6* lord of war and diseases and since 
there is concentration of planet in the third house of neighbours the 
border wars has become a permanent feature of India. There will 
be onslaught of diseases. As it is spread of AIDS is taking alarming 
proportion. 

Venus is also with Saturn the planet of masses and 
depressed classes or Dalits who will influence the political set up 
in the country. Saturn is also Yoga Karka being lord of 9" and 10". 
Hence the caste considerations will have upper hand in the polity 
of the nation. Being Yoga Karka Saturn would also mean that the 
masses especially the Dalits, OBCs and the Schedule castes, 


Predicting Events on Yearly Basis 529 


schedule tribes would have a major say in formation of governments. 
The aristocracy and upper castes would be relegated to a secondary 
position. 

The Antardasha lord is Jupiter, lord of 8" and 11" for this 
Lagna and hence malefic. It is in the enemy Rasi also, that makes 
it unprincipled and braggadocio. In the sign of Venus in the 6" it 
becomes fond of sex and high life without much moral values. 
However, there will be great interest in music and art. Though the 
music and dance would not be of traditional values but more of 
Bhangra and Rap type. It is also aspecting the 9" and 12th lord 
Mars and is making Vipreet Raj Yoga by being 8" lord in the 6‚Äù. 
While there be gains in foreign related enterprises not much progress 
would be made in creating communal harmony. 

Jupiter is placed in Uppachaya house where this is 
aspecting tenth, twelfth and 2" house of wealth. As Uppachaya 
house this would give increasingly good results, since this is house 
of growth. As Karka for wealth it is aspecting tenth house as also 
the second house which is good for the finances of the country. 
However, for lord of eleven to be in the 6" is not good for financial 
gains.

Navamsa 


The 12‚Ñ¢ April was Friday. Technically, Saturday starts at midnight 
at 00.00 Hrs when date changes but According to Hindu calendar 
day is from sunrise to sunrise. Therefore, lord of the year would be 
Venus of Friday and not Saturn of Saturday as some Panchangs 
state. 


The results of different planets becoming lord of a particular year 
have been given in a separate chapter. In this particular case Venus 
is the Raja. Venus has got the evil lordship of six and 11 in this 
horoscope. It is also in ‚ÄòPap Kartari‚Äô Yoga and one of its signs 
Taums has three malefics Mars Saturn and Rahu. It is/however, in 
the auspicious fifth house aspecting its own house of gains and it is 
also with the 10 lord meaning the Prime Minister of the country 
inspite of the criticism would remain popular and country would be 
well off financially inspite of setbacks. 

The results of Venus as lord of the year is given by Varahamihira 
as follows: "During the year presided over by Venus there will be 
happiness and prosperity all round". There will be food and water, 
wining and dining and merry making. There will be victory to the 
kings, and the enemies will be humbled. (It will be a Feel Good 
year!) 


The First House 
Lagna is aspected by its own lord which gives the nation 
health and vitality. It is aspected by Jupiter, which is a 
planet for expansion and optimism. Since it is aspecting 
from the 7" house the relations with a prosperous country 


Predicting Events on Yearly Basis 531 


(USA) would be good who will understand India's point of 
view. Lagna is also aspected by afflicted Mars from the 
6" house, house of war (Enemy will create troubles but 
nation has the strength to face the enemy and come out 
victorious.) 


Second House 
Lord of the second house is Saturn. It is in the 6" house 
with Mars and Rahu. The position of lord of wealth is not 
good in the 6 house. Here it is with Mars meaning 
expenditure on armaments. Since this is also with Rahu, 
great deal of money will be spent on defense in a war like 
condition. 


Third House 
Third lord in the 6" means border clashes. Third lord Mars 
is with Saturn and Rahu which shows heightened crisis at 
the border and likelihood of war. 
Since third lord is Mars it may cause accidents in railways, 
fire and agitation. 
It is also a Vipreet Raj Yoga which means great strides in 
telecommunication, satellites launching, radio and television. 
(Rahu is radio). Steel and defense production (Mars). 


Fourth House 

Sun is the 9" lord with 8" lord Moon in the fourth house. 
Ram Janam Bhoomi controversy will revive. There will be 
criticism of the government though because of presence 
of Sun and its dispositor Jupiter in the 7 (Pad Prapati) 
government will remain fully entrenched inspite of criticism. 
There will be new finds in underground mines and minerals. 
The problem relating to religious matters like Ram Janam 
Bhoomi may be initiated in secrecy or since the 8‚Äù lord is 
involved there are chances of its breakdown. 


Fifth House 
Fifth house relates to children, birth rate, education, 
all forms of national pleasures and entertainment, 
theatre, cinema sports, public park, speculation and stock 


532 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


exchange. Morals, immorality, scandals, crimes relating to 
immorality. High society and functions. Upper house of 
Parliament, Rajya Sabha, House of lords schools, 
educational places Ambassadors and diplomats from foreign 
countries Danger to ruler as it is 8" from 10". 

There is interchange between 5" and 6" lords. This is also 
interchange of Mars and Venus. Entertainment take form 
of vulgarity, nudity and sex exploitation which is depicted 
in film and literature, magazines etc. 

There are two benefics in the fifth house. Mercury as lord 
of tenth and 7" in fifth is creating a Raj Yoga while there is 
interchange between 5‚Ñ¢ and sixth house where Rahu is 
located. Rahu is also exalted. While entertainment industry 
will flourish and there might be big gains from IT industry 
(because of Rahu), since 5* lord is in the sixth also and is 
with malefics the gains may not be as great as anticipated. 
Since this house is also 8" from tenth it shows longevity of 
government. Since there are two benefic planets in this 
house, government will continue to remain in office but 
because of interchange with the 6" there will remain 
bickering among the cabinet members and not so savory 
incidents may take place. 


Fifth in the sixth may also mean illness amongst children 
and problems in the educational field. 

Since fifth also deals with stock exchanges, two benefics 
here may show stability but interchange with the 6" is not 
good for the healthy grow of stock exchange. 


Sixth House : 

Sixth House represents armed forces, territorial attacks - 
war also. Labour classes, labour unions strikes, State loans 
and debts. Medical and other services and diseases in 
general. 

The presence of three malefics will create war like frenzy. 
India and Pakistan had both mobilized their troops in May 
-June and were poised for a war. The Prime Minister Shri 
Vajpayee had even asked Jawans to be prepared for the 
final war. Since there was an interchange with the 5" house 


Predicting Events on Yearly Basis 533 


there was a last minute withdrawal from the brink because 
of heavy pressure from USA. There were chances that 
war may go nuclear as President of Pakistan Musharaff 
had openly claimed, involving untold misery on the 
subcontinent. 

Finances and Debt: 2" lord Saturn in 6th is not good for 
finances but it is also with 5 and 12‚Äù lord which may 
infuse foreign funds from abroad. 

Three malefics in the 6" house will assure victory in case 
of war and combination of 5" lord in 6" and 3‚Ñ¢ lord Saturn 
also in the sixth causing Vipreet Raj Yoga will ensure 
expenditure on modernization of armed forces with the 
help of foreigners (role of Rahu and Mars as lord of 
twelve.) The sixth lord relating to armed forces is well 
placed in the fifth with benefic Mercury. It may show 
acquisition of sophisticated arms by the armed forces 
especially its air and naval wings. 

Sixth lord Venus is with 10" lord Mercury in the 5" house. 
Venus represents women, and Mercury denotes youth. 
There will be increasing role of women in government, 
educational and literary fields as also in sports. This year 
is also the year of women. 


Seventh House 

The placement of Jupiter, Lagna lord in the 7‚Äù is very good 
especially when lord of seven Mercury is in the fifth with a 
benefic planet. Since Jupiter represents capitalism the 
relations with foreign countries especially America will 
improve. Treaties and agreements will be signed and the 
prestige of country will rise high. Women will be happy 
and will be honoured. Since Jupiter is significator for religion 
and spiritualism its aspect on Lagna will make people more 
spiritual and undertake pilgrimages to holy places. 


534 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Fighth House 
There is no planet in the eighth house which is good. The 
house is, however, aspected by Saturn. Saturn is lord of 
two and three and may cause some accidents of 
rail or air. There may be heavy loss of revenue and wastage 
of public money. 
The health of the cabinet or important personalities 
would be good on the whole excepting some ailments 
suffered by head of the sate, government or important 
person. 
The lord of eight Moon is in the fourth. Its role has been 
discussed in the fourth house. The opposition will be in 
disarray. 


Ninth House 
The 9" lord Sun is in the fourth house of education which is 
good for the progress in education and field of research. It is 
with the 8" lord Moon. Moon represents chemicals, liquids, so 
there may be advancement in chemical and medical fields. 
(Sun is doctor). 


Tenth House 
There is no planet in the 10" house. It is aspected by Sun, 
lord of five which is good for the overall smooth running of 
cabinet. However, it is with 8" lord Moon that may bring 
some unexpected problems for the Cabinet. The 10‚Äù lord 
is Mercury, which is a benefic which is good for cabinet. 


Eleventh House 

The 11" lord Venus is in the fifth with Mercury planet of 
communication and trade. It is aspecting its own house 
which augurs well for gains from trade, communication 
and ¬•/T industry. Many agreements may also be signed 
with foreign countries. International relations will improve 
and nation may have a good name in the comity of 
nations. 


Predicting Events on Yearly Basis 535 


Twelfth House 

The twelfth house has Ketu aspected by Saturn and Mars. 
Foreign spies will be active. Many conspiracies will be 
hatched against the state. There will be much expenditure 
and great amount of money will be squandered and 
misappropriated. Organized crime will flourish. 

The twelfth lord Mars is in the sixth badly mauled aspecting 
its own house which while giving strength to the house 
would cause many financial scandals. 


Chapter XIII 
Earthquakes 


In recorded history more than 15 million people have died in 
earthquakes or because of earthquake after-effects such as 
landslides, fires and tidal waves. In its most devastating form, an 
earthquake can wipe out an entire community in minutes. A list of 
major earthquakes of the world is given in the appendix. 

Earthquakes result from the stain caused by movement of 
the places that make up the Earth's outer shell and are directly 
associated with the activity that occur at ocean ridges, trenches 
and. faults. If the Earth's crust cannot accommodate itself to the 
strain it breaks up, releasing tremendous amount of energy in the 
form of sudden violent shocks. 

The most intense earthquake activity is round the margin of 
the Pacific in the Circum ‚ÄîPacific belt. About 75% of all shallow 
earthquakes, 90% of intermediate earthquakes and almost all deep 
earthquakes take place in this belt. It snakes its way up the west 
coast of South American, loops through the Caribbean and backs 
up at the west coast of North America to Alaska and across to 
Asia., Indonesia, New Zealand and the Antarctic. 

Another belt spreads across the Alps and North Africa., along 
the northern shores of the Mediterranean, eastwards through Iran 
and the HIMALAYAS, then through Southern China to join the 
Circum - Pacific belt. 

From the amplitude, or size, of the recorded waves, 
seismologists can determine the magnitude of the earthquakes. 
EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE is a measure of the seismic energy 
released at the focus, graded according to Richter Scale named 
after Charles F, Richter, a Californian seismologist, who devised it. 
The Richter scale of magnitude is logarithmic; this means a shock 
of magnitude 8 emits waves with an amplitude ten times greater 
than that of waves emitted by magnitude 7 shock, 100 times greater 
than that of waves emitted by a magnitude 6 and so on. 

The very largest earthquakes ever recorded have magnitude 
of about 8.9 on the Richter scale, but fortunately they are very 
uncommon. An earthquake with a magnitude greater than 8.5 occurs 


Earthquakes 537 


somewhere in the world once every five to 10 year, By contrast, 
more than 300,000 shocks with magnitude in the range of 2.2-2.9 
occur every year. 

The reasons for the earthquake to happen are being studied 
by scientists all over the world. The latest study conducted by United 
States Geological Survey have predicted that there will be major 
earthquake in San Francisco by 2030 which would cause devastation 
on an unprecedented scale involving loss of billions of dollars. 
K.N. Rao Journal of Astrology January March 2002 

While there are various reasons for this strain to occur and 
scientists all over the world will keep on arguing the subject has 
been dealt with in details by Hindu Maharishis and astrologers. It 
has been established that there are astrological factors which are 
responsible for aggravating the situation. In India there was a major 
earthquake at Bhuj Gujarat of more than 8 Richter scale on 26 
January 2001. In which more than 30,000 persons died. This 
earthquake was predicted by K.N. Rao in the magazine Week of 
14 January 2001. 

It was Garga Maharishi who gave us predictive techniques 
for forecasting earthquakes Russians have now established that 
eclipses and new and full Moon have a great role in causing seismic 
activity. 

A research team has been formed in Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan 
under the guidance of K.N. Rao to study major causes of the 
earthquakes. The first result has been published in an article which 
appeared in April-June 2001 in Journal Of Astrology. This research 
team has studied 170 of the severe earthquakes and have found 
that 
i) 55.8 per cent of the earthquakes have occurred during the 

period covering the 5 Tithis i.e. 2 Tithis immediately preceding 

new Moon or full Moon including day of the new Moon and 
full Moon and two Tithis just following the new Moon or full 

Moon including day of the new Moon and full Moon. 

ii) 33.5 per cent of earthquakes have occurred during 14th to 

{st Tithi including intervening new Moon/full Moon. 
iit) 17 per cent of the earthquake have occurred during new 

Moon/full Moon.

Other Factors responsible for Earthquakes: 
Role of Eclipses: 


1. 


Earthquakes normally follow close on the heels of eclipses 
and especially in the countries where eclipses occur in the 
10th or the fourth houses. 

According to western astrologers if there are any planet in 
fixed signs at the moment of eclipse, then earthquake will 
occur in those parts of the world where such planets are 
either rising, setting or culminating or on the Nadir. Thus, if at 
an eclipse the planet Saturn should be 30 degrees from the 
meridian, then earthquake will occur in that part of the world 
which is the same distance from Greenwich, east or west 
according to position of Saturn. 

At the time of earthquake there will be many malefic aspects 
or conjunction of malefic planets. These malefic planets will 
form an aspect with previous eclipses. An eclipse may be 
forerunner of earthquake, but earthquakes will not happen 
unless there are many aspects with the eclipse. 

Signs Taurus and Scorpio are notorious for earthquakes 
especially when Saturn, Rahu, Mars and Jupiter are in the 
signs. Taurus especially has the Rohini Nakshatra the 
implication of which has been explained separately. ‚Äù 
Jupiter in Taurus or Scorpio and having aspect, Conjunction 
of Mercury causes frequent earthquakes. 

The position of planets at each ingress of Sun into Aries, 
Cancer, Libra and Capricorn and at the time of New Moon 
should be observed. Note the countries in whose 4th house 
the malefic planets are placed or have aspect should be noted. 
There might be some seismic disturbance. 

Concentration of planets at the beginning of movable signs 
(within 1 degree) Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn. 

The countries and localities in which earthquakes will happen 
can be ascertained as follows. First with reference to the 
sign ruling different countries and cities especially with 
reference to four quarterly ingresses of Sun and noting the 
longitude in which eclipses occur. 


Earthquakes 539 


The timings of occurrences of earthquakes have been noticed 
between midday and sunset or between midnight and sunrise. 
A major planet, Saturn, Jupiter or Mars have been found to 
be retrograde at the time of earthquakes. 

Major planets in Kendras or Trikonas from each other 
contribute to occurrence of earthquake. 

Placement of Moon and Mercury in the same Nakshatra. 
There is importance attached to airy and earthy signs on day 
of earthquake. 

In some cases earth has been found to be nearest to Sun at 
the time of earthquake. 

The 1 st, 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th or 12th houses have been found to 
be afflicted at the time of earthquakes. 

The western astrologers put great emphasis on the role of 
extra terrestrial planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto in causing 
earthquakes. Even a foreign scientist was constrained to point 
out that in majority of the cases when earthquakes happened 
the planet Uranus was almost directly overhead the place of 
origin. The placement of Uranus in signs Taums and Scorpio 
has sinister meanings. If Neptune has gravitational effect on 
Uranus then both Neptune and Uranus would have combined 
effect of gravitational pull on the earth. However, this needs 
detailed study and research and its results would be published 
in our future researches.

1. There is conjunction of Saturn with Saturn and Rahu with 
opposition of Jupiter. 

2. Mars is afflicting Moon who is in 8th from traditional Lagna 
Capricorn of Afghanistan and Pakistan. 

3. There was an annular solar eclipse on 15 and 16th January. 
This position of eclipse is aspected by Jupiter and is conjunct with 
Saturn. 

Locating Places of Earthquake: 

While it is easy to locate the timings of the earthquake which 
is found out by conjunction, opposition of major planets, eclipses 
the location of the place where earthquake might occur is quite 
time consuming process. In which some help could be got by 
remembering the signs ruled by various countries. The fourth /8th 
houses from mling sign as also Lagna would be afflicted. The 
position of the new Moon ,full Moon and the signs in which eclipses 
happen provide further clue. The horoscopes for eclipses and ingress 
of Sub in all the four cardinal signs should be noted. 

2. The chart for entry of Sun in Aries is very important. For 
the earthquake to happen 8th and fourth houses assume importance. 
They should be severely afflicted. It should be remembered 8th 
house shows mass tragedies. 

The eclipse in a particular year should be under malefic aspect 
for the earthquake to happen. 

Interconnection between Mercury and Saturn, and Mercury 
behind the Sun should be noted. 

The affliction to Mercury by Saturn or Mars and their aspect 
on Lagna and 8th house should be taken note of. 

If the Nakshatras of Moon, Rohini, Hasta and Sravan are 
occupied by lord of or a malefic planet, it may cause earthquake. 

The planets Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu or Ketu and Mars arr 
normally found in at least one earthy sign at time of earthquake. 
Alternatively Mercury or 8th lord are afflicted. 

The position of above planets in airy signs is equally important 
with Mars in earthy sign. 

The eclipses should be carefully noted The planets affected 
by it give a clue to happening of earthquake. 


Earthquakes 5A5 


The time when a planet becomes retrograde or when it 
becomes direct has its implication in timing major events of history. 

In the light of above let us study some of the devastating 
earthquakes. 
Earthquake of Gujarat 26.1. 2001, 8: 46 AM 

This was one of the most potent earthquakes which caused 
destruction on a very large scale and shook the foundation of Indian 
economy. It occurred in Bhuj, 65 miles northeast of Jamnagar. This 
earthquake was so powerful that its effect Was felt throughout 
Northwest India and much of Pakistan. Its reverberations were 
heard as far as Nepal and Bangladesh. This place was also earlier 
devastated by an earthquake on June 16, 1819.. In this tragedy 
more than 18, 602 people lost their life and 166,836 people were 
injured. Six hundred people became homeless, and 3,32,0000 houses 
were destroyed. The total loss was estimated to be equivalent to 
13 billion dollar. 
Gujarat Earthquake: 26.1.2001 8.46 AM 


Combinations for Earthquake:

Principles of Astro - Meteorology 
Based on the book ‚ÄúApplied Astrology, Individual Monsoon 
Forecasting and New Researches‚Äù by K.N. Rao. 

When Sun reaches and crosses 6¬∞ 40 ‚Äô in the sign Gemini 
(Mithun) in Ardra Nakshatra (around June 22) the Monsoon arrives 
in North India and when Sun reaches 10¬∞ in Virgo (Kanya) on 
September 26, it begins to withdraw. The Moon in certain Nakshatras 
joining with other planets or when aspected by them can cause or 
hinder rain. Following principles for rain may be observed: 
Principle Nol: Though there are actually twenty-seven Nakshatras 
(Constellations), for the purpose of Astro Meteorology forecast, 
28 Nakshatras are made use of. 

Twenty-eighth Nakshatra is Abhijit and it is allotted a space towards 
the end of Uttarashada (no. 21). These 28 Nakshatras are spread 
out in seven Nadis.

It is well known that the entry of Sun in various Rasis and 
Nakshatras regulate the season. Venus and Mercury are always 
very close to Sun. 
Signification of seven Nadis: 
1. Parchand: Ruled by Saturn means extreme heat of the 

summer. 


548 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


Pawan: Ruled by Sun means strong hot winds of summer. 

Dahan: Ruled by Mars depicts fierce heat. 

Saumaya: Ruled by Jupiter strikes a balance between intense 

heat and soon to come cool early Monsoon showers. It is also 

called Madhya Nadi. 

5. Neer: ruled by Venus, a watery planet represents first showers 
of Monsoon. Neer means water. 

6. Jal: Ruled by Mercury. Also means water - plenty of rain of 
Monsoon. 

7. Amrita: Ruled by Moon a watery planet signifies rains in 
abundance. Torrential down pour. 

Neera, Jal and Amrit are also called Uttari or Sajala Rasis. 

Three Fold Classification: 

The sapt Nadi is divided into three categories: 

Yamtya: first three Nadis Prachand, Pawan and Dahan are known 

as Yamya Nadis. They are also called Dakshin Nadis. 

Soumaya: next three Soumaya, Neera and Jal mean drop in 

temperature. . 

Sheetal: last one Amrit means cool. 

Principle No 2 

When many planets are in one Rasi, especially in one Nakshatra 

with Mars and Sun joining them and Mars is with Rahu, there can 

be a terrible downpour even if it is not the regular Monsoon season. 

See the following instances : 

i) 15.4.1983 - Heavy Rain 


KRWN 


it) Again in August 1987 there was a heavy downpour all over 
northern India 


Meterology 549 


cy 26.8.1987 


In all these instances there were concentration of planets in one 
Rasi and on the day Moon joined them there was heavy rain. 


Examples: 

a) On January 8, 1989 when Moon joined Sun, Saturn and Venus 
in Dhanu there was terrible downpour of winter rain all over 
northern India including Delhi. To cause such extraordinary 
fluctuations at least two out of the five malefics Saturn Mars, 
and Sun Rahu and Ketu must conjoin or form an aspect with 
two water-producing planets like Moon and Venus. 

b) On 15 April 1983, Sun, Moon Mercury and Mars had received 
the aspect of Saturn from Tula, a terrible downpour had taken 
place all over northern India. In 1987 when every body was 
talking of drought Rao had predicted in a letter to news paper 
Statesman that the spell of drought would be broken. 

It will be thus clear that when there is concentration of planets in 

one Rasi, the weather begins to fluctuate and when Moon joins 

them this fluctuation becomes clear. 

Principle No 3 
Whatever may be the season, there must be a weather 

fluctuation when Moon joins Venus or when Moon is fifth or ninth 

from Venus. In the rainy season, it causes good rain unless there 
are factors preventing rains. 

Principal No 4 

When Mars transits from one Rasi to another then within 
two days, there is perceptible change in weather and in the rainy 


550 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


season there must be a good rainfall. Mars is the most powerful 
planet causing rainfall. For example note the following dates in the 
year 2002. 
Mars changed Rasis on: 10th January it entered Pisces, On 21‚Ñ¢ 
February it was in Mesha, and on April 5 it entered Taurus. On 
May 19 it was in Gemini, on July 4, it entered Karka and on August 
20 it was in Simha. 
Fluctuations in weather including rainfall in rainy season were noticed 
on these days. 
In mundane astrology such transits of Mars are also associated 
with major tragedies and fire accidents depending on planetary 
combinations. 
Principal No 5 
Similarly when a major planet changes a Rasi, it causes momentous 
events. In the case of weather it must cause a very noticeable 
change. 
In year 2002 it was noticed that on February 28, 2002 Rahu entered 
Taums Rasi. There were heavy storms and communal riots in 
Gujarat and other parts of India. 

On July 5 Jupiter entered Cancer there was severe heat and 
talk of war with Pakistan. 

The change of Rasis by Mercury and other heavy planets 
usually presages onslaught of storms, rains, lightening, heat, thunder 
and cause political disturbances as well. 

Principal No 6: When planets retrograde and on the day these 
become direct there is change in temperature, humidity and what 
the meteorologists say as "disturbances". 

But among all the planets Mercury must be singled out for 
spectacular and physically experienced weather fluctuations. 
Venus: Among all the planets it is Venus whose retrogression or 
direct motion does not singly affect weather condition unless other 
planets help accompanies it. 

Venus (Special) 

In Astro meteorological literature Venus always has a special 
meaning and it has to be studied in depth for even market 
fluctuations. Venus is Devata, Manushya and Rakshasha meaning

Some other Principles

> 


There will be rain if strong Moon is in a Rasi whose lord is 
aspecting it. 

More benefics in Dakshina Nadi will cause rain. 

If there are more malefics in Uttara Nadi there will be no 
rain. 

If Mercury and Venus, Mercury and Jupiter and Venus and 
Jupiter are together in a Rasi there is cloud formation. In 
favourable Rasi and favourable aspects there will be rain. 
Malefic aspects cause strong wind and less rain. 

Venus behind slow moving planet causes wind. Many planets 
in Pawan Nadi cause destructive wind. 


Factors Preventing Rain 
There are about 31 principles preventing rains in India. Only three 
are more important and are mentioned here. 


) 


ii) 


itt) 


When Sun is in between Venus and Mercury there is a 
break in the sense that for some days there is dry spell. 
When it started happening in late August and early 
September in 1988, the Indian Meteorological Department 
rushed to the conclusion that the monsoon season was over. 
On this basis instmctions were issued to all concerned 
departments including authorities controlling dams, to store 
water at a particular level. This was a mistake as this was 
followed by terrible rain which endangered Bhakra Nangal 
dam and the authorities had to release surplus water which 
created disaster in Punjab and neighbouring territories. The 
Punjab terrorists found a cause to shoot down Major 
General Kumar Director of Bhakra Dam Authority. 

Had the Meteorological department been aware of this 
phenomenon of Sun between Mercury and Venus causing 
temporary break in rain they would have avoided this 
disaster. 


If Jupiter and Mars are within 30 degrees of each other it 
prevents rains. 

But the worst combination is when Mars is ahead of Sun 
in the rainy season. This was so in the year 2002 and hence 


552 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


rains were delayed. This has been explained in Ardra 
Parvesh Chakra for year 2002. 

Forecast of Rains 

1. The method followed is to add 195 days to a certain day 
astrologically arrived at in the month of November- December. 
This gives first day of the monsoon showers. It comes correct 
within an error of margin of 48 hours. 

2. Four astrological charts are prepared to examine how planets 
would affect winds, humidity, moisture, and cloud formation 
and cause rain. 

3. Local observations are carried out in May- June of winds and 
clouds or local and regional rain. 

Animal Behaviour: 

Short range forecasts 

a) In the rainy season if the sky is overcast and your pet dog 
refuses to go outdoors it is sign of coming rain. 

b) If the kites are flying at the height of about 400 feet, it is 
indication of rain or storm. 

c) If spider has started weaving web outdoors, it indicates 
departure of rain. 

d) The croaking of frogs is indication of rain. 

e) The exultant cries of peacock are an indication of cloud 
formation. 

Areas of Research: 

1. There is need to study Garbha Dharan (impregnation of 

clouds) towards the fag end of Dakshinayan (17 July to 30 

January as the particular day when the Moon enters a particular 

constellation (or Nakshatra). This should be done to predict 

rain during the Indian monsoon. 

Similarly for winter rains, the Garbha Dharan is to be observed 

in the Uttarayana period (14 January to 16 July). 

3. Next stage in astrological research is the Shukla Pratipada 
of Chaitra, which is between March 13, and April 14 every 
year. 

4. Then there is Rohini Yoga in the month of Ashaarh. During 
this month Vayuparikshan has to be done daily and the flow 
of winds dutifully recorded. 

5. The last stage is to cast the horoscope of Ardra Parvesh to 
make final prediction about rainfall and the points of 


te 


Meterology 553 


obstmction in Ardraparvesh are to be borne in mind. In the 
year 1987 in the Ardra Parvesh horoscope the Moon is in the 
Nirjala (waterless Rasi). The forecasts on the basis of planetary 
configuration were 


i) All Kendras or quadrants were occupied by malefics, rains 
will not be timely 
ii) Mars aspected by malefics will create dry spells. 


itl) Sun being behind Mars till August 24, (Bhadrapad Krishna 
Amavasya) is not indicative of good rain but shows drought. 

"Aage Mangal Peeche Bhand Varsha hoi aus Sman.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSravan me aage chala Ravirath se Kujray, Bhadhay Krishna 

Pankhlo varsha Swalpa Dikhay.' The reference is to scanty rains 

caused by Mars being ahead of Sun till 24 August. 

To predict about date of rains following principles should be followed. 

1. After the Sun has entered Mrigsira Nakshatra towards the 
end of May, the southwest monsoon begins to strike Kerala 
coast. When Sun enters Ardra (22-23, June) every year 
Monsoon advances towards northern India. 

2. When the Sun enters Kanya Rasi middle of September the 
Monsoon prepares to withdraw from Northern India. 

3. When the Sun enters Hasta Nakshatra, it causes rain in Bihar 
which a Bihari calls Hathiya rain. But by that time monsoon 
withdraws from rest of Northern India. 

4. When the Sun enters Chitra, it causes some occasional rain, 
otherwise southwest Monsoon withdraws totally. In Indian 
tradition this is reference to the bird Chatak that supposedly 
waits for the raindrop of Swati. 

5. Conjunction of Sun with Saturn causes cold wave in upper 
India. 

Role of Sunspots on weather: 
The latest researches in science have established the relation of 
extreme hot weather and role of sunspots. It has now been proved 
that sunspots have direct connection with extreme heat. (Sunspots 
are dark spots, some as large as 50,000 miles in diameter, which 
move across the surface of the sun, contracting and expanding as 
they go). 


554 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


It was reported in the newspaper Hindustan Times on 13 April 
2003 that extreme and erratic weather is due to the connection of 
the sun and the earth that has so far not been studied. This factor 
has greater impact on the climate than greenhouse gases. In major 
researches undertaken between March 18 and 23 a deep connection 
was noticed between the sunspots and the earth which established 
beyond doubt role of sunspots in causing extreme heat. A British 
scientist E W Maunders who has established connection between 
sunspots and erratic weather conducted earlier researches on this. 
New science of Helios- seismology is taking important steps to 
prove planetary influence on weather. 

Timing of Rain 

This is a topic, which needs thorough knowledge and study of 
various aspects of rain. In Brihat Samhita there is a chapter to 
work out timing of rain. It is stated that in the month of Aggarhayan 
of Shukl Paksh Padi Pada from the date Moon enter Poorva Asahi 
Nakshatra that day should be treated pregnancy of clouds. 
Prospects of Rain 

Study the atmospheric conditions on three days in the lunar 
month of Ashada (June- July) when the Moon transits through 
Rohini, Swati and Uttarshadha Nakshatras. These are respectively 
called Rohini Yoga, Swati Yoga and Ashadi Yoga days. 

If on these days sky is covered with huge clouds, serpent 
like white in certain parts and black in others, or the sky is covered 
with red clouds and marked by lightning immediately before sunrise 
and after sunse., this is sure sign of heavy rains during monsoon. 
Swati and Ashadi Yogas 
On the Swati Yoga day rainfall throughout day and night shows 
uninterrupted rain for several days in winter. 

Wind from east or northeast indicates good rain and good crops 
while wind from other directions presages little rainfall in future. 

Continuous hot wind from southeast or high wind from 
southwest at sunset may bring terrible famine. 

Rohini Yoga 

When the Moon passes through Nakshatra of Rohini in 
the dark half of lunar month Ashada, Rohini Yoga is caused. 

If on the Rohini Yoga day sky is clear and sun hot, there will be rain 
the rainy season. Much misery and no rain are caused if unusual 


Meterology 555 


phenomena like meteoric falls, thunderbolts, mock fires etc. occur 
on Rohini Yoga day. 
Delivery of Clouds; Delivery or birth takes place 195 days after 
when the Moon will be in the same Nakshatra seven sidereal months. 
Clouds that conceive in the bright and dark halves of the month 
(Mrigsira -November - December) and in the bright half of Pausa 
(December -January) will be delivered of rain the in the dark half 
of Jyeshta (May June) or vie versa. On both these days rain will be 
moderate. 
Ardra Parvesh Chakra 

The rainy season in northern India starts with the entry of Sun in 
Ardra Nakshatra. The horoscope drawn at the time of entry of 
Sun in Ardra gives clear indication about the direction and strength 
of the monsoon. The time when Sun enters Ardra Nakshatra is 
given in ephemeris and Panchangs. The horoscope is drawn with 
Delhi as place of birth or entry of Sun in this Nakshatra. However, 
some astrologers are of the opinion that the place of entry taken 
should be Varanasi. 

This Monsoon season lasts till the entry of Sun in Swati 
Nakshatra. From Ardra to Swati Nakshatra is the rainy season. It 
is only some times that it rains when Sun is in Swati Nakshatra. 
The rain of this Nakshatra is very useful for Rabi crops of wheat, 
gram, Sarson etc. 

To interpret the chart it is necessary to understand the role of Rasis 
and planets. 

Rasis 

Twelve Rasis have been divided into following categories: 
1. Fiery - Aries, Leo and Sagittarius. 

2. Earthy - Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. 

3. Airy - Gemini, Libra, Aquarius 

4. Watery - Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. 

How much water is there in each Rasi is given below: 
Fiery Rasis: Aries 25%, Leo 0%, and Sagittarius 50%. 
Earthy Rasis: Taums 50%, Virgo 0%, and Capricorn full. 
Airy Rasis: Gemini Nil, Libra 25%, Aquarius 50%. 
Watery Rasis: Cancer full, Scorpio 25%, and Pisces full. 


556 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


While giving predictions it should be borne in mind the percentage 
of water each Rasi has and direction in which it is located. 

The planets Moon, Venus, Mercury and Jupiter gives plenty of 
rain, while malefic planets Sun, Mars and Saturn are dry, preventing 
rain. 

Role of Sun and Mars: They become intense dry when only they 
are together. 

Also if Sun is behind Mars there is no rain. 

Ghagh, a poet has said ‚ÄúMangal Rath Age Chale- Peeche chale 
jo Sur - Mand Varishti tab janiye padsi sagle shoor". (With 
Mars ahead of Sun there is no rain) 

Sun and Saturn: If in any year Sun and Saturn are together 
in a Rasi in summer there will be extreme heat and if they are 
together in wintry season it will be extreme cold in that year. 

Saturn is Karka for wind and dryness. This will bring strong 
wind, storms etc. This even drives away clouds of rain if it is in airy 
Nadi. If Saturn is in watery Nadi then it causes storms and rain 
especially when it is with watery planets or is aspected by watery 
planets. So the prediction about rain is to be given by combining 
Rasi effects with those of planets. This is how horoscope of Ardra 
Parvesh is judged. 

Directions in the Horoscope: Eight directions are shown in the 
horoscope. 

Lagna is always east, tenth house south, seventh house is west and 
fourth house is north. In between are the four more sub directions. 
Northeast, northwest etc. 

1. East: The places in the east are Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand, 
Mizoram, eastern Madhya Pradesh 1st House. 

2. Northeast: 2" and Third House: Bhutan, Assam, Meghalaya 
Amnachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Sikkim. 

3. North - 4th House - Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, 
U.P. Nepal, part of Jammu and Kashmir, Tibet, Uttar Anchal. 

4. Northwest: 5" and 6" house: Baluchistan, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, 
Afghanistan. 

5. West: 7" house - Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and western 
part of Madhya Pradesh. Sindh, West Punjab, Multan Doman Diu. 
6. Southwest: 8" and 9" house: Kerala Karnataka, Maharashtra, 
West Coast, Goa. 


Meterology 557 


7. South: 10 House: Tamil Nadu, part of Andhra Pradesh, 
Pondichery. ; 

8. Southeast: Eleventh and 12" House: Orissa, part of West 
Bengal, part of Andhra, East Coast, Andaman Nicobar. 

Example Horoscope: 1987 22 June, 12: 28 PM 


Ardra Pravesh 
1987 


How to Read the Horoscope of Ardra Parvesh: 
1. First see the directions and Rasis therein. 
2. The Rasis will show how much water will be there as per 


chart above. 

3. See the location of Planets and the aspect or directions they 
represent 

The planets will give rain as per table below: 

Planet Element Watery Content 

1. Sun Fiery Dry 

2. Moon Watery Water 

3. Mars Fiery Dry 

4. Mercury Earthy Water 

5. Jupiter Akash Water 

6. Venus Watery Water 

7. Satum Airy Dry and windy 


From the above it is clear that benefic planets Moon, Mercury, 
Jupiter and Venus are good for rain. The Karkas for dryness, 
drought (Sookha) are Saturn Sun and Mars. However, since Sun 
is life giver as well as Karka for Soul its effect on rain is not so 
bad. Sun and Mars is not good combination for rain. Please 
remember whenever Mars is ahead of Sun there is no rain. 


558 Analysing Horoscope Through Modern Techniques 


In the above horoscope the Sun and Mars are together at 
the time of Ardra Parvesh on 22 June. At the time of Ardra Parvesh 
there is no rain and Mars will move ahead of Sun in Karkha on 29" 
June. This is not favourable for rain. The rain will only happen 
when Sun moves ahead of Mars. The dates should be ascertained 
from ephemeris. 7 

Saturn is Karka for wind and dryness. This planet brings 
wind, storms and is responsible for driving away clouds in Nadis of 
wind. If it reaches Jal Nadi or is aspected by watery planets it 
causes rain and storm. In this way give prediction about rain by 
combining planets, Rasi and Nadis from Sapt Nadi Chakra. 

Let us apply these principles to the above horoscope. 

East Direction - Lagna: Lagna is Kanya. It represents eastern 
direction. Kanya has 0% water. The Navamsa Lagna is Aries with 
Mars as Lagna lord aspecting Lagna. This represents heat and 
dryness. Bengal, Bihar, UP, Punjab Haryana Himachal Pradesh 
would have heat at the time of Ardra Pradesh. There will be no 
rain in these parts. The summer will be hot with practically no rain. 
North East: Assam Bhutan and North east portion will have plenty 
of rain as Saturn is in North East Jupiter, Moon and Venus has 
aspect in the same direction. There will be heavy rain with storm. 
The Rasis concerned are Tula and Vrischik. Tula is airy Rasi with 
25% water and Vrischik is watery Rasi also with 25% water. 
North: Has been discussed above. Ardra Chakra is for the whole 
of North India. In northern India there is Sagittarius Rasi with the 
aspect of Sun, Mars and Mercury. Dhanu Rasi has 50% water. It 
has aspect of its own lord Jupiter who is a watery planet and is 
with Moon another watery planet. This is good for rain but the 
aspect of Sun and Mars and Mercury give late rain. 

And Gemini and Virgo are Rasis without water there will be shortage 
of rain. Southeastern Monsoon. 


Northwest: There are Capricorn and Aquarius Rasis, which have 
water. Makar has 100% water and Kumbha has 50% water. There 
is aspect of Mars and Saturn. There will be rain with high wind. 
But because of aspect of Mars the rains will be late. The western 
parts of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab Haryana, and Kashmir will 
comparatively have rain but rather late. As a result there will be 


Meterology 559 


good harvest. In the East and middle portion of Uttar Pradesh 
there will be less rain and loss of agriculture. 

West: West has Meena Rasi. It has 100% water with Rahu in it. 
There will be rain with wind. Rahu represents wind and storm. 
Southwest: Moon and Jupiter are in the South West direction. 
Venus is also in its own Rasi with aspect of Saturn. 

Result: Maharashtra and Gujarat will have heavy rain with storms 
and wind. There will be good southwesterly rain. 

South: In the South of India there is Mithun Rasi with 0% water. 
There are also Mars, Sun and Mercury, which promise very little 
rain. 

Southeast: Has aspect of Saturn and Jupiter. The Rasis involved 
are Cancer a watery sign with 100 per cent water and Simha with 
no water. There will be plenty of rain in Orissa and Andhra. There 
will also be storms and heavy wind. 

Result: In southwest portion of India there will be plenty of rain. 
But because of storm there will be plenty of loss. There will be 
shortage of rain in eastern part of India. In Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, 
Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan the rains will be late and hence 
danger of drought. (Sookha).

Predictions for rain for the Year 2002 

1. Lagna is a watery sign with 100% water having Venus a watery 
planet which is also in Ja/ Nadi and is good for rain. Lord of 
Lagna is Moon in Scorpio with water content 25% and is also 
with Ketu and aspected by Saturn and Mercury which is not 
very promising. In Navamsa, however. Moon is in its own sign 
but is aspected by a hot and dry planet Mars. In Sapt Nadi 


Meterology 561 


Chakra Moon is in Parchand Nadi whose lord Saturn is in 
Dahan Nadi, which is not good for rain. So in this season 
though there will be rain but not in abundance. 

2. However, important fact is that in this horoscope Mars 
is ahead of Sun. Hence rains will be delayed till Sun moves 
ahead of Mars which happens in early August. Hence rains in 
northern India would be delayed till early August. 

(Note: This is exactly what happened in the year 2002 contrary to 

meteorological department's prediction that rains will be on time, 

thus vindicating Vedic astrology). 

Example Horoscope: Predictions for the year 2003 on the 

basis of Ardra Parvesh Chakra. 

Time of making the Horoscope: Sun enters Ardra Nakshatra on 

22" June at 14 hrs 58 minutes. (This can be found out from Lehri's

Main Features of the Horoscope: 

1. In this Ardra Pravesh Chakra the Lagna lord is Venus which is 

in its own Rasi with a benefic Mercury and exalted Rahu. Venus is 

a watery planet which is good for rain. Taurus Rasi has 50 per cent 

water as such it is good for rain. 

2. Venus is also lord of Neer Nadi in Sapt Nadi Chakra which 

indicates good rain. 

1. Jupiter is exalted in a watery sign and is in a Kendra also 
which is a beneficial combination and good for rain. It is also in 
Amrit Nadi, which is good for rain. 


Meterology 563 


3. Moon, a watery planet is in Pisces a watery sign which has 
100% water and hence excellent for rain. 

3, Also Lagna is an airy benefic sign and Ardra Pravesh Chakra 
represents weather condition for North of India there will be 
plenty of rains with winds and storms (aspect of Mars on 
Venus). Lagna also represents East and being an airy Rasi 
indicate there will be rain with wind and storms in the east of 
India. 

4, Mercury is in Taums with Venus promising good rain. While 
Venus and Mercury are in Prachand Nadi indicating fierce 
weather but lord of this Nadi Saturn is in Saumya Nadi 
indicating weather change. 

¬ß, In the west because of fiery Rasi there will be shortage of 
rain. Lagna lord is in the 8" house with the aspect of Mars a 
fiery planet But Mars is in Jal Nadi and in the horoscope it is in 
Aquarius Rasi which has 50% water promising rain with wind 
(airy sign). Because Mars is fiery planet there is possibility of 
shortage of rain at some places and excess of rains at others. 

6. Inthe South there is watery Rasi with exalted Jupiter so there 
will be plenty of rain at most places. 

7. Inthe north, Capricorn Rasi promises good rain as ithas 100% 
water but its lord Saturn is in airy Rasi with fiery planet Sun 
because of which there will be storms, dust wind and rain. 

8. Jupiter in second from Sun would be good for rain but presence 
of Saturn with Sun gives extreme conditions of storm and heat 
and shortage of rain. The lord of Lagna in its own house 
promises good rain in some parts of the country.
