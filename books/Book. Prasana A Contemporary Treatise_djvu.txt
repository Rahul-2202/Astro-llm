INTRODUCTION 



My long cherished desire has been fulfilled when I am 
completed this book on Horary Astrology in Spain. This is 
second book authored by me in Sitges, Spain and fifth till 
date. Sitges, Spain has become my preferred destination for 
writing because of its quite, calm atmosphere and the 
Mediterranean. Book on Horary was overdue for many years 
as we had book on elementary Astrology "The Text Book of 
Astrology", book on Nadi Astrology, "Accurate Predictive 
Methodology" but not on Horary. 

An Astrologer has lot of responsibility on his shoulders while 
predicting an event because many a times whole life of the 
native depends on it. Challenge to a budding Astrologer is to 
check accuracy of his predictions. It may take years together 
to know the accuracy of your predictions till they come 
correct, which implies that after studying you will have to 
experience the application of science for the benefit of people 
at large. Nadi Astrology has been taught to me by my teacher 
Revered Late Sh. J.C. Luthra in 1995. Now the challenge 
was to know the accuracy of the system I with my friend 
Mr. P.K. Sarna took a stall In Diwali Mela to check the accuracy 
of Nadi Astrology through "Horary". Two days in the Mela 
boosted our confidence to a great extent as we could read 
past, present and future through Horary very well. The 
experience of seeing so many horoscopes was exhilarating. 

We were the first to use Horary Astrology on Television. In 
the years 2000 to 2001 I used Horary Astrology on Satellite 
T.V. In Nadi Horary Astrology answers can be give 
spontaneously with accuracy. Within half an hour of live 
program 20 - 25 answers were given i.e. one minute per 
answer, which included listening the question on phone, 
calculating the answer and answering it. 



-l- 



AD my students during these years have given me statistics 
of answers to frequently asked questions by people. This 
book includes chapters according to all the nine events of 
life in a native viz. Education, Litigation, Property and Vehicle 
Purchase, Career and Financial Prospects, Travel, Marriage, 
Children, Health and Longevity. 

A chapter on uncommon questions has also been included 
which contains Horary questions related to Mundane events, 
Politics and also questions which concern day to day life of 
some natives but are not directly involved in the nine events 
discussed above. In the chapter of Ruling Planets it is 
explained with illustrations how the answer to questions are 
given of the events, which are expected to happen within a 
day. 

In all the chapters numerous illustrations have been given 
and have been discussed in detail so that readers may be 
able to understand and practically apply Horary system of 
Nadi Astrology. All the illustrations are successful predictions 
of the author and his students. Some illustrations are from 
the work by group of my students who worked during Diwali 
Mela of 1998. A record of these Horary questions was 
compiled, their results were analyzed and they finally are 
included in this book. Some of the illustrations are from the 
T.V. programs and certain others are from my students. 

In certain illustrations I have showed Natal Horoscope and 
Horary Horoscope to prove that we get same answer from 
Natal Horoscope and Horary Horoscope. In certain cases it 
becomes essential to use the Horary Horoscope even if the 
natal Horoscope is present to verify the predictions for 
example the Natal Horoscope of a girl signifies no marriage 
and she is too young. In this case we will like to see whether 
her Horoscope is correct or not before giving such an adverse 
prediction. If she is too young then the events may not be 
too much to rectify Horoscope in such a case astrologer 
resorts to Horary Horoscope and the answer coming from 
the Horary Horoscope should be relied upon. In case of any 
difference of answer between the Horary Horoscope and 
Natal Horoscope then the Horary Horoscope should be given 
more importance because the Time of birth of Horary 
Horoscope is accurate. 



Sometimes native may ask same question again after some 
time due to curiosity. In such a case it is observed that the 
answer of the question does not change. However care 
should be taken that the second time again the native is 
serious to ask the question. It has also been observed that 
sometimes the native has asked a question and after an 
interval his relative or friend has asked the same question 
for the native. In all such cases same answers have been 
arrived at. 

In my lectures of "Horary Astrology" a common question is 
asked about the v Mook Prasna". Mook Prasna implies that 
native want to get answer of a question, which he does not 
want to ask. In 11 years of practice of Astrology and 
hundreds of my students who are practicing all over we 
have got 3-4 such questions out of the thousands of 
questions answered so far, A native will not ask question 
when he is feeling shy or have fear to ask the questions. 
These were all scandalous and after the answers given to 
the natives they opened up fully and explained the situation 
and the question in detail. In the chapter of "Career and 
Financial Prospects" I have included one of such questions. 
Native did not put question correctly and by the answer 
coming out from Horary it was found that the native was 
trapped by one of his partners. 

At what time the Astrologer should predict? In which direction 
should Astrologer face and the querist should face at the 
time of asking the question? These are also some of the 
questions, which are asked for. The answer is it doesn't 
make any difference when a question should be asked or 
answered and in what direction any body faces. It is only 
essential that the querist is serious and curious about the 
question. 

Experience in "Horary Astrology" has shown that if its 
principles are strictly followed the system gives accurate 
results because the time of asking the question is correct. 

People commonly ask if the Horary Astrology is extremely 
correct why the Astrologers do not become a billionaire by 
indulging in speculation trade? In Horary Astrology or Prasna 
Chart the querist should be serious only then one gets 

-3- 



accurate answer. In case if a native is really sick of some 
shares or commodity he has kept for long and wants to ask 
question regarding that the answer is surely going to come 
correct. Similarly in case of any match in sports between 
two teams if question is which team will win, then answer 
will surely come correct when queerest is emotionally 
attached to a team and wants his team should win or get 
the championship. If the answers to the speculative questions 
will start coming correct then that will overrule the native's 
Horoscope, which is not possible. 

This book is a unique book of Horary Astrology because it 
covers all the nine events of life and more with about 150 
illustrations with their true results. This book is well 
researched and carries the data, illustrations and experiences 
of many astrologers who have been working on this science 
for years together. 

In this book the principles of "Nadi Astrology" have been 
followed. Readers should have the knowledge of elementary 
Astrology to appreciate the book. However Astrologer having 
the knowledge of Nadi Astrology will understand the book 
easily. Readers are advised to go through "Accurate predictive 
Methodology" which will help them understand the book 
better. 

I will request my readers and astrologers to critically analyze 
any Horoscope after studying time, place and conditions 
after giving due consideration to caste, creed, religion and 
community. 

Research is an ongoing process and scope of improvement 
is always there. I appeal to all readers to write to me for 
any suggestions, improvements so that I incorporate the 
same in next edition of this book.

Saturn Capricorn, Aquarius 

Venus Taurus, Libra 

Uranus Capricorn 

Neptune Pisces

Natural Malefic: Natural malefic planets are Rahu, Ketu, 
Saturn, Mars, Uranus, Neptune & Pluto. 

Natural Benefic: Natural benefic planets are Jupiter, Venus, 
Mercury, Moon & Sun. Moon is always a benefic while 
decreasing & increasing. It should be considered a benefic 
during "Amavasya" also. In other words Moon is always a 
benefic. Similarly there should not be any confusion about 
Mercury. It is also a benefic always. Sun should also be 
considered a benefic since it signifies medicine, government 
& father etc. 

Separative planets: Separative tendencies are signified by 
Sun, Saturn, Rahu & Ketu. 

Natural Strength: Rahu, Ketu, Saturn & Mars are strong 
planets. They signify the events predominantly in their DBA 
& Transits than Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus & Jupiter. Uranus, 
Neptune, & Pluto are also very strong. They do not have 
any role in any DBA but their presence is felt certainly in 
Transits & behaviour of the native. 

Friendship & Enmity: There is no Friendship or Enmity 

-6- 



between any of the planets. All planets work in the manner 
explained in the book. 

In India most of the Astrologers are not using Uranus, Neptune 
& Pluto because Ancient Savants of Astrology have not 
written anything on it. It is a well known fact that all the 
three planets have been discovered recently* But since all 
of them are heavenly bodies & that too within our "Solar 
system" they must have been affecting the life on "Earth" 
Therefore I find it essential to write a few words on these 
planets. All of them do not take part in the DBA therefore 
they largely do not affect the occurring & the timing of the 
event. Their presence is felt in Transits & on the behaviour 
of the Native. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are transpersonal 
planets used much in Western Astrology. According to 
Western Astrology if these planets aspect Sun, Moon, 
Mercury, Venus and Mars then the native is very dynamic 
and intelligent. 

Uranus: Uranus signifies revolutions, rebellions, anarchy, ri- 
oting i.e. sudden blows & events in a Native's life. It rules 
Capricorn Sign. Uranus shares lordship with Saturn. Accord- 
ing to Western Astrology Uranus is lord of Aquarius whereas 
according to Indian Astrology Uranus is lord of Capricorn. 
Uranus represents revolutions hence is also associated to 
freedom. The change in the life of a native will be unex- 
pected, drastic and not wished for. The new change will be 
like the other side of the coin. It also rules intuition, cre- 
ativity, independent Ideas and leadership qualities. 

Neptune: Neptune is psychic in behaviour. It develops 
confusions in the mind of Native. It signifies cheats, de- 
ceivers, forgers, kidnapping etc. According to both Indian 
and western Astrology Neptune is lord of Pisces. It repre- 
sents sacrifices, love, sacrifice for love and fusing with 
others. It also rules confusions and victims of the situation 
however it is in our hand to overpower and weaken others. 
It also creates addiction to tobacco or alcohol and the 
reason can be result misunderstanding in love. It also 
rules spiritualism and mysticism. 

Pluto: Pluto is a kin of Mars but it signifies group activity. 
It signifies dacoits, massacres, gangsters, mass tragedies, 
racketeers etc. Pluto rules Scorpio according to both 



western and Indian Astrology. It signifies death like 
transformation. Sometimes beloved people separate from 
our lives and the cause of seperation can be death. 
Sometimes they will come back to us but the relations will 
not be the same again as they have transformed. It also 
gives us the opportunity to modify ourselves. Many fears 
are experienced in this path and in the end it is total 
liberation from the responsibilities. 

Dasa: Only Vimshottari Dasa is correct Dasa, which will be 
used in the book for timing the events of life of native. 

DBA: Term DBA will be used throughout in the book, which 
implies Dasa, Bhukti and Antar native will be undergoing at 
the time specified. Some astrologer also take it as Maha 
Dasa, Antar Dasa and Pratayantar Dasa also Main Period, 
Sub period and Sub - sub period. 

Ayanamsa: The first and foremost important factor before 
casting a horoscope is to take the correct "Ayanamsa". 
Ayanamsa is the rate at which the point of intersection of 
the Ecliptic & the celestial equator moves in retrograde 
motion. The correct Ayanamsa is given by the figure 
50.2388475". Reader should know that the fixed zodiac & 
the Sayana zodiac were in the same degree in the year 
291A.D. 

The astrologer should proceed now to cast the horoscope 
of the native by using the correct Ayanamsa. For casting 
the horoscope help can be taken from the K.P. Ephemeris or 
by Lahiri Ephemeris, Astrologers can take the help of correct 
software too available in the market. It is worth noting that 
K.P. & Lahiri Ephemeris are taking the same Ayanamsa but 
Lahiri had taken 285 A.D. as the year of coinciding of both 
the zodiacs. Astrologers should add 6' to Ascendant. & all 
the positions of the planets in case they are using Lahiri 
Ayanamsa or Chitrapaksha Ayanamsa.

CHAPTER - 1 

RULES OF HORARY 
ASTROLOGY 

Answers to the questions of native can be given on the 
basis of Natal & Horary Astrology (Prasna Chart). In Natal 
Astrology the Horoscope of the native is cast by knowing 
the Date, Time & Place of birth. An Astrologer on the basis 
of the, Natal Horoscope cast on this basis can predict all 
events of life, 

In Horary Astrology, Horoscope is cast at the time when the 
native asks question and answer to that question is given 
by looking at the planetary position at that time. It should 
be noted that in Natal astrology answers to all events of life 
can be given on the basis of Natal Horoscope but in case of 
Horary Astrology answer to only that particular question is 
given which is asked by the Native. 

Horary Astrology can answer all the events of life exhaustively, 
which can be predicted by Natal Astrology. The events are 
Education, Litigation, Property and Vehicle, Travel, Career, 
Marriage, Children, Health and Longevity. 

Why Horary Astrology is needed? 

In Natal Astrology purchase of property, vehicle, marriage 
and all other events of life can be predicted but answer to a 
precise question, can be easily predicted in Horary Astrology 
e.g. 

1. Which girl I will marry out of the two? 

2. Will I be able to purchase a particular property? 

3. Will I go to U.S.A.? 

In all these questions Native is very particular about the 
question. In question No.l he wants to marry out of two 
options. From Natal Horoscope Astrologer can time the 
marriage but cannot tell which of the two girl's he will marry. 

-10- 



Similarly in the second question the question is about 
purchasing a particular property. If in the Horary Horoscope 
the answer of second question is negative, native's desires 
will not be realized. In the second question the natal 
Horoscopes may show purchase of property but property 
purchased will be any property other than the property he 
desired to purchase. Similarly in third question native desired 
to go to U.S.A. and the Prasna Chart negates it then in 
case natal Horoscope signifies long travel then the native 
will not go to U.S.A. but the native may travel to some 
other country. 

The conclusion is that Horary Astrology can answer precise 
questions which may not be possible to answer in Natal 
Astrology. 

Natal Astrology is confined only to the events of life of a 
native but Horary Astrology answers to Mundane questions 
and also questions related to politics: 

• Who will win the match? 

• Will candidate of Congress party win from this 
constituency? 

From Horary Astrology we can also answer questions, which 
relate to environment we live in but may not relate to our 
Horoscope such as: 

• When will the road of our colony build up? 

• Will the municipality department put a lamppost in the 

park? 

By the help of Horary Astrology an astrologer can also answer 
those questions of the events, which are expected to happen 
within hours. 

• When X will reach the destination? 

• When will electricity come? 

Horary Astrology is also useful to all those people who's 
Natal Horoscope cannot be cast because their Date, Time & 
Place of birth are not known. 



-11 



PRASNA OR THE QUESTION 

It is clear that Horary Horoscope is cast at the time, when 
the native asks question. Basis of Horary astrology is that 
there must be a genuine question of native for a genuine 
answer. Now question arises as to what this genuine question 
is? 

Everybody born on earth has to undergo ups & downs in life. 
Whenever a problem arises, native tries to solve it with 
possible efforts within his reach. In case of failure or 
continuous trouble time comes when planets & stars compel 
him to visit an astrologer to know when his sufferings will be 
over. 

In other words problem haunts him to visit astrologer. This is 
the time when he visits / contacts astrologer and asks the 
question regarding his problem. At this point of time when 
he asks a question he gets accurate answer from the cosmos. 
To conclude astrologer should consider only that question in 
Horary in which native is involved and is curious to know the 
answer of the question. To cast a Horary Horoscope or Prasna 
Chart there must be a question or Prasna. 

Native can ask question either related to him or related to 
his relative or friends. It is advised to avoid questions asked 
by people casually in parties, get together etc. Irrelevant 
and non-serious questions should not be taken from the 
natives as they result into incorrect answers damaging the 
image of astrologer & astrology. They are also of no use to 
the querist/ native. 

When a native visits an Astrologer he has one burning 
question in mind about the current problem e.g. he is not 
doing well in business or he is not comfortable with job or his 
daughter is not getting married and so on. He can have two 
separate questions also about the profession and marriage 
of his daughter etc. then the astrologer should take question 
by Horary one by one depending upon the priority of the 
question told by the native. Preferably astrologer should 
take only one question from the native at a time and maximum 
second after answering the first question. 



12 



In case of leading question of one problem astrologer should 
refer to same horary Horoscope e.g. native asks when 
marriage of his daughter will take place? After the prediction 
by astrologer if the native asks about the married life of the 
daughter then the same Horoscope has to be referred to for 
the prediction about the married life of his daughter. 

An obvious question is that whether Astrologer can ask 
question for himself or not? An Astrologer is a person who 
has to go through the life as any other person and has to 
face similar problems. If even Astrologer is serious to ask a 
question he can ask the question for himself following the 
principles of Horary Astrology. 

ESSENTIALS OF HORARY HOROSCOPE 

1. Accuracy of Time: Astrologer should be very particular 
about the precision of time. 

2. Understanding question of Native: Astrologer should 
listen to the question of the Native with patience and try to 
understand his question carefully. Native is coming to the 
astrologer at the time of difficulty and at this time it is 
natural that he may not be in sufficient mental health and 
may utter unimportant things. He can be facilitated to come 
on concrete question and when he comes on the concrete 
question naturally is the time astrologer should take into 
consideration. 

3. Taking "Seed" from Native: As you know there are 
243 Sub lords in a Zodiac. Six sub lords spill over to the next 
sign. Therefore six other sensitive points in the zodiac result 
giving rise to 249 sensitive points in total. 

A diary is prepared having 125 pages amounting to 250 when 
pages are counted from front to back. This diary in hand is 
supposed to be Zodiac. After listening to the question of 
the native he is asked to open any page of the diary. Note 
down the page he has opened, See the Starting degree of 
the number in the Table I from the Annexure and consider it 
as the Ascendant degree or Cuspal degree of the Ascendant. 
The number noted is also called "Seed" of the question since 
from this Ascendant is arrived at and Horoscope will be cast 

-13- 



to know the answer With this method, he is asked to point 
to the answer to his own question in the Zodiac. 

Relevance of taking seed: 

Prime organ governing our body is the brain. Astrologically, 
planets & stars guide the brain. Our Nerves end in the palms 
of the hands and all the thinking of our brain is reflected 
through hands, which are guided by the brain through nervous 
system. Therefore taking the seed becomes relevant. In 
case of emergency if the native cannot come to the 
Astrologer in person then he can be asked to tell any number 
at random in between 1 to 249 by any means of 
communication. 

If Horary Horoscope is cast taking Ascendant from the time 
native has asked a question. This system collapses when 
two or more persons ask same question at one given time. 
Horary Astrology of Nadi system was applied on predicting 
marks to about 100 students in an hour's time (same 
Ascendant at that time) with success in 1997 whereas 
traditional system may not have answered in such case. 

4. Time of Birth of Question or Time of sowing of Seed: 

After knowing the degree of the Ascendant from the seed 
Horary Horoscope should be cast taking current time into 
consideration. 

In case the question is asked from the Astrologer & Astrologer 
is not in a position to cast the Horoscope at that time and 
cast the horoscope afterwards to know the answer then 
that time should be taken when Astrologer actually starts 
working on the question. 

In case Horoscope is to be cast by hand then when he 
takes the pen in hand to work upon, that time is to be taken 
& in case when he starts doing work by computer then that 
time is to be taken when he switches on his computer. The 
seed should be used within two days. If Astrologer is not 
able to work after getting the seed within two days he 
should ask for another seed from the native for the question. 

It is not the time of asking the question that is important. It 

-14- 



is important as to when the seed has been sown for calculating 
the answer. 

5. Place of Birth of question or Place of sowing of seed: 

For casting the Horary Horoscope latitude & longitude of 
place is taken where Astrologer works upon the question. 

6. Analyzing Horary Horoscope: After casting the Horary 
Horoscope answer should be given by analyzing the Planets 
in the Horoscope, DBA and Transits. 

Before going to the detail as to how a Horary Horoscope is 
seen let me explain you by an example how a Horary 
Horoscope is cast.

Step 2 

Now note down the degree of the Ascendant of Horary 
Horoscope from the seed. 

Since the seed is 135, the Ascendant is Libra 15° 13' 20" 
(from the Annexure).

Table from theAnnexure: 

Casting Nirayana Bhav Chalit Chart 

Step 1 

The first step is to check time, date & place of birth of the native. The 
place of birth of the native is Delhi i.e. latitude 28°40' N. Lef s open the 
page for Delhi in the "Raphael's Tables of Houses". 

Step 2 

Find out the Ayanamsa of 2000. The ayanamsa for the year is 
23degrees and 55minutes. 

Add the ayanamsa to the Ascendent degree of the native.The Ascendent 
degree is Libra 15° 13' 20". Adding ayanamsa to the Asc.=: 23°55' 
+ Libra 15° 13' 20" = Scorpio 9° 8'20" . 

Step 3 

Now we'll see the nearest degree of the Ascendent available in the 
Raphael's Table of Houses which we find to be Scorpio 9° 38' . 
Now pen down the cuspal degrees of the various houses available in 
the table. 

Cuspal degree of the 2nd house 9° Sagittarius 

3rd house 10°Capricom 

" u 10th house 13° Leo 

11th house 15° Scorpio 
n " 12th house 15° Libra 

Step 4 

Deduct Ayanamsa from the cuspal degrees so obtained. 

Cuspal degrees of 

2nd house = 9° Sagittarius - 23°55' = 15° 05' Scorpio 

3rd house = 10°Capricorn - " = 16° 05' Sagittarius

For taking out the houses signified { coordinates of ) by Rahu & Ketu 
different method is followed. Rahu & Ketu do not have Lordships. Rahu 
& Ketu give the results as follows : 

1) They give the results of Ihe planets 1hey are conjunct with. 

2) They also give the results of the planets they are aspected by. 

3) They also give the results of the planet in whose sign they are 
posited. 

The Rahu in the horoscope will give the results as under & in the same 
above sequence 
1)None 

2) Venus -1,2,8 

3) Mercury -9,12 

In addition to the above three conditions We'll also write the position 
of the Rahu which is 9 

So all the Houses signified by Rahu are : Rahu : 1,2,8,9,12 
Similarly for Ketu we'll follow the same steps 

1) Venus -1,2,8 

2) Mars -2,7, 11 

3) Jupiter -3,6 

The position of the Ketu is in the 3. 

So all the Houses signified by Ketu are : Ketu : 1,2,3,6,7,8,11

ANALYSING A HORARY HOROSCOPE 

A Horary Horoscope is analyzed in the similar manner as a 
Natal Horoscope is analyzed. 

While analyzing any Planet we should observe that Sub lord 

-19- 



is stronger than Nakshatra and the Nakshatra is stronger 
than the Planet. 

For any event to happen Dasa should be given the maximum 
weight age. If Dasa allows an event, the event can happen 
in the Dasa. If it does not allow the event we should check 
the "next Dasa and so on. Once the Dasa allows the event 
we should go to see the current Bhukti and if this Bhukti 
allows the event we should check the nearest Antra and 
then the Transits, which will tell the day of the happening of 
the event. However if current Bhukti does not allow the 
event we should check the nearest Bhukti, which allows the 
event to happen and see the Antras in the Bhukti and then 
the Transits. 

Readers who have knowledge of Nadi Astrology know that 
there are formulations of events of life and these formulations 
are to be seen in the Dasa Bhukti Antar or the DBA. All the 
formulations for happening of different events are given in 
different chapters of the book. 

For the events, which cannot change the status of a native, 
its Dasa may not be required to be seen. For example the 
question is Rs.100/- have been lost as to whether I will be 
able to recover it or not? Rs.100/- for a native who is a 
millionaire is a meager amount and if a millionaire ask such a 
question even Bhukti should not be seen just the Antra is 
enough to be seen. However, Dasa should be seen if a poor 
man asks this question. 

After seeing the DBA to pin point the day of happening of an 
event Transits should be seen in the following manner; 

Transits 

Any of the three planets which signify the event may / may 
not be from the DBA should either 

• Conjoin in one house 

• Or aspect each other 

• Or transit the significator houses 

• Or aspect them 

• Or transit over their natal positions 



20 



After one of the above conditions is fulfilled the event can 
take place at any given moment. 

For example Jupiter, Mars and Sun signify any event in any 
horoscope. In Transit Jupiter and Mars are conjunct and 
Sun joins both of them then this condition of conjunction of 
Mars, Sun and Jupiter all conjunct together will remain there 
for from a number of days to a month. We desire to calculate 
the day of the event. Hence after any of the above condition 
is fulfilled it is desirable to arrive at the day of the event. 
For that we proceed as follows. 

Event will take place on the day when 

• A transiting planet signifying event, either transit exactly 
over Natal degree of planet signifying the event. 

• Or two planets signifying the event transiting in a sign 
conjunct with in a degree. 

• Or any planet signifying the event transits exactly over 
Cuspal degree of significator Houses. 

• Or Moon conjoining three planets signifying event. Note 
that Moon should also signify the event otherwise its 
Transit is not desirable to be seen. 

• Or the transit of the Antar lord in the favourable 
Nakshatra. Favourable Nakshatra here also means 
Nakshatra of a Planet that signifies event. 

Please note that event takes place when there is disturbance 
in the cosmos within a degree or the sensitive degrees of 
Horoscope. Sensitive degrees of Horoscope are degrees of 
the Natal planets and the Cuspal degrees of the Houses. For 
example in case of marriage, degrees of Planets signifying 
marriage and the Cuspal degrees of 2,7,11 Houses become 
important for pin pointing event. Also fast moving planets 
Sun, Mars, Mercury and Venus are be helpful in pin pointing 
the day of event since the others take a number of days to 
cover a degree whereas Moon is too fast to draw any 
conclusion. 



-21 



During Transits any Planet signifying the event can take 
part or it finally precipitates the event. We have normally 
three planets taking part in DBA and three planets in Transits 
involvements of which will finally make the event happen. It 
implies for a major event to happen in life minimum three 
planets are required. Fast moving planets finally play the 
role to time the date of event. In other words Transit of 
slow moving planets Saturn, Jupiter, Rahu or Ketu cannot 
finalize an event. 

CUSPAL SUB LORD 

Starting degree of the House is called the Cusp or the Cuspal 
degree of the house in "Nadi Astrology". The Sub lord at the 
Cuspal degree is called the "Cuspal Sub lord". Cuspal Sub 
lord is important. The strength of the house is drawn from 
the strength of the Cuspal Sub lord. If the Cuspal sub lord 
signifies the combinations connected with the House the 
House is strong. The concerned events will take place in 
the concerned DBA. If the Cuspal Sub lord negates the 
event the event may not take place even in the DBA promising 
the event strongly. For example, if the Cuspal Sub lord of 
the 4 th House signifies 4 or 11 or good houses 2,9 in this 
regard the individual in the DBA of 4,11,12 will purchase the 
property. On the other hand if Cuspal Sub lord signifies houses 
3,5,6,8,12 the DBA of 4,11 will be ineffective. 

Readers who know IMadi Astrology are aware that it is difficult 
to handle the Cuspal degree of Houses in Natal Horoscope. 
This is because it is practically very difficult to correct the 
degree of Ascendant of a native to minutes. In case of 
Horary Astrology the degree of Ascendant is accurate 
therefore Astrologer can use the Cuspal Sub lord of all the 
Houses. For predictions Cuspal Sub lord of only the prime 
house is important. For example in case of marriage Cuspal 
Sub lord of 7 th House and for property Cuspal Sub lord of 4 th 
House carries importance.

CHAPTER - 2 

EDUCATION 



Education means acquiring information & knowledge through 
parents, teachers & gurus. This information & knowledge is 
available in books, texts, periodicals & scriptures & is taught 
through schools, colleges & educational institutions. 

The information & knowledge so acquired when applied in 
various fields of life becomes the wisdom. Wisdom is 
application of information & knowledge at appropriate time 
place & conditions. 

Houses 

Astrologically, Houses which signify information & knowledge 
acquired in schools, colleges & educational institutions are: 

House 2 House 2 signifies the knowledge acquired. 

House 4 House 4 is the prime house of education & it 
also signifies primary education. 

House 9 House 9 signifies higher education. 

House 11 House 11 signifies gain in education. 

In addition to the above houses of education there are also 
certain facilitator houses, they are: 

House 5 House 5 signifies intelligence & the 
comprehension of the native. 

House 3 House 3 is the prime house of written work, 
communication & printing. 

11 House in astrology signifies gain when rt gets connected 
with the relevant houses of education it combines to give 
gain of the relevant house. In such cases it also enhances 
the significance of house to heights. 

-23- 



Combinations 

The system of education is regulated through the examination 
system where the appraisal of the native's performance is 
carried out by allocation of the grades & percentage of 
marks so obtained. In line with the modern day education 
the following combinations in the DBA planets give the 
respective grades & percentage of marks. 

4.9.11 "A" grade or maximum marks. 
4,11 "B" grade or above average. 

5,11 little lower than above combination. 

4,9 "C" grade or average, 

2,5,9 "D" grade or low. 

Scattered 2,5,9 W E" grade or just passing marks. 

6.8.12 Failures & obstacles 

When 6,8,12 gets connected with any of the combinations 
mentioned above except 4,9,11 or 4,11 or 5,11 will result 
into compartment in the particular subject held during the 
relevant DBA. 

No inclination for Education: We also come across natives 
in peculiar circumstances when the native belongs to well 
to do family where native is provided with all the means of 
education but the native has no inclination for education. 
For such cases the combination 3,6,8 is profound in the 
horoscope. 

Foreign Education: In the modern world where education 
is desired by all, sometimes due to compelling circumstances 
of parents, lack of facility in the native's place, transfer or 
otherwise the native has to leave his home for having his 
education. Since education away from native's place has 
inherent foreign travel which is signified by the combination 
3,9,12. 

Scholarships: To promote healthy competition amongst the 
students the concept of scholarship to the meritorious 
candidates is prevalent in our educational institutions. It 
gives a sense of pride to the student, parents & other 
relatives. 



-24 



In astrology scholarship is signified by House 6 & for gaining 
the scholarship House 11 must get connected therefore 
getting the scholarship 6 & 11 houses in a native's horoscope 
should get profound in the DBA periods. 

Success in Competitive Examinations & Interviews : 

Admission to good course or prestigious institutions is 
regulated through competitive examinations, for success in 
such competitive examinations are achieved by the native 
when the DBA planets signify houses 6,11 or 4,9,11- In few 
cases where the seats available are more then the 
combinations of 4,11 or 5,11 in present DBA also results 
into success. 

Furthermore, the competitive written examinations are 
followed by interviews or group discussions or both. The 
interview or group discussion requires a person to have good 
communication & vocal skills which in astrology are signified 
by the 3 House. A native having combination of 3,11 or 
3,6,11 in present DBA gets through interviews & group 
discussions. 

Prizes or Awards: Combination 6,11 in the DBA of Jupiter 
or Venus signifies Prize whereas combination 10,11 in the 
DBA of Jupiter or Venus signifies award.

Balance Dasa of : Rah OY 7M 3D 

To see the performance of a student in studies for whole life 
we will have to see the approximate age left for studies. In 
this case the child was 7 years old and he has approxi- 
mately 14*17 years left for studies and for that we will have 
to have a look on all the Planets because all the Planets 
period will rotate in these years. Saturn, Sun and Mercury in 
the Horoscope are signifying 4,11 whereas Ketu, Sun and 
Mars signify 5,9,11- Saturn, Sun, Ketu, Mars also signify 10, 
11 ; 6,11 which implies winning prizes and awards. Venus, 
Moon, Jupiter and Rahu also signify the same combinations 
but they additionally signify 3,6,12 which implies no inclina- 
tion for education. Since 3,6,12 is signified with better com- 
binations like 5,11;9,11 repeating again 3,6,12 will not be 
able to over power the combinations 5,11;9,H and 12 will 
additionally signifies research oriented mind. 

This concludes that the child will be brilliant in studies. He 
will oftenly win prizes and awards. He will be successful in 
clearing competitive examinations also. Since 5,1 1 is signified 
in most of the planets he will be very creative also.

Balance Dasa of : Sat 4Y 6M 25D 

Astrologer should know the duration of the course and Dasa 
period of the duration have to be seen to know whether the 
native will be able to do the course successfully or not. The 
period in this case was a year and a half i.e. up to April 
2002. At the time of asking the question Saturn ~ Rahu - 
Saturn period was in operation. Saturn signifies 2,11,12 in 
Planet and Sub lord and 6,7 in the Nakshatra. 6 in Nakshatra 
and 12 from Planet and Sub lord indicates hurdles in doing 
the course whereas 2 r ll combination is positive. Rahu signifies 
2,4,9,11,3 Houses which are extremely positive. This implies 
that Saturn - Rahu - Saturn period is going to give little 
hurdles. Saturn and Rahu being natural malefics may give 
illusions but since Houses signified are good not much problem 
is indicated. Next Antra is of Mercury which signifies 6,8,12 



28 



and if during this period if examinations are held the native 
may fail in a subject or two. Next Antras up to April 2002 are

Company Secretary examinations are highly competitive 
examinations and the DBA in the Horoscope should clearly 
signify excellent combinations. In this Horoscope at the time 
of examination DBA of Saturn - Venus - Moon was running. 
Saturn signifies 4,5,8;2,10;6,9 in Planet, Nakshatra and Sub 
lord respectively. The Houses signified are not good enough 
for clearing the competitive examination. Bhukti lord Venus 
is better since it signifies 9,11 in Nakshatra. Antra lord Moon 
signifies 2,10; 4,5,8 ; 1,2,8,9 in Planet, Nakshatra and Sub 
lord respectively- Hence the native will not be able to clear 
the examination in this attempt. Native did the CS. in next 
attempt.

Natural significator of an Institute or social organization are 
Venus and Jupiter. For educational Institute Houses of 
education should also appear with the Houses of construction 
of property which are 4,11,12. Since the Institute is to be 
made in foreign the Houses for foreign 3,9,12 should also 
appear. 

Dasa lord Mercury signifies 7,8,10 ; 6,8,11 ; 6,8, 11 in Planet, 
Nakshatra and Sub lord respectively. Since 10,11 is being 
signified the institute is possible but 6,8 are suggesting more 
expenditure and loan than expected. Bhukti lord Venus 
signifies 2,3,5,7,8,9,10,12 in Nakshatra and Sub lord. 
2,3,5,9,10 are good Houses for education whereas House 8 
signifies hurdles. Concluding in the Venus period difficulties 
will be faced by the querent. Antra of Rahu is good since it 
signifies 3,4,5,9,10 Houses. This is the time when some work 
of Institute should start. Next Bhukti of Sun will start from 
April 2009 which signifies 6,8,11 in Nakshatra and Sub lord. 
This is the period when government will help for the institute 
and Institute in real sense should start specially in the Antra 
of Rahu, However being 6,8 Houses are together the work 
will not be easy. Further success will be achieved in 2013 in 
the Bhukti of Rahu which signifies all positive Houses 
1,3,4,5,9,10,12. Please note that Mercury is conjunct with 
Venus. Cuspal Sub lord of 4 th House is also Rahu.

The competitive examinations were to be held on December 
2001 and at that time DBA of Saturn - Jupiter - Rahu was in 
operation. Saturn is extremely positive as it signifies 4,11 in 
Nakshatra also Sub lord is positive. Bhukti Lord Jupiter and 
Antar Lord Rahu both signify 6,842 with no enough supporting 
Houses of education therefore the result expected was 
negative and it also happened so.

CHAPTER - 3 

LITIGATION 



These days man has become such an egoist, corrupt, 
manipulative & embroiled in various controversies that you 
hardly come across any person who has not faced litigation 
whether by initiating himself or somebody else initiating 
against him including the government & other agencies. 
Litigation as commonly understood means any dispute or 
difference or disagreement over anything, which results into 
the native approaching the courts, tribunal or any other 
competent authority. 

Houses 

House 6: In astrology House 6 is prime house of 

litigation by the native or against the native. 

House 8: House 8 plays significant role in litigation as it 
signifies tensions, obstacles, failures & insults. 

House 12: Similarly House 12 involves upon expenses in 
litigation, payment of penalties, dues or taxes 
& loss of sleep, imprisonment & secret plots of 
enemies. It is also prime house of loss. 

Planets 

Natural malefic Rahu, Ketu, Saturn promote litigations by 
the native or against the native. They also promote disputes, 
tensions, conviction by the court, imprisonment, kidnapping, 
insults, impositions of penalties, dues or taxes etc. Litigation 
is not possible without the participation of these Planets in 
DBA, 

Combinations & Timing of Litigation 

Astrologically if all or any of the 6,8,12 houses are signified 

-36- 



in the DBA of natural malefic Rahu, Ketu, Saturn native is 
involved in litigation. Kindly note that any of the 6, 8 or 12 
House alone in the Planet, Nakshatra or Sub lord of DBA 
planets doesn't result into litigation. It is only when any two 
or all of the above houses get connected in the Planet, 
Nakshatra or the Sub lord of DBA of natural malefic there is 
danger of litigation, damages & penalties to the native. If 
any of the 6, 8 or 12 are repeated in the Planet & Nakshatra 
or Nakshatra & the Sub lord in DBA of the natural malefic 
then also penalties are imposed on the native. 

In all such cases if Sun or Moon also get involved in the DBA 
the native suffers at the hands of the state government, 
central government, Municipal corporation & other 
government authorities. 

Imprisonment: If a native is convicted and sent by the 
court for imprisonment then the combination of 2,3,8,12 is 
repeated in the DBA of natural malefic Rahu or Ketu. Since 

House 12: 12th house is the main house of imprisonment & 
loss. 

House 8 : It signifies tensions, insults, obstacles & failures. 

House 3: It signifies away from home. 

House 2: As it signifies sufferings & the concern of the 
family. 

The period of the conviction can be known by the continuity 
of the above combination in the subsequent DBA. Same 
combination is for the arrest by police on account of any 
case registered against the native. 

Going Underground: In certain cases for avoiding the trial 
of the case & conviction thereafter some persons go 
underground to avoid the trial & imprisonment. The 
combination in such a case is 3,4,8,12. 

Kidnapping: Prosperity has its own pitfalls & these days 
kidnapping for ransom of the members of the rich families is 
a common phenomenon. The combination of kidnapping for 
ransom or otherwise is 2,3,4,8,12 in the DBA of the natural 
malefic Rahu or Ketu. If in Horary Horoscope combination of 

-37- 



2,4,11 appear in DBA the native returns home. In the Horary 
Horoscope we have to see combination of coming back or 
no return. Many a times the kidnapped person is murdered 
by the kidnappers and for that murder and longevity has to 
be seen. For taking an idea about the condition of the 
kidnapped person in captivity the Planets of DBA have to be 
seen. If they are natural benefic the native is in good shape 
and if the DBA is of natural malefic he is kept in filthy place 
and is being manhandled also. For the direction of the 
kidnapped person we will have to see the DBA lords and 
their directions.

Winning in litigation: When the combination of 6,11 appears 
in the relevant DBA subsequently then the native wins in 
the litigation. The native also wins the case if 10,11 or 6,10 
or 1,6 are signified in subsequent DBA. All the combinations 
are stronger in the ascending order i.e. 6,11 is stronger than 
10,11 whereas 10,11 is stronger than 6,10 & 6, 10 is stronger 
than 1,6. Since 

House 1: signifies self effort. 

House 6: is 12 th House of the opposition or loss of the 
opposition. 

House 10: signifies name, fame & authority. 

House 11: signifies gain or win. 

Bail: Native gets bail in the DBA of 10,11 or 6,11 or 6,10. 

Outside Court Compromise/Settlement: justice delay 
results into loss of time & more expenses. This position 
compels the litigants to compromise the case outside the 
court. The combination of compromise outside the court is 
the 5 and 9 Houses signified in DBA of natural benefic Moon, 
Mercury, Jupiter & Venus.

Rahu In the Natal Horoscope is extremely bad for litigation. 
Ketu Bhukti in Rahu Dasa had been up to December 2000. 
Ketu signifies 1, 6,10, 8 Houses which confirms litigation 
regarding marital problem. All other Planets also signify 
combination of divorce. He will get divorce but at the time 
of asking the question Bhukti and Antar of Venus was in 
operation for eight months which signifies combination 6,11 
i.e. bail, hence he will get bail and will not be arrested.

Present Dasa is of Moon which signifies 12 in the Sub lord 
therefore the Native will not get bail in the Dasa of Moon. 
Next Dasa is of Mars which signifies 3,8,; 4,5,6,8; 9,11,12 in 
the Planet, Nakshatra & Sub lord respectively. Since 11 is 
signified in the sublord & 6,11 is signified when Nakshatra & 
Sublord are clubbed together bail can be granted in the 
Mars Dasa. Mars is however weak to grant bail since its 
Nakshatra is negative. It requires excellent Bhukti for bail. 
Rahu is extremely good hence in its Bhukti bail is possible. 
Lady applied for bail of her husband in the DBA of Mars - 
Rahu - Saturn and her husband got conditional bail in 
November 2000.

Balance Dasa of : Ven 9Y 6M 20D 

Native used to receive threatening calls from someone and 
the culprit was revealed. Culprit was unrelated to the native. 
He had doubt on one of his distant relative therefore he 
wanted to confirm by the help of Astrology as to whether 
the relative was the person behind the scene. 



■44- 



To know whether a news or a message etc. is correct or not 
3,11 should appear in DBA. Houses 6,10 will be helpful too. 
Cuspal Sub lord of House 3 and Dasa Lord is Venus signifies 
3,4,8,11 whereas Jupiter, Bhukti and Antar lord signifies 
3,6,4,5,10 which confirms the involvement of the relative. 
The relative confessed this in front of police after few days 
during police investigation.

Dasa of Jupiter was in operation at the time of asking the 
question. Jupiter signifies 4,11; 2,4,5,7,9,10,11; 6,8 in 
Planet, Nakshatra & Sub lord respectively. Planet and 
Nakshatra are extremely positive to come out of the litigation 
whereas Sub lord is all the more negative. This implies only 
in extremely positive Bhukti it is possible to come out of the 
litigation by out of court settlement since 5,9 are signified. 
Native will have to pay price for this since 6,8 is also signified. 

Bhukti Moon is extremely bad since it signifies 6,8 in Planet 
and Sub lord. Bhukti of Moon ended on 16 th July 2002. Next 
Bhukti was of Mars which signifies 5,9,10,11 strongly. Rahu, 
Ketu and Venus are also extremely positive therefore it was 
advised to do out of court settlement in the Antras of these 



-46 



Planets to get rid of court case. Native was successful in 
February - March 2003 in the Antra of Venus. Venus is also 
the Cuspal Sub lord of 6 th House.

Dasa Lord is Moon, which signifies 3,4 in Planet and Nakshatra 
and 1,2,5 in the Sub lord. Moon neither signifies combination 
of win nor loosing the case. Mercury signifies the Houses 
5,9; 10; 12 which are the Houses of outside court settlement 
and wining the case respectively. Antar lord Venus signifies 
3,6; 1,7,8,11,12; 4 in Planet, Nakshatra and Sub lord 
respectively. 

Ketu signifies Houses 1,7,8,11,12 in Planet and Nakshatra 
and 7,8,11 in the Sub lord hence it is stronger for winning 
case. Sun is positive for win as it signifies 8,11. Mars, Rahu, 
Jupiter and Saturn have all the Houses of win, loose and 
outside court settlement. Since maximum Planets signify 



51 



combination of outside court settlement the matter will settle 
outside the court in period of benefic. Native did out of 
court settlement in DBA of Moon - Mercury - Jupiter. In 
Mercury and Jupiter 6,8,12 Houses are little stronger than 
10,1 1 Houses native gave more part of share to the opposite 
party.

CHAPTER -4 

PROPERTY AND VEHICLE 



The most common question an astrologer faces from the 
native is about acquisition of property or vehicle because it 
is distant dream of majority of persons specially in 
metropolitan cities. Property purchase involves the entire 
life savings of an individual. It is also correlated with the 
status of the family. 

Purchase of Property 

Houses 

Houses involved in purchase of property are: 



House 4 
House 11 
House 12 

Planets 



Prime house of property. 

Gain of property & fulfillment of desires. 

Expense incurred during the purchase of 
property. 



Natural significators of property are Mars &/ or Saturn. No 
property can be purchased or sold without their involvement 
in DBA or they should aspect or conjunct DBA planets. They 
also play major role in transits during purchase or sale of 
properties. 

Combination & Timing of Purchase of Property 

Native purchases a property when the DBA lords signify the 
combination of 4,11,12. Mars or Saturn should essentially 
appear in DBA or aspect DBA lords. 

Property Purchase through Loan 

Since purchase of property involves huge amount a native 

-53- 



in some case takes loan through banks, financial institutions 
& others. In such cases there is involvement of House 6 
with the combination of purchase of property in DBA. So the 
complete combination of purchase of property through loan 
is 4,6,11,12 & the significator planets Mars & / or Saturn . 
Property is also purchased or acquired through legacy, dowry 
& paying through the savings of provident funds or insurance. 
If the property is purchased through the savings of provident 
funds or insurance 8 House is signified with the combination 
of purchase of property. The complete combination of 
purchase of property in this case is 4,8,11,12 Mars & / or 
Saturn. Now if the property is acquired through legacy the 
House 8 is repeated with 4,11 houses. Now one thing should 
be carefully noted here that the involvement of House 12 
would not be there since the native makes no expense in 
this regard. 

Purchase in installments 

When 4,12 is signified in the DBA the property is purchased 
In installments. This case is a little different from the purchase 
through loan. Here no loan is taken & the property is acquired 
after a long process of payments in parts. 

Location & Status of Property 

If natural benefic Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus & Jupiter are 
in DBA planets the property purchased is in good & prime 
location. If somehow Sun & Moon are predominantly signified, 
property is purchased from Govt, or Govt, authority. There 
is an expansion in property in DBA of Jupiter or the property 
is huge. Venus signifies prime, sophisticated & beautiful 
property. It also signifies interior decoration. However if the 
property is purchased in the DBA of natural malefic Rahu, 
Saturn or Ketu the property is purchased in bad location. If 
somehow Saturn is predominant in DBA with other natural 
malefic, the property purchased can also be smaller than 
the needs of the native. 

Commercial property 

Mercury & the 7 House signify commercial property. The 
commercial property will be purchased when Mercury is any 

-54- 



of the DBA planets or 7 houses is signified with the combination 
of property purchase as discussed above. 

Construction of Property 

If a plot of land is purchased & the native wants to commence 
the construction at the same stage or the later stage the 
same combination of purchase of property should appear in 
DBA during construction. 

Rental Income 

Native will earn rental income in the DBA of 4,6,11. The 
tenant will not vacate the property if the combination of 
loss of property (given below) is signified in the subsequent 
DBA of the native. The property is revived in litigation when 
the combination of 4,6,11 is revived in the subsequent DBA* 
If the combination doesn't reappear in DBA the native has 
to loose the property forever. 

Loss of Property 

Loss of property can be due to various reasons like losing in 
litigation, Mafia, attachments etc. Loss of property takes 
place in the DBA of malefic Rahu/ Ketu signifying 4,6,8,12. 
Demolition of property by the Govt, authority will take place 
in the DBA of Sun or Moon. The DBA planets will signify the 
combination 4,7,8,12. 

Partition of Property 

Partition of property will take place between two or more 
parties when 3,11 will be signified in the DBA of separative 
planets. 

Common question asked by the native is whether the property 
purchased by him is lucky or not. If combination of purchase 
of property is signified in the DBA of natural benefic with 5,9 
or 5,9 are signified in the DBA of natural benefic the person 
will be happy in life & satisfied. On the other hand if 6,8,12 
are signified in the DBA of natural malefic during purchase of 
property & in subsequent DBA the person will have to face 
series of troubles in life therefore he will believe the property 



55- 



is not lucky for him. The astrologer in all such cases shall 
deal with the native in a very articulate manner 

Sale of Property 

Sale of property is signified by the combination 3,5,10. Since 
5,10 of the native are 4,11 to the opposite party & 3 being 
12 th from the 4 th House signifies losing the possession of the 
property by the native. Here also the signrficator planets 
remain the same i.e. Mars & Saturn. Therefore native sells 
property in the DBA of any of Mars or Saturn signifying the 
combination of 3,5,10. 

If somehow House 11 is signified in the DBA with the 
combination of sale of property the native is able to sell the 
property at higher price than the market price. On the other 
hand if same combination is signified with 6,8,12 in the DBA 
the property is sold at lower than the market price. 

If both 3,5,10 & 4,11 are signified in the DBA of the native 
there is simultaneous sale & purchase of the property by 
the native. 

Change of Residence 

Change of place of residence of a native is signified by the 
combination 3,5. They should be signified in the DBA planets 
of separatlves at the particular time. 

Purchase of Vehicle 

Purchase of vehicle is a common phenomenon because of 
the fast life & the distances involved. 

Houses 

Houses involved in purchase of vehicle are same as that of 
property. 



House 4 
House 11 
House 12 



The prime house of vehicles. 
Gain of vehicle. 
Expense thereon. 

-56- 



Facilitator house 

House 3: House 3 in a Horoscope is prime house of travel & 
leaving the home for various reasons such as business, 
service, tourism etc. In case of vehicle purchase it is a 
facilitator House whereas in property being 12 th from the 4 th 
it negates the purchase of property. 

Planet 

Venus: Venus is the significator planet in both sale & 
purchase of vehicles. 

Combinations & Timing of Purchase of Vehicle 

When an astrologer has to predict the purchase of vehicle 
he has to pin point DBA planets which signify 4,11/12. Care 
should be taken about the involvement of Venus in the DBA. 
Any of the DBA planet should be Venus or conjunct or 
aspected by Venus. 

Purchase of Vehicle through Loan 

Due to various factors native takes loan (through banks, 
financial institutions & others) to purchase vehicle. In such 
a case there is involvement of House 6 with the combination 
of purchase of vehicle in DBA. So the complete combination 
of purchase of vehicle through loan 15 4,6,11,12 & Venus. If 
this combination appears in the subsequent DBA of the native, 
astrologer can predict with authority that the vehicle will be 
purchased through loan in the DBA. Vehicle is also purchased 
through the savings of provident funds & insurance and in 
such a case combination of 4,8,11,12 appears in the DBA. 

Gift of Vehicle 

When the combination of 3,4,5,8,10,11 appears in the DBA 
with any of the DBA lord as Venus, native gets vehicle as 
gift or by winning in the lottery. 

Colour of the Vehicle 

The planets of the DBA signify colour of the vehicle at the 

-57- 



time of purchase. Stronger of the DBA planet will indicate 
the colour of the vehicle. However if all are equally strong 
the colour will be mixture of all the colours signified by the 
three DBA planets. 

Table of colours signified by different planets is as under: 



Sun 


White, Red 


Moon 


White 


Mars 


Red 


Mercury 


Green 


Saturn 


Dark Blue, Black 


Jupiter 


Yellow 


Venus 


White, Metallic & prime shades at the time of 




purchase. 


Rahu 


Same as Saturn 


Ketu 


Red, Sandal. 



Luxury Vehicles 

Luxury or big vehicles are purchased when Venus is aspected 
by natural benefic Moon, Mercury or Jupiter. 

Condition of Vehicle 

Vehicle purchased will be old if natural malefic Rahu, Ketu & 
Saturn predominate the DBA planets. If all the DBA planets 
are malefic as discussed above & also signify 6,8,12 the 
vehicle purchased carries various faults which will be difficult 
to locate & rectify. 

On the other hand if natural benefic Sun, Moon, Mercury, 
Jupiter, Venus signify DBA it motivates the native to purchase 
new vehicle. 

Commercial Vehicle 

Commercial Vehicles are purchased in the DBA signifying House 
7 with the combination of purchase of vehicle. Mercury can 
also be any of the DBA lord in this case or aspect or conjunct 
any of the DBA planets. 



58- 



Theft of Vehicle 

Theft of the vehicle takes place in the DBA signifying 
combination 4,6,8,12. In addition to the combinations above 
DBA planets should be natural malefic Saturn, Rahu or Ketu. 
Snatching of the vehicle will take place in DBA of Rahu or 
Ketu & the combination is 4,7,8,12* 

Vehicle is recovered when DBA signifies 2,6,10,11. However 
if the combinations of recovery do not appear at all for a 
quiet a long time after the loss and on the contrary 
combination of 6,8,12 is signified the vehicle is never 
recovered. 

In case of theft/ snatching when the vehicle is not recovered 
and the vehicle is insured the native approaches the insurance 
company for claim. Native is desired to get the claim in the 
DBA signifying 8,11. However if the combination doesn't 
appear in the subsequent DBA the native doesn't get the 
claim from the insurance company. The topic of theft has 
also be taken up in the last chapter "Miscellaneous" which 
can be referred to for further details. 

Sale of Vehicle 

Sale of vehicle is signified by the combination 3,5,10. Since 
5,10 of the native are 4,11 to the opposite party & 3 being 
12 th from the 4 th signifies parting the vehicle by the native. 
Here also the significator planet remain the same i.e. Venus. 
Therefore native sells vehicle in the DBA of Venus signifying 
the combination of 3,5,10. 

If somehow 11 is signified by the DBA with the combination 
of sale of vehicle the native is able to sell the vehicle at 
higher than the market price. On the other hand if same 
combination is signified with 6,8,12 in the DBA the vehicle is 
sold at lower than the market price. 

If both 3,5,10 & 4,11 are signified in the DBA of the native 
there is simultaneous sale & purchase of the vehicle by the 
native.

Balance Dasa of : Sat 11Y 7M 6D 

Dasa Lord Saturn signifies 8,9,12 in the Planet; 2,5 in 
Nakshatra and 7,10,12 in the Sub lord. This signifies that 
Saturn is not strong for purchase since it does not signify 
Houses 4,11. Combination 5,8,12 is evident if Planet and 
Nakshatra are put together. This implies that it is very difficult 



-60 



for the native to arrange money for purchase of shop he 
desires. Bhukti lord Venus signify 11,12 in the Planet, In 
Nakshatra and in Sub lord it signifies 1,3 and 7,10/12 
respectively which are not the Houses of property purchase. 
This implies that native will not be able to purchase the 
particular shop he desires. Cuspal Sub lord of house 4, Jupiter 
signfies 11, 12 Houses indicating that if Dasas will be 
favourable purchase is possible. 

Next Bhukti was of Sun which signifies 4,6,11,12 indicating 
purchase by loan. 3,5,10 in Sun and Saturn also indicate 
sale of some property in order to arrange money to purchase 
this shop. Native was able to purchase the shop in May 
2004 in the DBA of Saturn - Sun - Rahu. Rahu clearly signifies 
4,11,12 Houses. Please note House 7 is also signified in Sun 
and Rahu which implies commercial property.

Next Dasa was of Mercury which signifies 6,8,12 in Sub lord

This is a very ticklish question. For speculative gains 5,11 is 
the combination. 3 House is for paperwork and 3,11 is gain 
in paperwork/communication. 8,11 is combination for huge 
gain. Keeping these combinations in mind we will see this 
Horoscope. Dasa lord is Ketu which signifies 4,5,8,12,11 in 
Planet and Nakshatra and 1,3 in sub lord. Combination of 
5,8,12 signifies total loss hence 11 will not be able to handle 



-73 



it. Conclusion is the Dasa is negative for purchase shop in 
tender. There is no point seeing the Bhukti for predictive 
purpose since Dasa denies however for the benefit of the 
readers I will like to comment that Jupiter was the Bhukti 
lord at the time of question and that signifies 5,8,11 in 
Planet, Nakshatra and Sub lord all, hence positive for 
speculative gains of all types. Jupiter is Cuspal Sub lord of 
4 th House but because Dasa denies event, the event cannot 
happen.

reconstruct the Horoscope. Dasa of Mars was in operation 
which signifies 5 in Planet only and 6,8 in Nakshatra denying 
the change of residence. Next Dasa is of Rahu which signifies 
3,5 in sub lord. Saturn also signifies 3,5 in Planet and Sub 
lord. Native's brother changed residence in Rahu - Rahu - 
Saturn period, August 2002. Venus is Cuspal Sub lord of 4 th 
House signifying change of residence.

Balance Dasa of : Mon 2Y 4M 23D 

Dasa of Mars was in operation when native asked the 
question, Dasa lord Mars signifies 6,12 in Planet and 3,8 in 
Nakshatra or 3,6,8,12 put together implying loss of property. 
Sub lord of Mars signifies 6,12 at one hand and 1,5,9,10 on 
the other hand. 6,12 Houses get support from 6,8,12 from 
Nakshatra and Sub lord. Saving Houses 1,5,9,10 will be 
ineffective henceforth. Next Dasa is of Rahu which signifies 



76- 



6,12 in Nakshatra and the Sub lord is same as that of Mars. 
This also does not give any hope of getting the property 
back. Jupiter Dasa starts from 2029 which signifies 2,6,10,11 
and 4,11. No other Planet in the Horoscope signifies such 
combinations which implies he will never be able to get the 
property back in his life time. Cuspal Sub lord of 4 th House is 
Jupiter but because no other Planet is positive, the positive 
Houses in Jupiter can not help the native for realizing the 
property back.

Dasa was of Rahu when native asked the question. He 
constructed a cottage in Himachal Pradesh which he wanted 
to sell. Rahu signifies 3,6,8,12 which implies he will not be 
able to sell the cottage in the Dasa of Rahu. Next Dasa is of 
Jupiter which also signifies 3,6,8,12. Not a single Planet in 
the Horoscope signifies combination of sale of property hence 
he will never be able to sell the cottage in his lifetime. 
Cuspal Sub lord of 4 th House is Rahu which is extremely bad 
as discussed above-

Dasa lord was Moon at the time of asking the question which 
signifies 2,3,12 in planet and Nakshatra and 8,9,10,12 in the 
Sub lord. Since 8,12 of Sub lord get strength from 12 of 
Nakshatra and Planet the odds are against the native. Bhukti 
of Saturn strongly signifies 3,6, 1 1 , However 6,8, 12 is signified 
if Planet and Nakshatra are put together and here 10 in the 
Planet helps. Mars also signifies 3,11 and 5. It was suggested 
to do out of court settlement in DBA of Moon - Saturn - 
Mars because odds were against the native. Native did out 
of court settlement and got a portion of property. Cuspal 
Sub lord of 4 th House is Ketu which signifies 4 in Nakshatra 
and Sub lord and 3,11 in planet hence suggests native can 
get a portion of property.

Balance Dasa of : Ven OY 6M 24D 

Demolition of property is signified by the combination 4,7,8,12. 
In addition to the combination 4,7,8, 12 any of the DBA Planet 
should be Rahu or Ketu and Sun or Moon signifying government 
authority. 

Dasa lord is Venus which signifies 4,11,12 in the planet 2,3,12 



-84 



in the Nakshatra & 1,2,4,11,12 in the Sub lord. This implies 
due to the presence of 12 House in Planet, Nakshatra and 
Sub lord the demolition is possible however 11 House is also 
present which is the saving factor. Bhukti lord is Ketu which 
signifies 4,6,7,8,10,11,12 in the planet & 2,3,12 in the Sub 
lord whereas Nakshatra signifies Houses 1,2. 4,7,8,12 is 
clearly signified in Ketu implies that demolition is possible in 
the Bhukti of Ketu, 

Antar lord Rahu signifies 4,7,8,12 in the Sub Lord, This implies 
there is strong possibility of demolition. Last Antra in the 
Bhukti of Ketu is Mercury, which is conjunct with Sun, and 
Moon both signifying 4,7,8,12 and saving factors 10,11. 
Mercury itself is not very bad since it signifies 12 in Planet, 
Nakshatra and Sub lord. 

It all concludes that demolition is possible in the DBA of 
Venus - Ketu - Mercury. Since Dasa lord Venus is not very 
bad and is having saving Houses 11 signified in it the demolition 
would be partial. 

Cuspal Sub lord of the House 4 is Saturn which signifies 
4,7,8,12 Houses and also Houses 10,11. 

The demolition of the property took place on the 21 st February 
2000. Saturn, Jupiter and Mars aspect the House 4 on the 
day and Ketu Venus were in exact conjunction in the House 
7 on the day.

Dasa lord Jupiter signifies house 4 & 6 which signifies 
purchase of property on loan. Bhukti of Venus doesn't signify 
4,11,12 hence purchase of property was not possible in the 
Bhukti. Next Bhukti was of Sun which signifies 4,11,6 therefore 
purchase of property was possible in Bhukti. Native purchased 
property in the Antar of Mars in the Bhukti of Sun. Since 
Dasa Bhukti and Antar planets are natural benefic the 
location of property was good. Sun also signifies government 
therefore property will be purchased from govt, authority/ 
scheme on loan of because of the involvement of 6 th House. 
It is strange that House 12 is not signified in the DBA Planets. 
Native purchased property in October 2000 in the aforesaid 
DBA. Cuspal Sub lord of 4 th House is Mars, which is natural 
significator as well as signifying House 4 in this Horoscope.

In this type of question it is desirable to see the comfort 
and success the native desires. As the native is not able to 
decide the place she should live in future astrologer should 
compare the two Horoscopes from the two seeds given by 
the native for the given two places and take decision 
accordingly. 

In case of seed for Madrid Dasa lord Venus is signifying 
3,9,12; 2,4,11; 7,11; 3,11 combinations. All other Planets 
also signify same combinations which implies that the native 
shall be able to afford property in Madrid, she will be able 
travel, study further, will be able to write books etc. and will 
be comfortable in life. 

In case of seed for living in any distant Village Dasa Lord 
Venus signifies 7,8,12; 3,10; 3,12 combinations. Rahu and 
Moon signify single 8 in Sub lord which is dangerous. Ketu is 
also not comfortable as it signifies 8 in Planet, Nakshatra 
and Sub lord. Other Planets are good as they signify 3,10; 
3,9,12; 5,10 combinations. House 1 is also repeated in many 
Planets. This implies that the native will travel long distances 
for tourism, gaining knowledge and pilgrimage but also face 
difficulties. House 1 signifies that the native will feel lonely 
also. 

Comparing the Horoscope for Madrid with Village astrologer 
should keep the facts in front of the native and let the 
native take decision.

motherland, long journeys. 

House 7; signifies changing the course of journey. 

Combinations, Timing, Conditions & Place of Travel 

If 3,9,12 are signified in DBA planets of separatives viz. 
Saturn, Rahu, Ketu & Sun, Native travels abroad.

"Transits". The planets of DBA reveal the general standard 
of the place visited. If natural benefic Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, 
Sun, Moon are signified in DBA the native visits or settles in 
developed country. On the other hand if DBA planets are 
natural malefic Saturn, Rahu or Ketu he visits underdeveloped 
place / country. If DBA planets are both natural malefic & 
benefic developing place / nation is signified,

his motherland at scheduled time like sickness, changing the 
course of the journey, extension of stay, death, litigation 
etc.

the subsequent DBA the native is cured & will come back to

At the time of asking the question Dasa of Saturn was running* 
Saturn signifies 2,11,12; 5,12; 2,4,7 in Planet, Nakshatra 
and Sub lord respectively. House 12 is repeated in Planet 
and Nakshatra but because 2,4 is signified in Sub lord and 
2,11 signified in Planet in a very strong Bhukti native can go 
abroad* Jupiter Bhukti at the time of asking the question 
signifies 3,9,10; 1,3,4,6,8/9,10; 2,4,7 in Planet, Nakshatra 
and Sub lord respectively, Jupiter Bhukti is positive for Travel 
abroad but Sub lord suggests the travel will be for short 
time and the native will come back shortly. 

Antar lord is Sun which signifies 5,6;2,4,7; 1,3,4,6,8,9,10 in 
Planet, Nakshatra and Sub lord respectively. 3,9 is signified

in Sub lord. Nakshatra doesn't support travel which implies 
that Sun is weak for travel. Next Antar is of Moon which 
signifies 3,9,10 in Sub lord. Nakshatra and Planet signify 12 
hence Moon is strong for travel. 

Native traveled in the DBA of Saturn - Jupiter - Moon to 
Europe and came back shortly.

Native had booked the package tour to Srinagar from 3 rd 
June 2006 to 7 th June 2006 in May 2006. Unfortunately there 
had been two bomb blasts in the last week of May 2006 
therefore native had to give a second thought for the travel. 

Dasa Bhukti antar of Saturn -Jupiter- Rahu was in operation 
at the time of travel which does not signify any accident or 
mishap rather it signifies 5,11 in all the Planets traces of 8 
and 12 Houses are also there which here signify fear only. 
Native went to Srinagar and neither bomb blast nor mishap 
occurred during the travel.

CHAPTER -6 

CAREER AND FINANCIAL 
PROSPECTS 

It is the desire of every person to have a successful career 
once he has taken plunge into it at a particular age after 
finishing his studies. The pursuit of service or business as a 
career depends upon the family background, the education 
& other factors. Compelled by circumstances to earn a 
livelihood & support his family a person starts his career 
even though he has not finished his education. 

In astrology whether a person will pursue service or business 
can be explained by the following combinations: 

For service 2,6,10,11 

For business 2,7,10,11 since these houses signify as under: 

Houses 

House 2 : accumulation of wealth, money & bank 
accounts. 

House 10 : is the prime house of career, name &fame. 

House 11 : is the prime house of financial gain, increments 
& promotion. 

House 6 : is the prime house for service & working 
conditions. 

House 7 : is prime house of business, business partners, 
trade & commerce. 

Therefore when House 6 connects 2,10,11 native joins a job 
whereas when 7 House is signified he joins business. Care 
should be taken while dealing with House 6 & 7 House since 
both are complementary houses. 

First & foremost question a native is likely to ask from an 
astrologer is as to when will he get a job & whether in the 

-100- 



Government or Private sector? Native will get a job in the 
DBA planets signifying the combination 2,6,10,11. This 
combination may not appear fully in some horoscopes but 
may figure in a discontinued manner like 2,6 or 6,10 or 2,6,10 
or 10,11 or 6, 11 or 2,10,11 or 6,10,11, The more number of 
times this combination is repeated the more it reflects the 
higher the native is going to enjoy in his career. If Sun or 
Moon are one of the DBA planets native gets a Government 
job. However if Jupiter or Mercury are predominant in the 
DBA planet native joins a private job. 

Out of 2,6,10,11 if 6,11 or 10,11 or 2,11 or 2,6,10 or 2,10 
are signified in the DBA, these are good for career in 
descending order. However if 2,6 is signified in the Dasa in 
the Nakshatra or the Sub lord the position becomes doubtful. 
If Bhukti signifies 10,11 or 6,11 or 2,11 or 6,10 then there is 
a gain but if 5,8,12 or 8,12 are signified there is loss of 
money or reversals in the career. 

No job or obstacles in career 

It is a common experience people don't get job after a lot 
of hard work put in for searching the job even after good 
education & experience. Astrologically houses involved in 
preventing a job or obstacles in career are: 

Houses 

House 5: This may surprise many astrologers as to why & 
how House 5 good in all respects prevents a job or signifies 
loss in the career. House 5 being 12 th from the 6 th the prime 
house service or service conditions signifies loss of inclination 
in the work. It is also 11 th House of the competitor or the 
opposite party. When it conjoins with any of the 8,12 houses 
puts a real dent on the career or if the native is not having 
a job it prevents the job. 

House 8: It is the prime house of obstacles, misfortunes & 
insults 

House 12: This house signifies losses. 

Combinations & Timing 

-101- 



5,8,12: This combination is worst for the Career & financial 
prospects in the business as well in the job. It signifies 
suspensions, dismissals, scandal, insults & heavy loss of 
money. If the good houses 10,11 are not signified in the DBA 
with this combination it signifies "Total loss" If the native is 
without the job or work he/she can not get in its DBA. All 
this is also because 

House 5 is 11 th of the opposition. 

House 12 is 6 th of the opposition. 

House 8 is the 2 nd of the opposition. Therefore it is the 
opposition, which gains in all the circumstances. 

6,8,12: House 6 is prime house of work & work place. 
When it conjoins 8,12 it signifies loss & obstacles 
in the work place, hindrances & problems in 
accomplishing the work. This combination is not 
as bad as the above combination since there is 
not much gain to the opposition. 

Interviews & Written Tests 

After the basic educational qualification there is a written 
test followed by "Group discussion" & Interviews. For success 
in the written test combinations of 6,11 or 10,11 or 4,9,11 
or 5,11 or 4,11 should be signified in DBA (in the descending 
order) planets during the written test . 

For success in interview & group discussion the DBA planets 
should signify the combinations 3,6,11 or 3,10,11 or 3,11. 

Change in Job/Business 

The next step in the career is the change in job or business. 
The Houses involved in change in job or business areas 
follows: 

Houses 

House 5: Being 12 c]1 from the House 6 it signifies leaving the 
present work & working conditions. 



102 



House 9: Being 12 th from the House 10 it signifies leaving 
the present status or position. 

Planets 

All the separative planets viz. Sun, Rahu, Ketu, Saturn 
promote separation from the present conditions. 

Combination & Timing the Change of Job 

When 5,9 houses are signified in the DBA of separative 
planets person leaves the present job. 

Nature of the Next Job/Business 

The other aspect the native considers whether this change 
in the career is with good prospects or not? If subsequent 
DBA signifies 2,6,10,11 or 2,7,10,11 then the change is for 
good but if 8,12 are signified the change is for bad or there 
is going to be downward trend in the carrier subsequently. 
One more thing if the present DBA signifying 5,9 also signify 
2,6,10,11 or 2,7,10,11 then the change is with the promotion. 
However, if 5,9 is only signified in the DBA the change is to 
the same status. 

Change From Job to Business 

Another aspect considered here is change to Business from 
Service. If the DBA in Horary Horoscope signifies good Houses 
of career native should leave the job and join the business 
he/she intends to. However, if bad combinations 5,8,12 are 
appearing he/she should continue the job. 

Now I will discuss circumstances which are peculiar to career: 

Break in Career 

If the combination of 5,8,12 is signified in the DBA of 
separative planets clearly then the native has to suffer a 
tremendous loss in the career. For a businessman it is the 
time for the closure of the establishment or the unit. Natives 
who are in service are forced to leave the job. 



103- 



Suspension 

Native gets suspension orders when the combination of 5,8,12 
is signified with 2,6,10 in the DBA of separative planets. The 
native loses his job if combination of 5,8,12 is signified in 
the subsequent DBA. "Transits" of planets signifying 
combinations 5,8,12 in the same Houses/ Nakshatras will 
result the loss of job finally. Native is reinstated if the 
combination of 2,6,1041 is signified in the subsequent DBA. 

Promotions 

Native gets out of turn promotion & high ups when 
combination of 2,6,10,11 is signified in the DBA planets.. 
Multiple promotions are sought in the DBA of Mercury. Regular 
promotion is sought even when 2,6,10,11 Houses appear 
scattered in the DBA planets. 

Transfer 

When 3,9,12 is signified in the DBA the person gets transfer 
orders. If the DBA is of seperative planets native has to 
leave the native place & is transferred to a distant place. If 
the DBA planets are natural malefic predominantly he is 
transferred to underdeveloped country / place. On the other 
hand if DBA is of the natural benefic he is transferred to 
developed place or developed country or prime city. 

Partnership 

It is a common question people normally ask as to whether I 
should do partnerships or not? The partner will cheat if 
combination of 5,7,12 appears in DBA in Horary Horoscope. 

Getting Lost Property or Money 

In case native has lent money to someone or has lost money 
or an item then 5,8,12 in following DBA signifies loosing it 
and when in the following DBA 2,6,10,11 is signified native 
gets the money or item back. If both the combination appear 
in the DBA native realizes part of the money.

Dasa lord Jupiter signified 9, 10 in the Planet & Nakshatra & 
2,6,10,11 in the sub lord, Jupiter is fairly good for business. 
Bhukti lord Venus signifies 5,12 in the Sub lord. Since Bhukti 
lord is negative and Dasa - Bhukti - Antar lord are natural 
benefics it implies that the business requires money or more 



105 



investment & better infrastructure, Cuspal Sub lord of 7 th 
house is Rahu is also positive to a large extent. 

Next Bhukti is of Sun which signifies 2,6,10,11' Therefore 
the business will be roaring in the Bhukti of Sun. Most of the 
planets signify 2,6,10,11 therefore the planet will excel. 3,9,12 
are also signified in most of the planets which implies that 
dealing with foreign countries will also be fruitful. 

Jupiter Dasa is nearing the end now in 2006 and the native 
has excelled in business by now.

Promotion is signified by the combination 2,6,10,11 which is 
signified by Dasa lord Rahu in Planet Nakshatra & Sublord. 
Whereas in the other hand 5,8,12 is also signified in Planet 
Nakshatra & Sub lord which implies total loss or termination 
from the job. In such case an excellent Bhukti signifying 
2,6,10,11 is required for promotion. Present Bhukti of Mercury 
signifies 3,4,6; 1,5,8; 6 in Planet, Nakshatra and sub lord. 
Hence Mercury is adverse for profession. Antra of Moon was 
running at the time of asking the question signifying 5,8,12 
in Sub lord however 10,11 is alo signified. Sub lord is supported 
by 5,8 in nakshatra This concludes that it is possible that 
he may face some setback in job rather than promotion. 

Native got suspended from the job after few days.

Profit in business is signified by combination of 2,6,10,11. 
Since DBA Rahu - Mer - Rah signifies 5,8,12; 6,8,12; 7,8,12 
in the Planet Nakshatra & Sublord there will be total loss and 
bickerings. % ll' in the Sub lord of Rahu only signifies hope of 
profit. Combination of 3,8,12 fs also signified in Rahu signifying 
forgery and 6,8,12 suggesting loss in litigations. 

A close look also suggests that combination of 2,3,8,12 is 
also there in Mercury which implies arrest and combination 
of 3,4,8,12 in Rahu signifies going underground. Similar 
combinations are also present in Ketu, Sun, Moon, Mars, 
Jupiter and Saturn.

This question can be taken into the category of a "Mook 
Prasna" or a question which native does not reveal. This 
question was asked by native in "Diwali Mela" in Paschim 
Vihar, New Delhi. The native was told that you will suffer 
tremendous loss in deal. He was not satisfied and said that 
it is not possible. He was further told that it is possible that 
you may have to go underground after the cheating will be 
unearthed and this is our final answer. Listening to that to 
our surprise he confirmed that our reading is correct which 
cannot be shared in the book.

Native of Illustration - 3 brought the native to us. DBA of 
Mercury - Rahu - Saturn was running at the time of asking 
the question. All the three planets signify 2,6,10,11 Houses 
which states that the native will be benefitted in the deal. 
This question was asked at Deepawali Mela. After the na- 
tive had asked the question we used to request him to 
come after some time so that we are able to calculate the 
answer of the question. One of my student was calculated 
the answer to be positive he shared the answer with me. 
Native of illustration - 3 was hearing the discussion be- 
tween us and objected that the answer can not be positive 
as this person and he were the partners in the same deal. 
This comment of the native of illustration - 3 clearly un- 
folded the truth that it is his partner who has cheated him in 
the deal and reaped all the benefits of the deal.

Success in interview is assured in the DBA of combinations 
3,6,11; 3,11; 3,10,11- 

Dasa lord Mars signifies 3,6,11 in the planet; 3,6,10,11 in 
Nakshatra and supporting Houses in the Sublord viz, 7,9,10. 
Bhukti lord Mercury signifies 3,6,11 in the Nakshatra, 4,5 
supporting house in the Sublord & 12 house of setback. 

Antar lord, Rahu also signifies 3,6,10,11 in the Sublord & 
other supporting Houses. Therefore the Native will be 
successful in the interview. It is worth noting that nearly all 
the planets are favourable in the Horary Horoscope and will 
help in transits too. Cuspal Sub lord of the 3 rd house is 
Venus which is neither positive nor negative. In such case 
Cuspal Sub lord of 11 th House should be seen for success 
and that is Rahu which is extremely positive assuring success.

To getthe money back 2,6,10,11 combination should appear 
in DBA and if you won't get money combination 5,8,12 should 
appear. Cuspal Sub lord of ll tf1 House is Saturn which is bad 
since it signifies 6,8 in Nakshatra. Here 11,12 signified in 
Sub lord become very weak for realization of money, Dasa 
Lord Rahu is extremely positive and Bhukti Lord Jupiter is 
also good as it does not signify any of 6,8,12 Houses. Antar 
of Venus is also good, The friend asked the money for 3 
months and after the three months Antra of Moon will be in 
operation. Moon is also good as it does not signify any of 
6,8,12 Houses rather it signifies 2,7,10 Houses. Conclusion 
is because of 5,9 Houses present in Bhukti and Antar native 
will give money and friend may ask for extension of time 
period of part of money as Cuspal Sub lord of 11 th House is 
weak and rest of the Money will be received in Rahu Antar

DBA of Saturn - Venus - Venus was in operation at the time 
of asking the question. Cuspal Sub lord is Venus which is 
bad as it signifies 6,8,12 in Planet and Nakshatra put together, 
however 10 in Nakshatra gives little relief. Saturn is ordinary. 
Although it does not signify 6,8,12 Houses it also does not 
signify 10,11 Houses. Next Antra is of Sun which signifies 
6,12 in Sub which hence negative for getting job. Moon and 
Mars signify 6,12 and 6,8 respectively hence getting job in 
these Antras is not possible. Next Antar of Rahu signifies 
2,6,7,8,10,11. In planet and Nakshatra and 7,8,11 in $ub 
lord. Hence getting job in Rahu is sure but since Cuspal Sub 
lord, and Bhukti are not good native will get a job less than 
the status.

For settlement in favour 2,6,10,11 should appear and for 
settlement against 5,8,12 should appear in DBA. Dasa - 
Bhukti of Jupiter - Rahu is in operation hence the settlement 
will be against the native. The partners will not agree at all 
to the terms and conditions put forth by the native. Antar 
Lord Mars is positive but since Dasa and Bhukti lords are bad 
it will not be able to help. Settlement in the next Dasa,

adverse or neutral hence even in the Dasa of Ketu also 
which will run up to 2023 it is difficult for the native to rise

the sale of their product. For successful campaign or 
advertisement 3,11; 3,6,11; 3/10,11 should appear in DBA. 
For unsuccessful one 3,6,8 or 3,8,12 should appear in DBA. 
Dasa of Ketu signify 1,3,8/9,10 in Planet and Nakshatra and 
3,9,10 in Sub lord hence is positive. Bhukti lord Mercury on 
the other hand signifies 3,6,8 in Planet and Nakshtra and 
3,6,8,9,10 in Sub lord hence is negative. Antar Lord is Ketu 
and next Antar is of Venus up to December Is also as good 
as Ketu. Hence the campaign will give mixed results. Cuspal 
Sub lord of 3 rd House is Mercury and that of 11 th House is 
Venus which also suggests mixed results or medium success.

Jeera is a commodity which native had purchased for stock 
and he wanted to sell for maximum profit. We know unlike 
shares Jeera is an eatable and has short life for stocking 
therefore we will have to find nearest time to sell hence 
Dasa is not required to be seen if years of Dasa are balance- 
Saturn Bhukti and Venus Antra was in operation. Venus 



137 



signifies 2,5,12; 1,4; 3 in Planet, Nakshatra and Sub lord, 
hence is not good* Next Antra of Sun is even more bad as it 
signifies 5,8,12. Moon's Antra would start from 6* November 
and is extremely good as it signifies 2,11 in planet and 8, 9,11 
in Sub lord. He can sell in Moon if he can wait for 2 months 
or otherwise he should sell when Moon aspects 11 th House in 
the Antra of Venus. In this Horoscope Bhukti of Saturn also 
had to run for long therefore Saturn is also not required to 
be seen.

Jupiter Dasa is in operation at the time of asking the question, 
which signifies 3,6,9; 4,5,8; 1,8,11 in the Planet, Nakshatra 
and Sub lord. 5,9 signifies change 6; 5,8 and 8 in Planet 
Nakshatra and Sub lord signifies suspensions and terminations 
from job. Venus Bhukti is in operation, which is excellent as 
it signifies 6,10,11 and 8,10,11. Sun signifies combination 
10,11 and 5,8,12- Moon signifies 6 in Nakshatra and 8,11 in 
Sub lord hence will give mix results. Mars signifies 10; 11 in 
Planet and Nakshatra and 12;6 in Nakshatra and Sub lord. 
Rahu is good as it signifies 8,10,11. Mercury will also give 
mix results because it signifies 6,8,12 in Planet, Nakshatra 
and Sub lord and 11 in Planet and Nakshatra. Nearly all the 
Planets signify combination 8,11 or 8,10 implies he will have 
to survive on others wealth. This concludes that because 
Dasa lord Jupiter and many other planets signify suspensions, 
change and termination from job and some Planets are good 
native will have to face these problems but will get the jobs 
again whenever he will have to leave the job. The Natal 
Horoscope of the native below supports the Horary 
Horoscope. In Natal Horoscope Ketu, Rahu, Saturn and Jupiter 
signify 5,8,12 and whenever they appear in Bhukti or Antra 
native will have to leave the job.

CHAPTER - 7 

MARRIAGE AND 
RELATIONSHIPS 



Marriage is association of two persons of opposite sex to 
live together & bring up a family. In India & other Asian 
countries today marriage is sacrosanct and is treated as 
fusion or coming together of two families of husband & wife 
respectively through this institution of marriage. 

However in the western countries it is an association of two 
persons to live together with or without getting married 
formally. 

Marriage being sacrosanct in Asian countries the customs, 
traditions the authorities & the courts have a tendency to 
discourage separation or divorce in spite of the fact that 
the two individuals do not have compatibility. 

Houses 

The Houses involved in marriage are: 

House 7 : The prime house of marriage / partner / spouse. 

House 2 : The prime house of family, 

House 11: Gain of life partner / spouse / family. It also 
signifies fulfillment of desires. 

Combination & Timing of Marriage 

Marriage of native takes place in the DBA of the planets 
signifying the combination 2,7,11. 

Planet 

Venus is the natural significator of marriage. Marriage of a 
native can take place without the involvement of Venus in 
the DBA unlike the other cases of property purchase, vehicle 
purchase etc. But Venus is capable of promising marriage in 

-142- 



its DBA even if it doesn't signify the combination of marriage 
i.e. 2,7,11 

Love Affairs & Sexual Relationships 

Houses 

Houses involved in love affairs & sexual relationships are: 

House 5: House of love. 

House 12: It signifies bed pleasure. 

House 8: It signifies external sexual organs. However it 
also signifies tensions, obstacles, insults etc. 

House 11: Fulfillment of desires. 

House 7: In addition to main house of marriage & sexual 
organs it is the main house of trade & commerce. 

Combinations & Timing 

If 5,11 is signified in the DBA of the native, the native falls 
in love without any physical relationship. 

If 5,12; 5/8 is signified in the DBA of the native, the love 
affair involves physical relations or bed pleasures. 

However if 5,8,12 is signified in the DBA of the native, then 
it is an open & scandalous love affair involving humiliation, 
insults & tensions to the native. The combination of 5,6,8,12 
in DBA signifies termination of affair in that DBA. 

If House 4 is signified with 5,11 or 5,12; 5,8 native has 
hidden love affair However if 4 is connected with 5,8,12 
the love affair is hidden initially and after that it opens up in 
front of public. 

Nature of Planets 

Nature of planets in the DBA signify the type of person with 
whom the native will be having the affair/ sex. 

Sun : Native will have affair / with the boss or high 
government official or any superior. 

-143- 



Moon : Same as that of Sun but the person will be very 
beautiful. 

Mars : With a soldier, policeman etc., or barren lady. 

Rahu : With lower class, much older in age or outcast or 
eunuch. 

Jupiter : With the respected person / teacher / preacher. 

Saturn : With lower class, much older in age or outcast. 

Mercury : With much younger in age or student. The native 
will have multiple affairs. 

Ketu : With diseased, deformed, outcast, different religion, 
eunuch. 

Venus : Very beautiful / handsome, sophisticated person. 

The natural significance of planets also work in similar manner 
at the time of marriage & can be applied by an astrologer on 
horoscopes with success. 

Love Marriage: If the native is continuously having a 
combination of 5,8; 5,12 or 5,8,12 & subsequently 
combination 2,7,11 appears in DBA native will marry the 
person he/she loves. 

Marriage in known circle : If 3* house gets connected 
with 2,7,11 in DBA planets the marriage is culminated in 
known circle. Since 3rd house signifies neighbours & relations. 

Marriage in Foreign Land or with Foreigner: If 3,9,12 is 
connected with 2,7,11 the native is likely to marry abroad 
or with a foreigner. 

Dowry : When 8,11 is signified with 2,7,11 in DBA planets 
during marriage, native gets dowry during marriage. If the 
combination of property or vehicle gets connected with dowry 
& marriage in the DBA it results into gain of property or 
vehicle by way of dowry. 



144 



Divorce: Divorce under Indian law means annulment of 
marriage & thereafter the unmarried state is restored to the 
native who is free to remarry. 

Houses 

House 1: Being 12 th from the 2 rd House, family. 

House 6: Being 12 th from the 7* House, marriage. 

House 10: Being 12°? from the 11 th , gain in marriage. 10 th 
House also signifies the competent authority 
from which native will seek divorce. 

Planets 

Separative and natural malefic planets Rahu, Ketu & Saturn 
promote Divorce. 

Combination & Timing of Divorce 

The combination of 1,6,10 in the DBA of separative planets 
conveys disharmony & separations in the marital home. 
Further if combination 1,6,10 is repeated in the subsequent 
DBA the couple gets a divorce from the courts or the 
competent authority. However, if in subsequent DBA 
combination of 2,7,11 reappears then reconciliation takes 
place. 

Marriage Proposals & Breaking of Engagements 

Marriage is preceded by various proposals for marriage. 
Proposals of marriages come when 2,7,11 are scattered in 
the DBA. When DBA clearly signifies 2,7,11 engagement of 
the native takes place. If along with 2,7,11; 1,6,10 & 6,8,12 
are signified in subsequent DBA of separative planets the 
engagement breaks. 

Horoscope Matching (Kundali Milan) 

If the Horoscope of potential son in law for the daughter or 
potential daughter in law for son is available Astrologer should 
rely on the Horoscopes and match the Horoscopes as advised 
in the book "Marriage and Relationship" - Umang Taneja. 
If the Horoscopes of potential son in law for the daughter 

-14S- 



or potential daughter in law for son is not available Astrologer 
can use the Horary Astrology to know whether the marriage 
with potential son in law or daughter in law will be successful 
or not. 

Also if there are more than one prospective son in law or 
daughter in law, Astrologer can take different Horary numbers 
and conclude by comparing the Horoscopes so cast and tell 
the result arrived at. 

No Marriage : if combination of 1,6,10 appears more 
profoundly in maximum Planets native will not marry 
throughout life. Cuspal Sub lord of 7 House should also be 
signifying 1,6,10 in such cases. 

Remarriage : Remarriage in Horary Horoscope has to be 
seen as the marriage is seen as he/ she has to marry whether 
it is second marriage or third marriage and so on.

Cuspal lord of 7 th house is Rahu which signifies 
1,6,10,2,4,5,9,11 houses. Since houses of combination of 



150 



marriage are signified the native will get married. At the time 
of asking the question Dasa of Rahu was in operation. Rahu 
is stronger for separation and no marriage rather than 
marriage. Bhukti Lord Moon at the time of asking the question 
Moon also signifies same Houses hence marriage in Moon is 
difficult. Next Bhukti is of Mars which signifies 7,11,12 in 
Nakshatra and Sub lord hence Mars is very positive for 
marriage. Jupiter and Mercury are also very positive in the 
Horoscope. Marriage of the Native was finalized in March 
2000 in the DBA of Rahu - Mars - Jupiter.

When the native asks such a question astrologer should ask 
the relation with the person as to whether he/she is a 
colleague or associate or a friend and should revolve the 
House and make it ascendant. In this case the boy did not 
have relation with the girl and both use to see other at bus 
stop from where they use to catch the bus for their 
destinations. In this case the question should be attempted 
from the ascendant itself. Cuspal Sub lord of 5 th House is 
Moon which signifies 4,5,8,1 1 which implies love. DBA at the 
time of asking question was Mercury - Rahu - Jupiter. Rahu 
and Jupiter both signify complete combination of love. 
Mercury also signifies 12,9,11 hence the boy loves the girl.

Dasa of Saturn was in operation at the time of asking the 
question which signifies 6,7,10; 11,12; 3,10,12 In Planet, 
Nakshatra and Sub lord respectively. This implies since Sub 
lord signifies 10 and Nakshatra 11, Saturn is weak for marriage 
and strong Bhukti and Antarare required for marriage of the 
daughter. Bhukti of Moon signifies 11,12; 6,7,10; 11,12 in 
Planet, Nakshatra and Sub lord respectively. Hence Moon Is 
stronger for marriage and now we require a good Antra for 
fructification of event. Rahu is the Antar Lord which is 
extremely positive since it signifies 2,4,5,8,9,10,11 in Planet 
and Nakshatra and 5,8,11 in Sub lord. The daughter got 
engaged within days of asking the question. Cuspal Sub lord 
of House 7 is Ketu which is extremely positive for marriage In 
the Horoscope.

In case native asks such a question astrologer should take 
two seeds one by one for both the prospective son in laws 
and re - erect the Horoscopes with 7 th House as Ascendant. 
In the first case for Mr. X seed 178 in the Dasa Bhukti of 
Sun Venus, Sun signifies 6,10,11 in Nakshatra and 8,9,12 in 
Sub tord rendering Sun extremely weak for marriage. Venus 
also signifies 6,10,11 in Nakshatra and 5,9,12 in Sub lord 
and Planet, Venus is positive. Cursory look on other Planets 
describes that the other Planets are not good for marriage. 
Cuspal Sub lord of 7 th House is Venus. 

For the other seed 125 for Mr. Y Sun signifies 2,11 in sub 
lord and is much more positive than the Horoscope above. 
Even Venus signifies 2,7,11 in Sub lord which suggests the 



171-

positive and the Cuspal Sub lord of 7 th House is also Mercury. 
The daugter's marriage was finalized with this boy in a month.

This is a question of a sister who has two brothers and both 
are younger to her. This is question regarding the younger 
one that was nearly 32 years of age at the time of asking 
the question. It was a sole question the sister had and while 
going through the natal Horoscope it was found that her 
brother would remain unmarried throughout the life. Before 
giving such heart breaking prediction an astrologer should 
confirm the Horoscope is correct or not. Past life events 
were matched and the Horoscope was found correct. To be 
doubly sure Horary Horoscope was also referred to after 
taking seed from the sister. Dasa of Ketu was in operation 
at the time of asking the question. Ketu denies marriage as 
it signifies 1,10 in Nakshatra and 6 in Sub lord. Next Dasa 



-173 



lord and Cuspal Sub lord Venus also weak for marriage. Ketu, 
Sun, Moon and Jupiter in the Horoscope deny marriage. Only 
Rahu is positive in the Horoscope which concludes the native 
will never get married in life time. His Natal Horoscope is 
given below.
