CHAPTER XLIX. 
A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE ERAS, 


TE eras serve to fix certain moments of time which are Page 203. 
mentioned in some historical or astronomical connection. Beet ine 
The Hindus do not consider it wearisome to reckon with of fhe 5° 
huge numbers, but rather enjoy it. Still, in practical “™ 

use, they are compelled to replace them by smaller 

(more handy) ones. 

Of their eras we mention— 

1. The beginning of the existence of Brahman. 

2. The beginning of the day of the present nychthe- 
meron of Brahman, ic. the beginning of the kalpa. 

3. The beginning of the seventh manvantara, in 
which we are now. 

4. The beginning of the twenty-eighth caturyuga, in 
which we are now. 

5. The beginning of the fourth yuga of the present 
caturyuga, called kalikdla, i.e. the time of Kali. The 
whole yuga is called after him, though, accurately 
speaking, Ais time falls only in the last part of the 
yuga. Notwithstanding, the Hindus mean by saliidla 
the beginning of the aliyuga. 

6. Pandava-kdla, ie. the time of the life and the wars 
of Bharata. 

All these eras vie with each other in antiquity, the

one going back toa still more remote beginning than 
the other, and the sums of years which they afford go 
beyond hundreds, thonsands, and higher orders of num- 
bers. Therefore not only astronomers, but also other 
people, think it wearisome and unpractical to use them. 

Tn order to give an idea of these eras, we shal] use 
as a first gauge or point of comparigon that Hindu 
year the great bulk of which coincides with the year 
400 of Yazdayird. This nomber consists only of hun- — 
dreds, not of units and tens, and hy this peculiarity 

_ it is distinguished from all other years that might 
possibly be chosen. Besides, it is a memorable time ; 
for the breaking of the strongest pillar of the religion, 
the decease of the pattern of a prince, Mahmfid, the 
lion of the world, the wonder of his time—mey Ged 
have mercy upon him !—took place only e short time, 
less than a year, before it. The Hindu year precedes 
the Neuréz or new year’s day of this year only by — 
twelve daye, and the death of the prince occurred pre- 
cisely ten complete Persian months before it. 

Now, presupposing this our gauge as known, we shall 
compute the years for this point of junction, which is 
the beginning of the corresponding Hindu year, for the 
end of all years which come into question coincides 
with it, and the Neuréz of the year 400 of Yazdajird 
falls only « little latter (viz. twelve days). 

The book Vishnu-Dharma says: “ Vajra asked Mar. 


S tpran ” kendeys how much of the life of Brahman had elapsed ; 


Brabman 
has 


sconteg io Whereupon the sage answered : ‘ That which has elapsed 
the Fiskgu- ; . ° 
Daarna.” 38 8 years, 5 months, 4 days, 6 manvantaras, 7 samndhi, 


27 caturyugas, and 3 yugas of the twenty-eighth catur- 
yuga, and 10 divya-years up to the time of the afvamedha 
which thon hast offered.” He who knows the details of 
this statement and comprehends them duly is a sage 
man, and the sage is he who serves the ouly Lord and 
strives to reach the neighbourhood of his place, which is 
called Paramapada.” 


. CHAPTER XLIX. 3 


Presupposing this statement to be known, and refer- 
ring'the reader to our explanation of the various mea- 
aures of time which we have given in former chapters, 
we offer the following analysis. 
Of the life of Brahman there have elapsed before our 
gange 26,215,732,048,132 of our years, Of the nych- 
themeron of Brahman, 2. of the kalpa of the day, there 
have elapsed 1,972,948,132, aud of the seventh manvan- 
tara 120,5 32,132. 
The latter is also the date of the imprisoning of the 
King Bali, for it happened in the first caturyuga of the 
seventh manvantara. 
Ta all chronological dates which we have mentioned 
already and shall still mention, we only reckon with 
complete years, for the Hindus are in the habit of dis- 
regarding fractions of a year. 
Farther, the Vishnu-Dharma says: “Markandeya tho time ot 
says, in answer to a question of Vajra, ‘I have already coning to 
lived as long as 6 kalpas and 6 manvantaras of the pinot. 
seventh kalpa, 23 tretdyugas of the seventh manvantara. 
In the twenty-fourth tretdyuga Rama killed Ravana, 
and Lakshmana, the brother of Rama, killed Kumbha- 
karna, the brother of Ravana. The two subjugated all 
the Rakshasas. At that time VAlmiki, the Rishi, com- 
posed the story of Rima and Ramayana and eternalised 
it in his books. It was I who told it to Yudhishthira, 
the son of Pandan, in the forest of Kimyakavana.’” 
The author of the Vishnu-Dharma reckons here with 
tretdyugas, first, because the events which he mentions 
ocenrred in a certain éretdyuya, and secondly, because it 
_ is more convenient to reckon wita a simple unit than 
‘with such a unit as requires to be explained by reference 
to its single quarters. Besides, the latter part of the 
: ‘tretdyuga is a more suitable time for the events men- 

tioned than its beginning, because it is so much nearer 
_ to the age of evil-doing (v. i, pp. 379, 380). No doubt, 

the date of Raima and Ramayana is known among the 


4 ALBERUNI'S INDIA. 


Hindus, but I for my part have not been able to ascer- 
tain it, aa: 
Twenty-three caturyugas ate 99,360,000 years, 
and, together with the time from the beginning of a 
caturyuga till the end of the tretdyuga, 102,384,000 

years. : 
If we subtract this number of years from the number 
of years of the seventh manvaniara that have elapsed 
before our gauge-year, Viz. 120,532,132 (v. p. 3), we get 
the remainder of 18,148,132 years, ze,80 many years 
before our gauge-year as the conjectural date of Rima; 
and this may suffice, as long as it is not supported 
by a truatworthy tradition. The here-mentioned year 
corresponds to the 3,892,132d year of the 28th catur- 

yuga, 

How much All these compntations rest on the measures adopted 
eats by Brahmagupte. He and Pulisa agree in this, that 
| sat "* the number of kalpas which have elapsed of the life of 
coriimgto Brahman before the present kalpa is 6068 (equal to 8 
Buhne years, § months, 4 days of Brahman). But they differ 
sts from cach other in converting this number into catur- 
yugas, According to Pulisa, it is eqnal to 6,116,544 ; 
according to Brahmagupta, only to 6,068,000 catur- 
yugas, Therefore, if we adopt the system of Pulisa, 
reckoning 1 manvantara as 72 caturyugas without 
samdhi, 1 kalpa as 1008 caturyugas, and each yuga as 
the fourth part of a caturyuga, that which has elapsed 
of the life of Brahman before our gauge-year is the 
sum of 26,425,456,204,132 (!) years, and of the kalpa 
Page 203. there have elapsed 1,986,124,132 years, of the manvan- 
tara 119,884,132 years, and of the caturyuga 3,244,132 
years, 
Bow much § Regarding the time which has elapsed since the | 
elspudof beginning of the keliyuga, there exists no difference 
hala © atnounting to whole years. According to both Brahma- 
gupta-and Pulisa, of the kaliyuga there have elapsed 
before our gange-year 4132 years, and between the 


_ CHAPTER XLIX. 5 


wars of Bharata and our gauge-year there have elapsed 
3479 years. The year 4132 before the gauge-year is 
the epoch of the kalizdla, and the year 3479 before the 
gange-year is the epoch of the Paindavakdla, 

The Hindus have an era called Kdlayavana, regard- the ers 
ing which I have not been able to obtain full infor- *“*"*™ 
mation. They place its epoch in the end of the last 
dvdparayuga. The here-mentioned Yavana (JMN) 
severely oppressed both their country and their religion. 

To date hy the here-mentioned eras requires in any 
case vast numbers, since their epochs go back to a most 
remote antiquity. For this reason people have given 
up using them, and have adopted instead the eras 
of— 


(1.) Sri Harsha. 
(2.) Vikramdditya. 
(3.) Saka. 

(4) Valabha, and 
(5.) Gupta. 


The Hindus believe regarding Srt Harsha that he em otée 
used to examine the soil in order to see what of hidden #“"* 
treasures was in its interior, as far down as the seventh 
earth; that, in fact, he found such treasures ; and that, 
in consequence, he could dispense with oppressing his 
subjects (by taxes, &c.) His era is used in Mathura and 
the country of Kanoj. Between Sri Harsha and Vikra- 
mfditya there is an interval of 400 years, as I have been 
told by some of the inhabitants of that region. How- 
ever, in the Kashmirian calendar I have read that Sri 
Harsha was 664 years later than Vikramaditya. In 
face of this discrepancy I am in perfect uncertainty, 
which to the present moment has not yet been cleared 
up by any trastworthy information, 

Those who use the era of Vikramaditya live in the Era of vir. 
southern and western parts of India. It is used in the ue 
following way: 342 are multiplied by 3, which gives 


6 ALBERUN?PS INDIA. 


the product 1026. To this number you add the years 
which have elapsed of the current shashfyabda or sexa- 
gesimal samvatsara, and the sum is the corresponding 
year of the era of Vikramfditya. In the book Sréd- 
hava by Mahadeva I find as his name Candrabdtja. 

As regards this method of calcnlation, we must first 
say that it is rather awkward and unnatural, for if they 
began with 1026 as the basia of the calculation, as they 
begin—withont any apparent necessity-—with 342, this 
would serve the same purpose. And, secondly, admit- 
ting that the method is correct as long as there is only 
one shash{yabda in the date, how are we to reckon if 
there is a number of shashtyabdas? 

The epoch of the era of Saka or Sakakala falls 135 
years later than that of Vikramaditya. The here-men- 
tioned Saka tyrannised over their country between the 
river Sindh and the ocean, after he had made Arya- 
varta in the midst of this realm his dwelling-place. 
He interdicted the Hindus from considering and repre- 
senting themselves as anything but Sakas, Some main- 
tain that he was a Sidra from the city of Almansfra; 
others maintain that he was not a Hindu at all, and that 
he had come to India from the west. The Hindus had 
mnch to suffer from him, till at last they received help 
from the east, when Vikramaditya marched against him, 
put him to flight and killed him in the region of Kariir, 
between Multfn and the castle of Lént. Now this date 
became famons, as people rejoiced in the news of the 
death of the tyrant, and*was used as the epoch of an 
era, especially hy the astronomers. They honour the 
conqueror by adding Sri to his name, so as to say Sri 
Vikramfditya. Since there is 8 long interval between 
the era which is called the era of Vikramaditya (v. 
p. §) and the killing of Saka, we think that thet Vik- 
ram@ditya from whom the era has got its name is not 
identical with that one who killed Sake, but only 4 
namesake of bis. 


CHAPTER XLIX. 7 


The era of Valabha is called so from Valabha, the ruler kra of 
of the town Valabht, nearly 30 yojenas south of Anhil- 
vara. The epoch of this era falls 241 years later than page 06. 
the epoch of the Saka era. People use it in this way. 
They first put down the year of the Sakakdla, and 
then subtract from it the cube of 6 and the square of 
§ (216 + 25 = 241). The remainder is the year of the 
Valabha era, The history of Valabha is given in its 
proper place (cf. chap. xvii.) 

As regards the Guptakala, people say that the Guptas Ouptexils, 
were wicked powerful people, and that when they 
ceased to exist this date was used as the epoch of an 
era. It seems that Valabha was the last of them, be- 
cause the epoch of the era of the Guptas falls, like 
that of the Valabha era, 241 years later than the Saka- 
kala, 
The era of the astronomers begins 587 years later than tra of the 
the Sakakfla. On this era is based the canon Khanda- tora.” 
khddyaka by Brahmagupta, which among Mubammadans 
is known as Al-arkand. 

Now, the year 400 of Yazdajird, which we have Comparison 
chosen as a gauge, corresponds to the following years ofthe hy 
of the Indian eras :— with the 


tost-year, 
(t) To the year 1488 of the era of Sri Harshe, 
(2) To the year 1088 of the era of Vikramaditya, 
(3) To the year 953 of the Sakakala, 
(4) To the year 712 of the Valabha era, which is 
identical with the Guptak4ls, 
(5) To the year 366 of the era of the canon Khanda- 
khddyak 


yaka, 
(6) To the year 526 of the era of the canon Pafica- 
siddhantiht by Varihamihira, 
(7) To the year 132 of the era of the canon Kara- 
nasdra; and 
(8) To the year 65 of the era of the canon Karaya- 
tilaka, .

The eras of the here-mentioned canones are such as 
the authora of them considered the most suitable to be 
used as cardinal points in astronomical and other cal- 
culations, whence calculation may conveniently extend 
forward or backward, Perhaps the epochs of these eras 
fall within the time when the authors in question them- 
selves lived, but it is also possible that they fall within 
a time anterior to their lifetime.

is finished, they drop it, and simply begin to date by a 
new one. This era is called lokakdla, ic. the era of 
the nation at large. But of this era people giva such 
totally different accounts, that I have no means of: 
making ont the truth, In a similar manner they 
also differ among themselves regarding the beginning 
of the year. On the latter aubject I shall communicate 
what I have heard myself, hoping meanwhile that one 
day we shall be able to discover a rule in thie apparent 
confusion. 

Those who use the Saka era, the astronomers, begin 
the year with the month Caitra, whilst the inhabitants 
of Kanir, which is conterminous with Kashmir, begin 
it with the month Bhidrapada. The same people count 
our gauge-year (400 Yazdajird) as the eighty-fourth 
year of an era of theirs. 

All the people who inhabit the country between 
Bardari and Marigala begin the year with the month 
KaArttika, and they count tha gauge-year as the roth 
year of an era of theirs. The author of the Kashmirian 
calendar maintains that the latter year corresponds to 
the sixth year of a new centennium, and this, indeed, is 
the usage of the people of Kashmtr. 

The people living in tha country Nirahara, behind 
Marigala, as far as the utmost frontiers of Takeshar and 
Lohavar, begin the year with the month Margafirsha, 
and reckon our gauge-year as the ro8th year of their 


CHAPTER XLIX. 9 


era. The people of Lanbaga, tc. Lamghan, follow their 
example. I have been told by people of Multan that 
‘this syatem ie peculiar to the people of Sindh and 
Kanoj, and that they used to begin the year with the 
new moon of Margagirsha, bnt that the people of Multan 
only a few years eco had given up this syatem, and 
had adopted the syatem of the people of Kashmir, and 
followed their example in beginning the year with the 
new moon of Caitra. 

JT have already before excused myself on account of Popular 
the imperfection of the information given in this chap- dating in 
ter, For we cannot offer a atrictly scientific account of tie Hinds, 
the eraa to which it is devoted, simply because in them *n7cvt 
we have to reckon with periods of time far exceeding a °™ 
cenfennium, (and becanse all tradition of events farther 
back than a hundred years is confused (v. p. 8).) So 
I have myself seen the roundabont way in which they 
‘compute the year of the destruction of Somanath in the 
year of the Hijra 416, or 947 Sakakala, First, they 
write down the number 242, then under it 606, then 
under this 99. The sum of these numbers is 947, or the 
year of the Sakakéla, 

Now I am inclined to think that the 242 years have 
elapsed before the beginning of their centennial system, 
and that they have adopted the latter together with 
the Guptakala; further, that the number 606 represent= 
complete samvatsaras or centennials, each of which they Page 207. 
muat reckon as 101 years; lastly, that the 99 years 
represent that time which has elapsed of the current 
centennium. 

That this, indeed, is the nature of the calculation is 
confirmed by a leaf of a canon composed by Durlabha 
of Multan, which I have found by chance. Here the 
aothor says: “ First write 848 and add to it the daukixa- 
kdia, ie, the era of the people, and the sum is the 
Sakakfin.” 

If we write firat the year of the Sakakala correspond- 


10 ALBERUNIS INDIA. 


ing to our gauge-year, viz. 953, and subtract 848 from 
it, the remainder, 105, is the year of the daukika-kdla, 
whilst the destruction of Somanath falls in the ninety- 
eighth year of the centennium or lauktka-kdla, 

'  Durlabha says, besides, that the year hegina with the 
month Margadirsha, but that the astronomers of Multan 
begin it with Caitra, 

Origin of the The Hindus had kings residing i in Kabul, Turks who 

ikostdbeet were said to be of Tibetan origin. The first of them, 

a Barhatakin, came into the country and entered a cave 
in Kabul, which none could enter except by creeping 
on hands and knees,. The cave had water, and besides 
he deposited there victuals for a certain number of 
days. It is still known in our time, and is called Var. 
People who consider the name of Barhatakin as a good 
omen enter the cave and bring out some of its water 
with great trouble. 

Certain troops of peasants were working before the 
door of the cave, Tricks of this kind can only be 
carried out and become notorious, if their author has 
made a secret arrangement with somebody else—in 
fact, with confederates, Now these had induced per- 
sons to work there continnally day and night in turns, 
so thet the place was never empty of people. 

Some deys after he had entered the cave, he began 
to creep out of it in the presence of the people, who 
looked on him as & new-born baby. He wore Turkish 
dress, 8 short tunic open in front, a high hat, boots and 
arms. Now people honoured him as 8 being of mira- 
culous origin, who had been destined to be king, and in 
fact he brought those countries under his sway and 
ruled them under the title of a shdhiya of Kdbul. 
The rule remained among his descendants for gene- 
rations, the number of which is said to be about 
aixty. 

Unfortunately the Hindus do not pay much attention 
to the historical order of things, they are very careless 


CHAPTER XLIX. WI 


in relating the chronological succession of their kings, 
and when they are pressed for information and are 
at a loss, not knowing what to say, they invariably 
take to tale-telling. But for this, we should com- 
municate to the reader the traditions which we have 
received from some people among them. I have 
been told that the pedigree of this royal family, 
written on silk, exists in the fortress Nagarkot, 
and I much desired to make myself acquainted 
with it, but the thing was impossible for various 
reasons. 

One of this series of kings was Kanik, the same who 
is said to have built the vikdra (Buddhistic monastery) 
of Purushavar. It is called, after him, Kantk-caitya, 
People relate that the king of Kanoj had presented to 
him, among other gifts, a gorgeous and most singular 
piece of cloth. Now Kanik wanted to have dresses 
made out of it for himself, but his tailor had not the 
courage to make them, for he said, “There is (in the 
embroidery) the figure of a human foot, and whatever 
trouble I may take, the foot will always lie between tha 
shoulders.” And that means the same as we have 
already mentioned in the story of Bali, the aon of 
Virocana (i.e. a eign of subjugation, cf. i. p. 397). Now 
Kanik felt convinced that the ruler of Kanoj had 
thereby intended to vilify and disgrace him, and in 
hot haste he set out with his troops marching against 
him. 

When the rd¢ heard this, he was greatly perplexed, 
for he had no power to resist Kanik. Therefore he 
consulted his Vaztr, and the latter said, “You have 
roused a man who was quiet before, and have done un- 
becoming things. Now cut off my nose and lips, let 
me be matilated, that I may find a cunning device ; for 
there is no possibility of an open resistance.” The rdf 
did with him as he had proposed, and then he went off 
to the frontiers of the realm. 


The story of 
Kanik.

13 ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 


There he was found by the hostile army, was recog- 
nised and brought before Kanik, who asked what was 
the matter with him. The Vazir said, “I tried to 
dissuade Aim from opposing you, and sincerely advised 
him to be obedient to you. He, however, conceived a 
euspicion against me and ordered me to be mutilated. 
Since then he has gone, of his awn accord, to a place 
which a man can only reach by a very long journey 
when he marches on the highroad, but which he may 
easily reach hy undergoing the trouble of crossing an 
intervening desert, supposing that he can carry with 
himself water for so and so many days.” Thereupon 
Kanik answered: “The latter is easily done.” He 
ordered water to be carried along, and engaged the 
Vazir to show him the road. The Vaztr marched be- 
fore the king and led him into a boundless desert. 
After the number of days hed elapsed and the road did 
not come to an end, the king asked the Vazir what was 
now to be done. Then the Vazir said, “No blame 
attaches to me that I tried to save my master and to 
destroy his enemy. The nearest road leading ont of 
this desert is that on which you have come. Now do 
with me as you like, for none will leave this desert 
alive.” 

Then Kanik got on his horse and rode round a de- 
pression in the soil. In the centre of it he thrust his 
spear into the earth, and lo! water poured from it in 
eufficient quantity for the army to drink from and to 
draw from for the march back. Upon this the Vaztr 
said, “I had not directed my cunning scheme against 
powerful angels, but against feeble men. As things 
etand thus, accept my intercession for the prince, my 
benefactor, and pardon him.” Kanik answered, “I 
march back from this place. Thy wish is granted to 
thee. Thy master has already received what is due to 
him.” Kanik returned out of the desert, and the Vazir 
went back to bis master, the rdf of Kanoj. There he 


CHAPTER XLIX. 13 


found that on the same day when Kanik had thrust 
his spear into the earth, both the hands and feet had 
fallen off the body of the rdf, 

The last king of this race was Lagatdrmdn, and his mudof the 
Vasir was Kallar,a Brahman. The latter had been for- tactyrand” 
tunate, in so far as he had fonnd by accident hidden erin ofthe 
treasures, which gave him much influence and power, * 
In consequence, the last king of this Tibetan house, 
after it had held the royal power for so long a period, 
let it by degrees slip from his hands. Besides, Laga- 
tirmin had bad manners and a worse behaviour, ou 
account of which people complained of him greatly 
tc the Vazir. Now the Vazir put him in chains aud 
imprisoned him for correction, but then he himself 
found ruling sweet, his riches enabled him to carry out 
his plans, and so he occupied the royal throne. After 
him ruled the Brahman kings SAmand (Samanta), 
Kamali, Bhim (Bhima), Jaipil (Jayapila), Ananda- 
pila, Tarojanapala (Trilocanapéla). The latter was 
killed a.m. 412 (A.D. 1021), and his son Bhimspila five 
years later (A.D. 1026). 

This Hindu Shahiya dynasty is now extinct, and of 
the whole house there is no longer the slichtest rem- 
nant in existence. We must say that, in all their 
grandeur, they never slackened in the ardent desire of 
doing that which is good and right, that they were men 
of noble sentiment and noble bearing. I admire the 
following passage in a letter of Auandapala, which he 
wrote to the prince Mahmfid, when the relations be- 
tween them were already strained to the utmost: “I 
have learned that the Turks have rebelled against you 
and are spreading in Kharéséo. If you wish, I shall 
come to you with 5000 horsemen, 10,000 foot-soldiers, 
and 100 elephants, or, if you wish, I shall send you 
my son with donble the number. In acting thus, I 
‘do not speculate on the impression which this will 
make on you. I have been conquered hy yeu, and 


14 ALBERUN?PS INDIA. 


therefore I do not wish that another man should 


conquer you.” 
The same prinee cherished the bitterest hatred against 
_ the Muhammadans from the time when his son was 
made a prisoner, whilst his son Tarojanapala (Triloca- 
napala) was the very opposite of his father. 


CHAPTER L. 


HOW MANY STAR-CYCLES THERE ARE BOTH IN A “Kapa” 
AND IN A “CATURYUGA,” 


Ir ia one of the conditions of a Aulpa that in it the 
planets, with their apsidea and nodes, must unite in 
o° of Aries, i.e, in the point of the vernal eqninox. 
’ Therefore each planet makes within a kalpa a certain 
number of complete revolutions or cycles. 

These atar-cycles as known through the canon of the tradi 
Alfazirt and Ya'kdb Ibn Tarik, were derived trom a gitad 
Hindu who came to Bagdad as a member of the politi- 7 a 
cal mission which Sindh sent to the Khalif Almansir, 

AH. 154 (=a.D. 771). If we compare these secondary 
statements with the primary statements of the Hindus, 
we discover discrepancies, the cause of which is not 
known to me, Is their origin due to the translation of 
Alfazitt and Ya‘kib? or to the dictation of that 
Hindu? or to the fact that afterwards these computa- 
tions have been corrected by Brahmagupta, or some one 
else? For, certainly, any acholar who becomes aware 
of mistakes in astronomical computations and takes an 
interest in the subject, will endeavour to correct them, Muhammed 
as, eg. Muhammad Zbn Ishak of Sarakhs has done, seratne 
For he had discovered in the computation of Saturn a 

+ falling back behind real time (.¢., that Saturn, accord. 
ing to this compntation, revolved alower than it did in 
reality). Now he assiduonely atudied the subject, till 
at last he was convinced that his fault did not originate

from the equation (i.¢. from the correction of the places 
of the stars, the computation of their mean places). 
Then he added to the cycles of Saturn one cycle more, 
and compared his calculation with the actual motiun of 
the planet, till at last he found the calculation of the 
cycles completely to agree with astronomical observa- 
tion. In accordance with this correction he states the 
star-cycles in his canon,’

The computation of these cycles rests on the mean oycies of 
motion of the planets, As a caturyuga is, according to ina'cate 
Brahmagupts, the one-thousandth part of a kalpa, we ta

To ikswiss, if we divide the cycles of the table by 
10,000, the qnotient is the number of the star-cycles in 
a kaliyuga, for this is one-tenth of a caturyuga. The 
fractions which may occur in those quotients are raised 
to wholes, to caturyugas or kaliyugas, by being multi- 
‘plied by a number equal to the denominator of the 
fraction. 
The following tab'e represents the star-cycles speci- 
ally in a caturyuga and kaliyuga, not those in a man-

multiplications of whole caturyugas, atill it is difficult 
to reckon with them on account of the saridhi which 
ig attached both to the beginning and to the end of 
them.

the theory of Pulisa; and a third class of numbers differs 

from those of both Brahmagupta and Pulisa, as the

CHAPTER LI. 


AN EXPLANATION OF THE TERMS “ADHIMASA,” “ UNA- 
RATRA,” AND THE “ AHARGANAS,” AS REPRESENTING 
DIFFERENT 8UMS OF DAYS. 


On the leap THE months of the Hindus are lunar, their years solar ; 
therefore their new year's day must in each solar year 
fall by so much earlier as the lunar year is shorter than 
the solar (ronghly speaking, by eleven days). If this 
precession makes up one complete month, they act in ° 
the same way as the Jews, who make the year a leap 
year of thirteen months by reckoning the month Adar 
twice, and in a similar way to the heathen Arabs, who 
in a so-called annus procrastinationis postponed the 
new year's day, thereby extending the preceding year 
to the duration of thirteen months. 

The Hindus call the year in which a month is 
repeated in the common languace malamdsa. Mala 
means the dirt that clings to the hand. As snch dirt 
is thrown away, thus the leap month is thrown away 
out of the caleulation, and the number of the months 
of a year remains twelve. However, in the literature 
the leap month is called adhimdsa, 

That month is repeated within which (it being con- 
sidered as a solar month) two lunar months finish. If 
the end of the lunar month coincides with the beginning 
of the solar month, if, in fact, the former ends before 
any part of the latter has elapsed, this month is re- 
peated, becanse the end of the lunar month, although 


*. CHAPTER LI. - 22 


it hag not yet run into the new solar month, atill does 
no longer form part of the preceding month. 

If a month is repeated, the first time it has its 
ordinary name, whilst the second time they add before 
the name the word durd to distinguish between them. 

If, eg. the month Ashadha is repeated, the first is called Pace 2:3. 
Ash&dha, the second Durdshddha. The first month is 

that which is disregarded in the calculation. The Hin- 

dus consider it as unlucky, and do not celebrate any of 

the festivals in it which they celebrate in the other 
months. The most nalucky time in this month is that 

day on which the lunation reaches its end. 

The author of the Vishnu-Dharma says: “ Candra quotation 
(mana) is smaller than sdvana, ie. the lunar year is Fuse.” 
smaller than the civil year, by six days, ie. dnardtra, 
Una means decrease, deficiency. Saura is greater than 
candra by elevan days, which gives in two years and 
seven months the supernumerary adhimdsa month. 

This whole month is unlucky, and nothing must be 
done in it.” . 

This isa rough description of the matter. We shall 
now describe it accurately. 

The lunar year has 360 lunar days, the solar year has 
37'¢so lunar days. This difference sums up to the 
thirty days of an adhimdsa in the course of 9767/5 
lunar days, ¢.¢.in 32 months, or in 2 years, 8 months, 16 
days, plus the fraction: 7/7, lunar day, which is 
nearly = 5 minutes, 15 seconds. 

As the religious reason of this theory of intercala- Quotation 
tion the Hindus mention a passage of the Veda, which Vola 
they have read to us, to the following tenor: “If tha 
day of conjunction, ¢¢. the first lunar day of the month, 
passes without the aun’s marching from one zodiacal aign 
to the other, and if this takes place on the following 
day, the preceding month falls out of the calculation.” 

The meaning of this passage is not correct, and the criticieme 
fault must have risen with the man who recited and 


22 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 
translated the passage tome. For s month has thirty 


- lunar days, and a twelfth part of the solar year has 


3o%fit lunar days. This fraction, reckoned in day- 
minutes, ig equal to §5' 19° 2230", If we now, for 
example, suppose ® conjunction or new moon to take 
place at o° of a zodiacal sign, we add this fraction to 
the time of the conjunction, and thereby we find the 
times of the sun's entering the signs successively. As 
now the difference between a lunar and a solar month 
is only « fraction of a day, the sun's entering a new 


_ sign may naturally take place on any of the days of the 


month. It may even happen that the aun enters two 
consecutive signs on the same month-day (e.g. on the 
second or third of two consecutive months). This is 
the case if in one month the sun enters a sign before 
4' 40" 37" 30" have elapsed of it; for the next follow- 
ing entering a sign falls later by 55! 1g! 23" 30%, and 
both these fractions (ie, leas than 4! 40" 37" 30" plus 
the last-mentioned fraction) added together are not 
sufficient to make up one complete day. Therefore 
the quotation from the Veda is not correct. 

I suppose, however, that it may have the following 


< the Vedie correct meaning :—If a month elapses in which the sun 


Page 314. 


does not march from one sign to another, this month is © 
disregarded in the calculation. For if the sun enters 
a sign on the 29th of a month, when at least 4' 40" 37 
30” have elapsed of it, this entering takes place before 
the beginning of the sncceeding month, and therefore 
the latter month is without an entering of tie sun into 
a new eign, because the next following entering falls on 
the firet of the next but one or third month. If you 
compute the consecutive enterings, beginning with a 
conjunction taking place in o° of a certain sign, you 
find that in the thirty-third month the sun enters a new 
sign at 30! 20" of the twenty-ninth day, and that he 
enters the next following sign at 25' 39" 22" 30" of the 
first day of the thirty-fifth month, 


CHAPTER LI. 23 


Hence also becomes evident why this month, which 
is disregarded in the calcnlation, is considered as un- 
Incky. The reason is that the month misses just that 
moment which is particularly adapted to earn in it a 

heavenly reward, viz. the moment of the snn’s entering 
@ new sign. 

As regards adhkimdsa, the word means the first month, 
for AD means beginning (t.c. ddi). In the books of 
Ya'kfib Ibn Tarik and of Alfazart this name is written 
padamdsa, Pada (in the orig, P-Dk) means end, and 
it is possible that the Hindus call the leap month by 
both names ; but the reader must be aware that these 

_ two authors frequently misspell or disfigure the Indian 
words, and that there is no reliance on their tradition. 
I only mention this hecause Pulisa explains the latter 
of the éwo months, which are called by the same name, 
ae the supernumerary one. 

The month, as the time from one conjunction to the Explanation 
following, is one revolution of the moon, which revolves Seen ee: 
through the ecliptic, but in a course distant from that Montheand 
of the sun. This isthe difference between the motions 
af the two heavenly luminaries, whilst the direction 
in which they move is the same, If we subtract the 
revolutions of the sun, te. the solar cycles of a kaipa, 
from its lunar cycles, the remainder shows how many 
more lunar months a Aalpa has than solar months, All 
months ar days which we reckon as parts of whole 
kalpas we call here universal, and all months or daya 
which we reckon as parta of a part of a kalpa, eg. 
of a caturyuga, we call partial, for the purpose of sim- 
plifying the terminology. * 

The year has twelve solar months, and likewise universal 
twelve funar months, The lunar year is complete with moutus 
twelve months, whilst the solar year, in consequence of 
the difference of the two year kinds, has, with the 
addition of the adhtmdsa, thirteen months. Naw evi-_ 
dently the difference between the universal solar and 


24 ALBERUNPS INDIA. 


lunar months is represented by these supernumerary 
months, by which a single year is extended to thirteen 
months. These, therefore, are the «ntversal adhimdsa 
months. 

The universal solar months of a kalpa are 51,240, 
000,000; the universal lunar months of a Xalpe are 
§3:433,300,000. The difference between them or the 
adhimdsa months is 1,593,300,000. 

Multiplying each of these numbers by 30, we 0 get 
days, viz. solar days of a kalpa, 1,5§5,200,000,000; 
Innar days, 1,602,999,000,000; the days of the adhimdsa 
months, 47,799,000,000. 

In order to reduce these numbers to emaller ones 
we divide them by a common divisor, viz. 9,000,000. 
Thus we get as the eum of the daye of the solar monthe 
172,800; as the sum of the days of the lunar months, 
178,111; and as the sum of the days of the adhindsa 
months, $311. 

If we further divide the universal solar, civil, and 
lunar daya of a kalpa, each kind of them separately, by 
the universal adhimdsa mouths, the quotient represents 
the number of days within which a whole adhimdsa 
month sums up, viz. in O76 isis solar days, in 1006;'s"; 
lunar days, end in 990;4'¢s5 civil days. 

This whole computation rests on the measares which 
Brahmagupta adopts regarding a kalpa and the star- 
oycles in a kalpa. 

According to the theory of Pulisa regarding the 
caturyuga, a caturyuga has §1,840,000 solar months, 
53,433,336 lunar months, 1,593,336 adhimdsa months. 
Accordingly a caturyuga has 1,555,200,000 solar days, 
1,603,000,080 lunar days, 47,800,080 days of adhimdsa 
mouths. 

If we reduce the numbers of the months by the 
common divisor of 24, we get 2,160,000 solar months, 
2,226,389 lunar months, 66,389 adhimdsa months. If | 
we divide the nombers of the day by the common 


CHAPTER LI. 35 


divisor of 720, we get 2,160,000 solar days, 2,226,389 
lunar days, 66,389 days of the adkimdsa mouths. If 
we, lastly, divide the universal solar, lunar, and civil 
_ days of a caturyuga, each kind sepsrately, by the uni- 
versal adkimdsa months of a caturyuya, the quotient 
represents the numbers of days within which a whole 
adhimdsa month sums up, viz. in 976s4'5%5 solar days, 
in 1006,553,', lunar days, and in 9903485 civil days. 

These are the elements of the computation of the 
adhimdsa, which we have worked ont for the benefit of 
the fcllowing investigations, 

Regarding the cause which necessitates the dnardtra, Explanation 
lit. the days of the decrease, we have to consider the fol- ésaraira. 
lowing. 

If we have one year or a certain number of years, 
and reckon for each of them twelve months, we get the 
corresponding namber of solar months, and by multi- 
plying the latter by 30, the corresponding number 
of solar days, It is evident that the number of the 
lunar months or days of the same period is the same, 
plus an increase which forms one or several adhimdsa 
montha. If we reduce this increase to adhimdsa months 
due to the period of time in question, according to the 
relation between the universal solar months and the 
universal adhimdsa months, and add this to the months 
or days of the years in question, the aum represents the 
partial lunar days, tc. those which correspond to the 
given number of years. 

This, however, is not what is wanted. What we want 
ja the number of civil days of the given number of 
years which are Jess than the lunar days; for one ezvil 
day ia greater than one /unar day. Therefore, in order 
to find that which is sought, we must subtract some- 
thing from the number of lunar days, and this element 
which must be subtracted is called dnardira. 

The dnardira of the partial lunar days stands in the 
same relation to the universal lunar days as the uni- 


Critictams - 


on Ta'khb 
Tou Tarik.

26 : ALBERUNDPS INDIA. 


versal civil days are less than the universal lunar deys. 
The universal lunardays of a kalpa are 1,502,999,000,000. 
This number is larger than the number of universal 
civil days hy 25,082,550,000, which represents the uni- 
versal daardira, 

Both these numbers may be diminished by the com- 
mon divisor of 450,000. Thus we get 3,562,220 uni- 
versal lunar daya, and 55,739 universal dnardira days. 
- According to Pulisa, a orturyuga has 1,603,000,080 
lnnar days, and 25,082,280 ¢dinardira dsys. The com- 
mon divisor by which both numbers may be reduced 
is 360. Thus we get 4,452,778 lunar days and 69,673 
Unardira days. 

These are the rules for the computation of the ¢na- 
rdtra, which we ahall hereafter want for the compu- 
tation of the ahargana. The word means sum of days ; 
for 4h means day, and argana, sum. 

Ya‘kib Ibn Tarik has made a mistaké in the compnu- 
tation of the solar days; for he maintains that you get 
them by subtracting the solar cycles of a kalpa from 
the civil days of a kalpa, ic. the universal civil days. 
But this is not the case. We get the solar daya by 
multiplying the solar cycles of a kalpa by 12, in order 
to reduce them to months, and the product by 30, in 
order to reduce them to days, or by multiplying the 
number of cycles by 360. 

In the computation of the lunar daya he has first 
taken the right course, multiplying the lunar months 
of a kalpa by 30, but afterwards he again falls into a 
mistake in the computation of the daya of the dnardira. 
For he maintains that you get them by aubtracting the 
solar days from the lunar days, whilst the correct thing 
is to subtract the civil daye from the lunar days.

CHAPTER LII. 


ON THE CALCULATION OF “AHARGANA” IN GENERAL, 
THAT I8, THE RESOLUTION OF YEARS AND MONTHS 
INTO DAYS, AND, VICE VERSA, THE COMPOSITION OF 
YEARS AND MONTHS OUT OF DAYS. 


THe general method of resolution is as follows :—The General rule 
complete years are multiplied by 12; to the product are the stead. 
added the months which have elapsed of the current 
year, [and this sum is multiplied by 30 ;] to this product 
‘are added the days which have elapsed of the current 
month, The sum represents the saurdhargana, i, the 
sum of the partial soler days. 

You write down the number in two places. In the 
one place you multiply it by 5311, te, the number 
which representa the universal adhimdsa months. The 
product you divide by 172,800, i¢. the number which 
Tepresents the universal solar months, The quotient you 
get, as far as it contains complete days, is added to the 
number in the second place, and the sum represents the 
candrahargana, 7c, the sum of the partial lunar days. 

The latter number is again written down in two 
different places. In the one place you multiply it by 
55,739, 1-¢ the number which represents the wniversal 
dnardtra days, and divide the product by 3,562,220, te. 
the number which represents the oniversal lunar days. 
The quotient you get, as far as it represents complete 
days, is subtracted from the number written in the 
second place, and the remainder is the sdrandhargana, 
ic the sum of civid days which we wanted to find. 


Mere de. 


28 ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 
However, the reader must know that this computa- 


for the wane tion applies to dates in which there are only complete 


Page ar7- 


adhimdsa and dnardira days, without any fraction. Tf, 
therefore, a given nnmber of years commences with the 
beginning of a kalpa, or a eaturyuga, or a kaliyuga, this 
computation is correct. Bunt if the given years begin 
with some other time, it inay by chance happen that 
this computation is correct, bnt possibly, too, it may 
result in proving the existence of adhimdsa time, and in 
that case the computation would not be correct. Also 


‘the reverse of these two eventualities may take place. 
‘However, if it is known with what particular moment 


in the kalpa, caturyuga, or kaliyuga a given nnmber 
of years commences, we use a apecial method of com~ 
putation, which we shall hereafter illustrate by some 
examples, 

We ahal) carry ont this method for the besin- 
ning of the Indian year Sakakila 953, the same year 
which we nse as the gauge-year in all these computa~ 
tions, 

First we compute the time from the beginning of 
the life of Brahman, according to the rules of Brahma~ 
gupta. We have already mentioned that 6068 kalpas 
have elepsed before the present one. Multiplying this 
by the well-known number of the days of a kalpa 
(1,577,916,450,000 civil days, vide i. p. 368), we get 
9,574,797,018,600,000 as the anm of the days of 6068. 
kalpas. 

Dividing this number hy 7, we get § as ea remainder, 
and reckoning five days backwards from the Saturday 
which is the last day of the preceding kalpa, we get 
Tuesday as the first day of the life of Brahman. 

We have already mentioned the sum of the days of 
a caturyuga (1,577,916,450 days, v. i. p, 370), and have 
explained that a critayuga is equal to four-tenths of it, 
t.¢. 631,166,580 days, A manvantare has seventy-one 
times as much, i¢, 112,032,067,950 days. The days of 


CHAPTER Lil, . 29 


six manvaniaras and their sarhdhi, consisting of seven 
kritayuga, are 676,610,573,760. If we divide this 
number by 7, we get a remainder of 2. Therefore the 
six manvantaras end with a Monday, and the seventh 
begina with a Tuesday. 

Ofthe seventh manvantara there have already elapsed 
twenty-seven caturyugas, i.¢. 42,603,744,150 days. If 
we divide this namber by 7, we get a remainder of 2. 
Therefore the twenty-eighth caluryuga begins with a 
Thursday. 

The days of the yugas which have elapsed of the 
present caturyuga are 1,420,124,805. The division by 
7 gives the remainder 1. Therefore the kaliyuga begins 
with a Friday. 

Now, returning to our gauge-year, we remark that 
the years which have elapsed of the Aalpa up to that 
year are 1,972,048,132. Multiplying them by 12, we 
get as the number of their mouths 23,675,377,584. In 
the date which we have adopted as gauge-year there 
is no month, but only complete years; therefore we 
have nothing to add to this number. 

By multiplying this number by 30 we get days, 
viz, 710,261,327,520. As there are no days in the 
normal date, we have no daya to add to this number. 
If, therefore, we had multiplied the number of years 
by 360, we should have got the same result, viz. the 
partial solar daya. 

Multiply this number by 5311 and divide the pro- 
duct by 172,800, The quotient is the number of the 
adhimdsa days, viz. 21,829,849,018}$3. If, in multi- 
plying and dividing, we had used the months, we 
ahould have found the adhimdsa months, and, multi- 
plied by 30, they would be equal to the here-meutioned 
number of adkimdsa days. 

If we further add the adhimdsa days to the partial 
solar days, we get the sum of 732,091,176,5 38, ze, the 
partial lunar days. Multiplying them by 55,739, and

dividing the product hy 3,562,220, we gat the partial 
Gnardira days, viz, 11,455,224,575 1: 4T1t6. 
This sum of days without the fraction is subtract- 
ed from the partic? lunar days, and the remainder, 
720,635,951,963, represents the number of the civil 
daya of our gau 
Dividing it by 7, we get as remainder 4, which 
means that the last of these days is a Wednesday. 
Therefore the Indian year commences with a Thursday. 
If we further want to find the adhimdea time, we 
. divide the adhimdsa days by 30, and the quotient is 
the number of the adhimdsas which have elapsed, viz. 
727,661,633, plus a remainder of 28 days, 51 minutes, 
30 seconds, for the current year. This is the time 
which has already elapsed of the adhimdsa month of 
the current year. To become a complete month, it 
only wants £ day, 8 minutes, 30 seconds more. 
‘The same We have here used the solar and Innar days, the 
spplied toa adhimdsa and @nardira days, to find a certain past 
scconding to portion of a kalps, We shall now do the same to find 
e Poti the past portion of @ caturyuga, and we may use the 

same elements for the computation of 9 caturyuga 

' which we have used for that of a kalpa, for both 
methods jead to the same result, as long as we adhere 
to one and the same theory (eg. that of ‘Brahmagupts), 
and do not mix up different chronological systems, and ° 
as long as each gunakdra and its dhdgabhdra, which we 
here mention together, correspond to each other in the 
two computations, 

The former term means a multiplicator in all kinds 
of calculations. In our (Arabic) astronomical hand- 
books, as well as those of the Persians, the word occura 
in the form gunetr. The second term means each 
divisor. It occurs in the astronomical handbooks in 
the form bahedr. 

It would be useless if we were to exemplify this com- 
putation on a caturyuga according to the theory of Brah- 


CHAPTER LIl. 31 


magupta, as according to him a caturyuga is simply one- Page at. 
thousandth of a kalpa. We ahould only have to shorten 
the above-mentioned numbers by three ciphers, and in 
every other respect get the same results. Therefore we 
shall now give this computation according to the theory 
of Pulisa, which, though applying to the caturyuga, is 
similar to the method of computation used for a kalpa. 
According to Pulisa, in the moment of the beginning 
of the gauge-year, there have elapsed of the years of the 
caturyuga 3,244,132, Which are equal to 1,167,887,520 
solar days, If we multiply the number of months 
which corresponds to this number of days with the 
number of the adhimdsa months of a caturyuga or a 
corresponding multiplicator, and divide the product by 
the number of the solar months of a cafuryuga, or a 
corresponding divisor, we get as the number of adhi~ 
mdsa months 1,196,52544633. 
Forther, the past 3,244,132 years of the caturyuga 
are, 1,203,783,270 lonar days. Multiplying the: by 
the number of the dnardira days of 2 caturyuga, and 
dividing the product by the lunar days of a caturyuga, we 
get as the number of @nardira days 18,835,700 35°55. 
Accordingly, the civif days which have elapsed since 
the beginning of the caturyuga are 1,184,947,570, and 
this it was which we wanted to find. 
We shall here communicate a passage from the a similar 
Pulisa-siddhdnta, describing a similar method of com- mot 


computation 
putation, for the purpose of rendering the whole subject taken fom 
clearer to the mind of the reader, and fixing it there “#é« 
more thoroughly. Pulisa says: “We first mark the 
kalpas which have elapsed of the life of Brahman 
before the present Aalpa, 1.2. 6068. We multiply this 
number by the number of the caturyugas of a kalpa, 
ic. 1008. Thus we get the product 6,116,544. This 
number we multiply by the number of the yugas of a 
caturyuga, ic. 4,and get the product 24,466,176. This 
number we multiply by the number of years of a yuga, 


Page 219 


32 ALBERUN?S INDIA. 


ic. 1,080,000, and get the product 26,423,470,080,000- 
These are the years which have elapsed before the 
present kalpa. 

We further multiply the latter number by 12, so as 
to get months, viz. 317,081,649,960,000. We write 
down this number in two different places. 

In the one place, we multiply it by the number of 
the adhimdsa months of a caturyuga, 1.2, 1,593;336, oF 
& corresponding number which has been mentioned in 
the preceding, and we divide the product by the nom- 
ber of the solar months of a caturyuga, i.e. 51,840,000. 
The quotient is the number of adhimdsa months, viz, 
9:745,709,750,784. 

This number we add to the number written in the 
second place, and get the snm of 326,827,350,710,784. 
Multiplying this number by 30, we get the product. 
9,804,820,521,323,520, viz. lunar days, 

This number is again written down in two different 
places. Inthe one place we multiply it by the dnardtra 
of a caturyugea, 1c. the difference between civil and lunar 
days, and divide the product by the lunar days of a 


eaturyuga. Thus we get as quotient 15 3,4 16,869,240,320, 


te. dnardira days. 

We subtract this number from that one written 
in the second place, and we get as remainder 
9.651,403,652,08 3,200, i.e. the days which have elapsed 
of the life of Brahman before the present kalpa, 
or the days of 6068 kalpas, each kalpa having 
1,590,541,142,400 days. Dividing this sum of days 
by 7, we get no remainder. This period of time ends 
with a Saturday, and the present kalpa commences 
with a Sunday. This shows that the beginning of the 
life of Brahman too was a Sunday. 

Of the current kalpa there have elapsed six manrvan- 
taras, each of 72 caturyugas, and each caturyuga of 
4,320,000 years. Therefore six manvaniaras have 
1,866,240,000 years, This number we compute in the 


CHAPTER LI. 33 


game way as we have done in the preceding example, 
Thereby we find as the number of days of six complete 
manvantaras, 681,660,489,600. Dividing this number 
by 7, we get as remainder 6. Therefore the elapsed 
manvantaras end with a Friday, and the seventh man- 
vantara begins with a Saturday. 

Of the current manvantara there have elapsed 27 
caturyugas, which, according to the preceding method 
of computation, represent the number of 42,603,780,600 
days. The twenty-seventh caturyuga ends with a 
Monday, and the twenty-eighth begins with a Tnes- 
day. 
of the current caluryuga there have elapsed three . 
yugas, OF 3,240,000 years. These represent, according 
to the preceding method of computation, the number 
of 1,183,438,350 days. Therefore these three yugas 
end with a Thursday, and kaliyuga commences with a 
Friday. 

Accordingly, the snm of days which have elapsed 
of the ‘alpa is 725,447,708,550, and the sum of days 
which have elapsed between the beginning of the life 
of Brahman and the beginning of the present kaliyuga 
is 9,65 2,129,099,791,750. 

To judge from the quotations from Aryabhata, as we Thomethod 
have not seen a book of his, he seems to reckon in the Sumani” 
following manner :— i ora 

The sum of days of a caturyuga is 1,577,917,500. 
The time between the beginning of the Aaipa and the 
beginning of the aliyuga is 725,447,570,625 days. 
The time between the beginning of the kalpa end our 
gauge-dste is 725,449,079,845. The number of days 
which have elapsed of the life of Brahman before the 
present kalpa is 9,651,401,817,120,000. 

This is the correct method for the resolution of years 
into days, and all other measures of time are to be 
treated in accordance with this. 

We have already pointed out (on p. 26) a mistake 

VOL. iI. c 


A second 
method 
given by 
Ya'kab. 


34 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


of Ya‘kib [bn Tarik in the calculation of the universal 
solar and dnardira days. As he translated from the 
‘Indian language a calculation the reasons of which he 
did not understand, it would have been his duty to 
examine it, and to check the various numbers of it one 
by the other. He meutions in his book also the method 
of akargana, +c. the resolution of years, but his descrip- 
tion i3 not correct; for he says:— 

“Multiply the months of the given number of years 
by the number of the adhimdsa months which have 


- elapsed up to the time in question, according to the 


well-known rules of adhimdsa. Divide the product 
by the solar months. The quotient is the number of 
complete adhimdsa months plus its fractions which 
have elapsed up to the date in question.” 

The mistake is here so evident that even a copyist 
would notice it; how much more a mathematician who 
makes @ computation according to this method; for he 
multiplies by the partial adhimdsa instead of the 
universal. 

Besides, Ya'kib mentions in his book another and 
perfectly correct method of resolution, which is this: 
“When you have found the number of months of 
the years, multiply them by the number of the lunar 
months, and divide the product by the solar months, 
The quotient is the number of adkimdsa months toge- 
ther with the number of the months of the years in 
question. 

“This number you multiply by 30, and you add to 
the product the days which have elapsed of the current 
month. The eum represents the lunar days. 

“Tf, instead of this, the first number of months were 
multiplied by 30, and the past portion of the month 
were added to the product, the sum would represent 
the partial sular days ; and if this number were further 
coraputed according to the preceding method, we should 
get the adhimdsa days together with the solar days.” 


CHAPTER Lit. — 35 


The rationale of this calculation is the following :—IE 

we multiply, as we have done, by the number of the reaiioned 
universal adhimdsa months, and divide the product by mer 
the universal solar months, the quotient represents the 
portion of adhimdsa time by which we have multiplied. 
As, now, the lunar months are the sum of solar and 
adhimdsa months, we multiply by them (the lunar 
months) and the division remains the same. The quo- 
tient is the sum of that number which is multiplied 
and that one which is sought for, ze. the lunar days. 

We have already mentioned in the preceding part 
that by multiplying the lunar daye by the universal] Page 20 
taardira days, and by dividing the product by the 
universal lunar days, we get the portion of dnardira 
days which belongs to the number of luner days in 
question. However, the civé/ days in a Aalpa are less 
than the lunar days by the amount of the dnardtra 
daya. Now the lunar days we have stand in the same 
relation to the lunar days minus their due portion of 
dnardtra days as the whole number of lunar days (of 
a kaipa) to the whole number of lunar days (of a kalpa) 
minus the complete number of dnardtra days (of a 
kalpa); and the latter number are the universal civil 
days, If we, therefore, multiply the number of lunar 
days we have by the universal civil days, and divide 
the product by the universal lunar days, we get as 
quotient the number of civil days of the date in ques- 
tion, and that it was which we wanted to find In- 
stead of multiplying by the whole sum of civil days 
(of a Aalpa), we multiply by 3,506,481, and instead of 
dividing by the whole number of lunar daya (of a 
kalpa), we divide by 3,562,220. 

The Hindus have etill another method of calculation. Anctber.. 
It is the following :—“ They multiply the elapsed years ehszaxa of 
of the kalpa by 12, and add to the product the com- 
plete months which have elapsed of the current year, 

The sum they write down above the number 69,120, 


36 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


(Zacuna.) 
and the number they get is subtracted from the num- 
ber written down in the middle place. The double of 


‘the remainder they divide by 65. Then the quotient 


represents the partial adhimdsea montha. This number 
they add to that one which is written down in the 
uppermost place. They multiply the sum by 30, and 
add to the product the days which have elapsed of the 
current month. The sum represents the partial solar 
days. This number is written down in two different 
places, one under the other. They multiply the lower 
number by 11, and write the prodnet underit. Then 
they divide it by 403,963, and add the quotient to the 
middle number. They divide the sum by 703, and 
the quotient represents the partial @nardtra days. This 
number they subtract from the number written in the 
uppermost place, and the remainder is the number of 
civil days which we want to find.” 


Fxyliention, The rationale of this computation is the following :— 


of the 
toa 


erlorags 


If we divide the universal solar months by the uni- 
versal adhimdsa months, we get as the measure of one 
adhimdsa month 32,5344, solar months, The double 
of this is 65;;'s's's solar months. If we divide by this 
number the double of the months of the given years, the 
quotient is the number of the partial adhimdsas. How- 
ever, if we divide by wholes plus a fraction, and want 
to subtract from the number which is divided a certain 
portion, the remainder being divided by the wholes 
only, and the two snbtracted portions being equal por- 
tions of the wholes to which they belong, the whole 
divisor stands in the same relation to its fraction as 
the divided number to the subtracted portion.

would not be necessary to double the remainder. Bunt 
the inventor of this method seems to have preferred 
the reduplication in order to get smaller numbers; for 
if we reckon with single adhimdsas, we get the fraction 
of s$3is5, which may be rednced by 96 as a common 
divisor. Thereby we get 89 as the multiplicator, and 
§400 ag the divisor. In this the inventor of the 
method as shown his sagacity, for the reason for his 
computation is the intention of getting partial lunar 
daye and emaller multiplicators, 

His method (i.e. Brahmagupta’s) for the computation Method for 
of the dnardira days is the following :— reek the 

If we divide the universal lunar days by tho uni- duya scoord. 
versal tnardira days, we get as quotient 63 and a treo 
fraction, which may be reduced oy the common divisor Page 221. 
450,000. Thus we get 6352:753 lunar days as the period 
of time within which one dnardtra day sums up. If 
we change this fraction into eleventh parts, we get 7% 
and a remainder of £3: F5b which, if expressed in 
minutes, ia equal to 0’ §9” 54”. 

Since this fraction is very near to one whole, people 
have neglected it, and use, in a rough way, 3? instead. 
Therefore, according to the Hindus, one dnardtra day 
sums up in 63}$ or 3° lunar daya. 

If we now multiply the number of tinardira days, 
which corresponds to the number of lunar daya by 
6353:75) the product is less than that which we get by 
multiplying by 637%. If we, therefore, want to divide 
the lunar days by "ff, on the supposition that the 
quotient is equal to the first number, a certain portion 
must be added to the lunar days, and this portion he 
(the author of Pulisa-Siddhanta) had not computed accu- 
rately, but only approximatively. For if we multiply 

_ the universal dnardtra days by 703, we gat the product 
17,63 3,032,650,000, which is more than eleven times the 
universal lunar days. And if we multiply the universal 
lunar days by 11, we get the product 1 7,632,989,000,000.

The difference between the two numbers is 43,650,000. _ 
If we divide by this number the product of eleven timas 
the universal lnnar days, we get as quotient 403,963.

the last-mentioned quotient (403,963 +- a fraction), hia

remains a fraction of +495, or ;°y, and this is the amount 
which is neglected. If he uses this divisor without the 
fraction, and divides by it the product of eleven times 


. the partial lunar days, the quotient would be by so much 


larger as the dividendum has increased, The other

Because the majority of the Hindus, in reckoning

ference to this method, and are particularly painstaking 
in describing the methods for the computation of the 
adhimdsa, disregarding the methods for tha compu- 
tation of the wtnardtra days and the sum of the days 
(ahargana). One of their methods of finding the ad- 
himdsa for the years of a kalpa or caturyuga or kaliyuga 
is this :— 

They write down the years in three different places. 
They multiply the upper number by 10, the middle hy 
2481, and the lower by 7739. Then they divide the 


middle and lower numbers by 9600, and the quotients 


are days for the middle number and avama for the 


lower number. 


The sum of these two qnotients is added to the 
number in the upper place. The sum represents the 
number of the complete. adhimdsa days which have 
elapsed, and the sum of that which remains in the 
other two places is the fraction of the current adhimdsa, 
Dividing the days hy 30, they get months. 

Ye'kib lbn Tarik states this method quite correctly. 
‘We shall, as an example, carry out this computation for

7739, and get the product 15,268,645,593,548. The 

latter two numbers we divide by 9600; thereby we get 

for the middJe number as quotieut 509,883,782 and a 
remainder of 8292, and for the lower number a quo- 

tieat of 1,590,483,915 and a remainder of 9548. The 

sum of these two remainders is 17,840. This fraction 

(i.e. *¥4%%°) is reckoned as one whole. Thereby the 

aum of the numbers in all three’ places | is raised to 
21,829,849,018, 1.4. adhimdsa days, plus 323 day of the 
current adhimdsa day (i.e, which is now in course of 
summing up). 

Reducing these days to months, we get 727,661,633 
months and a remainder of twenty-eight days, which 
is called Sh-D-D. This is the interval between the 
beginning of the month Caitra, which is not omitted 
in the series of months, and the moment of the vernal 
equinox. 

Further, adding the quotient which we have got for 
the middle number to the years of the kalpa, we get 
the sum of 2,482,831,914. Dividing this number by 7, 
we get the remainder 3. Therefore the sun has, in the 
year in question, entered Aries on a Tuesday, 

The two numbers which are used as multiplicators Exptans 
for the nombers in the middle ‘and lower places are to iter me 
’ be explained in the following manner :— 

Dividing the civil days of a kalpa by the solar cycles 
of a kalpa, we gotas quotient the number of days which 
compose a year, 1.6. 365):223-450-088, Reducing this 
fraction by the common divisor of 450,000, we get 
365i#is%. The fraction may be further reduced by 
being divided by 3, but people leave it as it is, in order 


tion of the

that this fraction and the other fractions whioh occur . 
in the further course of this computation should have, 
the same denominator, 

Dividing the universal dnardira days hy the solar 
years of a kalpa, the quotient is the nnmber of ¢dnardira 
days which belong to a solar year, viz. 52:$$3:cas:Su0 
days. Reducing this fraction by the common divisor _ 
of 450,000, wa get $3335 days. The fraction may fur-— 
ther be redneed. by being divided by 3. 

The measnres of solar and lunar years are about 360 
days, a3 are also the civil years of aun and moon, the 


‘ona being a little larger, the other a little shorter. The 


oue of these measures, the lunar year, is used in this 
computation, whilst the other measure, the solar year, 
is aought for. The sum of the two qucetients (of the — 
middla and lower number) isthe diffarence between the 
two kinds of years, The upper number is multiplied by 
the sum of tha complete days, and the middle and lower. 


‘numbers are multiplied by each of the two fractions, 


If we want to abbreviate the computation, and do 
not, like the Hindus, wish to find the mean motiona of 
sun and moon, wa add the two multiplicators of tha 
middia and lower numbers together, This gives tha 
sum of 10,220, 

To this sum we add, for the upper place, the product 
of the divisor X 10 = 96,000, and we get *$$33°.. 
Reducing this fraction by the half, wa get 433). 

In this chapter (p. 27) we have aiready explained 
that by multiplying the daya by 5311, and dividing 
the product by 172,800, we get tha number of tha 
adhimdsas. If wa now multiply the number of years 
instead of tha days, tha product is 3% of the product 
which we should get when multiplying by the number 
of days. If wa, therefore, want to hava the same quotient 
which we get by the first diviaion, we must divide by 
seo Of the diviaor by which we divided in the first case, 
viz. 480 (for 360 X 480 = 172,800). 


CHAPTER Lil. - qe 


- Similar to this methed is that one prescribed by Aseoma _ 
“Palisa: : “ Write down the number of the partial months Suding the 
in two different places. In the one place multiply sccondiug to 
it by 1111, and divide the product by 67,500. Sube 

tract the quotient from the number in the other place, 

and divide the remainder by 32. The quotient is the 
number of the adhimdsa months, and the fraction in 

the quotient, if there is one, represents that part of an 
adhimdsa month which is in course of formation. Mul- 
tiplying this amount by 30, and dividing the product 

by 32, the quotient represents the days and day-frac- 

tions of the current adhimdsa month.” 

The rationale of this method is the following :— 

If you divide the solar months of a caturyuga by the Explication 
adhimdsa months of a caturyuga,in accordance with the thod of 
theory of Pulisa, you get as quotient 3233:582. Ii you — 
divide the months by this nnmber, yon get the com- 
plete adhimdsa months of the past portion of the catur- 
yuga or kalpa. Pulisa, however, wanted to divide by 
» wholes alone, without any fractions. Therefore he had 
to subtract something from the dividendum, as has 
already been explained in a similar case (p. 36). We 
have found, in applying the computation to our gauge- 
year, as the fraction of the divisor, 7}t¢é35, Which may 
be reduced by being divided by 32. Thereby we get 

1111 
BF,800. 

Pulisa has, in this calculation, reckoned by the solar 
days into which a date is resolved, instead of by months. 

For he says: “ You write this number of daya in two Further 
different places. In the one place you multiply it by thom: Pulisa 
271 and divide the product by 4,050,000. The quo- 

tient you oubtract from the number in the other 

place and divide the remainder by 976. The quo- 

tient is the number of adhimdsa months, days, and 
day-fractions.” 

Further he saya: “The reason of this is, that by 
dividing the days of a caturyuga by the adhimdsa 


on the pase

months, you get as quotient 976 days and a remainder 
of 104,064. The common divisor for this number and 
for the divisor is 384. Reducing the fraction thereby, 
we get sxfiison days.” 

Here, however, I suspect either the copyist or the 
translator, for Pulisa was too good a scholar to commit 
similar blunders. The matter is this :— 

Those days which are divided by the adhimdsa 
months are of necessity solar days. The quotient cun- 
tains wholes and fractions, as has been stated. Both 
denominator and numerator have as common divisor the 


‘number 24. Iteducing the fraction thereby, we get 


prispoo for 


4536 
BE5a5* 

If we apply this rule to the months, and reduce 
the nnmber of adhimdsa months to fractions, we get 
47,800,000 28 denominator. A divisor common to both 
this denominator and its numerator is 16. Reducing 
the fraction thereby, we get x.s%5's00 

If we now multiply the nnumber which Palisa adopts 
as devisor by the just-mentioned common divisor, tc. 
384, we get the product 1,55§,200,000, viz, solar daya 
in a caturyuga, But it is quite impossible that this 
nomber should, in this part of the calculation, be 
used as a divisor. If we want to base thia method on 
the rules of Brahmagupta, dividing the universal solar 
months by the adhkimdsa months, the result will be, 
according to the method employed by him, donble the 
amount of the adhimdsa. 

Further, a similar method may be used for the com- 


tation of the putation of the dnardira daya.

He who is perfectly acquainted with the preceding Rule how to 
rules of resolution will also be able to carry out the chrypatogi 
opposite function, the composition, if a certain amount Seerain 
of past days of a kalpa or caturyuga be given. To beroraasa 
make aure, however, we sbail now repeat the necessary of teak 
rules, 

If we want to fiud the years, the days being given, 
the latter must necessarily be civil daya, i. the differ- 

ence between the lunar days and the dnardéra days. 

This difference (ic. the civi? days) stands in the same 
relation to their dnardtra as the difference between the 
universal lunar days and the universal dnardira days, 

Viz. 1,577,916,450,000, to the universal dnardtra days. 
The latter number (i.e. 1,577,916,450,000) is represented 
by 3,506,481. If we multiply the given daya by 55,739, 
and divide the product by 3,806,48!, the quotient repre- 
sents the partial ¢nardira days. Adding hereto the civil 
days, we get the number of lunar days, viz. the sum of 
the partial solar and the partial adhimdsa days. These 
Innar days stand in the same relation to the adhimdsa 
days which belong to them as the sum of the uni- 
versal solar and adhimdsa days, viz. 160,299,900,000, 
to the universal adhimdse days, which number (i.¢. 
160,299,900,000) is represented by the number 178,111. 

If you, further, multiply the partial lunar days by 
5311, aud divide the product by 178,111, the quotient 
is the number of the partial adhimdsa days. Subtract- 
ing them from the lunar daya, the remainder is the 
number of solar days. Thereupon you reduce the days 
to months by dividing them by 30, and the months to 
years by dividing them by 12. This is what we want 
to find. 

" #g. the partial civil days which have elapsed up to 


2 la ALBERUNPS INDIA, 


Apptication our gauge-year are 720,635,951,963. This number is _ 
‘feseee given, and what we want to find is, how many Indian 
ci “years and months are equal to this sum of days. ane 
_ Firat, we multiply the number by 55,739, and divide 
the product by 3,506,481. Thequotient is 11,455,224,575 
dnardira days. 
We add this number to the civil days, The aum is 
732,091,176,538 lunar days. We multiply them by 

' §311, and divide the product by 178,111. The quotient 

- is the number of adhimdsa daya, viz. 21,829,849,018. 

. We subtract them from the lunar days and get 
the remainder of 710,261,327,520, te. partial solar 
days. We divide these by 30 aud get the quotient of 
23,675,377,584, &¢ solar months, Dividing them by 
12, we get Indian years, viz. 1,972,948,132, the same 
number of years of which our gauge-date consiats, as we 
have already mentioned in & previous passage. 

Oo Yakfib lbn Tarik has a note to the same effect: 

' Balefor - «Multiply the given civil daya by the universal lunar 

oe days and divide the product by the universal civil 
: ie eer, days, Write down the quotient in two different places. 
7 In the one place multiply the number by the universal 

adhindsa days and divide the product by the universal 
lunar days. The quotient gives the adhimdsa months. 

Maltiply them by 30 and subtract the product’ from 

the number in the other place. The remainder is the 

number of partial solar days. You further reduce them 

to months aud years.” i 

The rationale of this calculation is the following :— 

Explanation We have already mentioned that the given number of 
Seen days are the difference between the lunar daya and 
their dnardira, as the universal civil days are the dif- 

ference between the universal lunar days and their 

universal tzardira. These two measnres atand in a 

: Pegs es constant relation to each other.’ Therefore we get the- 

partial lunar days which are marked in two different . 
places. Now, these are equal to the sum of the solar 


CHAPTER LIlI. 435 


and adhimdsa days, as the general Iunar daya are equal 
to the sum of universal solar days and universal adhi- 
mdaa daya. Therefore the partial and the universal. 
adhimdsa days stand in the same relation to each other 
as the two numbers written in two different places, there 
being no difference, whether they both mean months 
or days. 

The following rule of Ya'kih for the computation of Ys;ab's 


od for 


the partial dnardtra days by meanga of the partial adhi- the com 
amdsa months is found in all the manuscripts of his partial Sue 
book :—- 

“The past adhimdsa, together with the fractions of the 
current adhimdsa, are multiplied by the universal zna- 
' ¢dtra days, and the product is divided by the universal 
solar months. The quotient is added to the adhimdsa. 
The sum is the number of the past dnardtras.” 
. This rule does not, as I think, show that its author Griticiom 
knew the subject thoronghly, nor that he had mach ""*™ 
confidence either in analogy or experiment. For the 
adhimdse months which have passed of the caturyuga 
up to our gange-date are, according to the theory of 
Palisa, 1,196,525£4535- Multiplying this nnmber by 
the dnardira of the caturyuga, we get the prodnct 
30,01 1,600,068,426,57;. Dividing this number by the 
solar months, we get the quotient 578,927. Adding 
this to the adhimdsa, we get the aum 1,775,452, And 
this is not what we wanted to find. On the contrary, 
the number of dnardira days ia 18,835,700. Nor is 
the product of the multiplication of this number by 30 
that which we wanted to find. On the cvsirary, it 
is 53,263,560. Both numbers are far away from the 
truth. .

CHAPTER LIII, 


ON THE AHARGANA, OR THE RESOLUTION OF YEARS INTO 
MONTHS, ACCORDING TO BPECIAL RULES WHICH ARE 
ADOPTED IN THE CALENDARS FOR CERTAIN DATES 
OR MOMENTS OF TIME, 


Method ot Nort all the eras which in the calendars are resolved 

Suriatie” into days have epochs falling at such moments of time 

Se” ~=—s when jast an adhimdsa or dnardtra happens to be com- 
plete. Therefore the suthors of the calendars require 
for the calculation of adhkimdsa and dnardira certain 
numbers which either must be added or subtracted if 
the calculation is to proceed in good order, We shall 
communicate to the reader whatever of these rules we 
happened to learn by the study of their calendars or 
astronomical handbooks. 

First, we mention the rule of the Khandakhddyaka, 
because this calendar is the best known of all, and pre- 
ferred by the astronomers to all others. 

Method ot  Brahmagupta says: “ Take the year of the Sakakdla, 

qatiai” = subtract therefrom 587, multiply the remainder by 12, 
end add tothe product the complete months which hsve 
elapsed of the year in question, Multiply the sum by 
30, and add to the product the days which have elapsed 
of the current month. Ths sum represents the partial 
solar days, 

“ Write down this number in three different places. 
Add 3 both to the middle and lower numbers, and 
divide the lowest one by 14,945. Subtract the quotient 


CHAPTER LIII. ° 47 


from the middle number, and disregard the remainder 
which yom have got by the division. Divide the middle 
number by 976. The quotient is the number of com- 
plete adhimdsa months, and the remainder is that which 
has elapsed of the cnrrent adhimdsa month, 

“ Multiply these months by 30, and add the product 
to the upper number. The eum is the number of the 
partial lunar days, Let them stand in the upper place, 
and write the same number in the middle place, Mul- 
tiply it by 11, and add thereto 497. Write this sum 
in the lower place. Then divide the sam by 111,573. 
Subtract the quotient from the middle number, and dis- 
regard the remainder (which you get by the division). 
Farther, divide the middle number by 703, and the 
quotient represents the ¢nardtra days, the remainder 
the avamas. Subtract the dnardira days from the upper 
number. The remainder is the number of civil days.” Page 26. 

This is the ahargana of the Khandakhddyaka. Divid- 
ing the number by 7, the remainder indicates the week- 
day on which the date in question falls. 

We exemplify this rule in the case of our gauge-year. Appitention 
The corresponding year of the Sakakdla is 953. We thoi tothe 
snbtract therefrom 587, and get the remainder 366," 
We multiply it by the product of 12 X 30, since the 
date is without months and days. The product is 
131,760, 7.¢. solar days. 

We write down this number in three different places. 

We add 5 to the middle and lower numbers, whereby 
we get 131,765 in both places. We divide the lower 
number by 14,945. The quotient is 8, which we sub- 
tract from the middle number, snd here we get the 
remainder 131,757. Then we disregard the remainder 
in which the division has resulted. 

Further, we divide the middle number by 976. The 
quotient 134 represents the number of months, There 

_is besides a remainder of $73. Multiplying the months 
by 30, we get the product 4020, which we add to the

solar days, “Thereby we get lunar days, viz. 135.780. 
We write down this number below the three numbers, 
multiply it by 11, and add 497 to the product Thus 
we get the sum 1,494,077. We write this number 
below the four numbers, and divide it by 111,573. The 
quotient is 13, and the remainder, #.¢. 43,628, is dis- 
regarded. We enbtract the quotient from the middle 
number, Thus we get the remainder, 1,494,064. We 
divide it by 703. The quotient is 2125, and the re- 
mainder, i.e. avama, is 7§§. We subtract the quotient 


_ from the lanar days, and get the remainder 133,655. 


These are the civil days which we want to find. Divid- 
ing them by 7, we get 4 a3 remainder. Therefore the 
1st of the month Caitra of the gauge-year falls on a 
‘Wednesday. 

The epoch of the era of Yazdajird precedes the epoch 
of this era (v. era nr. 5, p. 7) by 11,968 days. There- 
fore the sum of the days of the era of Yazdajird up to 
our gange-date is 145,623 days. Dividing them by the 
Persian year and months, we get as the corresponding 
Persian date the year of Yazdajird 399, the 18th Isfan- 
darmadh, Before the adhimdsa month becomes com- 
plete with 30 days, there must atill elapse five ghafé, 
4, two hours. In consequence, the year is a leap year, 
and Caitra is the month which is reckoned twice in it. 

The following is the method of the canon or calendar 
Al-arkand, according to a bad translation: “If you 
want to know the Arkand, ie. ahargana, take go, mul- 
tiply it by 6, add to the product 8, and the years of 
the realm of Sindh, ze. the time till the month Safar, 
AHL 117, which corresponds to the Caitra of the year 
109. Subtract therefrom 587, and the remainder re- 
presents the years of the Shakh, 

An easier method is the following: “Take the com- 
plete years of the dera Yazdagirdi, and subtract there- 
from 33. The remainder represents the years of the 
Shakh. Or you may also begin with the original ninety 


' CHAPTER Lill, © 49 


years of the Arkand. Multiply them by 6, and add 14 © 
to the product. Add to the sum the years of the Aera 
Yazdayirds, and subtract therefrom 587. The remainder 
representa the years of the Shakh.” 

I believe that the here-mentioned Shaki is identical critteu 
with Saka. However, the result of this calculation does latter = 
not lead us to the Sakaera, but to the Gupta era, which 
here is resolved into days. . If the suthor of the Arkand 
’ ‘began with 90, multiplied them by 6, added thereto 8, 
which would give 548, and did not change this number 
by an increase of years, the matter would come to the 
same result, and would be more easy and simple. 

The first of the month Safar, which the author of the 
latter method mentions, coincides with the eighth Daimah 
of the year 103 of Yazdajird. -Therefore he makes the Page a7. 
month Caitra depend upon the new moon of Daimah, 
However, the Persian months have since that time been 
in advance of real time, because the day-quarters (after 
the 365 complete days) have no longer been inter- 
calated. According to the author, the era of the realm 
of Sindh which he mentions must precede the era of 
Yazdajird by eix years, Accordingly, the years of 
this era for our gauge-year would be 405. These 
together with the years of the Arkand, with which the 
author begins, viz. 548, represent the sum of 953 years 
as the year of the Sakakdla. By the subtraction of 
.that amount which the author has mentioned, it is 
changed into the corresponding year of the Gupia- 
kala, 

The other details of this method of resolution or 
ahargana are identical with those of the method of tha 
Khandakhddyaka, as we have described it. Sometimes 
you find ina manuscript such a reading as prescribes 
the division by 1000 instead of by 976, but this is 
simply a mistake of the manuscripts, as such a method 
is without any foundation. 

Next iollows the method of Vijayanandin in his

canon called Karanatilaka: “Take the years of the 
Sakakila, subtract therefrom 888, multiply the re- 
mainder by 12, and add to the product the complete 
months of the current year which have elapsed. Write 
down the sum in two different places. Multiply the 
one number by 900, add 661 to the product, and divide 
the sum by 29,282. The quotient represents adhimdsa 
months, Add it to the number in the second place, 
multiply the sum by 30, and add to the product the 
days which have elapsed of the current month, The 
sum represents the lunar days. Write down this num- 
her in two different places. Multiply the one number 
by 3300, add to the product 64,106, divide the sum by 
210,902. The quotient represents the tnardira days, 
and the remainder the avamas. Subtract the dnardira © 
days from the lunar days. Tho remainder is the akar- 
gana, being reckoned from midnight as the beginning.” 

We exemplify this method in the use of our gauge- 
year. We subtract from the corresponding year of the 
Sakakdla (95 3) 888, and there remains 65. This num- 
ber of years is equal to 780 months. We write down 
this number in two different places. In the one place 
we multiply it by 900, add thereto 661, and divide the 
product by 29,282. The quotient gives 233$2%5 adhi- 
masa months. 

The multiplicator is 30. By being multiplied by it, 
the months are changed into days. The product, how- 
ever, is again multiplied by 30. The divisor is the pro- 
duct of the multiplication of 976 plus the following 
fraction by 30, the effect of which is that both numbers 
belong to the same kind (4c. that both represent days). 
Further, we add the resulting number of months to 
those months which we have previously found. By 
multiplying the sum by 30, we get the product of 
24,060 (read 24,090), te. lunar days. 

We write them down in two different places. The 
one number we multiply hy 3300 and get the product

~ "99,398,000 (read 79,497,000). Adding thereto 64,106 
- (read 69,601), we get the eum 79,462,104 (read 
- 79,566,601). By dividing it by 210,902, we get the 


quotient 376 (read 307), t.e. dnardira days, and a re- 
mainder of 2£355$ (read Figs), te. the avamas. We 
snbtract the tnardira daya from the lunar days, 
written in the second place, and the remainder is 
the civil ahargana, te, the sum of the civil days, viz 
23,684 (read 23,713). 

The method of the Paiea-Siddhdntikd of Varihami- Method of 
hira is the following: “Take the years of the Sakakdla, Si Buldsdnaid, 
subtract therefrom 427. Change the remainder into 
months by multiplying it by 12, Write down that 
number in two different places. Multiply the one 
number by 7 and divide the product by 228, The 
quotiont is the number of adhimdsa months. Add 
them to the number written down in the second place, 
multiply the eum by 30, and add to the product the 
days which have elapsed of the current month. Write 
down the sum in two different places. Multiply the 
lower number by 13, add to the product 514, and divide Page 208. 
the eum by 703. Subtract the quotient from the num- 
ber written iu the upper place, The remainder you 
get is the number of the civil days.” 

This, Varahamihira says, is the method of the Sid- 
dhinta of the Greeks. 

We exemplify this method in one of our gauge-years, application 
From the years of the Sakakila we subtract 427. The Srotieato 
remainder, i.e. 526 years, is equal to 6312 months, Soe" 
The corresponding number of adhkimdsa months is 193 
and a remainder of 35. The sum of these months 
together with the other months is 6505, which are equal 
to 195,150 lunar daye. 

The additions which occur in this method are required 


‘on account of the fractions of time which adhere to the 
“epoch of the era in question. The multiplication by 7 ie

which is nearly equal to 35 (cf. p. 29). 

Ina Muhammadan canon or calendar called the canon 
Al-harkan we find the same method of calculation, but 
applied to and starting from another era, the epoch of 
which must fall 40,081 (days) after that of the era of 
Yazdajird. According to this book, the beginning of the 
Indian year falls on Sunday the 21st of Daimah of the 
year 110 cf Yazdajird.. The method may be tested i in 
the following manner :— 


“Take seventy-two years, change them into innit:

remainder in the lower place is the numher of the 
avamas. Add 1 to the number of days and divide the 
sum by 7. The remainder shows the day of the week 
on which the date in question falls.” 

This method would be correct if the months of the 
seventy-two years with which the calculation begins 
were lunar. However, they are solar months, in which 
nearly twenty-seven months must be intercalated, 
so that these seventy-two years are more than 864 
months,

Between the above-mentioned rst of Sha'bin and the auc"!

these to the number of months adopted by the author

‘Write down this number in two places. Multiply 
the one by 7, and divide the product by 228. The

get the sum 3668. Multiply it by 30, and you get the

Laukika-kala, The sum is the Sakakfila. He subtracts 
therefrom 854, and changes the remainder of years into” 
months, He writes them down together with the nast 
months of the current year in three different places. 
The lower number he multiplies by 77, and divides 
the product by 69,120. The quotient he subtracts 
from the middle number, doubles the remainder, and 
adds thereto 29. The sum he divides by 65, 80 as to 
get adhkimdsa months. He adds them to the upper 
number and multiplies the sum by 30. He writes 
down the product together with the past days of the 
current month in two different places. He multiplies 
the lower number by 11 and adds to the product 686... 
The sum he writes underneath, He dividea it by 
403,963, and adds the quotient to the middle number, 
He divides the sum by 703. The quotient represents 
the tinardira days. He aubtracts them from the upper 


. number. The remainder is the civil ahargana, x. the 


eum of the civil days of the date in question. 
We have already in a former place mentioned the 


_ outlines of this method. After the author, Darlabha, 


had adopted it for a particular date, he made some 
additions, whilst the bulk of it is unchanged. How- 


ever, the Karanasfra forbids introducing any innovations

" process. Unfortunately that which we possess of the 
book is badly translated. What we are sable to quote 
from it is the following :— 

He eubtracta $21 from the years of the Sakakéla, 
The remainder is the dasis, This would be the year - 
132 for our gauge-year. He writes down this number 
in three different places. He multiplies the first num- 
. ber by 132 degrees. The product gives the number 
17,424 for our gauge-date, He multiplies the second 
number by 46 minutes, and gets the product 6072. 
He multiplies the third number by 34, and gets the 
product 4488. He divides it by 50, and the quotient 
representa minutes, seconds, &c., viz. 89 46°. Then 
‘be adds to the sum of degrees in the upper place 
112, changing the seconds to minutes, the minutes to 


'. degrees, the degrees to circles. Thus be gets 48 circles

the sun enters Aries. ;

the moon by 12, The quotient represents days, The

represents the past portion of the adhimdsa month, 
which is at present in the course of formation. 

The suthor, in regard to the manner in which the 
measure of the adhimdsa mouth is found, makes the 
following remark :— 

He divides the lunar number which we have men- 
tioned, viz, 132” 46’ 34", by 12. Thereby he gets as 
the portio anni 11° 3' 52" 50”, and as the portio mensis

CHAPTER LIV. 


ON THE COMPUTATION OF THE MEAN PLACES OF THE 
PLANETS. 


Ig we know the number of cycles of the planets in 8 Gencrat 
kalpa or caturyuga, and further know how many cycles thedeters 
have elapsed at a certain moment of time, we also theme 
know that the sum-total of the days of the kalpa or hixecle 
caturyuga stands in the same relation to the sum-total we"™ 
of the cycles as the past days of the kalpa or caturyuga 
to the corresponding amount of planetary cycles. The 
mest generally used method is this:— 

The past days of the Aalpa or caturyuga are multi- 
plied by the cycles of the planet, or of its apsis, or of its 
node which it describes in a kalpa or caturyuga. The 
product is divided by the sum-total of the days of the 
kalpa or caturyuga accordingly as you reckon by the 
one or the other. The quotient represents complete 
cycles, These, however, because not wanted, are dis- | 
regarded. 
. he remainder which you get by the division is mul- 
tiplied by 12, and the product is divided by the sum- 
total of the days of either kalpa or caturyuga by which 
we have already once divided. The quotient repre- 
sents signs of the ecliptic. The remainder of this divi- 
sion is multiplied by 30, and the product divided by 
the same divisor. The quotient represents degrees. 
The remainder of this division is multiplied by 60, 
and is divided by the same divisor. The quotient 
represents minutes. 


- 58 ‘ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


‘This kind of computation may be continued if we 


want to have seconds and minor values. The quotient | . 


represents the place of that planet according to its 
mean motion, or the place of that apsis or that node . 
which we wanted to find. 

The same is also mentioned by Pulisa, but his 
methad differs, as follows:—*“ After having found 
the complete cycles which have elapsed at a cer- | 
tain moment of time, he divides the remainder by — 
131,493,150. The quotient represents the mean signs 


- of the ecliptic, 


“The remainder is divided by 4,383,105. The quo- 
tient represents degrees. The fourfold of the remainder 
is divided by 292,207. The quotient represents minutes, 
The remainder is multiplied by 6o and the product 
divided by the last-mentioned divisor. The quotient 
Tepresents seconds, 

“This calculation may be continued, so as to give — 
third parts, fourth parts, and minor values. The quo- 
tient thus found is the mean place of the planet which 
we want to find.” 

The fact is that Pulisa was obliged to multiply the 
remainder of the cycles by 12, and to divide the pro- 
duct by the days of a caturyuga, because his whole 
computation is based on the caturyuga. But instead 
of doing this, he divided by the quotient which you 
get if you divide the number of days of a caturyuga by 
12. This quotient is the first number he mentions, viz. - 


131,493,150. 


Farther, he was obliged to multiply the remainder 
of the signs of the ecliptic by 30, and to divide. the 
product by the first divisor; but instead of doing this, 
he divided by the quotient which you get if you divide 
the first number by 30. This quotient is the second 
number, viz. 4,383,105. , 

According to the same analogy, he wanted to divide 
the remainder of the degrees by the quotient which 


a CHAPTER LIV. . 59 
| -.you get if you divide the second number by 60. How- 
ever, making this division, he got as quotient 73,051 
and a remainder of 3. Therefore he maltiplied the 
- whole by 4, in order that the fractions should be raised 
to wholes, For the same reason he also multiplies 
the following remainder hy 4; bnt when he did not 
get wholes, as has been indicated, he returned to mul- 
tiplying by 60. 

lf we apply this method to a kalpa according to the 
theory of Brahmagupta, the first number, by which the 
. remainder of the cycles is divided, is 131,493,037,500. ° 

- The second number, by which the remainder of the 
‘signs of the ecliptic is divided, is 4,383,101,250, The 
third number, by which the remainder of the degrees 
is divided, is 73,051,687. In the remainder which we 
get by this division there is the fraction of 3. There- 
fore we take the double of the number, viz. 146,103,375, 
‘and we divide by it the double of the remainder of 
‘ minutes, 


Brahmagupta, however, does not reckon by the kalpa w Drahma. 
and caturyuga, on account of the enormous sums of nies tile 
their days, but prefers to them the Aaliyuga, in order the Laliyuga 
to facilitate the calculation. Applying the preceding ge get & atnaller 


method of akargana to the precise date of the kaliyuga, “”” 
we multiply its sum of days by the star-cycles of a 
Kalpa. To the product we add the basis, i.e, the remain~ 
ing cycles which the planet had at the beginning of 
the kaliyuga. We divide the sum by the civil days 
of the kaliyuga, viz. 157,791,645. The quotient repre- 
sents the complete cycles of the planet, which are dis- 
regarded, - 

The remainder we compute in the above-described 
manner, and thereby we find the mean place of the 
planet. 

The here-mentioned bases are the eee for the 
“single planets :—

the following method ;—* The ahargana, tc. the sum of 
the days of the date, is, for each planet respectively, - 
autre qultiplied by a certain number, and the product is 
divided by another number. The quotient represents 


- complete cycles and fractions of cycles, according to 


mean motion. Sometimes the computation becomes 
perfect simply by this multiplication and division. 
Sometimes, in order to get a perfect result, you are 
compelled once more to divide by a certain number 
the days of the date, either such as they are, or multi- 
plied by some number, The quotient must then be 
combined with the result obtained in the first place. 
Sometimes, too, certain numbers are adopted, as eg. 
the basis, which must either be added or subtracted for 
this purpose, in order that the mean motion at the 
beginning of the era shonid be computed as beginning 
with o° of Aries. This is the method of the books 


' Khandakhddyaka and Karanatilaka. However, the 


author of the Karanasdra computes the mean places of

CHAPTER LY. 


ON THE ORDER OF THE PLANETS, THEIR DISTANCES 
AND SIZES, 


WHEN speaking of the lokas, we have inniys given a 
“quotation from the Vishnuu-Purdna and from the com- - 
mentary of Patafijali, according to which the place of . 
the aun is in the order of the planets below that of the 
moon, This is the traditional view of the Hindus, 
Compare in particular the following passage of the 
Matsya-Purdna :— 

“The distance of heaven from the earth is equal to 
the radius of the eatth. The sun is the lowest of all - 
planets, Above him there is the moon, and above 
the moon are the lunar stations and their stars. - 
Above them is Mercury, then follow Venus, Mars, 
Jupiter, Saturn, the Great Bear, and above it the pole, 
The pole is connected with the heaven. The stars can- 
not be counted by man. Those who impugn this view 
inaintain that the moon at conjunction becomes hidden 
by the aun, as the light of the lamp becomes invisible’ 
in the light of the sun, and she: becomes more visible 
the more she moves away from the sun.” 

- We shall now give some quotations from the books 
of this schol relating to the sun, the moon, and the 
stars, and we shall combine herewith the views of the 
astronomers, althongh of the latter we have only a vary 
slender knowledge. 

The Vdyu-Purdna says: “The sun has globular 
shape, fiery nature, and 1000 rays, by which he attracts 


CHAPTER LY. 63 


the water; 400 of these are for the rain, 300 for the Quotations 
snow, and 300 for the air.” Paige 

In another passage it says: “Some of them (i+. the 
rays) are for this purpose, that the devas should live in 
bliss; others for the purpose that men should live in 
comfort, whilst others are destined for the fathers.” 

In another passage the anthor of the Vdyu-Purdna 
divides the rays of the sun over the six seasons of the 
year, saying: “The sun illuminates the earth in that 
third of the year which commences with o° of Pisces 
by 300 rays; he causes rain in the following third by 
400 rays, and he causes cold and snow in the remain- 
ing third by 300 rays.” 

’ Another passage of the same book runs as follows: 
“The rays of the snn and the wind raise the water 
from the sea to the sun. Now, if the water dropped 
down from the sun, it would be hot. Therefore the sun 
handa the water over to the moon, that it should drop 
down from the moon cold, and thus refresh the world.” 

Another passage: “The beat of the sun.and his 
light are one-fourth of the heat and the light of the fire. 
In the north, the ‘sun falls into the water during the 
night; therefore he becomes red.” 

Another passage: “In the beginning there were the 
earth, water, wind, and heaven. Then Brahman per- 
‘ceived sparks under the earth. He brought them forth 
and divided them into three parts. One third of them 
is the common fire, which requires wood and is extin- 
guished by water. Another third is the sun, and the 
last third is the lightning. In the animals, too, there is 
fire, which cannot be extinguished by water. The sun 
attracts the water, the lightning shines through the 
rain, but the fire in the animals is distributed over the 
moist substances by which they nourish themselves.” 

The Hindus seem to believe that the heavenly bodies 
nourish themselves by the vapours, which also Aris- 
totle mentions as the theory of certain people, Thus 


°

the author of the Vishnu-Dharma explains that “the 
sun nourishes the moon and the etars, If the sun did 
not exist, there would not be a star, nor angel, nor man.” 

The Hindus believe regarding the bodies of all the 

stats that they have a globular shape, a watery essence, 
and that they do not shine, whilet the sun alone is of fiery 
essence, self-shining, and per accidens illuminates other 
stars when they stand opposite to him. They reckon, ac- 
cording to eyesight, among the etarsa also such luminous 
bodies as in reality are not stars, but the lights into 
which those men have been metamorphosed who have 
received eternal reward from God, and reside in the 
height of heaven on thrones of crystal The Vishnu- 
, Dharma says: “The stars are watery, and the rays of 
the sun illuminate them in the night. Those who by 
their pions deeds have obtained a place in the height 
git there on their thrones, and, when shining, they are 
reckoned among the stars.” 

All the stars are called téra, which word is derived 
from farana, ic. the passage. The idea is that those 
saints have passed through the wicked world and have - 
reached bliss, and that the stars pass through heaven in 
a circular motion. The word nakshatra is limited to 

the stars of the lunar stations. As, however, all of 
these are called fixed stars, the word nakshatra also 
applies to all the fixed etars; for it means not increas~ 
ing and not decreasing. I for my part am inclined to 
think that this increasing and decreasing refers to their 
number and to the distances of the one from the other, 
but the author of the last-mentioned book (Vishnu- 
Dharma) combines it with their light. For he adds, 
“as the moon increases and decreases.” 

Further, there is a passage in the same book where 
Markandeya says: “ The stars which do not perish be- 
fore the end of the kalpa are. equal to a nikharea, ie, 
100,000,000,000. ‘The number of those which fall down 
before the end of a kalpa is unknown. Only he can 
know it who dwells in the height during a Xalpa.” 


. CHAPTER LY. 65° 


__‘Vajra spoke : “ O Markandeya, thou hast lived during 

six kalpas, This is thy seventh kalpa. Therefore why 
dost thon not know them ?” 

He answered: “If they always remained in the same 
condition, not changing as long as they exist, I should 
uot be ignorant of them. However, they perpetually 
raise some pious man and bring another down to the 
earth. Therefore I do not keep them in my memory.” 

Regarding the diameters of eun and moon and their On the ais- 
shadows the Hatsya-Purdna ssys: “The diameter of the planote 
thie body of the sun is 9000 yojanae; the diameter of 
the moon is the double of it, and the apsis is as much 
as the two together,” 

‘ The same occurs in the Vdyu-Purdna, except that it 
says with regard to the apsis that it is equal to the sun 
when it is with the sun, and that it is equal to the 
moon when it is with the moon. 

Another author says: “ The apsis is 50,000 yojanas.” 

Regarding the diameters of the planets the Matsya- 
Purdna says: “The circumference of Venus is one- 
sixteenth of the circumference of the moon, that of pages; 
Jupiter three-fourtha of the circumference of Venns, 
that of Saturn or Mars three-fourths of that of Jupiter, 
that of Mercury three-fourths of that of Mars,” 

The same statement is also found in the Vadyu-Purdna. 

The same two books fix the circumference of the on the cir 
great fixed stars as equal to that of Mercury. The next cr the txed 
smaller class have a circumference of 500 yojanas, the —_ 
following clasees 400, 300, and 200. But there are no 
fixed stars with a smaller circumference than 150 yojanae, 

Thus the Vdyu-Purdya, But the Matsya-Purdna 
says: “ The next following classes have a circumference 
of 400, 300, 200, and 100 yojanas. But there is no fixed 
star with less circumference than a half yojana.” 

The latter statement, however, looks suspicious to 
me, and is perbaps a fault in the manuscript. 

The author of Vishnu-Dharma says, sea the

words of Markandeya: “Adhtit, the Falling Eagle; 
Ardré, the Sirius Yemenicus; Rohint, or Aldsbarin; 
_ Punarvasu, ie. the Two Heads of the Twins; Pushya, 
Revatt, Agastya or Canopus, the Great Bear, the master 
of Vayu,.the master of Ahkirbudhnya, and the master 
of Vasishtha, each of these stars has a circumfer- 
ence of five yojanas, All the other stars have each 
only a circumference of four yojanas, I do not know 
those stars, the distance of which is not measurable. 
They have a circumference between four yojanas and 
two kuroh, i.e. two miles, Those which have less cir- 
cumference than two kuroh are not seen by men, but 
only by the devas.” ; 

The Hindus have the following theory regarding the ~ 
magnitude of the stars, which is not traced back to any 
known suthority : “ The diameters of the sun and moon 
are each 67 yojanas; that of the spsis is 100; that of 
Venus 10, of Jupiter 9, of Saturn 8, of Mars 7, of Mer- 
cury 7.” 

This is all we have been able to learn of the confused 


wtrnoners DOtions of the Hindus regarding these subjects. We 
sajecte” Shall now pass on to the views of the Hindu astro- 


nomers with whom we agree regarding the order of the 
planets and other topics, viz. that the sun is the middle 
of the planets, Saturn and the moon their two ends, 
and that the fixed stars are above the planets. Some 
of these things have already been mentioned in the 
preceding chapters. 

Varabamihira says in the book Samhkitd: “The moon 
is always below the sun, who throws his rays upon her, 


i » and lits upthe one half of her body, whilst the other 


-half remains dark and shadowy like a pot which you 
-place in the sunshine. The one half which faces the 
sun is lit up, whilst the other half which does not face 
it remains dark. The moon is watery in her essence, 


therefore the rays which fali on her are reflected, as. 


they are reflected from the water and the mirror towards 


- CHAPTER LY. 67 


the wall, If the moon is in conjunction with the sun, 
the white part of her turns towards the sun, the black 
part towards us. Then the white part sinks downward 
towards us slowly, as the sun marches away from the 
moon.” . 

Every edacated man among the Hindu theologians, 
and much more so among their astronomers, believes 
indeed that the moon is below the sun, and even below 
all the planets. 

The only Hindn traditions we have regarding the Te cathe 
distances of the stars are those mentioned by Ya'kub Isiaoee 
Ibn Tarik in his hook, Zie Composition of the Spheres, 
and he had drawn his information from the well-known 

‘Hindu scholar who, a.H. 161, accompanied an embassy 
to Bagdad. First, he gives a metrological statement: 
“A finger is equal to six barleycorns which are put 
one by the side of the other, An arm (yard) is eqnal to 
twenty-four fingers. A farsakh is equal to 16,000 yards.” 

Here, however, we must observe that the Hindus do 
not know the farsakh, that it is, as we have already 
explained, equal to one half a yeana. 

Further, Ya‘kfb says: “ The diameter of the earth is 
2100 farsakh, its cirenamference 6596,°, farsakh.” 

On this basis he has computed the distances of the 
planets as wo exhibit them in the following table. 

However, this statement regarding the size of the Pulls and 
earth is by no means generally agreed to by all the taon taon the fe 

_ Hindus. So, eg. Pulisa reckons its diameter as 1600 jet. 
_ ydjanas, and its circumference as 5026} yojanas, whilst 
Brahmagupta reckons the former as 1581 yojanas, and 
the latter as 5000 yojanaa 

If we double theseuumbers, they ought to be equal to 

the numbers of Ya‘kfib; bnt this is not the case, Now 
the yard and the mile are respectively identical accord- 
ing to the measurement both of us and of the Hindus. 
According to onr computation the radius of the earth is 
3184 miles. Reckoning, according to the custom of our 


68 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


' country, rfarsakh = 3 miles, we get 6728 farsath ; and 
reckoning 1 farsakh = 16,000 yards, as is mentioned by 
Pageax. Ya'kfib, we get 5046 fareakh, Reckoning 1 yojana = 
32,000 yards, we get 2523 yojanas,

- This theory differs from that on which Ptolemy has Ptolemy on 
based his computation of the distances of the planets tanooe ofthe 
in the Kitdd-almanshirdi, and in which he has been Pago 236. 
followed hoth by the ancient and the modern astrono- 
mers, It is their principle that the greatest distance 
of a planet is equal to its smallest distance from the 
_ next higher planet, and that between. the two globes 
there is not a space void of action. 

According to this theory, there is between the two 
globes a space not occupied by either of them, in which 
there is something like an axia around which the rota- . 
tion takes place, It seems that they attributed to the 
sether a certain gravity, in consequence of which they 
felt the necessity of adopting something which Keeps or 
holds the inner globe (the planet) in the midst of the 
outer globe (the ether). 

It is well known among all astronomers that there on occults- 
ig no possibility of distinguishing between the higher juniax 
and the lower one of two planets except by means of 
the occultation or the increase of the parallax. However, 
the occultation occurs only very seldom, and only the 
parallax of a single planet, viz. the moon, can be ob- 
served. Now the Hindus helieve that the motions are 
equal, but the distances different. The reason why the - 
higher planet: moves more slowly than the lower is the 
greater extension of its sphere (or orbit); and thereason 
why the lower planet moves more rapidly is that its 
sphere or orbit is less extended. Thus, ¢g. one minute 
in the sphere of Saturn is equal to 262 minutes in the 
sphere of the moon. Therefore the times in which 
Saturn and the moon traverse the same space are dif- 
ferent, whilst their motions are equal, 

I have never found a Hindn treatise on this subject, 
but only numbers relating thereto acattered in various 
books—numbers which are corrupt. Somebody objected 
. to Pulisa thaf he reckoned the circumference of the 
sphere of each planet es 21,600, and its radius as 3438,

~ the earth as 2,598,900, and the distance of the fixed stars

‘mer numbers were minutes, the latter yojanas; whilst

whilst Varabamihira reckoned the sun’s distance from 


in another passage he says that the distance of the fixed _ 


stars from the earth is sixty times larger than the distance 
of the sun. Accordingly he ought to have reckoned 
the distance of the fixed stars as 155,934,000,

_ Giasanoes of ig based on @ principle which is unknown to me in the 


: ~ 


“present etage of my knowledge, and as long as I hava 


no facility in translating the books of the Hindus, The 
principle is this, that the extension of a minute in the 
orbit of the moon is equal to fifteem yojanas, The nature 


of this principle is not cleared up by the commentaries | 


of Balabbadra, whatsoever trouble he takes, For he 
says: “People have tried to fix by observation the 
time of the moon’s passing through the horizon, .¢, the 
time between the shining of the first part of her body 
and the rising of the whole, or the time between the 
beginning of her setting and the completion of the 
act of setting. People have found this process to 
last thirty-two minutes of the circumference of the 
sphere” However, .if it is difficult to fix by obser- 
vation the degrees, it is much more so to fix the 
minutes, 

Further, the Hindus have tried to determine by 


observation the yojanas of the diameter of the moon, 


and have found them to be 480. If you divide them 
by the minutes of her body, the quotient is 15 yojanas, 
as corresponding to one minute, If you multiply it by 
the minutes of the circumference, you get the product 


324,000. ‘This is the measure of the sphere of the 


moon which she traverses in each rotation, If you 
multiply this number by the cycles of the moon in a 
kalpa or caturyuga, the product is the distance which

the moon traverses in either of them. ‘According to- 
Brahmagupta, this is in a kalpa 18,712,069,200,000,000 
yojanas. Brahmagupta calls this number the yojanas of 
the ecliptic. 

Evidently if you divide this number by the cycles 
of each planet in a dalpa, the quotient represents the 
yojanas of one rotation, However, the motion of the 
' planets is, according to the Hindus, ‘as we have 
‘ already mentioned, in every distance one and the 
same. Therefore the quotient representa the measure 
of the path of the ephere of the planet in question. 

As further, according to Brahmagupta, the relation of 
the diameter to the circumference is nearly equal to The s panei 
‘that of 12,959: 40,980; you multiply the measure of or the r dis 
the path of the sphere of the planet by 12,959, and the contre 
divide the product by 81,960. The quotient is the computed 
radius, or the distance of the planet from the centre of Rraum Brahma a” 
the earth. ‘ 

We have made this computation for all the planets 
according to the theory of Brahmagupta, and present 
the results to the reader in the following table :—

garded the fractions smaller than 4, and have reduced 
larger fractions to wholes) We have, however, not 
taken the same liberty in the calculation of the circum- 
ferences, but have calculated with the utmost accuracy, 
because they are required in the computations of the . 
revolutions. For if you divide the yojanas of heaven in - 
a kalpa or caturyuga by the civil days of the one or the

traverses, Itstands in the same relation to the yojanas 
of the circumference of its sphere as its motion, which 
we want to find, to the circumference, the latter being 
divided into 360 equal parts. If you therefore multiply 
the path common to all the planets by 360 and divide 
the product by the yojanas of the circumference of the. 
planet in question, the quotient represents its mean 
daily motion.

calculation has been epplied to the minutes of the 
diameter of the sun, which we have found to be equal 
to 6522 yojanas according to Brahmagupta, and equal 
to 6480 according to Pulisa. Since Pulisa reckons the 
minutes of the body of the moon as 32, te. a power of 
2, he divides this number in order to get the minutes 
of the bodies of the planets by 2, till he at last gets 
1. Thusjhe attributes to the body of Venus 3 of 32

of ita orbit, which is found in the computations of the 
corrections of sun and moon. AB is the diameter of. 
the body of the sun, CD is the diameter of the earth, 
CDH is the cone of the shadow, HL is its elevation. 
Further, draw CR parallel to DB. Then is AR the 
difference between AB and CD, and the normal line 
CT is the middle distance of the sun, te. the radius of 
its orbit derived from the yojanas of heaven (¥. p. 72). 
From this the true distance of the sun always differs, 
sometimes being larger, sometimes amaller. We draw 
CK, which is of course determined by the parts of the 
sine, It stands in the same relation to CT, this being 
the sinus totus (=radius), as the yojanas of CK to the 
yojanas of CT. Hereby the measure of the diameter i ig 
reduced to yojanas. 

The ygjanas of AB stand in the same relation to the 
yojanas of TC as the minutes of AB to the minntes 
of TC, the latter being the sinus totus. Thereby AB 
becomes known and determined by the minutes of the 
sphere, because the sinus totus is determined by the 

Quotations Measure of the circumference. For this reason Pulisa 
fnhae-” says: “Multiply the yganas of the radius of the sphere 
- yt, of the sun or the moon by the true distance, and 
divide the product by the sinus totus. By the qnotient 
you get for the sun, divide 22,278,240, and by the 
quotient you get for the moon, divide 1,650,240. The 
quotient then represents the minutes of the diameter of 
the body of either sun or moon.” 

The last-mentioned two numbers are products of the 
multiplication of the yojanas of the diameters of sun 
and moon by 3438, which is the number of the minutes 
of the sinus totus. 

Likewise Brahmagupta says: “ Multiply the yojanasa 
of sun or moon by 3416, ae. the minutes of the sinus 
totus, and divide the product by the yojanas of the 
radius of the sphere of sun or moon.” But the latter 
rule of division is not correct, because, according to it, 


’ CHAPTER LV. . 75 


the ‘measure of the body would not vary (v. p. 74). 
Therefore the commentator Balabhadra holds the same 
opinion as Palisa, viz. that the divisor in this division 
should be the true distance reduced (to the measure 
of yojanas). 

Braimagupta gives the following rule for the com- Brahms 
putation of the diameter of the shadow, which in our froth for 
canones is called the measure of the sphere of the dragon's tation of the 
head and tail: “Subtract the yojanas of the diameter the ansdow. 
of the earth, ie, 1581, from the yojanas of the diameter 
of the sun, fe 6522. There remains 4941, which is 
kept in memory to be used as divisor. It is represented 
in the figure by AR. Further multiply the diameter 
‘of the earth, which is the double sinus totus, by the 
yojanas of the true distance of the sun, which is found 
by the correction of the sun. Divide the product by 
the divisor kept in memory. The quotient is the true 
distance of the shadow's end. 

' “Evidently the two triangles ARC and CDH are 
similar to each other. However, the normal line CT 
does not vary in size, whilst in consequence of the 
true distance the appearance of AB varies, though its 
size is constantly the same. Now let this distance be 
CK. Draw the lines AJ and RV parallel to each other, 
and JKV parallel to AB. Then the latter is equal to 
the divisor kept in memory. 

“ Draw the line JOM. Then M is the head of the cone 
of the shadow for that time. The relation of JV, the 
divisor kept in memory, to KC, the true distance, is 
the same as that of CD, the diameter of the earth, to 
ML, which he (Brahmagupta) calls a true distance (of Page 40. 
the shadow’s end), and it is determined by the minutes 
of the sine (the earth’s radius being the sinus totus). 

For KC——” 

Now, bowever, I euspect that in the following some- Lecuna {a 
thing has fallen ont in the manuscript, for the author snp oo oany 
continues: “Then multiply it (ie. the quotient of CK, gupta 


96 - ALBERUNTS INDIA: 


by the divisor kept in memory) by the diameter of the 
earth. The product is the distance between the earth’s 
centre and the end of the shadow. Subtract there- 
from the true distance of the moon and multiply the 
remainder by the diameter of the earth. Divide the 
product by the true distance of the shadow’s end. 
The quotient is the diameter of the shadow in the 
sphere of the moon. Further, we suppose the true 
distance of the moon to be LS, and FN is a part of the 
lunar sphere, the radius of which is LS. Since wo 
have found LM as determined by the minutes of the 
sine, it stands in the same relation to CD, this being 
the double sinus éofus, as MS, measured in minutes of 
the sine, to XZ, measured in minutes of the sine.” 

Here I suppose Brahmacupta wished to reduce LM, 
the true distance of the shadow’s end, to yojanas, 
which is done by multiplying it by the yojanas of the 
diameter of the earth, and by dividing the product by 
the double sinus totus. The mentioning of this division 
has fallen out in the manuscript; for without it the 
multiplication of the corrected distance of the shadow's 
end by the diameter of the earth is perfectly superfluous, 
and in no way required by the computation. 

Further: “ If the number of yojanas of LM is known, 
LS, which is the true distance, must alse be reduced to 
yojanas, for the purpose that MS should be determined 
by the same measure. The measure of the diameter of 
the shadow which is thus found represents yojanas. 

Farther, Brahmagupta says: “Then multiply the 
shadow which has been found by the sinus ¢otus, and 
divide the product -by the true distance of the moon. 
The quotient represents the minutes of the shadow 
which we wanted to find.” 

Critidsme However, if the shadow which he has found were 
suas” determined by yojanas, he ought to have multiplied it 
by the donble sinus totus, and to bave divided the pro- 
duct .by the yojanas of the diameter of the earth, in 


CHAPTER LV. -- 77 


order to find the minutes of the shadow. Ent as he has 
not done so, this shows that, in his computation; he 
limited himself to“determining the true diameter in 
minutes, Without reducing it to yojanas. 

The ‘anthor uses the true (sphufa) diameter without 
its having been reduced to yojanas. Thus he finds that 
the shadow in the circle, the radius of which is LS, is 
the true diamoter, and this is required for the compu- 
tation of the circle, the radius of which is the sinus 
totus, The relation of ZX, which he has already found, 
to SL, the true distance, is the same as the relation of 
ZX in the measure which is sought to SL, this being 
the sinus totus. On the basis of this equation the 
reduction (to yojanas) must be made. 

In another passage Brahmagnpta says: “The dia- another 
meter of the earth is 1581, the diameter of the moon hanes, 
480, the diameter of the sun 6522, the diameter of the gouging 
shadow 1581. Snbtract the ygjanas of the earth from ane 
the yojanas of the ann, there remains 4941, Multiply 
this remainder by the yojanas of the true distance of 
the moon, and divide the product by the yojanas of the 
true distance of the sun. Snbtract the quotient you 
get from 1581, and the remainder is the measure of the 
shadow in the sphere of the moon. Multiply it by 
3416, and divide the product by the yojanas of the middle 
radius of the sphere of the moon. The quotient represents 
the minutes of the diameter of the shadow. 

“Evidently if the yojanas of the diameter of the earth 
are subtracted from the yojanas of the diameter of the 
sun, the remainder is AR, t.e. JV. Draw the line VCF 
and let fall the normal line KC on O, Then the relation 
of the surplus JV to KC, the true distance of the sun, is 
the same as the relation of ZF to OC, the true distance 
ofthe moon. It is indifferent whether these two mean 
diameters are reduced (to yojanas) or not, for ZF is, in this 
case, found as determined by the measure of yojana. ~ 

“ Draw XN as equal to OF. Then ON is necessarily 


78 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


equal to the diameter of CD, and its sought-for part is 
‘ZX. The number which is thus found must be sub- 
tracted from the diameter of the earth, and the remainder 
will be Z™.” 
The author For such mistakes as occur in this computation, the 
the corrupt author, Brahmagupta, is not to be held responsible, but 
manuscript WO rather suspect that the fault lies with the mann- 
wpa. script. We, however, cannot go beyond the text we 
Fares have at our disposal, as we do not know how it may be 
in a correct copy. 


The measure of the shadow adopted by Brahma- 
gupta, from which he orders the reader to subtract, 
cannot be a mean one, for a mean measure stands in the 
midst, between too little and too mnch. Further, we 
cannot imagine that this measure should be the greatest 
of the measures of the shadow, including the plus (?) ; for 
ZF, which is the minus, is the base of a triangle, of 
which the one side, FC, cuts SL in the direction of the 
sun, not in the direction of the end of the shadow. 
Therefore ZF has nothing whatsoever to do with the 
shadow (conjectural rendering.) 


CHAPTER LV. — 79 


Lastly, there is the possibility that the minus belongs 
to the diameter of the moon. In that case the relation 
of ZX, which has been determined in yojanaz, to SL, 
the yojanas of the true distance of the moon, is the 
same as the relation of ZX reckoned in minutes to SL, 
this being the sinus totus (conjectural rendering.) 

By this method is found what Brahmagupta wants to 

‘find, quite correctly, without the division by the mean 
radius of the sphere of the moon, which is derived from 
the yojanas of the sphere of heaven (v, p. 72). (For the 
last three passages vide Wotes.) 

The methods of the computation of the diameters of the compn- 
sun and moon, as given by the Hindn canones, such a3 dumace 
the Khandakhddyoka and Karanaséra, are the same as tones 
are found in the canon of Alkhwarizmt, Also the com- "one ° 
putation of the diameter of the shadow in the Khanda-"""™ 
khddyaka is similar to that one given by Alkhwarizmi, 
whilst the Karanasara has the following method :~ 
“Multiply the biukét of the moon by 4 and the bhukti 
of the sun by 13. Divide the difference between the 
two products by 30, and the quotient is the diameter of 
the shadow.” 

The Karanatilaka gives the following method for the piameter ot 
computation of the diameter of the san:——“ Divide the otiesta. 
bhukti of the sun by 2, and write down the half in twohwisae’ 
different places, In the one place divide it by ro, and Ain ™” 
add the quotient to the number in the second place. 

The sum is the number of minutes of the diameter of 
the sna.” 

In the computation of the diameter of the moon, he 
firat takes the bkukti of the moon, adds thereto ,',th of 
it, and divides the number by 25. The quotient is the 
number of the minutes of the moon’s diameter. 

In the computation of the diameter of the shadow, 
he multiplies the dhukéi of the sun by 3, and from the 
prodnct he subtracts y,th of it. The remainder he anb- 
tracts from the bhukti of the moon, and the donble of 


Page 242. 


80 ALBERUNES INDIA. 


the remainder he divides by 15. The quotient is the 
number of the minutes of the dragon's head and 
tail. 

If we would indulge in further quotationa from the 
canones of the Hindus, we should entirely get away from 
the subject of the present book. Therefore we restrict 
ourselves to quote from them only subjects more or less 
connected with the special subject of this book, which 
either are noteworthy for their strangeness, or which 
are unknown among our people (the Muslims) and in 
our (the Muslim) countries,

CHAPTER LVI. 
ON THE STATIONS OF THE MOON. 


Tue Hindus use the lunar stations exactly in the same onthe 
way as the zodiacal signs. As the ecliptic is, by the tyewlunar 
zodiacal signs, divided into twelve equal parts, so, by *“™* 
the lunar stations, it is divided into twenty-seven equal 
parts, Each station occupies 13} degrees, or 800 minutes 
of the ecliptic. The planets enter into them and leave 
them again, and wander to and fro through their nor- 
thern and southern latitudes. The astrologera attribute 
to cach station a special nature, the quality of foreboding 
events, and other particular characteristic traits, in the 
same way as they attribute them to the zodiacal signs. 

The number 27 rests on the fact that the moon passes 
through the whole ecliptic in 27¢ days, in which nnm- 
ber the fraction of 3 may be disregarded. In a similar ransrsts- 
way, the Arabs determine their lunar stations ag begin- i 
ning with the moon’s first becoming visible in the west 
till her ceasing to be visible in the east. Herein they 
use the following method :— 

Add to the circumference the amount of the revoln- 
tion of the sun in a lunar month. Subtract from the 
sum the march of the moon for the two days called 
almihdk (i.¢, the 28th and 29th daya of a lunation). 
Divide the remainder by the march of the moon for one 
day. The quotient is 27 aud a little more than 3, which 
fraction must be counted as a whole day. 

However, the Arabs are illiterate people, who can 
neither write nor reckon, They only rely upon numbers 
and eyesight. They have no other medinm of research 
than eyesight, ana are not able to determine the lunar 
stations withont the fixed stars in them. If the Hindus 

VOL, IZ, - F 


83 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


want to describe the single stations, they agree with 
the Arabs regarding certain atars, whilst regarding 
others they differ from them. On the whole, tha Arabs 
keep near to the moon’s path, and use, in describing the 
stations, only those fixed stars with which the moon 
either stands in conjunction at certain times, or through 
the immediate neighbourhood of which she passes. 


Whether the The Hindus do not strictly follow the same line, but 
Eevatwenty. also take into account the various positions of one star 


a 


with reference to the other, ¢g. one star's standing in 
opposition or in the zenith of another. Besides, they 
reckon also the Falling Eagle among tha stations, so as 
to get 28. 

It is this which has led our astronomere and the 
suthors of ‘axe? books astray; for they say that the 
Hindus have twenty-eight lunar stations, but that they 
leave out one which is always covered hy the rays of the 
sun. Perhaps they may have heard that the Hindas call 
that station in which the moon is, the burning one; 
that station which it has just left, the left one after the 
embrace; and that station in which she will enter next, 
the smoking one. Some of our Mualim authors have main- 


_ tained that the Hindus leave out the station Al-zubdnd, 


"i 


and account for it by declaring that the moon’s path is 
burning in the end of Libra and the beginning of Scorpio. 

All this is derived from one and the same source, viz. 
their opinion that the Hindus have twenty-eight atations, 
and that under certain circumstances they drop one. 
Whilst just the very opposite is the case; they have 
twenty-seven stations, and under certain circumstances 
add one. 

Brahmagupta says that in the book of the Veda there 
is a tradition, derived from the inhabitants of Mount 
Meru, to this effect, that they see two suna, two moons, 
and fifty-four lunar stations, and that they have douhle 
the smount of days of ours. Then he tries to refute this 
theory by the argument that we do not see the fish (sic) 
of the pole revolve twice in a day, but only once. I for 


CHAPTER LVI. 83 


my part have no means of arraying this erroneous sen- 
tence in a reasonable shape. 

Tho proper method for the computation of the place methos for 
of a star or of a certain decree of a lunar atation is this:— the Place et 

Take its distance from o° Aries in minntes, and divide degre ots 
them by 800. The quotient represente whole stations ica. ean 
preceding that station in which the starin question stands. 

Then remains to be found the particular place within 
the station in question, Now, either star or degree is 
simply determined according to the 800 parts of the 
atation, and reduced by a common denominator, or the 
degrees are reduced to minutes, or they are multiplied 
by 60 and the product is divided by 800, in which case 
the quotient represents that part of the station which 
the moon has in that moment already traversed, if the 
station is reckoned as 4. 

These methods of computation suit as well the moon 
as the planets and other atars, The following, however, 
applies exclusively to the moon:—The product of the 
multiplication of the remainder (¢, the portion of the 
incomplete lunar station) by 60 is divided by the dhukti 
of the moon. The quotient shows how much of the 
lunar nakshatra day has elapsed. 

The Hindus are very little informed regarding the Tabloof the 

fixed stars, I never came across any one of them who tos taken 
knew the single stars of the lunar stations from eye- Klasde- 
sight, and was able to point them out to me with his ““”™* 
fingers, I have taken the greatest pains to investigate 
this subject, and to settle most of it by all sorts of com- 
parisons, and have recorded the results of my research 
in a treatise on the determination of the lunar stations. 
Of their theories on this subject I shall mention as 
much as I think suitable in the present context. But 
before, that I shall give the positions of the stations in 
longitude and latitude and their numbers, according to 
the canon Khandakhddyaka, facilitating the study of 
the subject by comprehending all details in the follow-

The notions of the Hindus regarding the stars are 
not free from confusion, They are only little skilled in 
practical observation and calculation, and have no under- 
standing of the motions of the fixed stars. So Variha- 

On the pre- mihira saya in his book Sazmhitd: “In six stations,

tatian ‘froma servation precedes calculation, so that the moon enters

culation, she leaves it in order to enter the follow- 
ing.” . 

Theaxthor My remark relating to the confused notions of the 

Yesmmt Hindus regarding the stars is confirmed, though this is - 

ment. perhaps not apparent to the Hindus themselves, e.g. by 
the note of Varahamihira regarding Alsharafdn = Asvini, 
one of the first-mentioned six stations; for he says that 
in it observation precedes calculation. Now the two stars 
of Afvini stand, in our time, in two-thirds of Aries (ze. 
between 10°-20° Aries), and the time of Varihamihira 
precedes our time by about 526 years. Therefore by 
whatever theory you may compute the motion of the 
fixed stars (or precession of the equinoxes), the Aévint- 
did, in his time, certainly not stand in less than one- 
third of Aries (ic. they had not come in the precession 
of the eqninoxes farther than to 1°-10° Aries). 

Supposing that, in Ais time, Afgvint really stood in 
this part of Aries or near it, as is mentioned in the 
Khandakhddyaka, which gives the computation of sun 


CHAPTER LVi. 87 


and moon in a perfectiy correct form, we must state 
that at that time there was not yet known what is now 
known, viz. the retrograde motion of the star by the 
distance of eight degrees. How, therefore, could, in 
his time, observation precede calculation, since the 
moon, when standing in conjunction with the two stars, 
had already traversed nearly two-thirds of the first sta- 
tion? According to the same analogy, also, the other 
etatements of Varahamihira may be examined, 

The stations occupy a smaller or larger space ac- Esch sta- 
cording to their figures, ic. their constellations, not ples tne” 
they themselves, for all stations occupy the same space onthe 
on the ecliptic, This fact does not seem to be known“? 
to the Hindus, although-we have already related similar 
notions of theirs regarding the Great Bear. For Brah- 
magupta says in the Uttara-chandakhddydka, i.e. the 
emendation of the Khanda-khddyaka :— 

“The measure of some stations exceeds the measure Quotation 
of the mean daily motion of the moon by one half, ea orange 
Accordingly their measure is 19° 45’ §2” 18”. There 
are six stations, viz Rohini, Punarvasu, Uttaraphal- 
guni, Viéikha, Uttarashadha, Uttarabhadrapada. These 
together occupy the space of 118° 35’ 13” 48”. Fur- 
ther six stations are short ones, each of them ocenpying 
less than the mean daily motion of the moon by one 
half. Accordingly their measnre is 6° 35’ 17” 26”. 
These are Bharani, Ardra, Aélesha, Svati, Jyesbthd, 
Satabhishaj. They together occupy the space of 39° 31’ 
44° 36°". Of the remaining fifteen stations, each occu- 
pies as much as the mean daily motion. Accordingly 
it occupies the. space of 13° 10° 34” 52”. They to- 
gether occupy the space of 197° 38’ 43”. These three 
groups of stations together occupy the space of 355° 
45’ 41" 24”, the remainder of the complete circle 4° 
14 18” 36, and this is the space of Abhijit, i.e. the 
Felling Eagle, which is left out. I have tried to make 
the investigation of this snbject acceptable to the 


88 ALBERUNI'S INDIA. 


student in my above-mentioned special treatise on the 
lunar stations (v. p. 83). 

The scantiness of the knowledge of the Hindus re- 
garding the motion of the fixed stars is sufficiently 
illustrated by the following passage from the Samhitd 
of Varahamihira :—“ It has been mentioned in the books 
of the ancients that the summer solatice took place in 
the midet of Aéslesh&, and the winter solstice in Dha- 
nishtha. And this ie correct for that time. Nowadays 
the summer solstice takes place in the beginning of 
Cancer, and the winter eolstice in the beginning of Cap- 
ricornus, If any-one doubts this, and maintains that it 
is as the ancients have said and no} as we say, let him 
go out to geome level country when he thinks that the 
summer solstice is near. Let him there draw a circle, 
and place in its centre some body which stands perpen- 
dicular on the plain. Let him mark the end of its 
shadow by some sign, and continue the line till it 
reaches the circumference of the circle either in east or 
west. Let him repeat the same at the same moment 
of the following day, and make the same observation. 
When he then finds that the end of the shadow deviates 
from the first sign towards the south, he must know 
that the aon has moved towards the north and has not 
yet reached its solstice, But if he finds that the end 
of the shadow deviates towards the north, he knowe 
that the sun has already commenced to move. south- 
ward and has already passed its solstice. If a man 
continues this kind of observations, and thereby finds 
the day of the solatice, he will find that our words are 

true,” 

. This passage shows that Varahamibira had no know- 
ledge of the motion of the fixed stars towards the east. 
He considers them, in agreement with the name, as 
jized, immovable stars, and represents the solstice as 
moving towards the west. In consequence of thia fancy, 
he has, in the matter of the lunar stations, confounded 


CHAPTER LVI. 89 


two things, between which we shall now properly dis- 


tinguish, in order to remove doubt and to give the 
matter in a critically emended form. 

In the order of the zodiacal signs we begin with that 
twelfth part of the ecliptic which lies north of the point 
of intersection of the equator and the ecliptic according 
to the second motion, t.c, the precession of the equinoxes, 
In that case, the summer solstice always occurs at the 
beginning of the fourth sign, the winter solstice at the 
begiuning of the tenth sign. 

In the order of the lunar stations we begin with that 
twenty-seventh part of the ecliptic which belongs to 
the first of the first zodiacal sign. In that case the 
summer solstice falls always on three-fourths of the 
seventh station (%¢ on 600’ of the etation), and the 
winter solstice on one fourth of the twenty-first station 
(ue. on 200’ of the station). This order of things wil 
remain the same as long as the world lasts. 

If, now, the lunar stations are marked by certain 
constellations, and are called by names peculiar to these 
constellations, the stations wander round together with 
the constellations, The stars of the zodiacal signs and 
of the stations have, in bygone times, occupied earlier 
(te. more western) parts of the ecliptic. From them 
they have wandered into those which they occupy at 
present, and in future they will wander into other still 
more eastern parts of the ecliptic, so that in the course 
of time they will wander through the whole ecliptic. 

According to the Hindus, the stars of the station 
Aélesha stand in 18° of Cancer. Therefore, according 
to the rate of the precession of the equinoxes adopted 
by the ancient astronomers, they stood 1800 years before 
our time in the 0° of the fourth sign, whilst the con- 
atellation of Cancer stood in the third sign, in which 
there was also the solstice. The solstice has kept its 
place, but the constellations have migrated, just the very 
opposite of what Varihamihire has fancied. 


CHAPTER LVII. 


ON THE HELIACAL RISINGS OF THE STARS, AND ON THE 
CEREMONIES AND RITES WHICH THE HINDUS PRAC- 
TISE AT SUCH A MOMENT, 


How fara THE Hindu method for the computation of the heliacal 

distant from risings of the stats and the young moon is, as we think, 

crder tobo- the same as is explained in the canones called Sindhind. 

tie” ‘They call the degrees of a star's distance from the 
sun which are thought necessary for its heliacal rising 
kdldriegaka, They are, according to the author of the 
Ghurrat-alzijdt, the following :—13° for Suhail, Alya- 
mAniya, Alwiki', Alayyik, Alsimakfan, Kalb-al‘akrab ; 
20° for Albntain, Alhak'a, Alnathra, Aéleshi, Sata- 
bhishaj, Revati; 14° for the others. 

Evidently the etars have, in this respect, been divided 

Page 247, into three groups, the first of which seems to comprise 
the stars reckoned by the Greeks as stars of the first 
and second magnitude, the second the stars of the third 
and fonrth magnitude, and the third the stars of the 
fifth and sixth magnitade. 

Brahmagupta onght to have given this classification 
in his emendation of the Khandakhddyaka, but he has 
not done so. He expresses himself in general phrases, 
and simply mentions 14° distance from the sun as 
necessary for the heliacal risings of all lunar stations. 

Vijayanandin says: “Some stars are not covered by 

nandix’” the rays nor impaired in their shining by the sun, viz. 
Alayyfik, Alsimaik, Alrimih, the two Eagles, Dhanish- 
tha, and Uttarabhfidrapad, because they have so much

northern latitude, and becanse also the country (of the 
observer) has 20 much latitude. For in the more 
northern regions they are seen both at the beginning 
and end of one and the same night, and never dis- 
appear.” 

They have particular methods for the compntation exter 
of the heliacal rising of Agastya, tc Suhail or Canopus, ing of Cone 
They observe it first when the sun enters the station” 
Hasta, and they lose it out of sight when ho enters the 
station Rohini. Pulisa saye: “ Take double the apsis of 
the sun. If it is equalled by the corrected place of the 
sun, this is the time of the heliacal setting of Agastya,” 

The apsis of the sun is, according to Pulisa, 2} zodiacal 
signs. The double of it falls in 10° of Spica, which is 
the beginning of the station Hasta. Half the apsis 
falls on 10° of Taurus, which is the beginning of the 
station Rohint. 

Brahmagupta maintains the following in the emen- Quotation 
dation of the Khandakhddyaka : — Len 

“The position of Suhail is 27° Orion, its southern 
latitude 71 perts. The degrees of its distance from the 
sun necessary for its heliacal rising are 12. 

“The position of Mrigavyadha, i.c. Sirius Yemenicus, 
ig 26° Orion, its sonthern latitude 4o parts. The de- 
grees of ita distance from the sun necessary for its 
heliacal rising are 13. If you want to find the time 
of their risings, imagine the sun to be in the place of 
the star. That amount of the day which has already 
elapsed is the number of degrees of ita distance from 
the sun necessary for its heliacal rising, Fix the 
aseendens on this particular place. When, then, the sun 
reaches the degree of this ascendens, the star first becomes 
visible. 

“In order to find the time of the heliacal setting of 
a star, add to the degree of the star six complete zodiacal 
signs. Snbtract from the sum the degrees of its dis- 
tance from the sun necessary for its heliacal rising, and

fix the ascendens on the remainder. When, then, the 
sun enters the degree of the ascendens, that is the time 
of its setting.” 
On tho, The book SamAtid mentions certain sacrifices and 
ised at ceremonies which are practised at the heliacal risings 
rising of cer- Of various stars. We shall now record them, translat- 
ing also that which is rather chaff than wheat, since we 
have made it obligatory on ourselves to give the quota- 
tions from the books of the Hindus complete and exactly 
as they are. 
Quotation, Varihamihira says : “ When in the beginning the sun 
hamihira's had risen, and in his revolution had come to etand in the 
iL pre wofee, zenith of the towering mountain Vindhya, the latter 
r-it,0n Would not recognise his exalted position, and, actuated 
‘emtyeand by haughtiness, moved towards him to hinder his 
thin” march and to prevent his chariot from passing above 
it. The Vindbya rose even to the neighbourhood of 
Paradise and the dwellings of the Vidyddharas, the 
spiritual beings. Now the latter hastened to it because 
it was pleasant and its gardens and meadows were 
lovely, and dwelt there in joy; their wives going to 
and fro, and their children playing with each other. 
When the wind blew against the white garments of 
their daughters, they flew like waving banners. 

In its ravines the wild animals and the lions ap- 
pear as dark black, in consequence of the multitude 
of the animals called dsramara, which cling to them, 
liking the dirt of their bodies when they rub each other 

Pege et, with the soiled claws, When they attack-the rutting 
elephants, the latter become raving, The monkeys and 
bears are seen climbing up to the horns of Vindhya 
and to its lofty peaks; as if by instinct, they took the 
direction towards heaven. The anchorites are seen at 
ita water-places, satisfied with nourishing themselves 
by its fruits, The further glorious things of the Vin- 
dhya are innumerable. 

When, now, Agastya, the son of Varuna (tc. Suhail, 


CHAPTER LYN. . 93 


the son of the water), had observed all these proceed- 
ings of the Vindhya, he offered to be his companion in 
his aspirations, and asked him to remain in his place 
until he (Agastya) should return and shonld have freed 
him (Vindhya) from the darkness which was on him. 

V. 1.—Then Agastya turned towards the ocean, de- 
vouring its water, so that it disappeared. There appeared 
the lower parts of the monntain Vindhya, whilst the 
makara and the water animals were clinging to it. 
They scratched the mountain till they pierced it and dog 
mines in it,in which there remained gems and pearls. 

V, 2—The ocean became edorned by them, further 
by trees which grew up, though it (the water) was 
feeble, and by serpents rushing to and fro in windings 
on its surface. 

V. 3.—The mountain has, in exchange for the wrong 
done to it by Suhail, received the ornament which it 
has acquired, whence the angels got tiaras and crowns 
made for themselves. 

V. 4.—Likewise the ocean has, in exchange for the 
sinking down of its water into the depth, received the 
sparkling of the fishes when they move about in it, the 
appearance of jewels at its bottom, and the rushing to 
and fro of the serpents and snakes in the remainder of 
its water. When the fishes rise over it, and the conch- 
shells and pearl-oystera, yon would take the ocean for 
ponds, the snrface of their water being covered with the 
white lotus in the season of Sarad and the season of 
autumn. 

V. 5.—Yon could scarcely distinguish between thia 
water and heaven, because the ocean is adorned with 
jewels as the heaven is adorned with etars; with many- 
headed serpents, resembling threads of rays which come 
from the sun; with crystal in it, resembling the body 
of the moon, and with a white mist, above which rise 
the olonds of heaven. 

V. 6.—How should I not praise him who did this 


o4 ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 


great deed, who pointed out to the angels the beauty of 
the orowns, and made the ocean and the mountain 
Vindhya a treasure-house for them ! 

V. 7.—That is Suhail, by whom the water becomes 
clean from earthly defilement, with which the purity of 
the heart of the pious man is commingled, clean, I say, 
from that which overpowers him in the intercourse 
with the wicked. 

V. 8—Whenever Agastya rises and the water in- 
creases in the rivers and valleys during his time, you 
see the rivers offering to the moon all thet is on the 
surface of their water, the various kinds of white and 
red lotus and the papyrus; all that swims in them, the 
ducks and the geese (pelicans 7), as a sacrifice unto him, 
even as a young girl offers roses and presents when she 
enters them (the rivers). 

V. 9—We compare the standing of the pairs of red 
geese on the two shores, and the ewimming to and fro 
of the white ducks in the midst while they sing, to the 
two lips of a beautiful woman, showing her teeth when 
she laughs for joy. 

V. 10—Ney, we compare the black lotus, standing 
between white lotua, and the dashing of the bees against 
it from desire of the fragrancy of its smell, with the 
black of her pupil within the white of the ring, moving 
coquettishly and amorously, being surrounded by the 
hair of the eyebrows. 

V. 11.—-When you then see the ponds, when the light 
of the moon has risen over them, when the moon illu- 
minates their dim waters, and when the white lotus 
opens which was shut over the bees, you would think 
them the face of a beautiful woman, who looks with a 
black eye from a white eyeball. 

V. 12.—When a stream of the torrents of Varshakila 
has flown to them with serpents, poison, and the impu- 
rities, the rising of Suhail above them cleaus them from 
defilement and saves them from injury. 


CHAPTER LVII. 95 


V. 13.—-As one momant’s thinking of Suhail before 
the door of a man blots out his sins deserving of punigh- Page 24 
ment, how much more affective will be the fluency of 
the tongue praising him, when the task is to do away 
with sin and to acquire heavenly reward! The former 
Rishis have mentioned what sacrifice is necessary when 
Suhail rises. I shall make a present to the kings by 
relating it, and shall make this relation a sacrifice unto 
Him. SolI say: 
_  \V.14.—His rising takes place at the moment when 

some of the light of the sun appears from the east, and 
the darkness of night is gathered in the west. The 
beginning of his appearance is difficult to perceive, and 
not every one who looks at him understands it. There- 
fore ask the astronomer at that moment about the direc- 
tion whence it rises. 

V. 15, 16.~~Towerds this direction offer the sacrifice 
called argha, and apread on the earth what you hap- 
pen to have, roses and fragrant flowers as they grow 
in the country, Put on them what yon thiok fit, 
gold, garments, jewels of. the sea, and offer incense, 
saffron, and sandalwood, musk and camphor, together 
with an ox and a cow, and many dishes and sweet- 
meats, 

V. 17.—Know that he who does this during seven 
consecutive years with pious intention, atrong belief, 
and confidence, possesses at the end of them the whole 
earth and the ocean which surrounds it on the four 
sides, if he is a Kehatriya. 

V.18.—If he is a Brahman, he obtains his wishes, 
learns the Veda, obtains a beantifol wife, and gets 
noble children from her. If he is a Vaigya, he obtains 
much landed property and acquires a glorious lordship. 
If he is a SAdra, he will obtain wealth, All of them 
obtain health and safety, the cessation of injuries, and 
the realisation of reward.” 

This is Varihamihira's statement regarding the offering 


96 ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 


to Suhail. In the same book he gives also the rules 
regarding Rohini: 

“Garga, Vasishtha, Kafsyapa, and Pariéara told their 
pupils that Mount Meru is built of planks of gold. 
Out of them there have risen trees with namerous 
sweet-swelling flowers and blossoms. The bees already 
surround them with a humming pleasant to hear, and 
the nymphs of the Devas wander there to and fro with 
exhilarating melodies, with pleasant instruments and 
everlasting joy. This mountain lies in the plain Nan- 
danavana, the park of paradise. So they say. Jupiter 
was there at a time, and then Néreda the Rishi asked 
him regarding the prognostics of Rohinf, upon which 
Jupiter explained them to him. I shall here relate 
them as far as necessary. 

V. 4.—Let & man in the black days of the month 

observe if the moon reaches Rohint. Let him 
seek to the north or east of the town « high spot. To 
this epot the Brahman must go who has the charge of 
the houses of the kings. He is to light there a fire and 
to draw a diagram of tho various planets and lunar 
stations round it, He is to recite what is necessary for 
each one of them, and to give each its share of the 
toses, barley, and oil, and to make each planet propi- 
tious by throwing these things into the fire. Round the 
fire on all four sides there must be as much as possible 
of jewels and jugs filled with the sweetest water, and 
whatever else there happens to be at hand at the 
moment, fruits, drugs, branohes of trees, and roots of 
planta Farther, he is to spread there grass which is 
cut with a sickle for his night-quarters. Then he is to 
take the different kinds of seeds and corns, to wash 
them with water, to put gold in the midst of them, 
and to deposit them in a jug. He is to place it towards 
a certain direction, and to prepare Homa, i.e. throw- 
ing barley and oil into the fire, at the same time re- 
citing certain pessages from the Veda, which refer to 


- CHAPTER LVI. 97 


different directions, viz. Varuna-mantra, VAyava-mantra, Page ss 
and Soma-mantra. 

- He raises a danda, ic. along and high epear, from 

the top of which hang down two straps, the one as long 

as the spear, the other thrice aa long. He must do all 

this before the moon reaches Rohini, for this purpose, 

that when ehe reaches it, he should be ready to deter- 

mine the times of the blowing of the wind as well as 

its directions. He learns this hy means of the straps 

of the spear. 

V. 10—If the wind on that day blowa from the 
centres of the four directions, it is considered propitious; 
if it blows from the directions between them, it is 
considered unlucky. If the wind remaina steady in the 
game direction, powerful and without changing, this 
too is considered propitious. The time of its blowing 
is measured by the eight parts of the day, and each 
eighth part is considered as corresponding to the half 
of a month. 

V. 11.—When the moon leaves the station Rohint, 
you look at the seeds placed in g certain direction. 
That of them which sprouts will grow plentifally in 
that year. 

V. 12,—When the moon comes near Rohinf, you 
must be on the look-out. If the sky is clear, not affected 
by any disturbance; if the wind is pure and does not 
cause a destructive commotion; if the melodies of the 
animals and birds are pleasant, this is considered pro- 
pitious. We shall now consider the clouds. 

V. 13, 14.—If they float like the branches of the 
valley (? bafn 2), and out of them the flashes of lightning 
appear to the eye; if they open as opens the white 
lotus ; if the lightning encircles the cloud like the rays 
of the sun; if the cloud a the colour of stibium, or of 


bees, or of satfroi ; -

bow shows its round form coloured with something like 
the red of evening twilight, and with colours like those 
of the garments of a bride; if the thunder roars like 
the screaming peacock, or the bird which cannot drink 
water except from falling rain, which then screams for 
joy, as the frogs enjoy the full water-places, so as to 
croak vehemently ; if you see the eky raging like the 
taging of elephants and buffaloes in the thicket, in the 
various parts of which the fire is blazing; if the clouds 
move like the limbs of the elephants, if they shine like 
the shining of pearls, conch-shells, snow, and even as 
the moonbeams, as though the moon had lent the clonds 
her lustre and splendonr ; 

V. 20.—All this indicates much rain and blessing by 
a rich growth. 

V. 25.—At the time when the Brahman sits amidst 
the water-jugs, the falling of stars, the flashing of the 
lightning, thunderbolte, red glow in the sky, tornado, 
earthquake, the falling of hail, and the screaming of 
the wild animals, all these things are considered as 
unlucky. 

V. 26.—If the water decreases in a jug ou the north 
side, either by iteelf, or by a hole, or by dripping away, 
there will be no rain in the month Srivana. If it de- 
creases in a jug on the east side, there will be no rain 
in Bhidrapada. If it decreases in a jug on the south 
side, there will be no rain in Aévayuja; and if it de- 
creases in a jug on the weat side, there will be no rain 
in Krttika. If there is no decrease of water in the 
jogs, the sommer rain will be perfect, 

V. 27.—From the jugs they also derive prognostics 
as to the different castes. The northern jug refers to 
the Brahman, the eastern to the Kshatriya, the sonthern 
to the Vaifya, and the western to the Sfidra. If the 
names of people and certain circumstances are inscribed 
upon the jugs, all that happens to them if, eg. they 
break or the water in them decreases, is considered as 


CHAPTER LVI. 99 


prognosticating something which concerns those per- 
sons or circumstances.” 

“The rules relating to the stationa Svatt and Sravana eagee 
are similar to those relating to Rohint. When yon are ¢. +, 
in the white days of the month Ashidha, when. the gana’ 
moon stands in either of the two stations Ashiidhi, 
te Pirva-ashidhfi or Uttara-ashidhd, select a spot as 
you have selected it for Rohint, and take a balance rageos:. 
of gold. That is the best. If it is of silver, it eng a 
middling, If it is not of silver, make it of wood > 
called khayar, which seems to be the khadira trea 
(ie. Acacia catechn), or of the head of an arrow with 
Which already a man has been killed. The smallest 
measure for the length of its beam is a span. The 
longer it is, the better; the shorter it is, the less 
favourahle. 

V. 6—A acale has four strings, each ro digits long- 

Its two scales are of linen cloth of the size of 6 digits, 
Its two weights are of gold. 

V. 7, 8—Weigh by it equal quantities of each 
matter, water of the wells, of the ponds, and of the 
rivers, elephants’ teeth, the hair of horsea, pieces of gold 
with the names of kings written on them, and pieces of 
other metal over which the names of other people, or the 
names of animals, years, days, directions, or countries 
have been pronounced. 

V. 1—In weighing, turn towards the esst; put the 
weight in the right scale, and the things which are to 
be weighed in the left, Recite over them and speak to 
the balance : 

V. 2.—‘*Thou art correct; thou art Deva, and the 

. Wife of a Deva. Thou art Sarasvati, the daughter of 
Brahman, Thou revealest the right and the truth, 
Thon art more correct than the soul of correctness. 

V. 3.—Thon art like the sun and the planets in their 
wandering from east to west on one and the same road. 

V. 4-—-Through thee stands upright the order of the 


ico ALBERUNTS INDIA. a 
world, and in thee is united the truth and the correct- 
ness of all the angels and Brahmans. 

V. 5.—Thou art the daughter of Brahman, and a 
man.-of thy house is Kafyapa.’ 

V. 1.~This weighing must take place in the even- 
ing. Then put the things aside, and repeat their 
weighing the next morning. That which has increased 
in weight will flourish and thrive in that year; that: 
which has decreased will be bad and go back. | 

This weighing, however, is not only to be, done in 
Ashadha, bat also in Bohint and Svatt. 

V. 11.—If the year is a Jeap-year, and the weigh- 
ing happens to take place in the repeated month, the 
weighing is in that year twice done. 

V..12.—If the prognostics are identical, what they 
forebode will happen. If they were not identical, 
observe the prognosties of Rohint, for it is predomi- 
nant.”

HOW EBB AND FLOW FOLLOW EAC OTHER IN THE 
OCEAN. 


Wiru regard to the cause why the water of the ocean Quotation 
always remains as it is, we quote the following passage Macy 
from the Matsya-Purdna:—“ At the beginning there **"""* 
were sixteen mountains, which had wings and could fly 

- and rise up into the air. However, the rays of Indra,

them iu each point of the compass—in the east, Risha-

Kanka, Drona, Sukma; in the west, Vakra, Vadhra, 
Narada, Parvata; in the south, Jimfta, Dravina, Main- 

Ska, MahAéaila (7). Between the third and the fourth 

of the eastern mountains there is the fire Saxivartaka, 
which drinks the water of the ocean. But for this the 
ocean would fill up, eince the rivers perpetually flow 

to it. 

“This fire was the fire of one of their kings, called story of 
Aurva. He had inherited the realm from his father, ™"**""™ 
who was killed while he was still an embryo. When

‘his sword to kill them, since they had neglected the

close contact with the world. Thereupon the angels 
humiliated themselves before him and tried to con-

ciliate him, so that he ceased from his wrath. Then he 
spoke to them: ‘But what am I to do with the fire of 
‘my wrath?’ and they advised him to throw it into the 
ocean. It is this fire which absorbs the waters of the 
ocean. Others say: ‘The water of the streams does not 

Peeeass. increase the ocean, because Indra, the ruler, takes up 
the ocean in the shape of the cloud, and sends it down 
as rains.’” 

Themanin Again the Matsya-Puréna says: “The black part in 

‘mere the moon which is called Sadalaksha, ie. the hare's 
figure, is the image of the figures of the above-men- 
tioned sixteen mountains reflected by the light of the 
moon on her body.” 

The Vishnu-Dharma says: “The moon is called Saga- 
laksha, for the globe of her body is watery, reflecting 
the figure of the eaiil as a mirror reflects. On the 
earth there are mountains and trees of different shapes, 
which are reflected in the moon as a hare’s figure. It 
is also called Mrigaldficana, ¢.c. the figure of a gazelle, 
for certain people compare the black payt on the moon’s 
face to the figure of a gazelle.” 

Btory of the The lunar stations they declare to be the dauchters 
tence of Prajipati, to whom the moon is married. He was 
especially attached to Rohini, and preferred her to the 
others. Now her sisters, urged by jealousy, complained 
of him to their father Prejipati, The latter strove to 
keep peace among them, and admonished him, but with- 
out any success, Then he cursed the moon (Zunua), in 
consequence of which his face became leprous, Now 
the moon repented of his doing, and came penitent to 
Prajipati, who spoke to him: “My word is one, and 
cannot be cancelled ; however, I shall cover thy shame 
for the half of each month.” Thereupon the moon 
spoke to PrajApati: “But how shall the trace of the sin — 
of the past be wiped off from me?” Prajipati answered: 
“ By erecting the shape of the lizga of Mahfideva as an 
object of thy worship.” This he did. The litga he

raised was the stone of Soman&th, for soma means the The idol of 
moon and ndtha means master, so that the whole word 
means master of the moon. The image was destroyed 

by the Prince Mahmfid— may God be merciful to 
him!—a.u. 416. He ordered the npper part to be 
broken and the remainder to be transported to his resi- 

deuce, Ghaznin, with all its coverings and trappings of 

gold, jewels, and embroidered garments. Part of it 

has been thrown into the hippodrome of the town, 
together with the Cakrasvdmin, an idol of bronze, that 

had been brought from Taneshar. Another part of the 

idol from Somanith lies before the door of the mosque 

of Ghazntn, on which people rub their feet to clean 

them from dirt and wet. 

The Jinga is an image of the penis of Mahideva. I rata of: 

have heard the following story regarding it:;—* A Rishi, 
on seeing Mahideva with his wife, became suspicious 
of him, and cursed him that he should lose his penis. 
At once his penis dropped, and was as if wiped 
off. But afterwards the Rishi was in a position to 
establish the gigns of his innocence and to confirm 
them by the necessary proofs. The suspicion which 
had tronbled his mind was removed, and he spoke to 
him: ‘ Verily, I shall recompense thee by making the 
image of the limb which thou hast lost the object of 
worship for men, who thereby will find the road to God, 
and come near him.’” 

Varihamihira says about the construction of the The con- 
linga: “After having chosen a faultless stone for it, tio oLingn 
take it as long as the i image is intended to be. Divide Wardha 
it into three parts, The lowest part of it is quad- Bias 
rangular, as if it were a cube or quadrangular column. fii sy 
The middle part is octagonal, its surface being divided 
by four pilasters, The upper third is round, rounded 
off so as to resemble the gland of a penis. 

_. V. §4.—In erecting the figure, place the quadran- 
gular third within the earth, and for the octagonal third

without, but so as to fit also on the quadrangular 
third in the earth. The octagonal form of the inner 
side is to fit on to the middle third, which projects out 

Pagooss} of the earth, The round third alone remains without 
cover.” 

Further he saye:— 

V. 55.—‘ If you make the round part too small or 
too thin, it will hurt the country and bring about evil 
among the inhabitants of the regions who have con- 
structed it. If it does not go deep enough down into 
the earth, or if it projects too little ont of the earth,

worship of the Hindus, but Somanith was the moat 
famous of these places, Every day they brought there 
a jug of Ganges water and a basket of flowers from 
Kashmir. They believed that the dinga of Somanath 
would cure persons of every inveterate illness and heal 
every desperate and incurable disease, 

The reason why in particular Somanith has become 
so famous is that it was a harbour for seafaring people, 
and a station for those who went to and fro between 
Sufala in the country of the Zanj and China.

theramect Of which the former is called dharna (7), the latter

common Hindus, there is a fire called Vadavinala in 
the ocean, which is always blazing. The flow is caused 
by the fire’s drawing breath and its being blown up by 
the wind, and the ebb is caused by the fire’s exhaling 


CHAPTER LVIIl. 105 


the breath and the cessation of its being blown up by 
the wind, 

MAnt has come to a belief like this, after he had 
heard from the Hindus that there is a demon in the 
sea whose drawing breath and exhaling breath causes 
the flow and the ebb. 

The educated Hindus determine the daily phases of 
the tides hy the rising and setting of the moon, the 
monthly phases by the increase and waning of the 
moon ; but the physical cause of both phenomena is not 
understood by them, 

It is flow and ebb to which Soman&th owes its name Origin ofthe 
(ie. master of the moon); for the stone (or livga) of of Homa. 
Somanith was originally erected on the coast, a little“ 
less than three miles west of the mouth of the river 
Sarsutt, east of the golden fortress Bardi, which had 
appeared as a dwelling-place for Vasudeva, not far from 
the place where he arid his family were killed, and 
where they were burned. Each time when the moon 
rises and sets, the water of the ocean rises in the flood 
80 a8 to cover the place in question. When, then, the 
moon reaches the meridian of noon and midnight, the 
water recedes in the ebb, and the place becomes again 
visible. Thus the moon was perpetually occupied iu 
serving the idol and bathing it. Therefore the place 
‘was considered as sacred to the moon, The fortress 
which contained the idol and its treasures was not 
ancient, but was built only about a hundred years ago. 

The Vishnu-Purdpa aays: “The greatest height of Quotation 
the water of the flow is 1500 digits.” This etatemeat Vistas 
seems rather exaggerated; for if the waves and the 
mean height of the ocean rose to between sixty to 
seventy yards, the shores and the bays would be more 
overfiown than has ever been witnessed. Still this is 
not entirely improbable, as it is not in itself impossible 
on account of some law of nature. 

The fact that the just-mentioned fortress is said to 


i

have appeared out of the ocean is not astonishing for 
that particular part of the ocean; for the Dtbajat 
islands (Maledives and Laccadives) originate in a 
similar manner, rising out of the ocean as sand-downs. 
They increase, and rise, and extend themselves, and 
remain in this condition for a certain time. Then they 
become decrepit as if from old age; the single parts 
become dissolved, no longer keep together, and dis- 
appear in the water as if melting away. The inhabi- 
tants of the islands quit that one which apparently dies 
away, and migrate to a young and fresh one which is 
abont to rise above the ocean. They take their cocca- 
not palms along with them, colonise the new island, 
and dwell on it. 

That the fortress in question is called golden may 
only be a conventional epithet. Possibly, however, 
this object is to be taken literally, for the islands of 
the ZAbsaj are called the Gold Country (Suvarnadvipa), 
because you obtain much gold as deposit if you wash 
only a little of the earth of that country.

CHAPTER LIX. 
ON THE SOLAR AND LUNAR ECLIPSES. 


It is perfectly known to the Hindn astronomers that 
the moon is eclipsed by the shadow of the earth, and 
the sun is eclipsed by the moon. Hereon they have 
based their computations in the astronomical hand- 
books and other works. 

Varibamihira says in the Samhita :— 

V. 1.—Some scholars maintain that the Head he- Quotation, 
longed to the Daityas, and that his mother was Sith- hontiins 
hika. After the angels had fetched the amrita out of cn. ied 
the ocean, they asked Vishnu to distribute it among 
them, When he did so, the Head also came, resembling 
the angels in shape, and associated himself with them. 
When Vishnu handed him a portion of the amrita, he 
took and drank it. But then Vishnu perceived who it 
was, hit him with his round cara, and cut off his he). 
However, the head remained alive on acconnt of the 
amrite in its mouth, whilst the body died, since it had 
not yet partaken of the amrita, and the force of the 
latter had not yet spread through it. Then the Head, 
humbling itself, spoke: ‘For what sin has this been 
done?’ Thereupon he was recompensed by being 
raised to heaven and by being made one of its inha- 
bitants. 

V. 2.—-Others say that the Head has a body like sun 
and moon, but that it is black and dark, and cannot 
therefore be seen in heaven. Brahman, the first father, 


108 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


ordered that he should never appear in heaven except 
at the time of an eclipse. 

V. 3.—’ hers say that he has a head like that of a 
serpent, a:.: a tail like that of a serpent, whilst others 
say that he has no other body besides the black colour 
which is seen.” 

After having finished the relation of these absurdities, 
Varfhamihira continues :-— 

V. 4.—If the Head had a body, it would act by 
immediate contact, whilst we find that he eclipses from 
a distance, when between him and the moon there is 
an interval of six zodiacal signs. Besides, his motion 
does not increase nor decrease, 30 that we cannot 
imagine an eclipse to be caused by his body reaching 
the spot of the lanar eclipse. 

V. 5.—And if a man commits himself to euch a view, 
let him tell us for what purpose the cyclea of the 
Head’e rotation have been calculated, and whet is the 
use of their being correct in consequence of the fact 
that his rotation is a regular one. If the Head is 
imagined to be a serpent with head and tail, why does 
it not eclipse from a distance less or more than six 
zodiacal signs ? 

V. 6.—His body is there present between head and 
tail; both hang together by means of the body. Still 
it does not eclipse sun nor moon nor the fixed stars of 
the lunar stations, there being an eclipse only if there 
are two heads opposed to each other. 

V. 7.—If the latter were the case, and the moon 
rose, being eclipsed by one of the two, the san would 
necessarily set, being eclipeed by the other. Likewise, 
if the moon should set eclipsed, the sun would rise 
eclipsed. And nothing of the kind ever occurs, 

V. &—As has been mentioned hy scholars who enjoy 
the help of God, an eclipse of the moon is her enter- 
ing the shadow of the earth, and an eclipse of the sun 
consists in this that the moon covers and hides the sun 


" CHAPTER LIX. 109 


from us. Therefore the lunar eclipse will never revolve 
from the west nor the solar eclipse from the east, 

V. 9.—A long shadow stretches awsy from the earth, 
in like manner as the shadow of a tree, 

V. 10.—When the moon has only little Istitade, 
standing in the seventh sign of its distance from the 
sun, and if it does not stand too far north or south, in 
that case the moon enters the shadow of the earth and 
is eclipsed thereby. The first contact takes place on 
the side of the east. 

V. 11.— When the sun is reached by the moon from 
the west, the moon covers the sun, as if a portion of 3 
cloud covered him, The amount of the covering differs 
in different regions. 

V. 12.-—Because that which covers the moon is large, 
her light wanes when one-half of it is eclipsed; and 
because that which covers the eun is not large, the rays 
are powerful notwithetanding the eclipse. 

V. 13.—The nature of the Head has nothing what- 
ever to do with the lunar and solar eclipses. On this 
subject the scholars in their books agree.” 

After having described the nature of the two eclipses, 
as he understands them, he complains of those who do 
not know this, and says: “ However, common people 
are always very loud in proclaiming the Head to be 
the cause of an eclipse, and they say, ‘If the Head 
did not appear and did not bring about the eclipse, the 
Brahmans would not at that moment undergo an obli- 
gatory washing.’” 

Varfihamihira says :~— 

- V.14.—* Fhe reason of this is that the head humi- 
liated itself after it had been cut off, snd received from 
Brahman a portion of the offering which the Brahmana 
offer to the fire at the moment of an eclipse. 

V. 15.—Therefore he is near the spot of the eclipse, 
searching for his portion. Therefore at that time people 
mention him frequently, and consider him as the cause 


Praise of 


no ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 


of the eclipse, although he has nothing whatsoever to 
do with it; for the eclipse depends entirely upon the 
uniformity and the declination of the orbit of the 
moon.” 

The latter words of Varfhamihira, who, in passages 
quoted previously, has already revealed himself to us 
as a man who accurately knows the shape of the world, 
are odd and surprising. However, he scems sometimes 
to side with the Brahmans, to whom he belonged, and 
from whom he could not separate himself, Still he 
does not deserve to be blamed, as, on the whole, his 
foot stands firmly on the basis of the truth, and he 
clearly speaks out the truth. Compare, eg. his state- 
ment regarding the Samdhi, which we have mentioned 


above (v. i, 366). 


Stricture Would to God that all distinguished man followed 
ph Peto his example! But look, for instance, at Brahmagupta, 


who is certainly the most distinguished of their astro. 
nomers. For as he was one of the Brahmans who read 
in their Purfnas that the sun is lower than the moon, 
and who therefore require a head biting the sun in 
order that he should be eclipsed, he shirks the truth 
and lends his support to imposture, if he did not—and 
this we think by no means impossible—from intense 
disgust at them, speak as he spoke simply in order to 
mock them, or under the compulsion. of some mental 
derangement, like a man whom death is about to rob of -- 
his consciousness. The words in question are found in 

the first chapter of his Brahmasiddhdnta :— 

“Some people think that the eclipse is not caused by 
the Head. This, however, is a foolish idea, for it is he 
in fact who eclipses, and the generality of the inhabi- 
tanta of the world say that it is the Head who eclipses. 
Tho Veda, which is the word of God from the mouth of 
Brahman, says that the Head eclipses, likewise the book 
Smriti, composed by Manu, and the SamAitd, composed - 
by Garga the son of Brahman. On the contrary, Vari- 


CHAPTER LIX. mW 


hamihira, Srtshena, Aryabhata, and Vishnucandra main- 
tain that the eclipse is not caused by the Head, but 
by the moon and the shadow of the earth, in direct 
Opposition to all (to the generality of men), and from 
enmity against the just-mentioned dogma. For if the 
Head does not cause the eclipse, all the usages of the 
Brahmans which they practise at the moment of an 
eclipse, viz. their rubbing themselves with warm oil, 
and other works of prescribed worship, would be illu- 
sory and not be rewarded by heavenly bliss. Ifa man 
declares these things to be illusory, he stands ontside 
of the generally acknowledged dogma, and that is not 
allowed. Manu says in the Smriti: ‘When the Head 
keeps the sun or moon in eclipse, all waters on earth 
‘become pure, and in purity like the water of the Ganges,’ 
The Veda saya: ‘The Head is the son of a woman of the 
daughters of the Daityas, called Sainakd’ (? Sirnhiké 7). 
Therefore people practise the well-known works of piety, 
and therefore those anthors must cease to oppose the 
generality, for everything which is in the Veda, Smriti, 
and Sanhitd is true.” 

If Brahmagupta, in this respect, is one of those of 
whom God says (Koran, Siira xxvii. 14), “ They have 
denied our signs, although their hearts knew them clearly, 
Srom wickedness and haughtiness,” we shall not argne 
with him, but only whisper into his ear: If people 
must under circumstances give up opposing the reli- 
gious codes (as seems to be your case), why then do you 
order people to be pious if you forget to be so your- 
self? Why do you, after having spoken such words, 
‘then begin to calculate the diameter of the moon in 
order to explain her eclipsing the sun, and the dia- 
meter of the shadow of the earth in order to explain its 
eclipsing the moon? Why do you compute both eclipses 
in agreement with the theory of those heretics, and not 
according to the views of those with whom you think 
it proper to agree? If the Brahmans are ordered to 


112 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


practise some act of worship or something else at the 
occurrence of an eclipse, the eclipse is only the date 
of these things, not their cause, Thus we Muslims are 
bound to asy certain prayers, and prohibited from say- 
ing others, at certain times of the revolution of the sun 
and his light. These things sre simply chronological 
dates for those acts, nothing more, for the sun has 
nothing whatever to do with our (Muslim) worship. 

Brahmagupta says (ii 110), “The generality thinks 
thus.” If he thereby means the totality of the inhabi- 
tants of the inhahitable world, we can only say that he 
would be very little able to investigate their opinions 
either by exact reaearch or by means of historical tra- 
dition, For India itself is, in comparison to the whole 
inhabitable world, only a small matter, and the number 
of those who differ from the Hindus, both in religion 
and law, is larger than the number of those who agree 
with them. 

Or if Brahmagupta means the generality of the Hindus, 
we agree that the uneducated among them are much 
more numerous than the educated; but we also point 
out that in all our religious codes of divine revelation 
the uneducated crowd is blamed as being ignorant, 
always doubting, and ungrateful. 

I, for my part, am inclined to the belief that that 
which mede Brahmagupta speak the above-mentioned 
words (which involve a sin against conscience} was 
something of a calamitous fate, like that of Socrates, 
which had befallen him, notwithstanding the abun- 
dance of his knowledge and the sharpness of his intel- 
lect, and notwithstanding his extreme yonth at the 
time. For he wrote the Brakmasiddhdnia when he was 
only thirty years of age. If this indeed is his excuse, 
we accept it, and herewith drop the matter. 

As for the above-mentioned people (the Hinda theo- 
logians), from whom you must take care not to differ, 
how should they be able to understand the astronomical 


CHAPTER LIX. 113 


theory regarding the moon’s eclipsing the sun, as they, 
in their Purdyas, place the moon above the sun, and 
that which is higher cannot cover that which is lower 
in the sight of those who stand lower than both. 
Therefore they required some being which devours 
moon and sun, as the fish devours the bait, and causes 
them to appear in those shapes in which the eclipsed 
parts of them in reality appear. However, in each 
nation there are ignorant people, and leaders atill more 
ignorant than they themselves, who (as the Koran, 
Sura xxix, 12, says) “bear their own burdens and other 
burdens besides them,” and who think they can increase 
the light of their minds ; the fact being that the masters 
are as ignorant as the pupils. 

Very odd is that which Varahamihira relates of certain 
ancient writers, to whom we must pay no attention if haere 
we do not want to oppose them, viz, that they tried to ee 
prognosticate the occurrence of an eclipse by pouring a 
small amount of water together with the same amount 
of oil into 9 large vase with a flat bottom on the eighth 
of the lunar days. Then they examined the spots 
where the oil was united and dispersed. The united 
portion they considered as a prognostication for the be- 
ginning of the eclipse, the dispersed portion as a prog- 
nostication for its end. 

Further, Varihamihira saya that somebody used to 
think that the conjunction of the planets is the cause 
of the eclipse (V. 16), whilst others tried to prognosticate 
an eclipse from unlucky phenomena, as, ¢g. the falling 
of stars, comets, halo, darkness, hurricane, landslip, and 
earthquake, “ These things,” so he says, “are not alwaye 
contemporary with an eclipse, nor are they its cause; 
the nature of an unlucky event is the only thing which 
these occurrences have in common with an eclipse. A 
_ Teagonable explanation is totally different from such 
absurdities.” 

The same man, knowing only too well the character 

FOL. IL, H 


114 ALBERUNTS INDIA. : 
of his countrymen, who like to mix up peas with wolfs: 
beans, pearls with dung, says, withont quoting any 
authority for his words (V. 63): “If at the time of an 
eclipse a violent wind blows, the next eclipse will be 
six months later. If a star falls down, the next eclipse 
will be twelve months later. If the air is dusty, it will 
be eighteen months later. If there is an earthquake, it 
will be twenty-four months later, If the air is dark, it 
will be thirty months later, If hail falls, i¢ will be 
thirty-six months later.” 

To such things silence is the only proper answer. 
Outee I shall not omit to mention that the different kinds 
the ectipess. of eclipses described in the canon of Alkhwé&rizmt, 

though correctly represented, do not agree with the | 
results of actual observation. More correct is a similar 
view of the Hindus, vis. that the eclipse has the colour 
of smoke if it covers less than half the body of the 
moon ; that it is coal-black if it completely covers one 
half of ber; that it has a colour between black and red 
if the eclipse covers more than half. of her body; and,

this canon, in two places. Multiply the one by So, and 
divide the product by 1296, reckoning a fraction, if it is 
not less than one-half, as a whole. Add to the quotient 
1063. Add the sum tothe number written in the second 
place, and divide the sum by 180. The quotient, as 
consisting of wholes, means the number of complete 
parvans. Divide it by 7, and the remainder under 7 
which you get means the distance of the particular 
parvan from the first one, t.¢ from that of Brahman. 
However, the remainder under 180 which you get by 
the division is the elapsed part of the parvan in which 
you are. You eubtract it from 180. If the remainder 
is less than 15, a lunar eclipse is possible or mecessary ; 
if the remainder is larger, it is impossible. Therefore 
you must always by a similar method compute that 
time which has elapsed before the particular parvan in 
which you happen to be.” 

Tu another passage of the book we find the following 
tule: “Take the kalpa-ahargana, i.e. the past portion 
of the days of a kalpa. Subtract therefrom 96,031, 
aud write down the remainder in two different placea. 
Subtract from the lower number 84, and divide the sum .

and divide the remainder by 173. The quotient you © 
disregard, but the remainder you divide by 7. The quo- 
tient gives parvans, beginning with Brahmddi” (sic). 

These two methods do not agree with each other. 
We are under the impression that in the second pas- 
sage something has either fallen out or been changed 
by the copyists. 

What Vardhamihira saye of the astrological portents 


Quotation, of the parvans does. not well suit his deep learning. 
famines He says: “If in a certain parvan there is no eclipse,

and there will be much hunger and killing.” If in 
this passage the translator has not made a blunder, 
we can only say that this description applies to each 
parvan preceding euch 2 one in which there occurs an 
eclipse, 

Stranger still is the following remark of his (V. 24): 
“If an eclipse occurs earlier than has been calculated, 
there is little rain and the sword is drawn, If it 
occurs later than has been calculated, there will be 
pestilence, aud death, and destruction in the corn, the 
fruit, and flowers. (V. 25.) This is part of what I have 
found in the books of the ancients and transferred to 
this place. Ifa man properly knows how to calculate, 
it will not happen to him in his calculations that an 
eclipse falls too early or too late. If the sun is eclipsed chap. tit 
and darkened outside a parvan, you must know that an ™* 
angel called Tvashtri has eclipsed him.” 

Similar to this is what he says in another passage: 
“Tf the turning to the north takes place before the sun Tid v.45 
enters the sign Capricornus, the south and the west 
-will be rained, If the turning to the couth takes place 
before the sun enters Cancer, the east and the north 
will be ruined. If the turning coincides with the sun’s 
entering the first degrees of these two signs, or takes 
place after it, happiness will be common to all four 
sides, and bliss in them will increase.” 

Such sentences, understood as they seem intended 
to be understcod, sound like the ravings of a madman, 
but perhaps thera is an esoteric meaning concealed 
behind them which we do not know. 

After this we must continne to speak of the domint 
temporum, for these too are of a cyclical nature, adding 
such materials as are related to them,

CHAPTER LXI. 


ON THE DOMINANTS OF THE DIFFERENT MEASURES OF 
TIME IN BOTH RELIGIOUS AND ASTRONOMICAL RELA- 
TIONS, AND ON CONNECTED SUBJECTS. 


Whichotthe DURATION, or time in general, only applies to the 


different 


measures of Creator as being his age, and not determinable by a 


time have 
dominants 


beginning and an end. In fact, it is his eternity. 


soe“ They freqnently call it the soul, ie purusha. But as 


regards common time, which is determinable by mo- 
tion, the single parts of it apply to beings beside the. 
Creator, and to natural phenomena beside the soul. 
Thus kaipa is always used in relation to Brahman, for 
it is his day and night, and his life is determined by it. 

Each manvantara has a special dominant called 
Afanu, who is described by epecial qualities, already 
mentioned in e former chapter. On the other hand, I 
have never heard anything of dominants of the catur- 
yugas or yugas. 

Varihamihira says in the Great Book of Nativities: 
“ Abda, te, the year, belongs to Saturn; Ayana, half a 
year, to the sun; Aittu,the sixth part of a year, to Mer- 
cury ; the month, to Jupiter; Paksha, half a month, to 
Venus; Vidsara, the day, to Mars; Muharta, to the 
moor.” 

In the same book he defines the sixth parts of the 
year in the following manner: “The first, beginning 
with the winter solstice, belongs to Saturn; the second, 
to Venus ; the third, to Mars; the fonrth, to the Moon 
the fifth, to Mercury ; the sixth, to Jupiter.” 


CHAPTER LXI. . a9 


We have already, in former chapters, described the 
dominants of the hours, of the muAtrias, of the halves 
of the lunar days, of the single days in the white and 
black halves of the month, of the pareans of the 
eclipses, and of the single manvaniaras, What there 
is more of the same kind we shall give in this place. 

In computing the dominant of the year, the Hindus Computer 
use another method than the Western nations, who dominant of 
compute it, according to certain well-known rules, from scovrding to 
the ascendens or horoscope of a year. The dominant of fadyait’” 
the year as well as the dominant of the month are the 
rulers of certain periodically recurring parts of time, 
and are by a certain calculation derived from the domi- 
nants of the hours and the dominanis of the days, 

If you want to find the dominant of the year, com- 
pute the sum of days of the date in question according 
to the rules of the canon Khandakhddyake, which is 
.the most universally used among them. Subtract there- 

from 2201, and divide the remainder by 360. Multiply 
the quotient by 3, and add to the product always 3. 
Divide the sum by 7. The remainder, a number 
under 7, you count off on the week-days, beginning 
with Sunday. The dominant of that day you come 
to is at the same time the dominant of the year. The 
Temainders you get by the division are the days of his 
rule which have already elapsed. These, together with 
the days of his rule which have not yet elapsed, give 
the sum of 360. 

It is the same whether we reckon as we have just 
explained, or add to the here-mentioned sum of daya 
319, instead of subtracting from it. 

If you want to find the dominant of the month, aub- How to find} 
tract 71 from the sum of days of the date in question, nant ofthe 
and divide the remainder by 30. Double the quotient " 
and add 1. The sum divide by 7, and the remainder 

_count off on the week-days, beginning with Sunday. 
The dominant of the day you come to is at the same

time the dominant of the month. The remainder you 
get by the division is that part of his rule which has 
already elapsed. This, together with that part of his 


Tule which has not yet elapsed, gives the sum of 30 days. 


I¢ is the same whether you reckon as we have just 
explained, or add 1g to the days of the date, instead of 
subtracting from them, and then add 2 instead of 13 to 
the double of the sum. 

It is useless here to speak of the dominant of the 
day, for you find it by dividing the sum of the days of 
a date by 7; or to speak of the dominant of the hour, 
for you find it by dividing the revolving sphere by 15. 
Those, however, who use the @pas xaspixaé divide by 15 
the distance between the degree of the sun and the de- 
gree of the ascendens, it being measured by equal degrees. 

The book Srédhava of Mahddeva asys: “Each of 
the thirds of the dey and night hasa dominant. The 
dominant of the first third of day and night is Brahman, 
that of the second Vishnu, and that of the third Rndra.” 
This division is based on the order of the three prime- 
val forces (satva, rajas, amas). 

The Hindus have still another custom, viz. that of 
mentioning together with the dominant of the year one 


- the planeta. of the Ndgas or serpents, which have certain names as 


they are used in connection with one or other of the 
planets. We have united them in the following table :—

The Hindus combine the planets with the sun be- Thedent: |

with the moon because the stars of her stations belong Fee 
to them. It is known among Hindn as well as Muslim 
astrologers that the planets exercise the rale over the 
zodiacal signs. Therefore they assume certain angelic 
beings as the dominants of the planets, who are ex- 
hibited in the following table, taken from the Véshnu-

CHAPTER LXII. 


ON THE SIXTY YEARS-SAMVATSARA, ALSO CALLED Page 263. 
“ BHASHTYABDA.” 


THE word samvatsara, which means the years, is a tech- x 

nical term for cycles of years constructed on the basis ft oie 
of the revolutions of Jupiter and the sun, the heliacal raujjubds, 
rising of the former being reckoned as the beginning. 

It revolves in sixty years, “aud is therefore called shash- 

fyabda, i. sixty years. 

We have already mentioned that the names of the a A your i 
Innar stations ate, by the names of the months, divided Sver by that 
into groups, each month having a namesake in the cor- which tne 
responding group of stations. We have represented rising of 
these things in a table, in order to facilitate the snbject tua, 
(v. i. 218). Knowing the station in which the heliacal 
rising of Jupiter occurs, and looking up this station in 
the just-mentioned table, you find at the left of it 
the name of the month which rales over the year in 
question. You bring the year in connection with the 
month, and say, eg. the year of Cattra, the year of Vai- 
étkha, &. For each of these years there exist astro- 
logical rules which are wel] known in their literature. 

For the computation of the lunar atation in which How to find 
the heliacal rising of Jupiter occurs, Varihamihira station of sof 
gives the following rule in his Samhita :— pole ris 

“Take the Sakakils, multiply it by 11, and multiply t gg 
the product by 4. You may do this, or you may also Nine don: 
multiply the SakakAle by 44. Add 8589 to the product till's, 


ag ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


and divide the sum by 3750. The quotient represents ae 
years, months, days, &c. 

« Add them to the Sakskfls, and divide the sum by 
60. The quotient represents great sexagenarian yuges, 
4¢, complete ehashfyabdas, which, as not being necessary, - 
are disregarded. Divide the remainder by 5, and the 
quotient represents small, complete five-year yugas. 
That which remains being less than one yuga, is called 
samvateara, ic. the year. 

.  “V, 22—Write down the latter namber in two diffe- — 
rent places. Multiply the one by 9, and add to the pro- 
duct ,', of the number in the other place. Take of the 
sum the fourth part, and this number represents com- 
plete lunar stations, ite fractions representing part of 
the next following current station. Count off this 
number of the stations, beginning with Dbanish¢h4. 
The station you arrive at is that one in which the 
heliacal rising of Jupiter takes place.” Thereby you 
know the month of the years, as has above been ex- 
plained. 

Smaller The great yugas begin with the heliacal rising of 

SZatined in Jupiter in the beginning of the station Dhanishtha and 

teordo the beginning of the month Magha. The small yugas 
have within the great ones a certain order, being 
divided into groups which comprehend certain numbers - 
of years, and each of which has a snecial dominant, 
This division is represented by the following table. 

If you know what number in the great yuga the year- 
in question occupies, and you look up this number 
among the numbers of the years in the upper art 
of the table, you find under it, in the corresponding 
columns, both the name of the year and the name of 
its dominant.

CHAPTER LXI. 129 


This is the method for the determination of the Page a. 
years of the shashtyabda, as recorded in their books, 
However, I have seen Hindus who subtract 3 from 
the era of Vikramfditya, and divide the remainder 
by 60. The remainder they count off from the begin- 
ning of the great yuga. This method is not worth 

anything. By-the-bye, it is the same whether you 
reckon in the manuer mentioned, or add 12 to the 
Sakakala, 

I have come across some people from the country The samrat- 
of Kanoj who told me that, with them, the cycle of people of 
samvatsaras has 1248 years, each single one of the a 
twelve samvratsaras having 104 years, According to 
this statement we must subtract 554 from the Sakakala, 
and with the remainder compare the following diagram. 

In the corresponding colnmn you see in which samvat- 
sara the year in qrestion lies, and how many years of 
the samvatsara have already elapsed :—

CHAPTER LXIII. 


ON THAT WHICH ESPECIALLY CONCERNS THE BRAHMANS, 
AND WHAT THEY ARE OBLIGED TO DO DURING THEIR 
WHOLE LIFE. 


First period THE life of the Brahman, after seven years of it have 


in the Brab- 


man’slife. passed,is divided into four parts. The first part begins 


Page 268, 


with the eighth year, when the Brahmans come to him 
to instruct him, to teach him his duties, and to enjoin 
him to adhere to them and to embrace them as long as 
he lives. Then they bind a girdle round his waist and 
invest him with a pair of yajnoparttas, zc, one strong 
cord consisting of nine single cords which are twisted 
together, and with a third yajnoparita, a single one 
made from cloth. This girdle runs from the left 
shoulder to the right hip. Further, he is presented 
with a stick which he has to wear, and with a seal- 
ring of a certain grass, called darbha, which he wears on 
the ring-finger of the right hand. This seal-ring is also 
called pavitra. The object of his wearing the ring on 
the ring-finger of his right hand is this, that it should 
be a good omen and a blessing for all those who receive 
gifts from that hand. The obligation of wearing the 
ring is not quite so stringent as that of wearing the 
yajnopavita, for from the latter he is not to separate 
himself under any circumstances whatever. If he 
takes it off while eating or fulfilling some want of 
nature, he thereby commits a sin which cannot be 
wiped off save by some work of expiation, fasting, or 
almsgiving. , 


CHAPTER LSIII, 131 


This first period of the Brahman’s life extends till the 
twenty-fifth year of his age, or, according to the Vishnu. 
Purdya, till his forty-eighth year. His dnty is to prac- 
tise abstinence, to make the earth his bed, to begin with 
the learning of the Veda and of its explanation, of the 
science of theology and law, all this being tanght to him 
by a master whom he serves day and night. He washes 
himself thrice a day, and perfarms a sacrifice to the fire 
both at the beginning and end of the day. After the sacri- 
fice he worships his master. He fasts a day and he breaks 
fast a day, but he is never allowed to eat meat. He 
dwells in the house of the master, which he only leaves 
in order to ask for a gift and to beg in not more than 
five houses once a day, either at noon or in the evening, 
Whatever alms he receives he places before his master 
to choose from it what he likes, Then the master 
allows him to take the remainder. Thus the pupil 
nourishes himself from the remains of the dishes of 
his master. Further, he fetches the wood for the fire, 
wood of two kinds of trees, paldéa (Butea frondosa) 
and darbha, in order to perform the sacrifice; for the 
Hindus highly venerate the fire, and offer flowers to it, 
It is the same case with all other nations, They 
always thought that the sacrifice was accepted by the 
deity if the fire came down upon it, and no other 
worship has been able to draw them away from it, 
neither the worship of idols nor that of stars, cows, 
asses, or images. Therefore Bashshar Ibn Burd says; 
“ Since there is fire, it is worshipped.” 

The second period of their life extendsfrom the twenty- Becond 
filth year till the fiftieth, or, according to the Vishnu-Pur- Brahman's 
dna, till the seventieth, The master allows him to marry,” 
He marries, establishes a household, and intends to have 
descendants, but he cohabits with his wife only once in 
a month after she has become clean of the menstruation. 
He is not allowed to marry a woman above twelve years 
of age. He gains his sustenance either by the fee he 


3 
i 


132 ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 


obtains for teaching Brahmans end Kshatriyas, not as 
& payment, but as a present, or by presents which he 
receives from some one because he performs for him 
the sacrifices to the fire, or by asking a gift from the 
kings and nobles, there being no importunate pressing 
ou his part, and no unwillingness on the part of the 
giver. There is always a Brahman in the honses of 
those people, who there administers the affairs of reli- 
gion and the works of piety. He is called purohita, - 
Lastly, the Brahman lives from what he gathers on the 
earth or from the trees. He may try his fortune in the 
trace of clothes and betel-nuts, but it is preferable that 
he should not trade himself, and that a Vaisya should 
do the business for him, because originally trade is for- 
bidden on account of the deceiving and lying which 
are mixed up with it. Trading is permitted to him 
only in case of dire necessity, when he has no other 
means of sustenance. . The Brahmans are not, like the 
other castes, bound to pay taxes and to perform services 
to the kings. Further, he is not allowed continually to 
busy himself with horses and cows, with the care for 
the cattle, nor with gaining by usury. The blue colour 
is impure for him, 30 that if it touches his body, he is 
obliged to wash himself. Lastly, he must always beat 
the drum before the fire, and recite for it the prescribed 
holy texts. 

The third period of the life of the Brahman extends 
from the fiftieth year to the seventy-fifth, or, according 
to the Vishnu-Purdna, till the ninetieth. He practises 
abstinence, leaves his household, and hands it as well 
as his wife over to his children, if the latter does not 
prefer to accompany him into the life in the wilderness, 
He dwells outside civilisation, and leads the same life 
again which he led in the first period. He does not 
take shelter under a roof, nor wear any other dress but 
some bark of a tree, simply sufficient to cover his loins. 
He slesps on the earth without any bed, and only 


CHAPTER LXIll. 133 


nourishes himeelf by fruit, vegetables, and roots, He 
lets the hair grow long, and does not anoint himself 
with oil. 

The fourth period extends till the end of life, He me The fourth 
wears a red garment and holds « stick in his hand, 
He is always given to meditation; he strips the mind 
of friendship and enmity, and roots out desire, and 
lust, and wrath. He does not converse with anybody 
at all. When walking to a place of a particular merit, 
in order to gain a heavenly reward, he does not etop on 
the road in a village longer than a day, nor in a city 
longer than five days. If any one gives him something, 
he does not leave a remainder of it for the following 
day. He has no other business but that of caring 
for the path which leads to salvation, and for reaching 
moksha, whence there is no return to this world. 

The universal duties of the Brahman throughout his the duties 
whole life are works of piety, giving alms and receiving fn general. 
them. For that which the Brahmans give reverts to 
the pitaras (is in reality a benefit to the Fathers). He 
must continually read, perform the sacrifices, take care 
of the fire which he lights, offer before it, worship it, 
and preserve it from being extinguished, that he may 
he burned by it after his death. It is called homa, 

Every day he must wash himself thrice: at the 
samadhi of rising, i.e, morning dawn, at the saidhi of 
setting, ic. evening twilight, and between them in the 
middle of the day. The first washing is on account of 
sleep, because the openings of the body have become 
lax during it. Washing is a cleansing from accidental 
impurity and @ preparation for prayer. 

Their prayer consists of praise, glorification, and pros- 
tration according to their peculiar manner, viz. pros- 
trating themselves on the two thumbs, whilst the two 
palms of the bands are joined, and they turn their faces 
towards the sun. For the sun is their kii/a, wherever 
he may be, except when in the south. For they do not 


Page 270. 


134 ALBERUNTIS INDIA. 


perform any work of piety with the face turned south- 
ward; only when occupied with something evil and 
unlucky they tarn themselves towards the sonth. 

The time when the sun declines from the meridian 
(the afternoon) is well suited for acquiring in it a 
heavenly reward. Therefore at this time the Brahman 
must be clean. 

The evening is the time of supper and of prayer. 
The Brahman may take his supper and pray without 
having previously washed himself. _Therefore, evidently, 
the rule as to the third washing is not as etringent as 
that relating to the first and second washings. 

A nightly washing is obligatory for the Brahman 
only at the times of eclipses, that he should be pre- 
pared to perform the rales and sacrifices prescribed for 
that occasion. 

The Brahman, as long as he lives, eats only twice a 
day, at noon and at nightfall; and when he wants to 
take his meal, he begina by putting aside as much as 
is anfficient for one or two men as alms, especially for 
strange Brahmans who happen to come at evening- 
time asking for something. To neglect their mainten- 
ance would be a great sin. Further, he puts something 
aside for the cattle, the birds, and the fire. Over the 
remainder he says prayers and eats it. The remainder 
of his dish he places ontside his house, and does not any 
more come near it, as it is no longer allowable for him, 
being destined for the chance passer-by who wants it, 
be he a man, bird, dog, or something else. 

The Brahman must have a water-vessel for himself, 
If another one uses it, it is broken. The same remark 
applies to his eating-instruments. I have seen Brah- 
mans who allowed their relatives to eat with them from 
the same plate, but most of them disapprove of this, 

He is obliged to dwell between the river Sindh in 
the north and the river Carmanvatt in the sonth. He 
is not allowed to .cross either of these frontiers so as 


CHAPTER LXIII, 135 


to enter the country of the Turks or of the Karnfta, 
Farther, he must live between the ocean in the east 
and west. People say that he is not allowed to stay 
in a country in which the grass which he wears on 
the ring-finger does not grow, nor the black-haired 
gazelles graze. This is a description for the whole 
country within the just-mentioned boundaries. If he 
passes beyond them he commits a sin, 

In a country where not the whole spot in the house 
which is prepared for people to eat upon it is plastered 
with clay, where they, on the contrary, prepare a sepa- 
rate tablecloth for each person eating by pouring water 
over a spot and plastering it with the dung of cows, 
the shape of the Brahman’s tablecloth must be square. 
Those who have the custom of preparing such table- 
claths give the following as the cause of this custom: 
-—The spot of eating is soiled by the eating. If the 
eating is finished, the spot is washed and plastered to 
become clean again. If, now, the soiled spot is not 
distinzuished by a separate mark, you would suppose 
also the other spots to be soiled, since they are similar 
to and cannot be distinguished from each other. 

Five vegetables are forbidden to them by the reli- 
gious code :—Onions, garlic, a kind of gourd, the root of 
a plant like the carrots called krnen (?), and another 
vegetable which grows round their tanks called ndJ¢.

CHAPTER LXIY. 


ON THE RITES AND CUSTOMS WHICH THE OTHER CASTES, 
BESIDES THE BRAHMANS, PRACTISE DURING THEIB 
LIFETIME. 


Tur Kshatriya reads the Veda and learns it, but does 
not teach it. He offera to the fire and acts according 
to the rules of the Purfinas. In places where, as we 
have mentioned (v. p. 135), a tablecloth is prepared 
for eating, he makes it angular. He rules the people 
and defends them, for he is created for this task. He 
girds himeelf with a single cord of the threefold yajno- 
pavita, and a single other cord of cotton. This takes 
place after he has finished the twelfth year of his life, 

It isthe duty of the Vaigya to practise agriculture 
and to cultivate the land, to tend the cattle and to 
remove the needs of the Brahmans, He is only allowed 
to gird himself with a single yajnopavita, which is made 
of two cords. 

The Sidra is like a servant to the Brahman, taking 
care of his affairs and serving him. If, though being 
poor in the extreme, he still desires not to be without 
a yajnopavita, he girds himself only with the linen one. 
Every action which is considered as the privilege of a 
Brahman, such as saying prayers, the recitation of the 
Veda, and offering sacrifices to the fire, is forbidden to 
him, to snch a degree that when, eg. a Sidra ore Vaigya 
is proved to have recited the Veda, he is accused by the 
Brahmans before the ruler, and the latter will order his 
tongue to be cut off. However, the meditation on God, 


CHAPTER LXIV. 137 


works of piety, and almsgiving are not forbidden to 
him. 

Every man who takes to some occupation which is 
not allowed to his caste, a9, eg. a Brahman to trade, a 
Sfidra to agriculture, commits a sin or crime, which 
they consider only a little less than the crime of theft. 

The following is one of the traditions of the Hindus: 

—In the days of, King Rama human life was very long, Bory of 
always of 2 well-defined and well-known length, Thus the Ged 
a child never died before its fether. Thon, however, Srabcess. 
it happened that the son of a Brahman died while the 
father was still aliva. Now the Brahman brought his 
child to the door of the king and spoke to him: “ This 
innovation has sprung up in thy days for no other 
reason but this, that there is something rotten in the 

state of the country, and because a certain Vazir com- 

mits in thy realm what he commits” Then Rama 
began to inquire into ths cause of this, and finally they | 
pointed ont to him a Candala who took the greatest 
pains in performing worship and in self-torment. The 

king rods to him and found him on the banks of the 
Ganges, hanging on something with his head down- 
ward. The king bent his bow, shot at him, and pierced 

his bowels, Then ha spoke: “That is it! I kill thee 

on account of a good action which thou art not allowed 

to do.” When he returned homs, he found the son of 

the Brahman, who had been deposited before his door, 
alive. 

All other men except the Candala, as far as they aro 
not Hindus, are called mleccha, i.e. unclean, all those 
who kill men and slaughter animals and eat the flesh 
of cows. 

All these things originate in the difference of the Philosophie 
classes or castes, ona set of people treating the others about all 
as fools. This apart, all men are equal to each other, equ 
ag Viisudeve says regarding him who seeks salvation: 

“In the judgment of the intelligent man, the Brahman 


138 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


and the Canpdals are equal, the friend and the foo, the 
faithful and the deceitful, nay, even the serpent. and 
the weasel. If to the eyes of intelligence all things 
are equal; to ignorance they appear as separated and 
different,” 

. Vasudeva speaks to Arjuna: “If the civilisation of 
the world is that which is intended, and if the direc- 
tion of it cannot proceed without our fighting for the 
purpose of suppressing evil, it is the duty of us who 
are the intelligent to act and to fight, not in order to 
bring to an end that which is deficient within us, but 
because it is necessary for the purpose of healing what 
is ill and banishing destructive elements, Then the 
ignorant imitate us in acting, as the children imitate 
their elders, without their knowing the real aim and 
purport of actions, For their nature has an aversion. to 
intellectual methods, and they use force only in order 
to act in accordance with the influences of Inst and 
passion on their senses. In all this, the intelligent and 
educated man is directly the contrary of them.”

CHAPTER LXV. 
ON THE SACRIFICES. 


Most of the Veda treats of the sacrifices to the fire, 

and describes each one of them. They are different in 
extent, so that certain of them can only be performed 

by the greatest of their kings. So, eg. the aévamedha. Atvamedha. 
A mare is let freely to wander about in the country 
grazing, without enybody’s hindering her. Soldiers 
follow her, drive her, and cry out before her: “She is 

the king of the world. He who does not agree, let him 

come forward.” The Brahmans walk behind her and 
perform sacrifices to the fire where she casts dung. 
When she thus has wandered about through all parts page o72. 
of the world, she becomes food for the Brahmans and 

for him whose property she is. 

Farther, the sacrifices differ in duration, so that only 
he could perform certain of them who lives a very long 
life; and such long lives do no longer occur in this 
our age. Therefore most of them have been abolished, 
and only few of them remain and are practised now- 

_ days. 

According to the Hindus, the fire eats everything, on tre. 
Therefore it becomes defiled, if anything unclean is Sop" 
mixed up with it, as, eg. water. Accordingly they are 
very punctilious regarding fire and water if they are in 
the hands of non-Hindus, because they are defiled by 
being touched by them. 

That which the fire eats for its share, reverts to the 
Devas, because the fire comes ont of their months 


140 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


‘What the Brahmans present to the fire to eat is oil and 
different cereals—wheat, barley, and rico—which they 
throw into the fire. Further, they recite the prescribed 
texts of the Veds in case they offer on their own behalf. 
However, if they offer in the name of somebody else, 
they do not recite anything. 


tory of the} The Vishuu-Dkarma mentions the following tradi- 


in 
poy tool 


tion :—Once upon a time there was a man of the class 
of the Daityas, powerful and brave, the ruier of a wide 
realm called Hiranyfiksha, He had a danghter of the 
name of Dktsh (?), who was always bent upon worship 
and trying herself by fasting and abstinence, Thereby. 
she had earned as reward a place in heaven. She was 
married to Mahfideva, When he, then, was alone with 
her and did with her according to the custom of the 
Devas, i.e. cohabiting very long and transferring the 
semen very slowly, the fire became aware of it and be- 
came jealous, fearing lest the two might procreate a fire 
similar to themselves, Therefore it determined to defile 
and to ruin them. 

When Mahadeva saw the fire, his forehead became 
covered with aweat from the violence of his wrath, so 
that some of it dropped down to the earth, The earth 
drank it, and became in consequence pregnant with 
Mars, ic. Skanda, the commander of the army of the 
Devas. 

Rudra, the destroyer, seized a drop of the semen of 
MahAdeva and threw it away. It was scattered in the 
interior of the earth, and represents all atom-like sub- 
stances (7). 

The fire, however, became leprous, and felt so much 
ashamed and confounded that it plunged down into 
patdia, <.. the lowest earth. As, now, the Devas missed 
the fire, they went ont to search for it. 

First, the frogs pointed it out to them, The fire, on 
seeing the Devas, left its place and concealed itself in 
the tree afvattha, laying a curse on the frogs, that they 


CHAPTER LXV. 14 


should have a horrid croaking and be odious to all 
others. 

Next, the perrots betrayed to the Devas the hiding- 
place of the fire, Thereupon the fire cursed them, that 
their tongues should be turned topsy-turvy, that their 
toot should be where its tip ought to be. But the 
Devas spoke to them: “If your tongue is turned topsy- 
turvy, you shall speak in human dwellings and eat 
delicate things.” 

The fire fled from the aéfvattha tree to the tree éami. 
Therenpon the elephant gave a hint to the Devas re- 
garding its hiding-place, Now it cursed the elephant 
thet his tongue should be turned topsy-turvy. But 
then the Devas spoke to him: “ If your tongue is tarned 
topsy-turvy, you shall participate with mau in his 
victuals and understand his speech.” 

At last they hit wpon the fire, but the fire refused to 
stay with them because it was leprous, Now the 
Devas restored it to health, and freed it from the 
leprosy. The Devas brought back to them the fire 
with all honour snd made it a mediator between them~- 
selves and mankind, receiving from the latter the 
shares which they offer to the Devas, and making these 
shares reach them.

CHAPTER LXVI. 
ON PILGRIMAGE AND THE VISITING OF SACRED PLACES. 


PInckimaGes sre not obligatory to the Hindus, bunt 
facultative and meritorious. A man sets off to wander 
to some holy region, to some much venerated idol or to 
some of the holy rivers. He worships in them, worships 
the idol, makes presents to it, recites many hymns and 
prayers, fasts, and gives alms to the Brahmans, the 
priests, and others. He shaves the hair of his head 
and beard, and returns home. 

The holy much venerated ponds are in the cold 
mountains round Meru. The following information 
regarding them is found in both the Vayu and the 
Matsya Purdnas :— 

“ At the foot of Mera there is Arhata (?), a very great 
pond, described as shining like the moon. In it origi- 


aed ‘Mata nates the river Zanba (1 *Jambu), which is very pure, 


Parigas. 


flowing over the purest gold. 

“Near the mountain Sveta there is the pond Uttara- 
ménasa, and around it twelve other ponds, each of them 
like a lake. Thence come the two rivers Sandi (?) and 
Maddbyanda (?), which flow to Kirnpurusha, 

“Near the monntain Nila there is the pond pyrd 
(pitanda ?) adorned with lotuses. 

“ Near the mountain Nishadha there is the pond Vish- 
nnpada, whence comes the river Sarasvati, i¢, Sarsuti. 
Besides, the river Gandharvt comes from there. 

“Tn the mountain Kailasa there is the pond Manda, 
as large as a sea, whence comes the river Mandakini, 


. CHAPTER LXVI. 143 


“North-east of Kailisa there is the monntain Can- 
draparvata, and at its foot the pond Acfd (?), whence 
comes the river Acfid. 

“Sonth-east of Kailisa there is the mountain Lohita, 
and at its foot a pond called Lohita Thence comes 
the river Lohitanadi 

“ South of Kailfsa there is the mountain Saraynfati (2), 
and at its foot the pond Manasa. Thence comes the. 
river Sarayd. 

“West of Kailisa there is the mountain Aruna, 
always covered with anow, waich cannot be ascended, 
At its foot is the pond Sailéda, whence comes the 
river Sailéda. 

“North of Kailadsa there ia the mountain Gaura (?), 
and at its foot the pond C-n-d-sara(?), ie, having 
golden sand, Near this pond the King Bhagiratha led 
his anchorite life. 

“His story is as follows:—A king of the Hindus Story of 
called Sagara had 60,000 aons, all of them bad, mean » 
fellows, Once they happened to lose a horse. They 
at once searched for it, and in searching they continu- 
ally ran about so violently that in consequence the 
surface of the earth broke in. They fouad the horse in 
the interior of the earth standing before a man who 
was looking down with deep-sunken eyes, When 
they came near him he amote them with his look, 
in conseqnence of which they were burned on the 
epot and went to hell on account of their wicked 
actions. 

“The collapsed part of the earth became a sea, the 
great ocean. A king of the descendants of that king, 
called Bhagiratha, on hearing the history of his ances- 
tors, was much affected thereby. He went to the 
above-mentioned pond, the bottom of which was 
polished gold, and stayed there, fasting all cay and rage 28. 
worshipping during the nights. Finally, Mahadeva 
asked him what he wanted; upon which he answered, 


i 


144 ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 


‘1 want the river Ganges which flows in Paradise, 
knowing that to any one over whom its water flows 
ail his sins are pardoned. Mahadeva granted him 
his desire. However, the Milky Way was the bed 
of the Ganges, and the Ganges was very haughty, 
for nobody had ever been able to stand against it. 
Now Mahddeva took the Ganges and put it on his 
hesd. When the Ganges could not move away, he 
became very angry and made a great uproar. How- 
ever, Mahfideva held him firmly, so that it was not 
possible for anybody to plunge into it. Then he took 
part of the Ganges and gave it to Bhagiratha, and this 
king made the middle one of its seven branches flow 
over the bones of his ancestors, whereby they became 
liberated from punishment, Therefore the Hindus 
throw the burned bones of their dead into the Ganges. 
The Ganges was also called by the name of that king 
who brought him to earth, te Bhagtratha,” 

We have already quoted Hindn traditions to the 
effect that in the Dvipas there are rivers as holy as the 
Ganges. In every place to which some particular holi- 
ness is ascribed, the Hindus construct ponds intended 
for the ablutions. In this they have attained to a very 
high degree of art,so that our people (the Muslims), 
when they see them, wonder at them, and are unable 
to describe them, much less to construct anything like 
them. They build them of great etones of an enor- 
mous bulk, joined to each other by sharp and strong 
cramp-irons, in the form of steps (or terraces) like so 
many ledges; and these terraces run all around the 
pond, reaching to a height of more than a man’s stature. 
On the surface of the stones between two terraces they 
construct staircases rising like pinnacles. Thus the 
first steps or terraces are like roads (leading round 
the pond), and the pinnacles are steps (leading up and 
down). Ié ever so many people descend to the pond 
whilst others ascend, they do not meet each other, and 


CHAPTER LXVI. 145 


the road is never blocked up, because there are so many 
terraces, and the ascending person can always turn 
aside to another terrace than that on which the descend- 
ing people go, By this arrangement all troublesome 
thronging is avoided. 

In Multan there is a pond in which the Hindus on single 
worship by bathing themselves, if they are not pre-e” ”™*™ 
vented. 

The Samhita of Varahamihira relates that in Tane- 
shar there is a pond which the Hindus visit from afar 
to bathe in its water. Regarding the cause of this 
custom they relate the following:—The waters of all 
the other holy ponds visit this particular pond at the 
time of an eclipse. Therefore, if a man washes in it, 
it is as if he had washed in every single one of all of 
them. Then Varahamihira continues: “ People say, if 
it were not the head (apsis) which causes the eclipse 
of sun and moon, the other ponds would not visit this 
pond.” 

The ponds become particularly famous for holiness 
either because some important event has happened at 
them, or because there is some passage in the holy 
text cr tradition which refars to them. We have 
already quoted words spoken by Saunaka. Venus had 
related them to him on the authority of Brahman, to 
whom they had originally been addressed. In this text 
King Bali also is mentioned, and what he would do till 
the time when Nardyana would plunge him down to 
the lowest earth. In the same text occurs the follow- 
ing passage :—‘I do that to him only for this purpose on the in- 
that the equality between men, which he desires to omatai be 
realise, ahall be done away with, that men shall be ongin tga and to 
different in their conditions of life, and that on this Xtmaition 
difference the order of the world is to be based; further, 5" 
that people shall turn away from his worship and Page 75 
worship me and believe in me, The mutual assistanca 
of civilised people presupposes a certain difference 

VOL, IL. K 


146 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


among them, in consequence of which the one requires 
the other. According to the same principle, God has 
created the world as containing many differences in 
itself. So the single countries differ from each other, 
one being cold, the other warm; one having good 
soil, water, and air, the other having bitter salt soil, 
dirty and bad smelling water, and unhealthy air. 
There are still more differences of this kind; in some 
cases advantages of all kinds being numerous, in others 
few. In some parts there are periodically return- 
ing physical disasters; in others they are entirely 
unknown. All these things induce civilised people 
carefully to select the places where they want to build 
towns. 

That which makes people do these things is usage 
and custom. However, religious commands are machi 
more powerful, and influence mnch more the nature of 
man than usages and customs. The bases of the latter 
are investigated, explored, and accordingly either kept 
or abandoned, whilst the bases of the religions com- 
mands are left as they are, not inquired into, adhered 


‘to by the majority simply on trust. They do not argue 


asan 
asylum. 


over them, as the inhabitants of some sterile region do 
not argue over it, since they are born in it and do not 
know anything else, for they love the country as their 
fatherland, and find it difficult to leave it. If, now, 
besides physical differences, the countries differ from 
each other also in law and religion, there is so much 
attachment to it in the hearts of those who livein them 
that it can never be rooted out.” 

The Hindus have some places which are venerated 
for reasons connected with their law and religion, ¢g. 
Benares (Darainasi), For their anchorites wander to it 
and atay there for ever, as the dwellers of the Ka‘ba 
stay for ever in Mekka. They want to live there to 
the end of their lives, that their reward after death 
should be the better for it. They say that a murderer 


CHAPTER LXVI. 147 


ie held responsible for his crime and punished with a 
punishment due to his guilt, except in case he enters 
the city of Benares, where he obtains pardon, Regard- 
ing the cause of the holiness of this asylum they relate 
the following story :— 

“Brahman was in ehape four-headed. Now there 
happened some quarrel between him and Sarhkara, ie. 
Mahadeva, and the succeeding fight had this result, 
that one of the heads of Brahman was torn off. At 
that time it was the custom that the victor took the 
head of the slain adversary in his hand and let it hang 
down from his hand as an act of ignominy to the dead 
and as aaign of his own bravery. Further, a bridle was 
put into the mouth (7). Thus the head of Brahman was 
dishonoured by the hand of Mahideva, who took it 
always with him wherever he went and whatever he 
did. He never once separated himself from it when he 
entered the towns, till at last he came to Benares. After 
le had entered Benares the head dropped from his hand 
and disappeared.” 

A similar place is Pikara, the story of which is this: on tne holy 
Brahman once was occupied in offering there to the Ptr, 
fire, when a pig came out of the fire. Therefore they Mantre,” 
represent his image there as that of a pig. Outside eS 
the town, in three places, they have constructed ponds 
which stand in high veneration, and are places of 
worship. 

Another place of the kind is Taneshar, also called 

Kurukshetra, ie. the land of Kuru, who was « peasant, 
a pious, holy man, who worked miracles by divine 
power. Therefore the country was called after him, 
and venerated for his aake. Besides, Taneshar is the 
theatre of the exploits of Vasudeva in the wars of 
Bharats and of the destraction of the evil-doers. It is 
for this reason that people visit the place, 

Mahia, too, is a holy place, crowded with Brahmans. 


Page 276. 


148 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


It is venerated because Vasudeva was there born and 
brought up, in a place in the neighbourhood called 
Nandagoia, 

Nowadays the Hindus also visit Kashmtr. Lastly, 
they used to visit Mfiltin before its idoltemple was 
destroyed. 


( 149 ) 


CHAPTER LXVII. 


ON ALMS, AND HOW A MAN MUST SPEND WHAT HE 
EARNS. 


Ir is obligatory with them every day to give alms as 
much as possible. They do not let money become a 
year or even a month old, for this would be a draft on 
an unknown future, of which a man does not know 
whether he reaches it or not. 

With regard to that which he earna by the crops or 
from the cattle, he is bound first to pay to the ruler of 
the conntry the tax which attaches to the soil or the 
pasture-ground. Further, he pays him one-sixth of the 
income in recognition of the protection which he affords 
to the subjects, their property, and their families. The 
same obligation rests also on the common people, but 
they will always lie and cheat in the declarations about 
their property. Further, trading businesses, too, pay a 
tribute for the same reason. Only the Brahmans are 
exempt from all these taxes. 

As to the way in which the remainder of the income, 
after the taxes have been deducted, is to be employed, 
there are different opinions. Some destine one-ninth of 
itfior alms. For they divide it into three parts. One of 
them is kept in reserve to guarantee the heart against 
anxiety. The second is spent on trade to bring profit, 
and one-third of the third portion (i.e. one-ninth of the 
whole) is spent on alms, whilst the two other thirds are 
spent according to the same rule. 

Others divide this income into four portions. One- 


150 ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 


fourth is destined for common expenses, the second for 
liberal works of a noble mind, the third for alms, and 
the fourth for being kept in reserve, ie not more of 
it than the common expenses for three years. If the 
quarter which is to be reserved exceeds this amount, 
only this amount is reserved, whilst the remainder is 
spent a3 a: ms. 

Usury or taking percentages is forbidden. The sin 
which a man commits thereby corresponds to the 
amount by which the percentages have increased the 
capital stock. Only to the Sidra is it allowed to take 
percentages, as long as his profit is not more than one- 
fiftieth of the capital (te, he is not to take more than 
two per cent.). 


( 158) 


CHAPTER LXVIII. 


ON WHAT I3 ALLOWED AND FORBIDDEN IN EATING 
AND DRINKING. 


ORIGINALLY killing in genaral was forbidden to them, 
as it is to the Christians and Manicheans. People, 
however, have the desire for meat, and will always 
fling aside every order to the contrary. Therefore the 
heré-mentioned law applies in particular only to the 
Brahmans, because they are the guardians of the reli- 
gion, and because it forbids them to give way to their 
lusts. The same rule applies to those members of the 
Christian clergy who are in rank above the bishops, 
viz. the metropolitans, the cathulici, and the patriarcbs, 
not to the lower grades, euch as presbyter and deacon, 
except in the case that a man who holds one of these 
degrees is at the same time a monk. 

‘As matters stand thus, it is allowed to kill animals by Must of ant. 
means of strangulation, but only certain animals, others rod unlaw- 
being excluded. The meat of such animals, the killing of eaten. 
which is allowed, is forbidden in case they die a sudden 
death. Animals the killing of which is allowed are 
sheep, goats, gazelles, hares, rhinoceroses (gandha), the 
buffaloes, fish, water and land birds, as sparrows, ring- 
doves, francolins, doves, peacocks, and other animals Page 277. 
which are not loathsome to wan nor noxions. 

That whioh is forbidden are cows, horses, mules, 
asses, camels, elephants, tame poultry, crows, parrots, 
nightingales, all kinds of eggs and wine. The latter is 


152 ALBERUNI'S INDIA. — 


allowed to the Sidra. He may drink it, but dare not 
sell it, as he is not allowed to sell mest. 


- Why the Some Hindus say that in the time before Bhfrata it . 
wes torial” was allowed to eat the meat of cowa, and that, there 


then existed sacrifices part of which was the killing of 
cows, After that time, however, it had been forbidden 
on account of the weakness of men, who were tuo weak 
to fulfil their duties, as also the Veda, which originally 
was only one, was afterwards divided into four parts, 
simply for the purpose of facilitating the study of it to 
men, This theory, however, is very little substantiated, 
as the prohibition of the meat of cows is not an alle- 
viating and less strict measure, but, on the contrary, one, 
which is more severe and more restrictive than the 
former law. 

Other Hindus told me that the Brahmans used to 
suffer from the eating of cows’ meat. For their country 
is hot, the inner parts of the bodies are cold, the natural 
warmth becomes feeble in them, and the power of. 
digestion is so weak that they must strengthen it by 
eating the leaves of betel after dinner, and by chewing ~ 
the betel-nut. The hot betel inflames the heat of the. 
body, the chalk on the betel-leaves dries up everything 
wet, and the betel-nut acts as an astringent on the 
teeth, the gums, and the stomach. As this is the case, 
they forbade eating cows’ meat, because it is essentially 
thick and cold, 

I, for my part, am uncertain, and hesitate in the 
question of the origin of this custom between two diffe- 
rent views. 

(Lacuna tn the manuscript.) 

As for the economical reason, we must keep in mind 
that the cow is the animal which serves man in travel-. 
ling by carrying his loads, in agriculture in the works 
of ploughing and sowing, in the household by the milk 
and the product made thereof. Further, man makes 
use of its dung, and in winter-time even of its breath. 


CHAPTER LXVIII. 153 


Therefore it was_ forbidden to eat cows’ meat; as also 
Albajjij forbade it, when people complained to him. 
that Babylonia became more and more desert. 

I have been told the following passage is from an Thatall 

Indian book; “ All things are one, and whether allowed eqial gn 
or forbidden, equal. They differ only in weakness and Sal pei of 
power. The wolf has the power.to tear the aheep ; 
therefore the sheep is the wolf’s food, for the former 
cannot oppose the latter, and is his prey.” I have 
found in Hindu books passages to the same effect. 
However, such views come to the intelligent man only 
by knowledge, when in it hs has attained to such a 
degree that a Brahman and a Candfila are equal to him. 
Tf he is in this state, all other things also are equal to 
him, in so far as he abstains from them. It is the same 
if they are all allowed to him; for he can dispense with 
them, or if they are forbidden to him, for he. does not 
desire them. As to those, however, who require these 
things, being in the yoke of ignorance, something is 
allowed to them, something forbidden, and thereby a 
wall is erected between the two kinds of things.

law of 


* for it prevents the uproar of passions abhorred by 


the cultivated mind, and it removes all those causes 
which excite the animal to a fury always leading to 
harm. Considering the life of the animals by pairs, 
how the one member of the pair helps the other, and 
how the Just of other animals of the same species is 
kept aloof from them, you cannot help declaring matri- 
mony to be a necessary institution; whilst disorderly 
cohabitation or harlotry on the part of man is a shame- 
ful proceeding, that does not even attain to the standing 
of the development of animals, which in every other 
respect stand far below him. 

Every nation has particular customs of marriage, 
and especially those who claim to have a religion anc 
Jaw of divine origin. The Hindus marry at e very 
young ege; therefore the parents arrange the marriage 
for their sons. On that occasion the Brahmans perform 
the rites of the sacrifices, and they as well as others 
receive alms. The implements of the wedding rejoic- 
ings are brought forward. No gift is settled between 
them, The man gives only # present to the wife, as he 
thinks fit, and a marriage gift in advance, which he has 
no right to claim back, but the wife may give it back 
to him of her own will. Husband and wife can only 
be separated by death, as they have no divorce. 


CHAPTER LXIX, 155 


A man may warry one to four wives. He is not 
allowed to take more than four; butif one of his wives 
die, he may take another one to complete the legitimate 
number, However, he must not go beyond it. 

If a wife loses her husband by death, she cannot The widow. 
marry another man. She has only to chose between 
two things—either to remain a widow as long as she 
lives or to burn herself ; and the latter eventuality is 
considered the preferable, because as a widow she is 
ill-treated as long as she lives. As regards the wives 
of the kings, they are in the habit of burning them, 
whether they wish it or not, by which they desire to 
prevent any of them by chance committing something 
unworthy of the illustrious husband. They make an 
exception only for women of sdvanced years and for 
those who have children; for the son is the responsible 
protector of his mother. 

According to their marriage law it is better to marry Forbidden 
® stranger than a relative. The more distant the rela- Seu 
tionzhip of a woman with regard to her husband the 
better. It is absolutely forbidden to marry related 
women both of the direct descending line, viz. a grand- 
daughter or great-granddaughter, and of the direct 
ascending line, viz. 9 mother, grandmother, or great- 
grandmother. It is also forbidden to marry collateral 
relations, viz. a sister, a niece, a maternal or paternal 
aunt and their daughters, except in case the couple of 
relaticns who want to marry each other be removed 
from each other by five consecutive generations. In 
that case the prohibition is waived, but, notwith- 
standing, such a marriage is an object of dislike to 
them. 

Some Hindus think that the number of the wives number of 
depends upon the caste; that, accordingly, 2 Brahman ™"* 
may taka four, a Kshatriya three, a Vaisya two wives, 
and a Sfidra one, Every man of a caste may marry 3 
woman of his own caste or one of the castes or caste

below his; but nobody i is allowed to marry a woman 
of a caste superior to his own. 


Pertuesqxi- The child belongs to the caste of the smaller: not to 


that of the father. Thus, eg. if the wife of a Brahman 
ig a Brahman, her child also is a Brahman ; if she is a 
Sidra, her child is a Sddra. In our time, nweyen the 
Brahmans, although it is allowed to them, never marry 
any woman except one of their own caste. 

The longest duration of the menstrual courses which 
has been observed is sixteen days, but in reality they 
last only during the first, four days, and then the hus- 
band is not allowed to cohabit with his wife, nor even 
to come near her in the house, because during this 
time she is impure. After the four days have elapsed. 
and ehe has washed, ehe is pure again, and the husband 
may cohabit with her, even if the blood has not yet. 
entirely disappeared ; for this blood is not considered 
as that of the menstrual courses, but as the same sub- 
stance-matter of which the embryos consist. 

It is the duty (of the Brahman), if he wants to co- 
habit with a wife to get a child, to perform a sacrifice 
to the fire called gorbhidhdna ; but he does not perform 
it, because it requires the presence of the woman, and 
therefore he feels ashamed to doeo. In consequence 
he postpones the sacrifice and unites it with the next 
following one, which is due in the fourth month of the 
pregnancy, called simaritonnayanam. After the wife 
hes given birth to the child, a third sacrifice is per- 
formed between the birth and the moment when the 
mother begins to nourish the child. It is called jdéa- 
karman. 

The child receives a name after the days of the child- 
bed have elapsed. The sacrifice for the occasion of the 
name-giving is called ndmakarman. 

As long as the woman is in childbed, she does not 
tonch any vessel, and nothing is eaten in her house, nor 
does the Brahman light there a fire. These days are 


CHAPTER LXIX. 157 


eight for the Brahman, twelve for the Kshatriya, fifteen 
for the Vaiéya, and thirty for the Sadra. For the low- 
caste people which are not reckoned among any caste, 
no term is fixed. 

The longest duration of the suckling of the child is 
three years, but there is no obligation in this matter. 
The sacrifice on the occasion of the first cutting of the 
child’s hair is offered in the third, the perforation of 
the ear takes place in the seventh and eighth years, 

People think with regard to harlotry that it is allowed on the 
with them. Thus, when Kabul was conquered by the peru: 
Muslims and the Ispahbad of Kabul edopted Islam, be “°* 
stipulated that he should not be bound to eat cows’ meat 
nor to commit sodomy (which proves that he abhorred 
the one as much as the other), In reality, the matter 
is not as people think, but it is rather this, that the 
Hindus are not very severe in punishing whoredom. 
The fault, however, in this lies with the kings, not with 
the nation. But for this, no Brahman or priest would 
suffer in their idol-temples the women who sing, dance, 
and play. The kings make them an attraction for their 
cities, a bait of pleasure for their subjects, for no other 
but financial reasons, By the revenues which they 
derive from the business both as fines and taxes, they 
want to recover the expenses which their treasury has 
to spend on the army. 

In a similar way the Buyide prince ‘“Adud-aldaula 
acted, who besides also had a second aim in view, viz. 
that of protecting his subjects against the passions of 
his unmarried soldiers.

CHAPTER LXX. 
ON LAWSUITS. 


TuE judge demands from the euitor a document written 
against the accused person in a well-known writing which 
is thought suitable for writs of the kind, and in the 
document the well-established proof of the justice of 
his suit. In case there is no written document, the 
contest is settled by means of witnesses without a 
written document, 

The witnesses must not be Jess than four, but there 
may be more. Only in case the justice of the deposi- 
tion of a witness is perfectly established and certain 
before the judge, he may admit it, and decide the qnes- 
tion alone on the basis of the deposition of this sole 
witness. However, he does not admit prying about in 
secret, deriving arguments from mere signs or indica- 
tions in public, conclnding by analogy from one thing 
which seems established about another, and using all 
sorts of tricks to elicit the truth, as Iyaés Ibn Mnu'‘i- 
wiya used to do. : 

If the suitor is not able to prove his claim, the de- 
fendant must ewear, but he may also tender the oath 
to the suitor by saying, “Swear thon that thy claim is 
true. and I will give thee what thou claimest.” 

There are many kinds of the oath, in accordance with 
the value of the object of the claim, If the object is 
of no great importance, and the suitor agrees that the 
accused person shall swear, the latter simply swears 
before five learned Brahmans in the following words: 


CHAPTER LXX. 159 


“Tf I lie, he shall have as recompense as much of my 
goods as is equal to the eizhtfold of the amonnt of his 
claim.” 

A bigher sort of oath is this: The accused person is 
invited to drink the bésh (visha ?) called brahmana (?). 
It is one of the worst kinds; hutif he speaks the trath, 
the drink does not do him any harm, 

A atill higher sort of ordeal is this: They bring the Puge 2% 
man to a deep and rapidly flowing river, or to a deep 
well with much water, Then he speaks to the water: 
«Since thou belongest to the pure angels, and knowest 
both what is secret and public, kill me if I lie, and 
preserve me if I speak the truth.” Then five men 
take him between them and throw him into the 
water. Ii he has spoken the truth, he will not drown 
and die. 

A atill higher sort is the following: The judge sends 
both claimant and defendant to the temple of the most 
venerated idol of the town or realm. There the defen- 
dant has to fast during that day. On the following day 
he dresses ia new garments, and posts himself together 
with the claimant in that temple. Then the priests 
pour water over the idol and give it him to drink. If 
he, then, hes not spoken the truth, be at once vomits 
blood. 

A atill higher sort is the following: The defendant 
is placed on the scale of a balance, and is weighed ; 
wherenpon he is taken off the acale, and the scale is 
left as it is. Then he invokes as witnesses for the 
truth of his deposition the spiritual beings, the angels, 
the heavenly beings, one after the other, and all which 
he speaks he writes down on a piece of paper, and fastens 
it to his head. He is a second time placed in the scale 
of the balance. In case he has spoken the truth, he 
now weighs more than the first time. 

There is also a still higher sort. It is the following: 
They take bntter and sesame-oil in equal quantities, and 


-160 ALBERUNFS INDIA. 


‘boil them in a:kettle: Then they throw a leaf into it, 
which by getting flaccid and burned is to them a sign 
of the boiling of the mixture, When the boiling is at 
its height, they throw a piece of gold into the kettle 
and order the defendant to fetch it out with his hand, 
If he has spoken the truth, he fetches it out. 

The highest kind of ordeal is the following: They 
make a piece of iron so hot that it is near melting, and 
put it with a pair of tongs on the hand of the defen- 
dant, there being nothing between his hand and the 
iron save a broad leaf of some plant, and under it some 
few and scattered corns of rice in the husks. They 
order him to carry it seven paces, and then he may 
throw it to the grouud.

CHAPTER LXX1. 
ON PUNISHMENTS AND EXPIATIONS. 


In this regard the manners and customs of the Hindus 
resemble those of the Christians, for they are, like those 
of the latter, based. on the principles of virtue aud 
abstinence from wickedness, such as never to kill 
under any circumstance whatsoever, to give to him who 
has stripped you of your coat also your shirt, to offer 
to him who has beaten your cheek the other cheek 
“also, to bless your enemy and to pray for him. Upon 
my life, this is a noble philosophy; but the people of 
this world are not all philosophers. Most of them are 
ignorant and erring, who cannot be kept on the straight 
road save by the sword and the whip. And, indeed, 
ever since Constantine the Victorious became a Chris- 
tian, both sword and whip have ever been employed, 
for without them it would be impossible to rule. 

India has developed in a similar way. For the Hin- 
dus relate that originally the affairs of government and 
war were inthe hands of the Brahmans, hut the country 
became disorganised, since they ruled according to the 
philosophic principles of their religious codes, which 
proved impossible when opposed to the mischievous 
and perverse elements of the populace. They were even 
near losing also the administration of their religious 
affairs, Therefore they humiliated themselves before 
the lord of their religion. Whereupon Brahman in- 
trusted them exclusively with the functions which they 
now have, whilst he intrusted the Kshatriyas with the

duties of ruling and fighting. Ever since the Brahmans 
live by asking and begging, and the penal code is exer- 
cised under the control of the kings, not under that of 
the scholars. 

The law about murder is this: If the aianiaree i is a 
Brahman, aud the murdered person a member of another © 
caste, he is only bound to do expiation consisting of 
fasting, prayers, and almsgiving. 

If the murdered person is a Brahman, the Brahman 
murderer has to answer for it in a future life ; for he is 
not allowed to do expiation, because expistion wipes off 
the sin from the sinner, whilst nothing can wipe off any 
of the mortal crimes from a Brahman, of which the 


greatest are: the murder of a Brahman, called vajra- 


brahmahatyd ; further, the killing of a cow, the drink- 
ing of wine, whoredom, especially with the wife of one’s 
own father and teacher, However, the kings do not 
for any of these crimes kill a Brahman or Kshatriya, 
bat they confiscate his property and banish him from 
their conutry. 

If a man of a caste under those of the Brahman and 
Kshatriya kills a man of the same caste, he has to 
do expiation, but besides the kinge inflict upon him a 
punishment in order to establish an example. 


Lawofthen. The law of theft directs that the punishment of the - 


Punishment 


ofan 


thief should be in accordance with the value of the stolen 
object, Accordingly, sometimes a punishment of extreme 
or of middling severity is necessary, sometimes & course 
of correction and imposing a payment, sometimes only 
exposing to pnblic shame and ridicule. If the object is 
very great, the kings blind a Brahman and mutilate him, 
cutting off his left hand and right foot, or the right hand 
and left foot, whilst they mutilate a Kshatriya without 
blinding him, and kill thieves of the other castes. 

An adulteress is driven out of the house of the hus- 
band and banished. 

I have repeatedly been told that when Hindu slaves 


CHAPTER LXXI. 163 


(in Muslim countries) escape and return to their country Hindu 
and religion, the Hindus order that they should fast hy fa Latearamsigg 
way of expiation, then they bury them in the dung, Hitrning return 
stale, and milk of cows fora certain number of days, ty. Ptr ou 
till they get into a state of fermentation. Then they 
drag them out of the dirt and give them similar dirt 
to eat, and more of the like. 
T have asked the Brshmans if this is true, but they 
deny it, and maintain that there is no expiation possible 
for such an individual, and that he is never allowed 
to return into those conditions of life in which he was 
before he was carried off as a prisoner. And how 
should that be possible? If a Brahman eats in the 
honse of a Sfidra for sundry days, he is expelled rom 
his caste and can never regain it.

CHAPTER LXXIiI. 


ON INHERITANCE, AND WHAT CLAIM THE DECEASED 
PERSON HAS ON IT. 


Lawofine THE chief rule of their law of inheritance is this, that 


Page 282, 


the women do not inherit, except the danghter. She 
gets the fourth part of the share of a son, according to 
a passage in the book Manu. If she is not married, 
the money is spent on her till the time of her marriage, 
and her dowry is bought by means of her share. After- 
wards she has no more income from the house of her 
father. 

If a widow does not burn herself, but prefers to remain 
alive, the heir of her deceased husband has to provide 
her with nourishment and clothing as long as she lives. 

The debts of the deceased must be paid by his heir, 
either ont of his share or of the stock of his own pro- 
perty, no regard being had whether the deceased has 
left any property or not. Likewise he must bear the 
just-mentioned expenses for the widow in any case 
whatsoever. 

As regards the rule about the male heirs, evidently 
the descendants, i.¢, the son and grandson, have a nearer 
claim to the inheritance than the ascendants, z.. the 
father and grandfather. Further, as regards the single 
relatives among the descendants as well as the ascen- 
dants, the nearer a man is related, the more claim he 
has on inheriting. Thus a son has a nearer claim than 
a grandson, a father than a grandfather. 

The collateral relations, as, ¢.g. the brothers, have less 


CHAPTER LXXII. 165 


claim, and inherit only in case there is nobody who has 
a better claim, Hence it is evident that the son of a 
danghter has more claim than the son of a siater, and 
that the son of a brother has more claim than either 
of them, 

If there are several claimants of the same degree of 
relationship, a3, ¢g., sona or brothers, they all get equal 
shares. A hermaphrodite is reckoned as a male being. 

If the deceased leaves no heir, the inheritance falls 
to the treasury of the king, except in the case that the 
deceased person was a Brahman. In that case the 
king has no right to meddle with the inheritance, but 
it is exclusively spent on almsgiving. 

The dnty of the heir towards the deceased in the 


first year consists in his giving sixteen banquets, where v 


every guest in addition to his food receives alms also, 
viz. on the fifteenth and sixteenth days after death; 
further, once a month during the whole year, The ban- 
quet in the sixth month mnst be more rich and more 
liberal than the others. Further, on the last but one 
day of the year, which banqnet is devoted to the 
deceased and his ancestors; and finally, on the last day 
of the year. With the end of the year the duties 
towards the deceased have been fulfilled. 

If the heir is a son, he must during the whole year 
wear mourning dress; he must mourn and have no 
intercourse with women, if he is a legitimate child and 
of a good stock. Besides, you must know that nonrish- 
ment is forbidden to the heirs for one single day in the 
first part of the mourning-year. 

Besides the almsgiving at the just-mentioned aixteen 
banquets, the heirs must make, above the door of the 
house, something like a shelf projecting from the wail 
in the open air, on which they have every day to place 
a dish of something cooked and s vessel of water, till 
the end of ten daya after the death. For possibly the 
spirit of the deceased has not yet found its rest, but 


trom Pisto. 


“166 ALBERUNT'S INDIA, 


moves still to and fro around the house, hungry and 
A similar view is indicated by Plato in Phaedo, where 
he speaks of the soul circling round the graves, because — 
possibly it still retains some vestiges of the love for the 
body. Further he asys: “ People have said regarding 
the soul that it is its habit to combine something cohe- 
rent out of the single limbs of the body, which is its 
dwelling in this as well as in the future world, when it 
leaves the body, and is by the death of the body sepa- 
rated from it.” 
. On the tenth of the last-mentioned days, the heir 
spends, in the name of the deceased, much food and 
cold water, After the eleventh day, the heir sends 
every day sufficient food for a single person and a 
dirham to the house of the Brahman, and continues 
doing this during all the days of the mourning-year 
without any interruption wutil its end. 


-( 167 ) 


CHAPTER LXXIII 


ABOUT WHAT IS DUE TO THE BODIES OF THE DEAD AND 
OF THE LIVING (i. ABOUT BURYING AND SUICIDE). 


In the most ancient times the bodies of the dead were Primitive ; 
exposed to the air by being thrown on the fields without toms. 
any covering; also sick people were exposed on the 

fields and in the mountains, and were left there. If 

they died there, they had the fate just mentioned; but 

if they recovered, they returned to their dwellings. 

Thereupon there appeared a legislator who ordered Page 233. 
people to expose their dead to the wind, In conse- 
quence they constructed roofed buildings with walls of 
rails, through which the wind blew, passing over the 
dead, as something similar is the case in the grave- 
towers of the Zoroastrians. 

After they had practised this custom for a long time, 
Narfyana prescribed to them to hand the dead over to 
the fire, and ever since they are in the habit of burn- 
ing them, so that nothing remains of them, and every 
defilement, dirt, and smell is annihilated at once, so 
as scarcely to leave any trace behind. 

Nowadays the Slavonians, too, burn their dead, whilst Oreck par- 
the ancient Greeks seem to have had both customs, : 
that of burning and that of burying. Socrates speaks 
in the book Phsedo, after Crito had asked him in what 
manner he wanted to be buried: “As you wish, when 
you make arrangements for me. I shall not flee from 
you.” Then he spoke to those around him: “Give to 
Crito regarding myself the opposite guarantee of that 


168 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


which he has given to the judges regarding myself; 
for he guaranteed to them that I should stay, whilat 
you now must guarantee that I shall not atay after 
death, I shall go away, that the look of my body 
may be tolerable to Crito when it is burned or burted, 
that he may not be in agony, and not say: ‘Socrates 
is carried away, or is burned or buried, Thou, O 
Crito, be at ease about the burial of my body. Do 
as thou likest, and specially in accordance with the 
lawa.” 

Galenus saya in his commentary to the apothegms 
of Hippocrates: “It is generally known that Asclepius 
was raised to the angels in a column of fire, the like of 
which is also related with regard to Dionyace, Heracles, 
and others, who laboured for the benefit of mankind. 
People say that God did thus with them in order to 
destroy the mortal and earthly part of them by the fire, 
and afterwards to attract to himself the immortal part 
of them, and to raise their sonls to heaven.” 

Tn these words, too, there is a reference to the burning 
as a Greek custom, but it seems to have been in use 
only for the great men among them. 

In a similar way the Hindus express themselves, 
There is a point in man by which he is what he is. 
This point becomes free when the mixed elements of 
the body are dissolved and scattered by combustion. 

Firesndthe Regarding this return (of the immortal soul to God), 

rman the Hindus think that partly it is effected by the rays 

rein of the sun, the soul attaching itself to them and ascend- 
ing with them, partly by the flame of the fire, which 
raises it (to God). Some Hindu used to pray thet God 
would make his road to himself as a atraight line, be- 
cause this is the nearest road, and that there is no other 
road upwards save the fire or the ray. 

Similar to this is the practice of the Ghuzz Turks 
with reference to a drowned person ; for they place the 
body on a hier in the river, and make a cord hang down 


CHAPTER LXXIIl. 169 


from his foot, throwing the end of the cord into the 
water, By means of this cord the spirit of the deceased 
is to raise himself for resurrection. 

The belief of the Hindns on this head was confirmed 
by the words of Vasudeva, which he spoke regarding 
the sign of him who is liberated from the fetters (of 
bodily existence), “His death takes plsce during wtia- 
rdyana (i.e. the northern revolution of the sun from the 
winter solstice to the summer solstice), during the 
white half of the month, between lighted lamps, i.e, be- 
tween conjunction and opposition (new moon and full 
moon), in the seasons of winter and spring.” 

A similar view is recognised in the following words Quotation 
of Mant: “The other religious bodies blame us “because Page 284. 
we worship sun and moon, snd represent them as an 
image. But they do not know their real natures; they 
do not know that sun and moon are our path, the door 
whence we march forth into the world of our existence 
(into heaven), as this has been declared by Jesus.” So 
he maintains. 

People relate that Buddha had ordered the bodies of 
the dead to be thrown into flowing water, Therefore 
his followers, the Shamanians, throw their dead into 
the rivers, 

According to the Hindus, the body of the dead has ningu 
the claim upon his heirs that they are to wash, embalm, pura” 
wrap it in a shroud, and then to burn it with as much 
sandal and other wood as they can get. Part of his 
burned bones are brought to the Ganges and thrown 
into it, that the Ganges should flow over them, as it 
has flowed over the burned bones of the children of 
Sagera, thereby forcing them from hell and bring- 
ing them into paradise. The remainder of the ashes 
is thrown into some brook of running water, On 
the spot where the body has been burned they raise 
& monument similar to a milestone, plastered with 


gypsum. 


The tree of 


170 ALBERUNI'S INDIA. 


The bodies of children under three years are not 
burned. 

Those who fulfil these duties towards the dead 
wards wash themselves as well as their dresses during 
two days, because they have become unclean by touch- 
ing the dead. 

Those who cannot afford to burn their dead will 
either throw them somewhere on the open field or into 
running water. 

Now as regards the right of the body of the living, 
the Hindus would not think of burning it save in the 
case of a widow who chooses to follow her husband, or 
in the case of those who are tired of their life, who are 
distressed over some incurable disease of their body, 
some irremovable bodily defect, or old age and infirmity. 
This, however, no man of distinction does, but only 
Vaiéyas and Sfdras, especially at those times which 
are prized as the most suitable for a man to acquire in 
them, for a future repetition of life, a better form and 
condition than that in which he happens to have been 
born and to live. Burning oneself is forbidden to 
Brahmans and Kshatriyas by a special law. Therefore 
these, if they want to kill themselves, do so at the time 
of an eclipse in some other manner, or they hire some- 
body to drown them in the Ganzes, kesping them under 
water till they are dead. 

At the junction of the two rivers, Yamuna and 
Ganges, there is a great tree called Praydga, a tree of 
the species called aja. It is pecaliar to this kind of 
tree that its branches send forth two species of twigs, 
some directed npward, as is the case with all other trees, 
and others directed downward like roots, but without 
leaves. If such a twig enters into the soil, it is like a 
supporting column to the branch whence it has grown. 
Nature has arranged this on purpose, since the branches 
of this tree are of an enormous extent (and require to be 
supported). Here the Brahmans and Kshairiyas are in 


CHAPTER LXXIIL. 171 


the habit of committing suicide by climbing up the tree 
and throwing themselves into the Ganges. 

Johannes Grammaticus relates that certain people Greek 
in ancient Greek heathendom, “whom I call the wor- 
shippers of the devil”—so he says—used to beat their 
limbs with swords, and to throw themselves into the 
fire, without feeling any pain therefrom. 

As wa hava related this as a view of the Hindus not 
to commit suicida, so also Socrates speaks: “ Likewise 
it does not become a man to kill himself before the 
gods give him a cause in ths shape of some compulsion 
or dire necessity, like that in which we now are.” 

Farther he says: “ We human beings are, as it were, 
in a prison. It does not behove us to flee nor to free 
ourselves from it, because the gods take notice of us, 
since we, the human beings, are servants to them.”

CHAPTER LXXIV. 
ON FASTING, AND THE VARIOUS KINDS OF IT. 


Fasting is with the Hindus voluntary and superero- 
gatory. Fasting is abstaining from food for a certain 
length of time, which may be different in duration and 
in the manner in which it is carried out. 

The ordinary middle process, by which all the condi- 
tions of fasting are realised, is this: A man determines 
the day on which he will fast, and keeps in mind the 
name of that being whose t=nevolence he wishes to 
gain thereby and for whose sake he will fast, be it a 
god, or an angel, or some other being. Then he pro- 
ceeds, prepares (and takes) nis food on the day before 
the fast-day at noon, cleans his teeth by rabbing, and 
fixes his thoughts on the fasting of the following day. 
From that moment he abstains from food. On the 
morning of the fast-day he again rubs his teeth, washes 
himself, ard performs the duties of the day. He takes 
water in his hand, and sprinkles it into all four direc- 
tions, he prononnces with his tongue the name of the 
deity for whom he fasts, and remains in this condition 
till the day after the fast-day. After the sun has risen, 
he is at liberty to break the fast at that moment if he 
likes, or, if he prefers, he may postpone it till noon. 

This kind is called wpacdsa, ic. the fasting; for the 
not-eating from one noon to the following is called eka- 
nokta, not fasting. 

Another kind, called kricchra, is this: A man takes 
his food on some day at noon, and on the following day 


CHAPTER LXXIVY. 173 


in the evening. On the third day he eats nothing 
except what by chance is given him withont bis asking 
for it. On the fourth day he fasts. 

Another kind, called pardka, is this: A man takes 
his food at noon on three consecutive days. . Then he 
transfers his eating-hour to the evening during three 
further consecutive days. Then he fasts uninterrupt- 
edly during three consecutive days without breaking 
fast. 

Another kind, called candrdyana, is this: A mano 
fasts on the day of full moon; on the following day he 
takes only a mouthful, on the third day he takes double 
this amount, on the fourth day the threefold of it, &c.,, 
_ &e., going on thus till the day of new moon. On that 

day he fasts; on the following days he again diminishes 
his food by one mouthful a day, till he again fasts on 
the day of full moon. 

Another kind, called mdsavdsa (mdsopavdsa), is this: 
A man nninterruptedly fasts all the daye of a month 
without ever breaking fast. 

The Hindus explain accurately what reward the latter Reward ot 

the fastin, 
fasting in every single month will bring to a man for a in the single 
new life of his after he has died. They say:

If he fasta Margadirsha, he will be born in the most 
beautiful and fertile country. + 

If he fasts Pausha, he obtains a high reputation. 

If he fasts Magha, he obtains innumerable wealth. 

Tf he fasts Phalguna, he will be beloved. 

He, however, who fasts during all the months of the 
year, only twelve times breaking the fast, will reside in 
paradise 10,000 years, and will thence return to life as 
the member of a noble, high, and respected family. 

The book Vishnu-Dharma relates that Maitreyi, the 
wife of Yajnavalkya, asked her husband whet man is 
to do in order to save his children from calamities and 
bodily defects, upon which he answered: “If a man 
begins on the day Duvé, in the month Pausha, ic. the 
second day of each of the two halves of the month, and 
fasts four consecntive days, washing himself on the 
first with water, on the second with sesame oil, on the 
third with galangale, and on the fourth with s mixture 
of various balms; if he further on each day gives alms 
and recites praises over the names of the angels; if he 
continue to do all this during each month till the end 
of the year, his children will in the following life be 
free from calamities and defects, and he will obtain 
what he wishes ; for also Diltpa, Dushyanta, and Yaydti 
obtained their wishes for having acted thus.”

CHAPTER LXXV. 
ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAST-DAYS, 


Tax reader must know in general that the eighth and mo oighth 
eleventh days of the white half of every month are fast- maser 
days, except in the case of the leap month, for it is dis- tmonth are 
regarded, being considered unlucky. ceeds 

"The eleventh is specially holy to Vasudeva, because 
on having takeu posaession of MAbiira, the inhabitants of 
which formerly used to worship Indra one dey in each 
month, he induced them to tranefer this worship to the 
eleventh, that it ahould be performed in his name, As 
the people did so, Indra became angry end poured rains 
over them like deluges, in order to destroy both them 
and their cattle. Vasudeva, however, raised a monntain 
by his hand and protected them thereby. The water 
collected round them, but not above them, end the image 
of Indra fled, The people commemorated this event 
by a monument on a mountain in the neighbourhood 
of Mfhdra, Therefore they fast on this day in the etate 
of the most punctilions cleanness, and they stay awake 
all the night, considering this as an obligatory perfor- 
mance, though in reality it is not obligatory, 

The book Vishnu-Dharma says: “When the moon is on single 
in Rohini, the fourth of her stations, on the eighth day of throug out 
the black half, it iaa fast-day called Jayunth, Giving “7 
alma on this day is an expietion for all sins.” 

Evidently this condition of the fast-day does not in 
general apply to all months, but in particular only to 
Bhadrapada, since Vasudeva was born in this month 


Page 287. 


176 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


and on this day, whilst the moon stood in the station 
Rohini. The two conditions, viz the moon’s standing 
in Rohint and that the day is the eighth of the black 
half, can happen only once in so and so many years, for 
various reasons, ¢g. the intercalation of the year, and 
because the civil years do not keep pace with lunar time, 
either getting in advance of it or falling behind, 

The same book says: “When the moon stands in 
Punarvasu, the seventh of her stations, on the eleventh 
day of the white half of the month, this is a fast-day, 
called Atj (? Affdtaja). If a man does works of piety 
on this day, he will be enabled to obtain whatever he 
wishes, as has been the case with Sagara, Kakutstha, 
and Dandahamdr (2), who obtained royalty because they 
had done so. 

The sixth day of Caitra is  fast-day holy to the aun. 

In the month Ashfidha, when the moon stands in 
Anuridha, the seventeenth of her signs, there is a fast- 
day holy to Vasudeva called Devasint (2), t.c. Deva is 
sleeping, because it is the beginning of the four months 
during which Vasudeva slept. Others add this condi- 
tion, that the day must be the eleventh of the month. 

It is evident that auch a day does not occur in every 
year. The followers of Vasndeva abstain on this day 
from meat, fish, sweetmeats, and cohabitation with the 
women, and take food only once a day, They make 
the earth their bed without any covering, and do not 
use a bedstead raised above the earth. 

People say that these four months are the night of 
the angels, to which must be added a month at the 
beginning as evening twilight, snd s month at the end 
as morning dawn. However, the sun atands then near 
o° of Cancer, which is noon in the day of the angels, and 
I do not see in what way this moon is connected with 
the two Sarndhis. 

The day of full moon in the month Sravana is o fast- 
day holy to Somanatha. 


CHAPTER LXXV. 177 


When in the month Agvayuja the moon stands in 
Alsharatfn (the lunar station) and the sun is in Virgo, 
it is a fast-day. 

The eighth of the same month is a fast-day holy to 
Bhagavati. Fasting is broken when the moon rises. 

The fifth day of Bhadrapada is a fast-day holy to 
the sun, called ska?, They anoint the solar rays, and 
in particular those rays which enter through the win- 
dows, with various kinds of balsamic ointments, and 
place upon them odoriferous plants and flowers. 

When in this month the moon stands in Rohini, it 
is a fast-day for the birth of Vasudeva. Others add, 
besides, the condition that the day mnst be the eighth of 
the black half. We have already pointed out that such 
a day does not occur in every year, but only ‘in certain 
ones of a larger number of years, 

When in the month Karttika the moon stands in 
Revatt, the last of ber stations, it is a fast-day in com- 
memoration of the waking up of Vasudeva. It is called 
deotthint, ic. the rising of the Deva. Others add, 
besides, the condition that it must be the eleventh of 
the white half, On that day they soil themselves with 
the dung of cows, and break fasting by feeding upon a 
mixture of cow’s milk, urine, and dung. This day is the 
first of the five days which are called Bhishma pafica- 
rairi, They fast during them in honour of Vasudeva. 
On the second of them the Brahmans break fasting, 
after them the others. 

On the sixth day of Pausha is a fasting in honour of 
the sun. 

On the third day of Macha there is a fasting for 
the women, not for the men. It is called Gaur-t-r 
(gaurt-trittyd 7), and lasts the whole day and night. 
On the following morning they make presents to the 
nearest relatives of their husbands,

ON THE FESTIVALS AND FESTIVE DAYS. 


YATRA means travelling under auspicious circumstances. 
Therefore 2 feast is called yitré. Most of the Hindu 
festivals are celebrated by women and children only.

people of Kashmir, called Agdds (?), and celebrated on 
account of a victory gained by their king, Muttai, over 
the Turks. According to their account he ruled over 
the whole world. But this is exactly what they say 
of most of their kings. However, they are incautious 
enoogh to assign him to a time not much anterior to 
our time, which leads to their lie being found out. It 
is, of course, not impossible that a Hindu should rule 
(over 2 huge empire), as Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, 
and Persians have done, but all the times not much 
anterior to our own are well known. (If, therefore, 
auch had been the case, we should know it.) Perhaps 
the here mentioned king ruled over the whole of India, 
and they know of no other country but India and of no 
other nations bnt themselves, 

On the 11th there is ¢ festival called Hindoli- 
caitra, when they meet in the devagriha, or temple of 
Vasudeva, and sewing his image to and fro, as had been 
done with him when he was an infant in the cradle. 
They perform the same in their houses during the 
whole day and make merry. 

On the full moon’s day of Caitra there ia a feast 
called Bahand (vasania f). a festival for the women,

when they put on their ornaments and demend presents 
from their husbands. 

The z2nd is a festival called cattra-cashati, a day of 224 Caitra. 
merriment holy to Bhsgavati, when people use to wash 
and to give alms. 

The 3rd Vaisikha is a festival for the women called 
Gaur-t-r (gaurt-trittyd ?), holy to Gaurt, the daughter of Page 208. 
the mountzin Himavant, the wife of Mahadeva, They — 
wash and dress gaily, they worship the image of Gauri 
and light lamps before it, they offer perfomes, abstain 
from eating, and play with swings. On the following 
day they give alms and eat. 

On the roth Vaiédkha all the Brahmans whom the 
kings have invited proceed forth to the open fields, and 
there they light great fires for the sacrifices during five 
days till full moon. They make the fires in sixteen 
different apots and in four different groups. In each 
group a Brahman performs the sacrifice, so that there 
are four performing priests as there are four Vedas. 

On the 16th they return home, 

In this month occurs the vernal equinox, called Vernal equi- 
vasanta. They determine the day by calculation and” 
make it a festival, when people invite the Brahmans. 

On the rat Jyaishtha, or new moon’s day, they cele- st Jyaist- 
brate a festival and throw the firstfruits of all seeds‘ 
into the water in order to gain thereby a favourable 
prognostic, 

The full moon’s day of this month is a festival to ulna 
the women, called riipa-panca (1). 

All the days of the month Ashadha are devoted to Asagia 
alms-giving. It is also called dhdri. During this 
time the household is provided with new vessels.

Bhagavatt. They give mach alms before it and kill 
kids, He who does not possess anything to offer, 
stands upright by the side of the idol, without ever 
sitting down, and will sometimes pounce upon whom- 
soever he meets and kill him. 

On the 15th, when the moon stands in the last of 
her atations, Revatt, there is the festival Puhdt (7), 
when they wrangle with each other and play with the 
animals. It is holy to Vasudeva, because his uncle 
Kazhsa had ordered him into his presence for the pur- 
pose of wrangling. 

On the 16th there is a festival, when they give alms 
to the Brahmans. 

On the 23rd is the festival Afoka, also called dhof, 
when the moon atands in the seventh station, Punar- 
vasu, It is a day of merriment and of wrangling. 


Budnpedt. In the month Bh4drapada, when the moon atands in 


the tenth station, Machf, they celebrate a festival 
which they call pitripaksha, ic. the half of the month 
of the Fathers, because the moon’a entering this atation 
falls near the time of new moon. They distribute alms 
during fifteen days in the name of the Fathers. 


nee On the 3rd Bhadrapada is the festival Harbdlt (1, for 


the women. It is their custom that a number of daya 
before they sow all kinds of seeds in baskets, and they 
hring the baskets forward on this day after they have 
commenced growing, They throw roses and perfumes 
on them and play with each other daring the whole 
night. On the following morning they bring them 
to the ponds, wash them, wash themselves, and give 
alms,

women celebrate this festival when they are pregnant 
and desire to have children.

of it he dyes with crocus, the other ine leaves as it is, 

He gives the thread the same length as the atatue of 
Vasudeva is high. Then he throws it over his neck, 
so that it hangs down to hia feet, It is a much vene- 
rated festival, 

- The 16th, the first day of the black half, is the first ie 
of seven days which are called ardra(?), when they 
adorn the children nicely and give a treat to them. 
They play with various animals, On the seventh day 
the men adorn themselves and celebrate a festival. 
And during the rest of the month they always adorn 
the children towards the end of the day, give alms to 
the Brahmans, and do worka of piety. 

When the moon stands in her fourth atation, Rohini, 
they call this time Gandiahéd (2), celebrating 9 festival 
during three days and making merry by playing with 
each other, from joy over the birth of Vasudeva. 

Jivaéarman relates that the people of Kashmir cele- jth) 
brate a festival on the 26th and 27th of this month, % 
on acccunt of certain pieces of wood called gana (?), 
which the water of the river Vitasté (Jailam) carries, 
in those two days, through the capital, Adhishthdna, 
People maintain that it is Mahadeva who sends them. 

It is peculiar to these pieces of wood, so they say, that 
nobody is able to seize them, however much he may desire 
it, that they always evade his grasp and move away. 

However, the people of Kashmir, with whom I have 
conversed on the subject, give a different statement as 
to the place and the time, and maintain that the thing 
occurs in & pond called Kedaishahr (7), to the left of the 


Pee eal ad

source of the just-mentioned river (Vitasta-Jailam), in 
the middle of the month Vaigékha, The latter version 
is the more likely, as about this time the watere begin 
to increase. The matter reminds one of the wood in 
the river of Jurjan, which appears at the time when the 
water swells in its source. 

The same Jivagarman relates that in the country of 
Svat, opposite the district of Kirt (1, there is a valley 
in which fifty-three streams unite. I is called Tranjdi 
(cf. Sindhi trévanjdha). In those two days the water 
of this valley becomes white, in consequence of Maha- 
deva's washing in it, as people believe. 

The tst KaArttika, or new moon’s day, when the 
sun marches in Libra, is called Dibdli. Then people 
bathe, dress festively, make presents to each other of 
betel-leaves and areca-nuts ; they ride to the tempies 
to give alms and play merrily with each other till noon. 
In the night they light a great number of Jamps in 
every place so that the air is perfectly clear. The 
cause of this festival is that Lakshmi, the wife of Viasu- 
deva, ouce a year on this day liberates Bali, the son of 
Virocana, who is a prisoner in the seventh earth, and 
allows him to go out into the world. Therefore the 
festival is called Balirdjya, i.e. the principality of Bali. 
The Hindus maintain that this time was a time of 
luck in the Kyitaynga, and they are happy because 
the feast-day in question resembles that time in the 
Kritayuga. 

In the same month, when full moon is perfect, they 
give banquets and adorn their women during all the 
days of the black half, 

The 3rd Mirgagirsha, called Guvdna-bdirty (——. tri- 
ityd f), is a feast of the women, sacred to Gaurt. They 
meet in the houses of the rich among them; they put 
several silver statues of the goddess on a throne, and 
perfume it and play with each other the whole day. 
On the following morning they give alms.

In each meeting-place they put 108 jugs full of water, 
and after the water has become cool, they wash with 
it four times at the four quarters of that night. On 
the following day they give alms, they give banquets 
and receive guests, The women’s washing with cold 
water is common to all the days of this month.

A festival in The Hindus of Maltfn have a festival which is called 


Sdmbapuraydtra ; they celebrate it in honour of the 
san, and worship him. It is determined in this way: 
They first take the ahargana, according to the rules of 
Khandakhidyaka, and subtract 98,04otherefrom. They 
divide the remainder by 365, and disregard the quotient, 
If the division does not give a remainder, the quotient 
is the date of the festival in question If there is a 
remainder, it represents the days which have elapsed 
since the festival, and by subtracting these days from 
36§ you find the date of the same festival] in the next 
following year.

CHAPTER LXXVIL 


ON DAYS WHICH ARE HELD IN SPECIAL VENZRATION, 
ON LUCKY AND UNLUCKY TIMES, AND ON SUCH 
TIMES. AS ARE PARTICULARLY FAVOURABLE FOR 
ACQUIRING IN THEM BLISS IN HEAVEN. 


Tae single days enjoy different degrees of veneration 
uccording to certain qualities which they attribute to 
them. They distinguish, eg. the Sunday, because it is 
the day of ‘the sun and the beginning of the week, as 
the Friday is distingnished in Islam. 

To the distinguished days further belong amdvdsyd The days of 
and pirnimd, ic. the days of conjunction (new moon) and fall 
and opposition (full moon), because they are the limits 
of the wane and the increase of the moonlight. Inu 
accordance with the belief of the Hindus regarding Page 291. 
this increase and wane, the Brahmans sacrifice con- 
tinually to the fire in order to earn heavenly reward. 
They let the portions of the angels accumulate, which are 
the offerings thrown into the fire at moonlight during the 
whole time from new. moon to full moon. Then they 
begin distributing these portions: over the angels in 
the time from fnll moon to new moon, till at the time 
of new moon nothing any more remains of them. We 
have already mentioned that new mocn and full moon 
are noon and midnight of the nycuthemeron of the 
Fathers, Therefore the uninterrupted almsgiving 
on these two days is always done in honour of the 
Fathers, 


Criticisms 
thereon. 


186 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


Four other days are held in special veneration, 
because, according to the Hindus, with them the 
single yugas of the present caturyuga have commenced, 
viz. :— 

The 3rd Vaidakha, called kshairiid (?), on which 
the Kritayuga is believed to have commenced. 

The oth Karttika, the beginning of the Tretayuga. 

The 15th Magha, the beginning of the DvApara- 
yuga. 

The 13th of Agvayuja, the beginning of the Kali- 
yuga, 

According to my opinion, these daya are festivals, 
sacred to the yugas, instituted for the purpose of alms- 
giving or for the performance of some rites and cere~ 
monies, as, ¢g., the commemoration-days in the year of 
the Christians. However, we must deny that the four 
yugas could really have commenced on the days here 
mentioned. 

With regard to the Kritaynga, the matter is perfectly 
clear, because its beginning is the beginning of the 
solar and lunar cycles, there being no fraction in the 
date, since it is, at the same time, the beginning of the 
caturyuga. Itis the first of the month Caitra, at the 
same time the date of the vernal equinox, and on the 
same day also the other yugas commence. For, accord- 
ing to Brahmagupta, a caturyuga contains :— 


Civil days . . . . * «+ 1,$77:916,450 
Solarmonths . . . « + 51,840,000 
Leap months . 8 ee 1,593,300 
Lunardays. - . « «+ © 1,602,999,000 
Gnardtradays . . . « « ~~ 25,082,550 


These are the elements on which the resolution of 
chronological dates into days, or the composition of 
them out of days,is based. All these nnmbers may be 
divided by 10, and the divisors are wholes without 
any fraction. Now the beginnings of the single yugas 
depend upon the beginning of the caturyuga, 


‘CHAPTER LXXVilI. 187 


According to Pulisa the cazuryuga contains :— 
Civildays 2... 6) ee) 4 577,937,800 


Solar months . 7 . z é 51,840,000 
Leap months : . . . F 1,593:336 
Lunar days... ee . - 1,603,000,010 


Onartiradays . . « + « 25,082,280 


All these numbers may be divided by 4, and the divi- 
sors are wholly without any fraction. According to 
this computation, also, the beginnings of the single 
yugas are the aame as the beginning of the caturyuga, 
t.¢. the first of the month Caitra and the day of the 
vernal equinox. However, this day falls on different 
week daya. 

Hence it is evident that their theory about the 
above-mentioned four days being the beginnings of the 
four yvgas, is without any foundation at all; that they 
could never arrive at such a result unless by resorting 
to very artificial ways of interpretation. 

The times which are specially favourable to earn a tie days 
heavenly reward in them are called punyakdla. Bala- Gudia“™ 
bhadra saya in his commentary to the Khandakhfid- 
yaka :—“TIf the yogin, ic. the ascetic who understands 
the creator, who chooses the good and eschews the bad, 
continued his manner of life during one thousand years, 
his reward would not be eqnal to that of a man who 
givea alms on punyakdla and fulfils the duties of the 
day, ue. washing and anointing himself, saying prayers 
and praises,” 

No doubt, most of the feast-days enumerated in the 
preceding belong to this kind of daya, for they are page aoe, 
devoted to almsgiving and banqueting. If people did 
not expect to gain thereby a reward in heaven, they 
would not approve of the rejoicings and merrimenta 
which are characteristic of these days. 

Notwithstanding the nature of the punyakdla is 
such as here explained, some of them are considered as 
lucky, cthers as unlucky days. 


188 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


Those days are Incky when the planets migrate from 

one sign into the other, especially the sun. These times 

” gechkrintt. are called sarnkrdait. The most propitious of them are 
the days of the equinoxes and solstices, and of these the 
most propitious is the dey of the vernal equinox. It is 
called bikhat or shibt (vishuva), as the two sounds sh and 
kh may be exchanged for each other, and may also, by 
a metathesis, change their place. 

As, however, a planet's entering a new sign does not 
require more than a moment of time, and, during it, 
people must offer to the fire the offering sénéa (?) with 
oil and corn, the Hindus have given a greater extent to 
these times, making them begin with the moment when 
the eastern edge of the body of the sun tonches the 
first part of the eign; reckoning as their middle tho 
moment when the eun’s centre reaches the first part of 
the sign, which is in astronomy considered as the time 
of the migration (of the planet from one sign to the 
other), and reckoning as the end that moment when the 
western edge of the sun’s body touches the first part 
of the sign, This process lasts, in the case of the sun, 
nearly two hours. 

For the purpose of finding the times in the week 
when the sun migrates from one sign to another, they 
have several methode, one of which was dictated to me 
by Samaya (?). It is this:—- 

Methodfor Subtract from the Sakakila 847, multiply the re- 

themense, mainder by 180, and divide the product by 143. The 

fi quotient you get represents days, minutes, and seconda. 
This number is the basis, 

If you want to know at what time in the year in 
question the sun enters any one of the twelve signa, 
yon look out the sign in the following table. Take the 
number which you find side by side with the sign in 
question, and add it to the basis, days to days, minntes 
to minutes, seconds to seconds. If the wholes amount 
to 7 or more, disregard them, and with the remainder 


CHAPTER LXXVII. 189 


count off the week-days, beginning with the beginning

The beginning of consecutive solar years in the week on te 


differs by 1 day and the fraction at the end of the thowala 


year. This amount, reduced to fractions of one kind, {ng toBrah- 
is the multiplicator (180), used in the preceding com- Pula and 
putation in order to find the surplus of each year (ie, 47> 
the amount by which its beginning wanders onward 
through the week). 

The divisor (143) is the denominator of the fraction 
(which is accordingly {3$). 

Accordingly the fraction at the end of the solar year 
is, in this computation, reckoned as +4'5, which implies 
as the length of the solar year, 365 days 15’ 31” 28” 6". 
To raise this fraction of a day to one whole day, 42§ of 
a day are required. I do not know whose theory this is. 

If we divide the days of a caturyuga by the number 
of its solar years, according to the theory of Brahma- 
gupta, we get as the length of the solar year, 365 days 
30° 22” 30” o'. In this case the multiplicator or 
gunakdra is 4027, and the divisor or bhdgahdra is 3200 Page 293. 
(ie. 1 day 30° 22” 30” o' are equal to $923).

Reckoning according to the theory of Pulisa, we find 
as the length of the solar year 365 daya 15’ 31” 30” o*. 
Accordingly, the gunakdra would be 1007, the bhdga- 
héra S00 (ie. 1 day 15’ 31” 30” of are equal to 1927). 

According to Aryabhata, the length of the solar year 
is 365 days 16’ 31715". In that case the gurakdra is 
725 and the bhdgakdra is 572 (i.e. t day 15’ 31” 15” are 
equal to 133). 

Another method for finding the moment of sarnkrdnti 
has been dictated to me by Auliatta (7), the son of Sa- 
Adit (2), and is based on the system of Pulisa. It is this: 

Subtract from the Sakakfla 918, multiply the re- 
mainder by 1007, add to the product 79, and divide the 
sum by 800, Divide the quotient by 7. The remainder 
you get is the basis. Whst now must for each sign be 
added to the basis, as has already been mentioned (ii. 
188), is indicated by the following table opposite to each 


sign :—

Varahamihira maintains in the Pasicasiddhdntikd 
that the shadaMtimukha is in the same degree pro- 
pitious as the time of savnkrdnti for acquiring in it 
infinite heavenly reward. This is the moment of the 
sun’s entering :—The 18th degree of Gemini; the 14th 
degree of Virgo ; the 26th degree of Arcitenens ; and the 
28th degree of Pisces. 

The moment of the sun’s entering the fixed signs 


CHAPTER LXXVII. 191 


is four times as propitious as the moment of his 
entering the other signs. For each of these times 
they compute the beginning and the end by meana 
of the radius of the sun in the same way as they 
compute the minutes of the ann’s or moon’s entering 
and leaving the shadow at an eclipse. This method is 
well known in their canones. We, however, communi- 
cate here only those of their methods of calculation 
which we think remarkable, or which, as far as we 
know, have not yet been explained before Muslim ears, 
as Muslims know of the methods of the Hindus only 
those which are found in the Sind-hind. 

Most propitious times are, further, the times of solar Timon of 
and lunar eclipses. At that time, according to their “"™” 
belief, all the waters of the earth become as pure as that 
of the Ganges. They exaggerate the veneration of 
these times to such a degree that many of them commit 
suicide, wishing to die at such a time as promises them 
heavenly bliss. However, this is only done by Vaidyas 
and Stdras, whilst it is forbidden to Brahmans and 
Kshatriyas, who in consequence do not commit suicide 
(vide, however, ii. 170). 

Further, the times of Parvan are propitious, t.¢ those Parcan and 
tines in which an eclipse may take place. And even 
if there is no eclipse at such a time, it is considered 
quite as propitious as the time of an eclipse itself. 

The times of the yogas are as propitious as those of 
the eclipses. We have devoted a special chapter to 
them (chap. Ixxix.), 

If it happens within the course of one civil day that Unlucky 
the moon revolves in the latter purt of some station, 
then enters the following station, proceeds throngh the 
whole of it and enters a third atation, so that in one 
single day she stands in three consecutive stations, such 
a day is called trikaspaka(?), and also trikarkasha (2), Powe 204. 
It is an unlucky day, boding evil, and it is counted 
among the punyakdla, (See ii. 187.) 


192 ALBERUNY?S INDIA. 


The same applies to that civil day which compre- 
hends a complete lunar day, whose beginning, besides, © 
falls in the latter part of the preceding lunar day, 
and whose end falls in the beginning of the following 
lunar day. Such a day is called trahagattata (7). It 
is unlacky, but favourable to earn in it @ heavenly 
reward, 

When the days of dnarttra, i.e. the days of the de- 
crease (see ii, 25), sum up so as to form one complete 
day, it is unlucky and reckoned among the punya- 
kdla, This takes place according to Brahmagupta 
in 6299:5$3 civil days, 62,7,fi5 solar days, 6353-733 
lunar days. 

According’ to Pulisa, it takes place in 62$3-37§ civil 
days, 63$5:37$ lunar days, 6zzfiify solar days. 

The moment when a complete leap-month without 
any fraction is summed up, is unlucky, and is not 
reckoned among the punyakdla, According to Brahma- 
gupta, this takes place in 990;5;$$3 civil days, 976, 
solar days, 1006;5°, lunar days. 

Times which are considered as unlucky, to which no 
merit whatsoever is attributed, are, ¢g., the times of 
earthquakes. Then the Hindus beat with the pots of 
their households against the earth and break them, in 
order to get a good omen and to banish the mishap. 
As times of s similar ill nature, the book Samhita 
further enumerates the moments of landslips, the fall- 
ing of stars, red glow in the sky, the combustion of 
the earth by lightning, the appearance of comets, the 
occurrence of events contrary both to nature and 
custom, the entering of the wild beasts into the villages, 
rainfall when it is not the season for it, the trees 
putting forth leaves when it is not the season for it, 
when the nature of one season of the year seems trans- 
ferred to another, and more of the like. 

The book Srddhave, attributed to MahAdeva, says 
the following:

civil days. 

As the Hindus call these fithis nychthemera, they 
also call the former half of a éiths day, the latter half 
night. Each of these halves has a separate name, and 
they ail of them (d«. all the halves of the lunar days of 
the lunar month) are called karanas. 

Some of the names of the karanas occur only once 
in a month and are not repeated, viz. four of them 
about the time of new moon, which are called the fixed 
ones, because they occur only once in the month, and 
because they always fall on the same day and night of 
the month. 

Othezs of them revolve and occur eight times in a 
month. They are called the movable ones, because of 
their revolving, and because each one of them may as 
well fall on a day as on a night. They are seven in 
number, and the seventh or last of them is an unlucky 
day, by which they frighten their children, the simple 
mention of which makes the hairs on the head of their 
boys stand on end. We have given an exhaustive 
description of the karagas in another book of ours, 
They are mentioned in every Indian book on astronomy 
and mathematics. 


CHAPTER LXXVII. 195 


If you want to know the daranazs, first determine the Rote how te 
lunar days, and find out in what part of them tha date toreya: 
in question falls, which is done in this way ~~ 

Subtract the corrected place of the sun from the. 
corrected place of the moon. The remainder is the 
distance between them, If it is Jess than six zodiacal 
signs, the date falls in the white half of the month; 
if it is more, it falls in the black half. 

Reduce this number to minntes, and divide the pro- 
duct by 720. The quotient represents fithis, ie. com- 
plete lunar days. If you get by the division a re- 
mainder, multiply it by 60 and divide the product hy 
the mean dhukti. The quotient represents ghafts and 
minor fractions, te. thet portion of the current day 
which has already elapsed. 

This is the method of the canones of the Hindus. 
The distance between the corrected places of sun and 
moon must be divided by the mean bhukti, This, how- 
ever, is impossible for many of the days. Thvzefore 
they divide this distance by the difference between 
the daily revolutions of sun and moon, which they 
reckon for the moon as 13 degrees, for the sun as 1 


li is a favourite method ia rules of this kind, especi- 
ally in Indian ones, to reckon by the mean motion of 
san and moon. The mean motion of the sun is sub- 
tracted from the mean motion of the moon, and the 
remainder is divided by 732, which is the difference 
between their two middle bhuitis, The quotient then 
represents days and ghafis. 

The word wht is of Indian origin. In the Indian Explana- 
language it is bhukti (=the daily motion of a planet). Matte 
If the corrected motion is meant, it is called dkukti 
sphuta. If the mean motion is meant, it is called 
bhukti madhyama, and if the bukt which renders equal 
is meant, it is called bhuktyantara, i. the difference 
between the two bhuktis.

The lanar days of the month have special names, 
which we exhibit in the following diagram. If you 
know the lunar day in which you are, you find, by the 
side of the number of the day, its name, and opposite 
it the karana in which you are If that which has 
elapsed of the current day is less than half a day, the 
karaga is a diurnal one; if that which has elapsed of 
it is more than half a day, it is a nocturnal one. This

The Hindus attribute to some of the karanas domi- 
nants, as is their custom. Further they give rales 
showing what during each karaza must be done or not, 
rales which are similer to collections of astrological 
prognostics (as to lucky or unlucky days, &c.). If we 
give here a second diagram of the karanas, we thereby 
simply mean to confirm what we have said already, and 
to repeat a subject which is unknown among us. Thus 
it is rendered easy to learn the subject, because learning 
is the fruit of repetition.

complete karazas. 

What remains after the division is multiplied by 60,

Every unit of the number is equal to half a ghafé, 

We now return to the complete karanas. If they 
are two or less, you are in the second karana. In that 
case you add one to the number and count the sum off, 
beginning with catuskpada, 

If the number of Karanas is $9, you are in éakuni. 

If it is less than 59 and more than two, add one to 
them and divide the sum by seven, The remainder, if 
it is not more than seven, count off, beginning with the 
beginning of the cycle of the movable karanas, t.c. with 
bava. Thereby you will arrive at the name of the 
current karana in which you happen to be. 


Thetercxcs Wishing to remind the reader of something relating

by Alkindt to the karanas which he perhaps has forgotten, we

authors. 


must tell him that Alkindi and others like him have 
hit upon the system of the Aaranas, but one which was 
not sufficiently explained. They did not comprehend 
the metbod of those who use the daranas. At one time 
they trace them back to Indian, another time to 
Babylonian origin, declaring all the time that they are 
altered on purpose and corrupted by the inadvertence 
of the copyists. They have invented a calculation for 
them which proceeds in a better order than even the 
original method itself. But thereby the thing has 
become something totally different from what is origin- 
ally was. Their method is this: they count half days, 
beginning with new moon. The first twelve hours they 
regard as-belonging to the sun, as burning, «4c. unlucky, 
the next twelve hours as belonging to Venus, the 


CHAPTER LXXVII. 20r 


following twelve hours as belonging to Mercury, and 
80 on according to the order of the planets. Whenever 
the order returns to the sun, they call his twelve 
houra the hours of Albist, i.e. vishfi. 

However, the Hindus do not measure the karanas 
by civil, but by lunar days, nor do they begin with those 
burning hours following upon new moon, Accord- 
ing to the calculation of Alkind!, people begin, after 
new moon, with Jupiter; in that case the periods of 
the sun are not burning. On the other hand, if they 
begin, according to the method of the Hindus, after 
new moon with the sun, the hours of vish{t belong 

.to Mercury. Therefore, each method, that of the 
Hindus and that of Alkindi, must be treated sepa- | 
rately. 

Because vishjt recurs eicht times in a month, and 
because the points of the compass are eight, we shall 
exhibit in the eight fields of the following table their 
dotpodoyotpeva regarding the karanas, observations 
the like of which are made by all astrologers regarding 
the shapes of the planets and regarding those stars 
which rise in the single third parts of the zodiacal

CHAPTER LXXIX. 
ON THE YOGAS. 


Pages. THESE ate times which the Hindus think to be most 
nolucky and during which they abstain from all action. 
They are numerous. We shall here mention them. 

Explastion There are two yogas regarding which ell Hindus 

sodvaa-” agree, viz. :-— 

ss (1.) The moment when sun and moon together stand 
on two circles, which ere, as it were, seizing each other, 
ie. each pair of circles, the declinations of which, on 
one and the same side (of either solstice), are equal. 
This yoga is called vyattpdta. 

(2.) The moment when sun and moon stand together 

on two equal circles, te. each pair of circles, the de- 
clinations of which, on different sides (of either solstice), 
are equal, This is called vatdhrita, 
’ It is the signum of the former that in it the sum of 
the corrected places of sun and moon represents in any 
case the distance of six zodiacal signs from O ° of Aries, 
while it is the signum for the latter that the same sum 
represents the distance of twelve signs. Ifyou compute 
the corrected places of sun and moon for a certain time 
and add them together, the sum is either of these signa, 
te. either of these two yogas. 

If, however, the sum is less than the amount of the 
signum or larger, in thet case the time of equality (.c. 
the time when the sum is equal to either of the signa) 
is computed hy means of the difference between this 
sum and the term in question, and by means of the 


CHAPTER LXXIX. 205 


eum of the two bkudti of sun and moon instead of the 
bhuktyantara, in the same manner as in the canones 
the time of full moon and opposition is computed. 

If you know the distance of the moment from noon On misdie - 
or midnight, whether you correct the places of sun and ~ 
moon according to the one or the other, its time is 
called the middle one. For if the moon followed the 
ecliptic as accurately as the sun, this time would be 
that which we want to find. However, the moon 
deviates from the ecliptic. Therefore, she does not at 
that time etand on the circle of the sun or on the circle 
which, as far as observation goes, is equal to it For 
this reason the places of sun and moon and the dragon’e 
head and tail are computed for the middle time. 

According to this time they compute the declinations Method d for 
of sun and moon. If they are equal, this is the time vyatlpaa" 
which is sought for. If not, you consider the declina- rita. 
tion of the moon. 

If, in computing it, yon have added her latitude to 
the declination of the degree which she occupies, you 
subtract the latitude of the moon from the declination 
of the sun. However, if, in computing it, you have 
subtracted her latitude from the degree which tho moon 
occupies, you add her latitude to the declination of the 
sun. The result is reduced to ares by the tables of the 
kardajdt of declination, and these eres are kept in 
memory, They are the same which are used in the 
canon Karanatilaka. 

Farther, you observe the moon at the middle time. 

If she stands in some of the odd quarters of the ecliptic, 
ie. the vernal and autumnal ones, whilst her declina- 
tion is less than the declination of the sun, in that case 
the time of the two declinations equalling each other— 
and that is what we want to find—falls after the middle, 
te. the future one; but if the declination of the moon 
is larger than that of the sun, it falls before the middle, 
ae, the past one. 


it 


206 ALBERUONTS INDIA. 


If the moon stands in the even quarters of the 
ecliptic (4c. the summer and winter quarters), juat the 
reverse takes place. 

Pulisa adds together the declinations of sun and 
moon in vyattpdia, if they stand on different sides of 
the solstice, and in vasdhrita, if they stand on the same 
side of the solstice, Further, he takes the differeuce 
between the declinations of sun and moon in vyattpdta, 
if they stand on the same side, and in vaidhrita, if they 
stand on different sides. This is the first value which 
is kept in memory, tc. the middle time. 

Farther, he reduces the minutes of the days to mdshas, 
supposing that they are less than one-fourth of a day. 
Theu he computes their motions by means of the bhukti 
of sun and moon and the dragon’s head and tail, and 
ke computes their places according to the amoant of 
middle time, which they occupy, in the past and the 
future. This is the second value which is kept in 
memory. 

By this method he manages to find out the condition 
of the past and the future, and compares it with the 
middle time. If the time of the two declinations 
equalling each other for both sun and moon is past or 
future, in that case the difference between the two 
values kept in memory is the portio divisionts (divisor) ; 
but if it is past for the one and future for the other, 
the sum of the two values kept in memory is the gortio 
divisions. 

Farther, he multiplies the minutes of the days, which 
have been found, by the first value kept in memory, 
and divides the product by the portio divisionts. The 
quotient represents the minutes of the distance from the 
sniddle time which minutes may either be past or future. 
Thus the time of the two declinations equalling each 
other becomes known. 

The author of the canon Karanatilaka makes us 
return to the arc of the declination which has been 


CHAPTER LXXixX. 207 


kept in memory. If the corrected place of the moon sncther 
is less than three zodiacal signs, it is that which we ieee 
want; if it is between three and six signs, he subtracts ise c** 
it from six signs, and if it is between six and nine 

signs, he adds six signs thereto; if it is more than nine 

signs, he subtracts it from twelve aigna. Thereby he 

gets the second place of the moon, and thie he compares 

with the moon’s place at the time of the correction. 

If the second place of the moon is less than the first, 

the time of the two declinations equalling each other is 

future; if it is more than the first, the time of their 
equalling each other is past. 

Further, he multiplies the difference between the two 
places of the moon by the bhudti of the sun, and divides 
the product by the bhukti of the moon. The quotient 
he adds to the place of the sun at the time of the cor- 
rection, if the second place of the moon is larger than 
the first ; but he subtracts it from the sun's place, if the 
second place of the moon is less than the first. Thereby 
he finds the place of the sun for the time when the two 
declinations are equal to each other. 

For the purpose of finding it, he divides the difference 
between the two places of the moon by the bhutkés of 
the moon. The quotient gives minutes of days, indi- 
cative of the distance. By means of them he com- 
putes the places of sun and moon, of the dragon’s head 
and tail, and of the two declinations, If the latter are 
equal, it is that which we want to find, If they are 
not equal, the author repeats the caloulation so long 
till they are equal and till the correct time has been 
found, 

Thereupon he computes the measure of sun and moon. 
However, he disregards half of the eum of them, so that 
in the further calculation he uses only the one half of 
their measures. He multiplies it by 60 and divides the 
product by the bhuktyanfara, The quotient representa 
the minutes of the falling (pdta ?) 


208 ALBERUNTPS INDIA. 


’ The correct time, which has been found, is marked 
in three different places. From the first number he 
subtracts the minutes of the falling, and to the last 
number he adds them. Then the first number is the 
time of the beginning of vyat{pdia or vaidhrita, which- 
ever of the two you want to compute. The second 
number is the time of its middle, and the third number 
the time of its end. 

Theanthow's We have given a detailed account of the bases on 
mijee* which these methods rest in a apecial book of ours, 
called Khaytl-alkustfaint (1.c. the image of the two 
eclipses), and have given an accurate description of 
them in the canon which we have composed for Sydva- 
bala (1), the Kashmtrian, and to which we have given 
the title The Arabic Khandakhadyaka. 
about the Bhattila (?) thinks the whole day of either of these 
eexy.* two yogas to be unlucky, whilst Varfhamihira thinks 
only that duration of them to be unlacky which is found 
by the computation. He compares the unlucky portion 
of the day to the wound of a gazelle shot with a 
poisoned arrow. The disease does not go beyond tho 
environs of the poisoned shot ; if it is cut out, the injury 
is removed. 
According to what Pulisa mentions of Pardéara, the 
Hindus assume a number of vyatfpdias in the lunar 
stations, bnt all of them are computed by the same 
method which he has given, For the calculation does 
not increase in its kind; only the single specimens of it 
become more numerous. 
Qvotation The Brahman Bhattila (7) says in his canon :— 
ting one “ Here there are 8 times, which have certain gauge- 
inch ene measures. If the sum of the corrected places of sun and 
moon is equal to them, they are unlucky. They are: 
“1. Bak-shidia (7). Its gauge-measure is 4 zodiacal 


signs, 
“2. Ganddnta, Its gauge-measure is 4 signs and 
13} degrees, 


CHAPTER LXXiX. 209 


“3. Ldfa (?), or the goneral vyatipdia, Its gange- 
measure is 6 signs, 

“4, Cdsa (1). Its gauge-measure is 6 signs and 63 
degrees. 

“5. Barh (1), also called barhvyatipita. Its gauge- 
Measure is 7 aigns and 16% degrees. 
_ “6, Kdladanda. Its gauge-measure is 8 signs and 
13} degrees. 

“9, Vydkshdta (7). Its gauge-measure is g signs 
aud 23} degrees. 

“8, Vaidhrita. Its gauge-measure is 2 signs.” 

These yogas are well known, but they cannot all be 
traced back to a rule in the same way as the 3d and 
8th ones, Therefore they have no certain duration 
determined by minates of the falling, but only by 
general estimates. Thus the duration of vydkshdta (1) 
and of bakshilta (1) is one muhtirta, according to the 
statement of Varihamihira, the duration of Ganddnia 
and of Barh (?) two muhtrtas. 

The Hindua propound this subject at great length 
and with much detail, but to no purpose. We have 
given an account of it in the above-mentioned book. 
(See ii, 208.) 

The canon Karanatilaka mentions twenty-seven twenty. 
yogas, which are computed in the following manner: — secoriing to 

Add the corrected place of the sun to that of the #ac""™ 
moon, reduce the whole sum to minutes, and divide the Page 30. 
number by 800. The quotient represents complete 
yogas. Multiply the remainder by 6o, and divide the 
product by the aum of the Uhkuktis of sun and moon. 
The quotient represents the minutes of days and minor 
fractions, viz. that time which has elapsed of the cur- 
rent yoga, 

We have copied the names and qualities of the 
yogas from Sripala, and exhibit them in the following

CHAPTER LXXX. 


ON THE INTRODUCTORY PRINCIPLES OF HINDU ASTRO~ 
LOGY, WITH A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THEIR 
METHODS OF ASTROLOGIOAL CALCULATIONS. 


Over fellow-believers in these (Muslim) countries are indian 
not acquainted with the Hindu methods of astrology, tmeesn 
and have never had an opportunity of studying an junaes- 
Indian book on the subject. In consequence, they ™™* 
imagine that Hindu astrolugy is the same aa theirs and 
relate ell sorta of things as being of Indian origin, of 
which we have not found a eingle trace with the 
Hindus themselves. As in the preceding part of this 
our book we have given something of everything, we 
shall also give as much of their astrological doctrine as 
will enable the reader to discuss questions of a similar 
nature with them. If we were to give an exhaustive 
representation of the subject, this task would detain us Page 302. 
very long, even if we limited ourselves to delineate 
only the leading principles and avoided all details, 

First, the reader must know that in most of their 
proguostics they simply rely on means like auguring 
from the flight of birds and physiognomy, that they do 
not—as they ought to do—draw conclusions, regarding 
the affairs of the sublunary world, from the secouds 
(ste) of the stars, which are the events of the celestial 
sphere. 

Regarding the number seven as that of the planets, on the 
there is no difference between us and them. They call ae 
them graka. Some of them are throughout lucky, viz. 


212 , ALBERUNYS INDIA. 


Jupiter, Venus and the Moon, which are called sas:m- 
Other three are throughout unlucky, viz. 
Saturn, Mars, and the San, which are called krtiragraha. 
Among the latter, they also count the dragon’s head, 
though in reality it is not 6 star. The nature of one 
planet is variable and depends upon the nature of that 
planet with which it is combined, whether it be lucky 
or unincky, This is Mercury. However, alone by 
iteelf, it is lucky.

The column of this table which indicates the order 
of the size and power of the planets, serves for the 
following purpose :—Sometimes two planets indicate 
exactly the same thing, exercise the same influence, and 
stand in the same relation to the event in question. 
In this case, the preference is given to that planet which, 
in the column in question, is described as the larger or 
the more powerful of the two. 


The manthe The column relating to the months of pregnancy is to 


bel oa 


be completed by the remark that they consider the eighth 
month as standing under the influence of a horoscope 
which causes abortion. According to them, the embryo 
takes, in this month, the fine substances of the food. If 
it takes all of them and is then bom, it will remain 
alive; but if it is born before that, it will die from some 
deficiency in its formation. The ninth month stands 
under the influence of the moon, the tenth under that 
of the sun. They do not speak of a longer duration of 
pregnancy, but if it happens to last longer, they believe 
that, during this time, some injury is brought about by 
the wind, At the time of the horoscope of abortion, 
which they determine by tradition, not by calculation, 
they observe the conditions and influences of the planets 
and give their decision accordingly as this or that planet 
happens to preside over the month in question, 

The question as to the friendship and enmity of the 
planets among each other, as well as the influence of 
the dominus domds, is of great importance in their astro- 
logy. Sometimes it may happen that, at a particular 
moment of time, this dominium entirely loses its original 
character. Further ou we shall give a rule as to the 
computation of the dominium and its single years. 


The sodiscei 4‘Lbere is no difference between us and the Hindus 
signa, 


regarding the number twelve as the number of the 
signs of the ecliptic, nor regarding the manner in which 
the domintum of the planets is distributed over them.

to each zodiacal sign as 8 whole :-—

trikona is a powerful influence, attributed to a planet, 
when it is in the gaudtum in one of its two houses 
(cf. ii. 225). 

They do not refer the aspectus trigoni to the elements 
and the elementary natures, as it is our custom to do, 
but refer them to the points of the compass in general, 
as has been specified in the table. 

They call the turning zodiacal sign (rpomsxcov) carardsi,

resting one, and the doubte-bodted one (Stowya) dvieva-

qualities of each of them. The one half of them shove

under the earth they call naw, te. ship. Further, they 
call the half ascending to the midst of heaven and the 
other half descending to the cardo of the earth, dhanx, 
i.e the bow. The cardines they call kendra (xévrpoy), 
the next following houses panaphara (éravagopd), and

The hitherto mentioned details are in reality the 
cardinal-points of Hindu astrology, viz the planets, 
zodiacal signs, and houses. He who knows how to find 
out what each of them means or portends deserves the 
title of a clever adept and of a master in this art. 

Next follows the division of the zodiacal signs in 
minor portions, first that in x{mbahras, which are called 
hord, ic. hour, because half a sign rises in about an 
hour's time, The first half of each male sign is unlucky 
as standing under the influence of the sun, because he 
produces male beings, whilst the second half is lucky as 
standing under the influence of the moon, because she 
produces female beings. On the contrary, in the female 
signs the first half is lucky, and the second unlucky. 

Farther, thers are the triangles, called drekidna. 
There is no use in enlarging on them, as they are 
simply identical with the so-called draijdndt of our 
system. 

Farther, the suhbahrdt (Persian, “the nine parts”), 


CHAPTER LXXX. 223 


called navdmiéaka. As our books of introduction to the 
art of astrology mention two kinds of them, we shall 
here explain the Hindu theory regarding them, for the 
‘information of Indophiles, You reduce the distance 
between 0° of the sign and that minute, the nuhbahr of 
which you want to find, to minutes, and divide the 
number by 200. The quotient represents complete 
nuhbahras of uinth-parts, beginning with the éurning 
sign, which is in the triangle of the sign in question ; 
you count the number off on the consecutive signs, so 
that one sign corresponds to one nuhbahr. That sign 
which corresponds to the last of the ninth-parts which 
yon have is the duminant of the nukdahr wo want to find. 

The first nuhbahr of each turning sign, the fifth of 
each jixed sign, and the ninth of each dowble-bodied 
sign is called vargottama, i.e. the greatest portion. 

Further, the twelfth-parts, called the twelve rulers.4.% 
For a certain place within a sign they are found in the pe. 
following manner :—Reduce the distance between 0° of 
the sign and the place in question to minutes, and 
divide the number by 150. The quotient represents 
complete twelfth-parts, which you count off on the 
following signs, beginning with the sign in question, so 
that one twelfth-part corresponds to one sign. The 
dominant of the sign, to which the last twelfth-part 
corresponds, is at the same time the dominant of the 
twelfth-part of the place in question. 

Farther, the degrees called trinédtigaka, ie. the 5103 
thirty degrees, which correspond to our limits (or Spia). Spa. 
Their order is this: The first five degrees of each male 
sign belong to Mars, the next following five to Saturn, 
the next eight to Jupiter, the next seven to Mercury, 
and the last five to Venus. Just the reverse order 
takes place in the female signs, viz. the first five degrees 
belong to Venus, the next seven to Mercury, the next 
eight to Jupiter, the next five to Saturn, aud the last 
five to Mercury. 


224 ALBERUNPS INDIA. 


These are the elements on which every astrological 
calculation is based. 


teat The nature of the aspect of every sign depends upon 
aupect. the nature of the ascendens which at a given moment. 


rises above the horizon. Regarding the aspects they 
have the following rule ~— 

A sign does not look at, ic. does not stand in aspectu 
with the two signs immediately before and after it, 
On the contrary, each pair of signs, the beginnings of 
which are distant from each other by one-fourth or one- 
third or one-half of the circle, stand in aspect with each 
other. If the distance betwoen two signs is one-sixth 
of the circle, the signs forming this aspect are counted 
in their original order; but if the distance is five- 
twelfths of the circle, the signs forming the aspect are 
counted in the inverse order. 

There are various degrees of aspects, viz. — 

The aspect between one sign and the fourth or 
eleventh following one is a fourth-part of an aspect ; 

The aspect between one sign and tae fifth or ninth 
following one is Aalf an aspect; 

The aspect between a sign and the sixth or tenth 
following one ia three-quarters of an aspect ; 

The aspect between a sign and the seventh following 
one is a whole aspect, 

The Hindus do not speak of an aspect between two 
planets which stand in one and the same sign. 

With reference to the change between the friendship 
and enmity of single planets with regard to each other, 
the Hindus have the following rule :— 

If a planet comes to stand in signs which, in relation 
Page xe, tits rising, are the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, first, second, 

third, and fourth signs, its nature undergoes s change 
for the better. If it is most inimical, it becomes mo- 
derated ; if it is moderated, it. becomes friendly ; if it is 
friendly, it becomes most friendly.. If the planet comes 
to stand in all the other signs, its nature undergoes a 


ie 


each other. 


CHAPTER LXXx. 225 


change for the worse. If originally it is friendly, it 
becomes moderate; if it is mederate, it becomes ini- 
such circumstances, the nature of a planet is an acci- 
dental one for the time being, associating itself with its 
original nature, 

After having explained these things, we now proceed The four 
to mention the four forces which are peculiar to each each p Planet. 
planet :— 

I. The habitual force, called sthénabala, which the Tagine 

planet exercises, when it stands in its altitudo, its house, & & 
or the house of its friend, or in the nuhbahr of its house, 
or its altitudo, or its mtlairikona, ue. its gaudiuwm in the 
line of the lacky planets. This force is peculiar to sun 
and moon when they are in the lucky signs, as it is 
peculiar to the other planets when they are in the un- 
Incky signs. Especially this force is peculiar to the 
moon in the first third of her tunation, when it helps 
every planet which stands tn aspect with her to acquire 
the same force. Lastly, it is peculiar to the ascendens 
if it is a sign representing a biped. 

II. The force called drishgibala, tc. the lateral one, tagh. it rs. 
also called drigba/a, which the planet exercises when 
etanding in the cardo in which it is strong, and, accord- 
ing to some people, also when standing in the two houses 
immediately before and after the cardo. It is peculiar 
to the ascendens in the day, if it is a sign representing a 
_ biped, and in the night, if it is a four-footed sign, aud in 
both the satidhis (periods of twilight at the beginning 
and end) of the other aigns, This in particular refers 
to the astrology of nativities. In the other parts of 
astrology this force is peculiar, as they maintain, to the 
tenth sign if it represents a quadruped, to the seventh | 
sign if it is Scorpio and Cancer, and to the fourth sign 
if it is Amphora and Cancer. 

III. The conquering force, called cesh{tébala, which tagh. its 
@ planet exercises, when it is in retrograde motion, 

VOL, II, P 


Page 309. 


226 ALBERUN?PS INDIA. 


when it emerges from concealment, marching as a 
visible etar till the end of four eigns, and when in the 
north it meets one of the planets except Venus, For 
to Venus the south is the same as the north is to the 
other planets. If the two ( ? illegible) stand in 
it (the south), it is peculiar to them that they stand in 
the ascending half (of the eun’s annual rotation), pro- 
ceeding towards the summer solstice, and that the moon 
in patticular stands near the other planets—except the 
sun—which afford her something of this force. 

The force is, further, peculiar to the ascendens, if its 
dominant is in it, if the two stand in aspect with Jupiter 
and Mercury, if the ascendens is free from an aspect of 
the unlucky planets, and pone of them—except the 
dominant—is in the ascendens, For if an unlucky 
planet is in it, this weakens the aspect of Jupiter and 
Mercury, so that their dwelling in this force loses its 
effect. 

IV. The fourth force is called A@Jubala, ic. the tem- 
poral one, which the daily planets exercise in the dsy, 
the nightly planets during the night. It is peculiar 
to Mercury in the sathdhi of its rotation, whilst others 
maintain that Mercury always has this force, because 
he stands in the same relation to both dsy and night. 

Farther, this force is peculiar to the lucky planets in 
the white half of the month, and to the unlucky stars 
in the black half, It is always peculiar to the ascendens, 

Other astrologers also mention years, months, days, | 
and hours among the conditions, under which the one 
or other of the four forces is peculiar to s planet. 

These, now, are the forces which are calculated for 
the planets and for the ascendens. 

If aeveral planets own, each of them, eeveral forces, 
that one is preponderaut which has the most of them. 
If two planets have the same number of balas or forces, 
that one has the preponderance the magnitude of which 
is the larger. This kind of magnitude is in the table of 


CHAPTER LXXX. : 227 


il. 215, called naisargikabala. This is the order of the tagh. it. » 
planets in masnitnde or force. 
The middle years which are computed for the planets Tho years 
are of three different species, two of which are com- thesinglo 


puted according to the distance from the altitude. The ert 
measures of the first and second species we exhibit in scene 
the table (ii. 215). wee 

The shaddya and naisargika are reckoned as the 
degree of altitude. The first species is computed when 
the above-mentioned forces of the sun are prepon- 
derating over the forces of the moon and the ascendens 
separately. 

The second species is computed if the forces of the 
moon are preponderating over those of the sun and 
those of the ascendens, 

The third species is called arinédya, and is computed 
if the forces of the ascendens are prepondcrating over 
those of sun and moon, 

The computation of the years of the first species for The first 
each planet, if it does not stand in the degree of ii 
altitudo, is the following :— 

Yon take the distanbe of the star from the degree of tagh. vi. :. 
its altitudo if this distance is more than six signs, or 
the difference between this distance and twelve signs, in 
case it is less than six signs. This number is multiplied 
by the aumber of the years, indicated by the table on 
page 812. Thus the signs sum up to months, the de- 
grees to days, the minutes to day-minntes, and these 
valves are reduced, each sixty minutes to one day, each 
thirty.days to one mouth, and each twelve mouths to 
ove year. 

The computation of these years for the ascendens is 
this :— 

Take the distance of the degree of the star from 0° of ragh. vi, 2. 
Aries, one year for each sign, one month for each 2} 
degrees, one day for each five minutes, one day-minute 
for each five seconds, 


: 
i 


228 ALBERUNPS INDIA. 


The computation of the years of the second species 
for the planets is the following :-— 

Take the distance of the star from the degree of its 
altiius according to the just-mentioned rule (ii. 227), 
This number je multiplied by the corresponding num- 
ber of years which is indicated by the table, and the 
Temainder of the computation proceeds in the same 
way 43 in the case of the first species. 

The compntation of this species of years for the 
ascendens is this -— 

Take the distance of its degree from 0° of Aries, a 
year for each nuhbahr; months and days, &., in the 
same way as in the preceding computation, The 
number you get is divided by 12, and the remainder 
being less than 12, represents the number of years of 
the ascendens. 

The computation of the years of the third species is 
the same for the planets as for the ascendens, and is 
similar to the computation of the years of the ascendens 
of the second species. It is this:— 

’ Take the distance of the star from o° of Aries, one 
year for each nukbakr, multiplying the whole distauce 
by 108. Then the signs sum up to months, the degrees 
to days, the minutes to day-minutes, the emaller mea- 
sure being reduced to the larger one, The years are 
divided by 12, and the remainder which you get by 
this division is the number of years which you want 
to find. 

All the years of this kind are called by the common 
name dyurdéya. Before they undergo the equation 
they are called madhyamdya, and after they have 
passed it they are called sphujdya, tc. the corrected 
ones. , 

The years of the ascendens in all three species are 
corrected ones, which do not require an equation by 
means of two kinds of subtraction, one according 
to the position of the ascendens.in the wther, and a 


CHAPTER LXXX. 229 


second according to its position in relation to the 
horizon. 

To the third kind of years is peculiar an equation by Various 
means of an addition, which always proceeds in the tionsterthe 
same manner. It is this:— iw” 

If a planet stands in its largest portion or in its 
honse, the drekkdna of its house or the drekkdna of its 
altitudo, in the nuhbahr of its house or the nuhbahr of 
its altitudo, or, at the same time, in most of these posi- 
tions together, its years will be the donble of the middle 
number of years. But if the planet is in retrograde 
motion or in its altitudo, or in both together, its years Pago j10. 
are the threefold of the middle number of years. 

Regarding the equation by means of the subtraction 
(vide ii, 228) according to the first method, we observe 
that the years of the planet, which is in its dejectio, are 
reduced to two-thirds of them if they are of the first or 
second species, and to one-half if they belong to the 
third species. The standing of a planet in the house 
of its opponent does not impair the number of its years. 

The years of a planet which is concealed by the rays 
of the sun, end thus prevented from exercising an in- 
fluence, are reduced to one-half in the case of all three 
species of years, Oniy Venus and Saturn are excepted, 
for the fact of their being concealed by the rays of the 
sun does not in any way decrease the numbers of their 
years. 

As regards the equation by means of subtraction 
according to the second method, we have already stated 
in the table (ii. 221, 222) how mnch is subtracted from 
the unlucky and lucky stars, when they stand in the 
houses above the earth. If two or more planets come 
together in one house, yon examine which of them is 
the larger and stronger one. The subtraction is added 
to the years of the stronger planet and the remainder is 
left as it is, 

If to the years of a single planet, years of the third 


230 ALBERUNPS INDIA. 


species, two additions from different sides are to be 
made, only one addition, viz, the longer one, is taken 
into account, The same is the case when two subtrac- 
tions are to be made, However, if an addition as well 
as a aubtraction is to be made, you do the one first and 
then the other, because in this case the sequence is 
different. 

By these methods the years become adjusted, and the 
sum of them is the duration of the life of that man who 
is born at the moment in question. 

It now remains for us to explain the method of the 

Thesinge Hindns regarding the periods (sic), Life ia divided 

glementsof in the above-mentioned three species of years, and 

Beane immediately after the birth, into years of sun and 

off. moon. That one is preponderating which has the most 
forees and balas (vide ii. 225); if they equal each other, 
that one is preponderating which has the greatest 
portio (sic) in its place, then the next one, &c. The 
companion of these years is either the ascendens or that 
planet which stands in the cardines with many forces 
‘and portiones, The several planets come together in the 
cardines, their influence and sequence are determined by 
their forces and shares. After them follow those planets 
which stand near the cardines, then those which stand 
in the inclined signs, their order being determined in the 
same way as in the preceding case. Thus becomes 
known in what part of the whole human life the years 
of every single planet fall. 

However, the single parts of life are not computed 
exclusively in the years of the one planet, but accord. 
ing to the influences which companion-stars exercise 
upon it, ze. the planets which stand in aspect with it. 
For they make it partake in their rule and make it 
share in their division of the years. <A planet which 
stsnds in the same aign with the planet ruling over the 
part of life in question, shares with it one-half. That 
which stands in the fifth and ninth signs, shares with 


CHAPTER LXXX. 231 


it one-third, That which stands in the fourth and 
eighth signs, shares with it one-fourth, That which 
stands in the seventh sign, shares with it one-seventh. 
Tf, therefore, several planets come together in one 
position, all of them have in common that share which 
is necessitated by the position in question. 

The method for the computation of the years of such 
a companionship (if the ruling planet stands in aspect How one 
with other planets) is the following : — tdcled by 

Take for the master of the years (i.e. that planet o nother , 

which rules over a certain part of tha life of a man) one“ 
as numerator and one as denominator, ze. +, one whole, 
because it rules over the whole. Further, take for each 
companion (i.e. each planet which stands in aspect with 
the former) only the numerator of its denominator (not 
the entire fraction). You multiply each denominator by 
all the numerators and their sum, in which operation the 
original planet and its fraction are disregarded. There- 
by all the fractions are reduced to one and the same 
denominator. The eqnal denominator is disregarded. 
Each numerator is multiplied by the sum of the year 
and the product divided hy the sum of the numerators. 
The quotient represents the years Adlambika (kdla- 
bhdga ¢) of a planet. 

As regards the order of the planets, after the question 
as to the preponderance of their influence has been 
decided (? ¢ext in disorder), in so far as each of them Page 31. 
exercises its individual infinence. In the same way as 
has already been explained (vide ii. 230), the preponde- 
rating planets are those standing in the cardines, first 
the strongest, then the less strong, &c., then those 
standing near the cardines, and lastly those standing in 
the inclined signs.

the planets, which they occupy on the origin (ze. at 


232 ALBERUNPS INDIA. 


the moment of birth) and at every given moment of 
life in what way the years of the different planets are 
distributed over it, To these things Hindu astrologers 
join certain methods of the astrology of nativities, 
which other nations do not take into account. They 
try, eg. to find out if, at the birth of a human being, its 
father was present, and conclude that he was absent, if 
Lagtojita- the moon does not stand in aspect with the ascendens, 
pm ill oF if the sign in which the moon stands is enclosed 
between the signs of Venus and Mercury, or if Saturn 
is in the ascendens, or if Mars atands in the seventh sign, 

Chap. iii. 4 (?).—Further, they try to find out if the 
child will attain full age by examining sun and moon. 
If sun and moon stand in the same sign, and with them 
an unlucky planet, or if the moon and Jupiter just quit 
the aspect with the ascendens, or if Jupiter just quits 
the aspect with the united sun and moon, the child 
will not live to full age. 

Further, they examine the station in which the sun 
stands, in a certain connection with the circumatances 
of a lamp. If the sign is a turning one, the light of the 
lamp, when it is transferred from one place to the other, 
moves. If the sign is a fixed one, the light of the lamp 
is motionless; and if the sign is a double-bodied one, it 
moves one time and is motionless another, 

Farther, they examine in what relation the degrees 
of the ascendens stand to 30. Corresponding to it is 
the amount of the wick of the lamp which is consumed 
by burning. If the moon is full moon, the lamp is full 
of oil; at other times the decrease or increase of the oil 
corresponds to the wane and increase of the moonlight. 

Chap. iv. 5.—From the strongest planet in the car- 
dines they draw 3 conclusion relating to the door of the 
house, for its direction is identical with the direction of 
this planet or with the direction of the sign of the ascen- 
dens, in case there is no planet in the cardines. 

Chap. iv. 6—Further, they consider which is the 


CHAPTER LXXX. 233 


light-giving body, the sun or moon. If it is the eun, 
the house will be destroyed. The moon is beneficent, 
Mars burning, Mercury bow-shaped, Jupiter constant, 
and Ssturn old. 

Chap. iv. 7.—If Jupiter stands in its altitudo in the 
tenth sign, the honse will consist of two wings or three. 
If ita tndicium is strong in Arcitenens, the house will 
have three wings; if it is in the other donble-bodied 
signs, the house will have two wings, 

Chap. iv. 8.—In order to find prognostics for the 
throne and ita feet they examine the third eign, its 
Bquares and its tength from the twelfth till the third 
signs, If there are unlucky planets in it, either the 
foot or the side will perish in the way that the unlucky 
planet prognosticates. If it is Mars, it will be turned ; 
if it is the sun, it will be broken; and if it is Saturn, it 
will be destroyed by old age, 

Chap. iv. 10.—The number of women who will be 
present in 2 house corresponds to the number of etars 
which are in the signs of the ascendens and of the moon. 
Their qualities correspond to the images of these con- 
etellations. 

Those stars of these constellations which stand 
sbove the earth refer to those women who go away 
from the house, and those which stand under the earth 
prognosticate the women who will come ¢o the honse 
and enter it. 

Further, they inquire into the coming of the spirit taghujata 
of life in man from the dominant of the drekkdna of $*™ 
the stronger planet of either sun or moon. If Jupiter is 
the drekkana, it comes from Devaloks; if it is Venus or 
the moon, the spirit comes from Pitriloka; if it is Mars 
or the sun, the spirit comes from Vridcikaloka ; and if it 
is Saturn or Mercury, the epirit comes from Bhbriguloka. 

Likewise they inquire into the departing of the soul 
after the death of the body, when it depsrts to that 
planet which is atronger than the dominant of the 


Page 412. 


234 ALBERUN?S INDIA. 


drekkAna of the sixth or eighth houses, according to a 
similar rule to that which has just been laid down. 
However, if Jupiter stands in its altttudo, in the sixth 
house, or in the eighth, or in one of the cardines, or if 
the ascendens is Pisces, and Jupiter is the strongest of 
the planets, and if'the constellation of the moment of 
death is the same as that of the moment of birth, in - 
that case the spirit (or soul) is liberated and no longer 
wanders about. 

I mention these things in order to show the reader 
the difference between the astrological methods of our 
people and those of the Hindus. Their theories and 
methods regarding aerial and cosmic phenomena are 
very lengthy and very subtle at the came time, As 
we have limited ourselves to mentioning, in their 
astrology of nativities, only the theory of the determina- 
tion of the length of life, we shall in this department of 
science limit ourselves to the species of the comets, 
according to the statements of those among them who 
are aupposed to know the subject thoroughly. The 
analogy of the comets shall afterwards be extended to 
other more remote sabjects. 

The head of the Dragon is called ré@hu, the tail ketu. 
The Hindus seldom speak of the tail, they only use the 
head. In general, all comets which appear on heaven 
are also called kevu, 

Varahamihira says (chap. iii. 7-12) :— 

“The Head has thirty-three sons who are called 


” tdmasaktlaka. They are the different kinds of the 


comets, there being no difference whether the head 
extends away from them or not. Their prognostics 
correspond to their shapes, colours, sizes, and positions. 
V. 8.—The worst are those which have the shape of a 
crow or the shape of a beheaded man, those which 
have the shape of a sword, dagger, bow and arrow. 
V. 9, 10,—They are always in the neighbourhood of 
sun and moon, exciting the waters so that they become 


CHAPTER LXXX. 238 


thick, and exciting the air that it becomes glowing red. 
They bring the air into such an uproar that the tornadoes 
tear out the largest trees, that flying pebbles beat against 
the calves and knees of the people, They change the 
nature of the time, so that the seasons seem to have 
changed their places. When unlucky and calamitous 

. events become numerous, such as earthquakes, land- 
slips, burning heat, red glow of heaven, uninterrupted 
howling of the wild beasts and screaming of the birds, 
then know that ail this comes from the children of the 
Head. V. 11.—And if these occurrences take place 
together with an eclipse or the effulgence of a comet, 
then recognise in this what thou hast predicted, and 
do not try to gain prognostics from other beings but the 
Sons of the Head. V. 12,~In the place of the calamity, 
point towards their (the comets) region, to all eight 
sides with relation to the body of the sun,” 

Varihamihira says in the Samhita (chap. xi. 1-7) :—~ 

“T have spoken of the comets not before having 
exhausted what is in the books of Garga, Pardsara, 
Asita and Devala, and in the other books, however 
numerous they may be. 

“It is impossible to comprehend their computation, 
if the reader does not previously acquire the knowledge 
of their appearing and disappearing, because they are 
not of one kind, but of many kinds, 

“ Some are hich and distant from the earth, appearing 
between the stars of the lunar stations, They are called 
divya. 

“Others have a middle distance from the earth, 
appearing between heaven and earth, They are called 
dntartkshya. 

“ Others are near to the earth, falling down upon the 
earth, on the mountains, houses and trees. 

“Sometimea you see a light falling down to the 
earth, which people think to be a fire. If it is not 
fire, it is keturtpa, i.e. having the shape of a comet. 

“Those animals which, when flying in the air, look 


Page 313. 


236 ALBERUNT?S INDIA. 


like sparks or like fires which remain in the houses of 
the pifdcas, the devila, and of the demons, efflorescent 
substances and others do not belong to the genus of 
the cometa. 

“ Therefore, ere you can tell the prognostica of the 
comets, you must know their nature, for the prognostics 
are in agreement with it. That category of lights which 
is in the air, falling on the bannera, weapons, houses, 
trees, on horses end elephants, and that category coming 
from a Lord which is observed among the stars of the 
lunar stations—if a phenomenon does not belong to 
either of these two categories nor to the above-men- - 
tioned phantoms, it is a telluric ketu. 

V. 5.—“ Scholars differ among each other regarding 
the number of the cometa. According to some there 
are 101, according to others 1000. According to 
N&rada, the sage they are only one, which appears in 
a multitude of different forms, always divesting itself of 
one form and arraying itself in another. 

V. 7.—* Their influence lasts for as many months as 
their appearance lasts days. If the appearance of a 
comet lasts longer than one and a half month, subtract 
from it forty-five days. The remainder represents the 
months of its influence. If the appecrance lasts longer 
than two months, in that case state the years of its 
influence to be equal to the number of tie months of 
its appearance. The number of comets does tint exceed 
the number 1000.” 

We give the contents of the following table in order 
to facilitate the study of the subject, although we have 
not been able to fill out all the single fields of the 
diagram, because the manuscript tradition of the single 
paragraphs of the book either in the original or in the 
copy which we have at our disposal is corrupt. The 


' guthor intends by his explanations to confirm the theory 


of the ancient scholars regarding the two numbers of 
comets which he mentions on their authority, and he 
endeavours to complete the number 1000.

CHAPTER LXX&. 239 


The author (Vardhamihira) had divided the comets Page 3:5. 
into three classes: the Aigh ones near the stars; the Further 
. flowing ones near the earth ; the middle ones in the air, Fro a gl 

and he mentions each one of the high and middle classes Yerttamt- 
of them in our table separately. : 

He further says (chap. xi. 42) :— 

“If the light of the middle class of comets shines on 
the instruments of the kings, the banners, parasols, 
fans, and fly-flaps, this bodes destruction to the rulers. 
Tf it shines on a house, or tree, or mountain, this bodes 
destruction to the empire. If it shines on the farni- 
ture of the house, its inhabitants will perish. If it 
shines on the aweepings of the house, its owner will 
perish.” 

Further Varihamihira says (chap. xi. 6) :-— 

“Tf a shooting-star falls down opposite to the tail of 

a comet, health and wellbeing cease, the rains lose their 

beneficial effects, and likewise the trees which are holy 

to Mahadeva—there is no use in ennmerating them, 

since their names and their essences are unknown 

among us Muslims—and the conditions in the realm of 

Cola, Sita, the Huns and Chinese are troubled.” 

Further he says (chap. xi. 62) :-— 
“Examine the direction of the tail of the comet, it 
being indifferent whether the tail hangs down or stands 

erect or is inclined, and examine the lunar station, the 

edge of which is touched by it. In that case predict 

destruction to the place.and that its inhabitants will be 

attacked by armies which will devour them as the pea- 

cock devoura the snakes. 

“From these comets you must except those which 
bode something good. 
“ As regards the other comets, you must investigate 

in what lunar stations they appear, or in what station 

their tails lie or to what station their tails reach. In 
' that case you must predict destruction to the princes 

of those countries which are indicated by the lunar 


240 ; ALBBRUNTS INDIA. 


stations in question, and other events which are in- 
dicated by those stations.” 

The Jews hold the same opinion regarding the 
comets as we hold regarding the stone of the Ka'ba 
(viz. that. they all are stones which have fallen down 
from heaven). According to the same book of Vara- 
hamihira, comets are such beings as have been on 
account of their merits raised to heaven, whose period 
of dwelling in heaven has elapsed and who are then 
redescending to the earth. 

The following two tables embody the Hindu theories 
of the comets :—

CHAPTER LXXX. 245 


This is the doctrine of the Hindus regarding the Page 3:2. 
comets and their presages. 

Only few Hindus occupy themselves in the BANE On metecro- 
way as physical scholars among the ancient Greeks 
did, with exact scientific researches on the comets and 
on the nature of the other phenomena of heaven 
(ta peréwpa), for also in these things they are not able 
to rid themselves of the doctrines of their theologians. 
Thus the Matsya-Purina says :— 

“There are four rains and four mountains, and 
their basis is the water. The earth is placed gn four 
elephants, standing in the four cardinal directions, 
which raise the water by their trunks to make the 
seeds grow. They sprinkle water in summer and 
snow in winter. The fog is the servant of the rain, 
raising itself up to it, and adorning the clouds with 
the black colonr,” 

With regard to these four elephants the Book of the 
Medicine of Elephants says :-— 

“Some male elephants excel man in cunning. There- 
fore it is considered a bad omen if they stand at the 
head of a herd of them. They are called manguniha (?), 
Some of them develop only one tooth, others three and 
four; those which belong to the race of the elephants 
bearing the earth, Men do not oppose them; and if 
they fall into a trap, they are left to their fate.” 

The Vayu-Purana says :— 

“The wind and the sun’s ray raise the water from 
the ocean to the sun. If the water were to drop down 
from the sun, rain would be hot. Therefore the sun 
hands the water over to the moon, that it should drop 
down from it as cold water and refresh the world,” 

As regards the phenomena of the sky, they say, for 
ingtance, that the thunder is the roaring of Airdvata, 
i.e., the riding-elephant of Indra the ruler, when it 
drinks from the pond Manas, rutting and roaring with 
a hoarse voice,

The rainbow (lit, bow of Kuzah) is the bow of 
Indra, as our common people consider it as the bow of 
Rustam. 

We think now that what we have related in this 
book will be sufficient for any one who wants to con- 
verse with the Hindus, and to discuss with them 
questions of religion, science, or literature, on the very 
basis of their own civilisation. Therefore we shall 
finish this treatise, which has already, both by its length 
and breadth, wearied the reader. We ask God to 
pardon, us for every statement of ours which is not 
true. We ask Him to help us that we may adhere to 
that which yields Him satisfaction. We ask Him to 
lead us to a proper insight into the nature of that which 
is false and idle, that we may sift it so as to distinguish 
the chaff from the wheat. All good comes from Him, 
and it is He who is clement towards His slaves. Praise — 
be to God, the Lord of the worlds, and His blessings be 
upon the prophet Makammad and his whole family !

VOL. I. 


P. 1, Title—~The author proposes to investicate the 
reality (= haktka) of Hindu modes of thought in the entire 
extent of the subject. He describes the religious, literary, 
and scientific traditions of India, not the country and its 
inhabitants. However, in some chapters he gives more 
than the title promises; ¢/ his notes on the toads and on 
the courses of the rivers, 

The contents of the eighty chapters of the book may be 
arranged under the following heads :— 

Chap. 1. General Introduction. 

Chap. 2-11. On Religious, Philosophical, and cognate 
subjects, 

Chap. 12-17. On Literature and Metrology, Strange 
Customs and Superstitions. 

Chap. 18-31. On Geography, Descriptive, Mathemati- 
cal, and Traditional, ze. Pauranic, 

Chap. 32-62. On Chronology and Astronomy, inter- 
spersed with chapters of Religious Tradition, cg. on Nari- 
yana, Vasudeva, &c. 

Chap. 63-76, On Laws, Manners and Customs, Festivals 
and Fast Days, 

Chap. 77-80, On Astrological Subjects. 

The word makiia, translated by category, is a technical 
term of Arabian philosophy. It was coined by the first 
Arabian translators of Aristotle for the purpose-of render- 
ing xaTryopia, and has since become current in the school 
language of Islam (c/, the Arabic title of Aristotelis Cate- 
gore Greece cum versione Arabica, &c., edid. J, Th, Zenker, 
- Lipsia, 1846). The Syrian predecessors of those Arabian 
translators had simply transferred the Greek word just as 


250 ALBERUN?S INDIA. 


it is into their own languago; ef. eg. Jacob of Edessa in 
G. Hoffmaun’s De Hermeneuticis apud Syros Aristoteleis, 
’ Lipsiz, 1869, p. 17. 

That @ Muslim author should investigate the ideas of 
idolaters, and not only such as Muslims may adopt, bat 
also such as they must reject and condemn, that he quotes 
the Koran and the Gospel side by side (p. 4-5), is a proof 
of s broadness of view and liberality of mind more fre- 
quently met with in the ancient times of Islam, in the 
centuries before the establishment of Mohammadan ortho- 
doxy by Alghazzilt (died AD. 1111), than later. There 
wag more field for utterances of mental individuality before 
the ideas of all the nations of Islam were moulded into a 
unity which makes it difficult to recognise the individual 
influences of every single nation on the general develop- 
ment of the Muhammadan mind, before all Islam had 
become one huge religious community, in which local and 
national differences seem to have lost most of their original 
importance for the spiritual life of map. The work of 
Alberuni is unique in Muslim literature, -as an earneat 
attempt to study an idolatrous world of thought, not pro- 
ceeding from tha intention of attacking and refuting it, 
bat uniformly showing the desire to be just and impartial, 
even when the opponent’a views are declared to be inad- 
missible. There can be hardly a doubt. that under other 
circumstances, in other periods of Muslim history and 
other countries, the present work micht have proved fatal 
to its author; and it ehows that the religious policy of 
King Mahmiid, the great destroyer of Hindu temples and 
idols, under whom Alberuni wrote, must have been so 
liberal as to be rarely met with in the annals of Islam 


(of. pp. 268, 269). 


P.5. The master Abt-Sahl, do—Al-tiflist, ic. a native 
of Tiflis in the Caucasus, is not known from other sources. 
I snppose he was one of the high civil functionaries of the 
realm or court of Mahmid. The name SeAi occurs very 
freqnently among men of Persian descent of those times, 
and the title Ustddh = master, is in the Ta’rikh-i-Baibaki 
alwaya prefixed, if not precisely as an official title, at all 
events as a title expressive of profound respect on the 
part of the speaker, to the names of tha ministers end

highest civil officials of Mahmfd and Masfid, such as 
Bi Sahl Zauzant, BO Sahl Hemdfinit, BA Nasr Mushkan, 
the minister of state, whose aecretary Al-baihakt was, as 
well as to the name of Alberuni (44, 16), but never to the 
namea of the great military men (cf. on titles in the Ghaz- 
nawi empire, A. de Biberstein Kazimirski, Menoutchehrt, 
Paris, 1887, p. 308). Administrative akill was a legacy 
left by the organisation of the Sasanian empire to the 
Persians of later centuries, whilst military qnalities seem 
entirely to have disappeared among the descendants of 
Rustam. For all the generals and officers of Mahmid 
and Mas fd were Turks, aa Altuntash, Arslan Jadhib, Ari- 
yarok, Bagtagiz, Bilkftagin, Niydltagin, Noshtagin, &c, 
The Ghazna princes spoke Persian with their civil function- 
aries, Turkish with their generals and soldiers (cf. Elliot, 
History of Indie, ii 81, 102). 


P.5. The Mu tazila sect.—The dogma, God has no know. 
ledge, is part of their doctrine on the qualities of Gad, 
maintained especially by Ma‘mar Ibn ‘Abbaéd Al-Sulami. 
(Cf. on this and related subjects the treatise of H. Steiner, 
Die Mutaziliten oder die Freidenker im Islam, Leipzig, 
1865, pp. 50, §2, §9, and Al-Shahrastant’s “ Book of Reli- 
gious and Philosophical Sects,” edited by Cureton, London, 
1846, p. 30, ll. 7-9). Proceeding from the stndy of Greek 
philosophy, the doctors of this school tried to save the 
free will of man as against predestination. There was 
once in Arabic a large literature composed by them and 
by their opponents, most of which ia unknown, at all 
events not yet brought to light. Most of these books 
were of a polemical nature, and it is against their polemi- 
cal bias that the criticism of Alberuni is directed. With 
regard to his own work, he expressly declares (p. 7) that 
it is not & polemical one. The book which Abd-Sahl had 
before him, and which gave rise to the discussion between 
him and our author, was probably one like that of Abul- 
hasan Al-’ash‘ari (died A.D. 935), the great predecessor of 
Alghazzali, “On the Qualities of God,” in which he attacks 
the Muttazila doctrine of the negation of God's omni- 
science. (Cf. W. Spitta, Zur Geschichte Abulhasan Al- 
*Asharts, Leipzig, 1876, p. 64.) The same author has 
also written an extensive work against the antagonists of 


252 ALBERUNYIS INDIA. 


the orthodox faith, against Brahmins, Christians, Jews, 
and Magians (v. ib. p. 68). 

Our information regarding the ancient literature on the 
history of religion and philosophy (the latter proceeding 
from a work of the Neoplatonist Porphyrius) is very 
scanty, and mostly limited to titles of books. The work 
of Shahrastini (died a.D. 1153) ia a late compendium or 
ywaue (v. his pref, 1,8). His editor, Cureton, intended to 
give “Observations respecting the sources from which this 
author has probably derived his information” (English 
pref., p. iv.), but, as far as I am aware, he has not carried 
out his intention. There is an excellent treatise on the 
history of religions in the Fisrist of Al-nadim (composed 
about Ap. 987) on p. 4. The same author mentions, 
(p. ‘¥v) an older work on doctrines and religions by 
Alhasan Ibn Mfs4 Alnaubakhti (mentioned by Mas‘idi), 
who also wrote against metempsychosis. Parts of a simi- 
lar work of Ibn Hazm, an Arab of Spain (died A.D. 1064), 
are extant in the libraries of Vienna and Leyden. Mr. 
C. Schefer has recently published in his Chrestomathie 
Persane, Paris, 1883, a useful little book in Persian called 
ghost gle ws, composed by Abul-Ma ali Muhammad Ibn 
‘Ukail, who wrote in Ghazna, under the king Mas‘fid Ibn 
Ibrahim (A.D. 1089-1099), half a century after Alberuni, 
whose Jndica he quotes in his book, He calis it #1 #\,¥, i... 
“ The Doctrines of the Hindus” (p. ‘T4). Two more treatises 
in Persian on the history of religions are mentioned by 
C. Schefer, Chrestomathte Persane, pp. 136, 137. 

An aathor who seems to have written on subjects con- 
nected with the history of religions is one Abi-Ya'kib of 
Sijistan, as Alberani (i 64-65) quotes his theory on the 
metempsychosis from a book of his, called Kitdb-kashf- 
almahjadb. ; 


’ Pp. 6-7. Alérdnshahri and Zurkdén.—Our author has 
not made any use of the Muhammadan literature on the 
belief of the Hindus, 2s far as such existed before his 
time; evidently he did not give it the credit of a bord Jide 
source of historical information. Throughout his book 
he derives his statements exclusively either from Indian 
books or from what he had heard himself. He makes an 
exception of this rule only in favour of Aléranshahri, the 


ANNOTATIONS. 253 


author of a general work on the history of religions. 
Alberuni seems tu have known this book already (a.p. 
1000) when he wrote his “Chronology,” for there he gives . 
two quotations, one au Eranian, and the other an Armenian 
tradition, on the anthority of Aléranshahri (v. “ Chrono- 
logy of Ancient Nations,” &c., translated by Dr. C. Edward 
Sachau, London, 1879, pp. 208, 211). 

The word Eranshahr was known to the Arabs as the 
name of the whole Sasanian empire, from the Oxus to the 
Euphrates, So it is used, ¢g. by Abi-Ali’Ahmad [bn 
“Umar Ibn Dusta in his geocraphical work (British 
Museum, add. 23,378 on fol. 1200), where he describes the 
whole extent of it. If, however, Eranshahr here means 
the place where the anthor Abul‘abbais was born, we must 
take the word in the more restricted meaning, which is 
mentioned by Albal4dhuri. For it is also the name of a 
part of the Sasanian empire, viz. one of the four provinces 
of Khurdsiv, the country between Nishipur, Tis, and 
Herft. Accordingly, we suppose that Alérinshahri means 
a native of this particular province. Cf, Almukaddasi, 
p. "W, Yakft, i 4. According to another tradition, the 
name Erinshahr also applied to Nishapur, ic. the name 
of the province was used to denote its capital. Cf. Almu- 
kaddasi, p, ™*. 

Aléranshahri, a sort of freethinker according to Albe- 
_ runi, is only once quoted (i. 326, a Buddhistic tradition 
on the destruction and renovation of the world). But as 
Alberuni praises his description of Judaism, Christianity, 
and Manichism, we may suppose that the information of 
the Indica on these subjects, eg. the quotation from the 
Gospel (p. 4—5), was taken from Erinshahri. 

Incorporated in the work of Eransbabri was a treatise 
on Buddhism by an author, Zurkaén, who is entirely 
unknown, Although Alberuni speaks very slightingly 
of this author, and although he does not mention him 
anywhere save in the preface, he seems to have borrowed 
from him those notes on Buddhistic subjects which are 
scattered through his work (v. Index Rerum, s.v. Bud- 
dhists), This sort of information is not of a very high 
standard, bnt other sources on Buddhism, literary or oral, ‘ 
do not seem to have been at the command of Albernni. 
The Hindus with whom se mixed were of the Brahminical 


254 : ALBERUNI'S INDIA. 


creed, not Buddhists. In the countries where he had 
lived, in Khwarizm, Jurjin, the country round Ghazna 
. (ZAbulistan), and the Panjab, there had been no oppor- 
tunity for studying Buddhism; and also among the nume- 
rous soldiers, officers, artisans, and other Indians in the 
service of Mahmdd in Ghazna and other places, there do 
not seem to have been Bnddhists, or else Alberuni would 
have used such occasions for filling ont this blank in his 
knowledge. 

In the Fikrist (ed. G. Fliigel, Leipzig 1871), on p. 
rer there is an extensive report on India and China, 
which is derived from the following sources :-— 

1. The account of Abfi-Dulaf of Yanbfl, who had 
travelled to India and China about aD. 941. 

2. That of a Christian monk from Najran, who by order 
of the Nestorian Katholikos had also travelled to India 
and China in the years A.D. 980-987. 

3. From a book dated A.D. $63, of an unknown author, 
a book which had passed through the hands of the famons 
Alkindt, Was this perhaps the work of Aléranshabri, and 
the note on Buddha on p. ¥Pv by Zarkin? 

The origin of the chapter on Indian subjects in Shah- 
rastini (ed. Cureton, London, 1846), on p. PPP sez. is not 
known. At all events, this author has not made use of 

. Alberani’s work. 


Pp. 7-8. Greeks, Sifis, Christians.—In order to illustrate 
the ideas of the Hindus, and to bring them nearer to the 
understanding of his Muslim readers, Alberuni quotes 
related ideas— 

1. Of the Greeks (¢f. i 24). 

2. The Christians. 

3. The Jews. 

4. The Manichzans ; and 

5. The Safis, . 

Pantheism in Islam, the doctrine of the Sifis, is as near 
akin to the Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean schools of 
Greek philosophy as to the Vedanta school of Hindu 
philosophers. It was in our author’s time already repre- 
sented by a very large literature. He qnotes some Sififi 
sentences, ey. of Abi Bakr Al-shibli, and Abi Yazid 
Albistimi, who are known from other sources (i. 87, 88), 


ANNOTATIONS. 255 


and a Safi interpretation of a Koranic passage (i. 88). 
Cf. besides, the Index Rerum av. Sifism. He gives i. 33, 
34, several etymologies of the word Safi, which he himself 
identifies with Jodia. 

The notes relating to Mani and the Manichmans (v. 
Index Rerum), and the quotations from their books, are 
probably mostly taken from Aléranshabri (v. p. 18). 
However, it must be kept in- mind that, at the time of. 
our author, the works of Mant still existed, and he him- 
self found the “Book of Mysteries”. and others in his 
native country, though perhaps at a time subsequent to 


* the date of the composition of the Indica. Cf. Chronologie 


Orientalischer Volker, herausgegeben von Ed, Sachan, 
Leipzig, 1878, Vorwort, pp. xi. and xxxvi. The following 
works of Mani are quoted: “ Book of Mysteries,” »ts 
Ny3t; Thesaurus vivificationis se yS,i. 39. Ch Mani, 
seine Lehre und seine Schriften, by G. Fliigel, Leipzig, 1862. 

As regards the Jews, I am not informed to what degree 
Jewish colonies were in those times spread over Cen- 
tral Asia. Alberuni derived probably his knowledge of 
Judaism also from Aléranshahri (p. 253). That in earlier 
years, during his stay in Jurjin, he was acquainted with 
a Jewish scholar is apparent from his chronological work 
(‘Chronology of Ancient Nations,” p. 269). 

Alberuni’s knowledge of Christianity may have been 
communicated by various channels besides the book of © 
his predecessor Aléranshahri, as during his time it was 
far spread in Central Asia, and even at the court of 
Mahmid in Ghazna (eg. Abulkhair Alkhammér, p. 256), 
there lived Christians. It has not yet been investigated 
in detail how far Nestorian Christianity had been carried 
eastward across Central Asia towards and into China,

Episcopalium que sunt Patriarche Nestoriano Subjecta

kites, whilst he expressly states that he does not know 
the Jacobites. Cf. “ Chronology of Ancient Nations,” pp. 
283,43; 202, 123 295, 22; 312, 16. 

Where Alberani. learned Greek philosophy, and who 
introduced him to the study of Plato’s Dialogues and Zeges, 
he does not state himself The Arabic translations which 
he used, and which are tolerably correct, had passed 
through Syriac versions which are now no longer extant 
(e.g. those of Plato). Alberuni was personally acquainted 
and had literary connections with a man who was one of 
the first representatives of Greek learning in the Muslim 
world in that age, Abulkhair Alkhammfr, and it was 
perhaps to him that Alberuni owed part of his classical 
education. Abulkhair was born a Christian in Bagdad, 
AH. 942. He lived some time in Khwarizm, and migrated. 
thence, together with Alberuni and others, to Ghazna, A.D, 
1017, after Mahmad had annexed that country to his 
empire. He died in Ghazna during Mahmid’s reign, te. 
before A.D. 1030, and is said to have become a Muslim 
towards the end of his life. He was a famous physician, 
and wrote on medical subjects and on Greek philosophy ; 
besides he translated the works of Greek philosophers 
(cg. Theophrast) from Syriac into Arabic. Of his writ- 
ings we may mention a “ Book of Comparison of the 
Theory of the (Greek) Philosophers and of the Christians,” 
“Explanation of the Theory of the Ancients (¢.e. Greek 
philosophers) regarding the Creator and regarding Laws,” 
“The Life of the Philosopher,” “ On the Sdn,” “ On Meteo- 
rology,” &c, His pedigree points toa Persian descent. Cf. 
Chronologie Orientalischer Volker, Finleitung, p. xxxii., 
Fihrist, p. ¥°, and the work of Shahrazfiri d+, cl,3t de; 
ett (manuscript of the Royal Library of Berlin, MSS. 
Orient. oct. 217, fol. 1442-1462); C. Schefer, Chresto- 
mathie Persane, p. 141. 

It must be observed that Alheruni, in comparing Hindu 
doctrines with those of Plato, follows in the wake of 
Megasthenes, who says: ITapawdéxoucr S¢ xal fous, 

‘Gorwep ai TTAdtov, wepi te dpOapaias yvyis xal tay xa’ 
g5ou xpicewy kai dda toiaita (Schwanbeck, Bonn, 1846, 
p. 138). 


P. 8. Sdakhya (or Simkhya) and Pdtaijala.—The 


ANNOTATIONS. ! 257 


former word is here written sdagw asi. It may be 
doubtful whether the second is to be read Pétefijala or 
Pataijali. Alberuni generally says Jove wbS, which 
may be translated the book of (the author) Patamjal:, or 
the book (which is called) Pataitjal: or Pdtanjala. Only 
in one place, i. 68 (TP, 5), he says Josh who col the 
author of the book of Pataiyalt, where apparently Jet 
tTeans the title of the book, not the name of the author. 
The long @ in the Arabic writing would rather indicate the 
pronunciation Pdteijala than Patafijah, but in this respect 
the transliteration is not always uniform, as sometimes 
a short Indian @ has been rendered by a long @ in Arabic, 
ag. § tala, pep brahman, » 2S gandharva, Idole 
madhyaloka, SSy- sutala, whe vijayanandin, 4 para, >

the word Je’ evidently means the author, i. 70 (TP, 20), 
and $7 (Pt, 3). The name of the anthor seems to have 
been current also as meaning his book. Therefore, and be- 
cause in Sanskrit generally the name Patafjali is quoted, I 
have given the preference to the latter form of the name, 

Alberuni has transferred large portions of his transla- 
tions of the books Sdikhya and Patatjali, which he had 
published at an earlier date, into the Zndica, 


Pp, 17-19.—In a similar way to Alberuni, the poet Mir 
Khusrau discourses on classical and vernacular in his 
Nuh-sipihy. He mentions the word Sanskrit, whilst Albe- 
runi only speaks of Hindé (v. Elliot, “ History of India,” 
iii, 562, 556; also v. 570, “On the Knowledge of Sanskrit 
by Muhammadans ”), 

There were Hindu dragomans in the service of Mahmid, 
both in the civil administration and in the army, larce 
portions of which were Hindus under Hindu officers 
(Elliot, ii, 109; some fought in Karman, Khwarizm, and 
before Merw for their Muslim master, ib. ii. 130, 131). 
Part of these troops were Kannara, ie, natives of Karna- 
tadeéa (here i. £73). 

A specimen of these interpreters is Tilak, the son of 
Jai Sen (i.e. Tilaka the son of Jayasena), After having 
pursued his studies in Kashmir, he became interpreter first 
to Kadi Shirazi Bulhasan ‘Ali, a high civil official under

Mahmid and Mas‘id (Elliot, if. 117, 123), then to Ahmad 
SJbn Hasan of Maimand, who was grand vizir, A.D. 1007- 
1025, under Mahmid, and a second time, 1030-1033, 
under Mas iid, and rose afterwards to be a commanding 
officer in the army (Elliot, ii. 125-127). This class of 
men spoke and wrote Hindt (of course with Arabic cha- 
racters) and Persian (perhaps also Turkish, as this language 
prevailed in the army), and it is probably in these circles 
that we must look for the origin of Urdii or Hindustani, 
The first author who wrote in this lancuage, the Dante of 
Muhammadan India, is one Mas‘fid, who died a little more 
than a century after the death of King Mahmid (a.n. 525 
=AD. 1131). Cf A. Sprenger, “Catalogue of the Arabic, 
Persian, and Hindustany. Manuscripts of the Libraries of 
the King of Oudh,” Calcutta, 1854, pp. 407, 485. If we 
had any of the Hindi writings of those times, they would 
probably exhibit the same kind of Indian speech as that 
which is found in Alberuni’s book. 


P. 18—The bearing of the words g¥ tj2h es. (9, 
14, 15), which I have translated “and must pronounce the 
case-endings either,” &c., is doubtful. The word ’trdd 
means the process or mode of Arabizing a foreign word, and 
refers both to consonants and vowels, An #rdb mashhitr 
would be a generally known Arabie mode of pronunciation 
of a word of Indian origin, an’i‘rdb ma mdi such a pro- 
nunciation of an Indian word in Arabic as is not yet 
known, but invented for the purpose. Hg. the Sanskrit 
word dvipa appears in two different forms, as dib, 2, 
which must be classed under the first head, and as dbfp, 
«et, Which belongs to the second class, If it is this the 
author means, we must observe that the former class, 4.¢. 
the class of words which had already general currency in 
Arabic before he wrote his Jndica, is insignificantly small 
in comparison with the large number of words which by 
Alberuni were for the first time presented to a reader of 
. Arabic (v. preface of the edition of the Arabic original, 
p. xxvii). 

Another meaning of the word ‘/rdb is the vowel-pronun- 
ciation af the end of the words, chiefly the nouns; in fact, 
the case-endings, Accordingly, irdb mashhir may mean 
case-ending (in German, vocalischer Auslaut) as it is gene- 


‘ANNOTATIONS. 259 
rally used in Hindi, eg. “S gitd, say) revatt, and i'rab 


mimal, a case-ending added to a word purposely in order to 
make it amenable to the rules of Arabic declension (dip- 
toton and triptoton), eg. #13 lanku=Skr. lankhd, y gauru 
=Skr. Gaurt, 24 bindu=Skr. Vindhya, The vocalisation 
of these words is liable to lead us into anerror, Is {, an 
Arabic diptoton, or is its final vocal the termination of the 
noun in Hindi? If the former were the case, we ought 
also to have 3, in genitive and accusative, and we ought 


to read ‘or a caste (varna), eal an impure one (mleccha), 
oe a measure (mina), &. But these forms do not occur 


in the manuscript, and therefore I hold the termination u to 
be the Indian nominative, developed out of the 6 of Prakrit, 
and still extant in Sindhi. (Cf E. Trumpp, Dic Stammbil- 
dung des Sindht, “ Journal of the German Oriental Society,” 
Xvi. p, 129; his “ Grammar of the Sindhi Language,” p, 32). 
The Arabic manuscript is not sufficiently accurate to enable 
us to form an opinion to what extent names in Alberuni’s 
Hindi terminated in wv, but we must certainly say that 
this is the case in the vast majority of nouns. If we are 
correct in this, the term ’i‘rdb ma mdi cannot mean an 
artificial case-ending or one invented or added for the pur- 
pose, because it existed already in the Indian dialect whence 
Alberuni took the word. 

Of the words wtjeh Wasaiy wrbodall, LES peatey Lag Slot It 
Jytae bel, yya-e0 bet, the former hali refers to the writing of 
the consonauts (and perhaps of the Lesezeichen), Accord- 
ingly the latter half ought to refer to the vowels; but 
*trdb does not mean vowels or vocalisation; it only means 
the vocalisation of the final consonant of the word. There- 
fore I am inclined to prefer the first of the two interpreta- 
tious here proposed, and to translate for in order to fix 
the pronunciation we must change the points (1. the dia- 
critical points of the consonants, # «4 3 3 53, &c.) and 
the signs (perhaps he means the Hamza, which cannot be 
applied to Indian sounds), and must secure tts correct pro- 
. wuneiation by such a process of Aralizing as is either already 
in general use or is carried out (or invented) for the pur- 
pose. This is an example (and there are hundreds more) 
of the concise style of the author, so sorely fraught with

ambiguity. Every single word is perfectly elear and cer- 
tain, and still the sentence may be understood in entirely 
different waya. 


P. 10, 3 Which in our Persian grammatical system 
are considered as, &c.—Literally, “Which our companions 
call having,” &. Speaking of his: fellow-Muslims in 
opposition to the Hindus, the anthor alwaya says our com- 
panions, our people, not meaning national differences, Arab, 
Persian, or Turk, but exclnsively the difference of creed. 

In Sanskrit a word (a ayllable) may commence with 
one, two, or three consonants, ¢9. det, syd, strt, kshveda, 
which is impossible in Arabic, where each syllable begins 
and ends with one consonant only. Alberuni’s comparison 
cannot, therefore, refer to Arabic. 

In Persian, the rales for the beginning and end of the 
syllable are different. Whilst in the ancient forms of 
Eranian speech a syllable could commence with two con- 
sonants, as, eg. fratama, khsapa, Neo-Persian permits only 
one consonant at the beginning of a syllable, fardum, shab, 
However, the end of a syllable may consist of two con- 
ecutive consonants, as in ydft sh, baksh (te, khushk 
«lis, mard oy, &. Alberuni seems to hint at these ex- 
amples, and at a doctrine of certain grammarians, who are 
not known, to this effect, that the first of these two conso- 
nants is to be considered as having not a complete or 
clear vowel, but an indistinct hidden one, something like 
a schiwa mobile of Hebrew grammar. 

There is a small number of words (or syllables) in Neo- 
Persian which indeed commence with the two consonants 
©, 0S, 6.9. high, wigt, olgaicel, wl, yrclys, but they were at 
the author's time pronounced as a single one, if we may 
judge from the metrical system of the Shdhndma of his 
contemporary Firdausi, who was only a little older than 
himself. (Cf similar remarks of the author, i. 138, 139.) 


P. 20. Sagara.—The atory of Sagara is related in Vishnu- 
Purdna, translated by Wilson-Hall, vol. iii, p. 289-295. 
The words peten «sist, and git dsb X43 micht make 
us think that these events happened within the recollec- 
tion of the author; but this is not necessarily the case. 
The former words may be interpreted, “J recollect the story

of a Hindu who,” &e, 4 “I recollect having heard the 
story,” &.; and the words with which he winds up the 
story may mean, “I feel thankful to my fate that it was 
not I and my contemporaries whom he treated thus, but 
former generations.” 


P. 21. Shamaniyya.—The Buddhists are in Arabic called 
by this name, which is derived from a Prakritic form of 
Sanskrit sramana (Strabo Zappavas, Hieronymus Sam- 


anaet), and by the word d,eme', i.¢, the red-robed people 
(= raktapata), which refers to the red-brown (= kdshdyc) 
cloaks of the Buddhist monks, Cf Kern, Der Buddhismus 
und seine’ Geschichte in Indien, tibersetzt. von H. Jacobi, 
Leipzig, 1882, ii. 45. See another note of our author's on 
Buddhism in his “Chronology of Ancient Nations,” pp. 
188, 189. It is extremely difficult, from the utter lack of 
historic tradition, to check the author's statements as to 
the western extension of Buddhism, which certainly never 
reached Mosul. Before all, it will be necessary to examine 
how far Alberuni, when speaking of the ancient history 
and institutions of Eran, was under the influence of the 
poets of his time, Dakiki, Asadi, and Firdausi, who 
versified Eranian folklore for the edification.of the states- 
men of the Samanian and Ghaznavi empires, all of them 
of Eranian descent. Heating the songs of the heroic 
exploits of their ancestors: consoled them to a certain 
degree for the only too palpable fact that their nation was 
no longer the ruling one, but subject to another; that 
Arabs and Turks had successively stepped into the heritage 
of their ancestors, 

It must be observed that the negotiators of the cities 
of Sindh, whom they sent to the Muslim conquerors when 
first attacked by them, were invariably sramanas (Vv. 
Albaladhuri), which seems to indicate that Sindh in those 
times, t.c. about A.D. 710, was Buddhistic: Cf. H. Kern, Der 
Buddhismus und seine Gicschichte in Indien, ii. 543. 


P. 21. Muhammad Ibn Alkdsim.—The brilliant career 
of the conqueror of Sindh falls into the years A.D. 707- 
714. By Albaladhuri (p. ®), Ibn-Al’athir, and others 
he is called Muh, Ibn Alkasim Jon Muhammad, not Ton 
Almunabbih, as here and p. 116. When Alberuni wrote, 


262 ALBERUNTI'S INDIA. 


Islam was known in Sindh already 350 years (since A.D. 
680), and was established there 320 years (since about 
A.D. 710). On the history of the conquest of Sindh, ¢f.

“Fragments,” p. 182; Elliot, History of India, i. 113. 
Instead of Bahmanvé read Bamhanvd = Brahmanavdta. 


P. 23. The words of Vardhamihira are found in his 
Brihat-Samhitd, translated by Kern in the “Journal of 
the Royal Asiatic Society,” 1870, p. 441 (ii. 15): “The 
Greeks, indeed, are foreigners, but with them this science 
is in @ flourishing state. Hence they are honoured as 
though they were Rishis; how much more then a twice- 
born man, if he be versed in astrology.” 

P, 25. Think of Socrates, &e—The author speaks of a 
Socratic fate ot calamity, meaning a fate like that which 
befell Socrates. I do not know from what particular 
source Alberuni and his contemporaries derived their in- 
formation abont the history of Greek philosophy. There 
is a broad stream of literary tradition on this subject in 
Arabic literature, but it has not yet been investigated 
what was its origin, whether it proceeded from one source 
or from several. Those men, mostly Greek heathens from 
Harran or Syrian Christians, who had enjoyed the Greek 
edneation of the time, not only translated Greek literature 
into Syriac and Arabic for the benefit of their Arab mas- 
ters, but wrote also general works on the history of Greek 
learning and literature, probably translating and adopting 
for their purpose some one of the most current school- 
books on this subject, used in the schools of Alexandria, 
Athens, Antioch, &. Among authors who wrote such 
books, some being mere compilations of the famous sen- 
tences of Greek sages (doxographic), others having a more 
historic character, are Hunain Ibn “Ishak, his son “Ishik 
Tbn Hunain, and Kusté Ibn Laké (zc. Constans the son 
of Lucas)., But what were the Greek works from which 
they took their information, and which they probably 
communicated to the Arabs exactly as they were? I am 
inclined to think that they used works of Porphyrins and 
Ammonius, the Greek onginals of which are no longer 
extant.

P. 25. Jurare in verba, &c—The Hindus consider, eg. 
the sciences of astronomy and astrology as founded upon 
tradition, and their anthors produce in their books side 
by side their own perbaps more advanced ideas and some 
silly notions of any predecessors of theirs, although they 
are fully aware that both are totally irreconcilable with 
each other. Cf the words of Varihamihira to this effect 
in Brihat Samhitd, ix. 7, and the note of his commentator 
Utpala to v. 32. Alheruni pronounces most energetically 
against this kind of scientific composition when speaking 
of Brahmagupta in chapter lix. on eclipses. 


P. 27. Beyond all likeness and untlikeness, an expression 
frequent in the description of the Deity. Literally trans- 
lated: things that are opposite to cach other and things that 
are like each other. Perhaps the rhyme didd and nidd, 
‘adddd and ‘anddd, has contributed to the coining of this 
term. As for the idea, it may be compared with the term 
dvandcds in Hindu philosophy = pairs of opposites, as 
pleasure and pain, health and sickness. Bhagavad-Giid, 
iL 45, vii. 27; “ Yoga Aphorisms of Patafijali” (edited by 
Rajendralila Mitra), ii. 48, p. 111. 


P. 27, Who is the worshipped one? &e—The greater 
pat of this extract from Patafijali has been translated into 
ersian by Abulma ali Muhammad Ibn ‘Ubaid-Allah in 
his Kitdb-baydn-aladydn ; v, C. Schefer, Chrestomathie Per- 
sane, i, WAATSS at; gh Gabe GWT Sad OS ogee GY] emtaS JT 


P. 27. Pataitjali.—The book of this name used and trans- 
lated by the author had the form of.a conversation between 
two persons, simply called “ the asking one,” and “ the an- 
swering one,” and its subject was the search for liberation 
and for the union of the soul with the object of tts medita- 
tion (i. 132), the emancipation of the soul from the fetters 
of the body (i. 8). It was a popular book of theosophy, 
propounding in questions and answers the doctrine of the 
Yoga, a theistic philosophy developed by Pataijali out of 
the atheistic Sashkhya philosophy of Kapila. Cf. J. Davies, 
“ Hindu Philosophy,” Sdrkhyd Karikd of Isvara Krishna, 
London, 1881, p. 116. The latter is called nirtévara= 


264 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


not having a lord, the former sefvara xhaving 3 lord. It 
mostly treats of moksha (salvation) and métempsychosis. 
It contained not only theory, but also tales (i. 93), Hag- 
gadic elements by way of illustration. 

Alberuni’s Pataiijali is totally different from “ The Yoga 
Aphorisms of Patafijali” (with the commentary of Bhoja 
Raja, and an English translation by Rajendral4la Mitra, 
Calcutta, 1883), and, as far as I may judge, the philosophic 
system of the former differs in many points essentially 
from that of the Sftras, 

Moreover, the extracts given in the Indica stand in no 
relation with the commentary of Bhoja Raja, although the 
commentator here and there mentions ideas which in a 
like or similar form occur in Alberuni’s work, both works 
being intended to explain the principles of the same school 
of philosophy. 

Besides the text of Patafijali, a commentary also is 
mentioned and quoted (i, 232, 234, 236, 238, 248), ys 
Seth OLS or Jesh to, It is most remarkable that the 
extracts from this commentary are all of them not of a 
philosophic, but of a plainly Pauranic character, treating 
of cosmographic subjects, the lokas, Mownt Meru, the 
different spheres, &c. The name of the commentator is 
not mentioned. If the quotations on i 273 seq. may be 
considered as derived from this commentary, the author 
was Balabhadra. V. index i. s.v. Patanjali. 


P, 29, Gitd.—The book Géid is, according to Alberuni, 
a part of the book Bhdrate (i.e. Mahdbhdrata, which term 
does not occur in the Jndica "), and a conversation between 
Vasudeva and Arjuna (423 gow JU). It is largely quoted 
in chapters relating to religion and philosophy. We have 
now to examine in what relation Alberuni’s Giéd stands to 
the well-known Bhagavad-Gitd as we have it in our time. 
Cf. “Hindu Philosophy,” “The Bhagavad-Gita, or the 
Sacred Lay,” translated by J. Davies, London, 1882. The 
latter is described as a skilful union of the systems of Kapila 
and Patafijali with a large admixture of the prevailing 
Bréhmante doctrines. Although the opinions regarding its 
origin differ widely, it can searcely be denied that it is not 
free from having been influenced to a certain degree by 

1 Of. Albernni on the MahkdbAdrata, i. 132, 133.

Christianity, and that it could not have been composed 
before the third Christian century. Chapter xi. gives the 
impression of having been modelled after a Christian 
apocalypsis, hee 

The quotations from the Géd (or Song) may be divided 
into three classes :— , 

(1.) Sach as exhibit a close relationship with certain 
passages in the Bhagavad-Gitd. Parts of sentences are 
here and there almost identical, but nowhere whole sen- 
tences ; v. i. 40, $2, 73, 74, 86, 87, 103, 104, 218 (v. note), 
3523 i. 169. 

(2.) Such as show a certain similarity, more in the ideas 
expressed than in the wording, with passages in the 
Bhagavad-Gtid; v. i. 29, 70, 71, 78, 79, 103, 104, 122. 

(3.) Such as cannot be compared, either in idea or in 
wording, with any passage in the Bhagarad-Gitd ; v.i. 52, 
53, 54, 70, 71, 73; 74> 75, 79 78, 79, 80, 92, 122; ii. 137, 
138. 


The single texts will be discussed in the notes to the 
‘places in question. 

The quotations given by Alberuni cannot have been 
translated from the Bhagavad-Giid in its present form. 
Admitting even that the translator translated as little 
literally and accurately as possible (and the texts of Albe- 
runi do not give this impression), there remains a great 
number of passages which on no account could be derived 
from the present Sanskrit text, simply because they do not 
exist there, Or has Alberuni translated a commentary of 
the Bhagavad-Gttd instead of the original? The text of 
the extracts, as given in the Jndiea, is remarkably short 
and precise, extremely well worded, withont any repeti- 
tion and verbosity, and these are qualities of style which 
hardly point to a commentary. 

Alberuni seems to have used an edition of the Bhagavad- 
Gitd totally different from the one which we know, and 
which also in India seems to be the only one known. It 
must have been more ancient, because the notorious Yoga © 
elements are not found in it, and these have been recog- 
nised by the modern interpreters as intezpolations of a 
later time. Secondly, it must have been more complete, 
because it exhibits a number of sentences which are not 
found in the Bhagavad-Gitd. 


266 ALBERUN?T'S INDIA. 


Various generations of Hindu scholars have modelled 
and remodelled this book, one of the mosi precious gems 
of their literature, and it seems astonishing that an edition 
of it which existed as late as the time of Alberuni should 
not have reached the nineteenth century. 

_ As regards’ the quotation on this page (29), it exhibits 

only in the substance a distant relationship with Bhagavad- 
Gitd, x. 3: “He who knows Me as unborn and without 
beginning, the mighty Lord of the world, he of mortals is 
free from delusion, he is free from all sin.” 


P. 30. Sémkhya—The book Sdmakhya, as used and 
translated by Alberuni, had the form of a conversation 
between an anchorite and a sage, and it contained a 
treatise on the origines and a description of all created 
beings (i. 8), a book on divine subjects (i 132). It was 
composed by Kapila. The anthor quotes it largely on 
questions of religion and philosophy. The Sdamkhya 
philosophy of Kapila is the most ancient system of 
thought among the Hindus, the source of the Yoga doc- 
trine of Pataiijali. €f. Colebrooke, “ Essays,” i. 239-2709; 
J. Davies, “ Hindu Philosophy,” &c., p. ror seg. 

The relation between Alberuni’s Sémkhya and the so- 
called Sdrikhyapravacanam (“The Sinkhya Aphorisms of 
Kapila,” translated by Ballantyne, London, 1885) is a 
very distant one, and is limited to this, that there occurs 
a small number of passages which show a similarity of 
matter, not of form. The latter book (the Sitras) seems 
to be a late secondary prodnetion; v. A. Weber, Vorle- 
sungen tiber Indische Literaturgeschichte, p. 254, note 250. 
Besides, the philosophic system propounded by Alberuni . 
under the name of Sdézitthya seems in various and essen- 
tial points to differ from that of the Sdtras; it seems 
altogether to have had a totally different tendency. The 
Stiras treat of the complete cessation of pain; the first one 
runs thus: “ Well, the complete cessation of pain, (which 
is) of three kinds, is the complete end of man;” whilst the 
oo of Alberuni teaches moksha by means of know- 
edge. 

Next we have to compare Alberuni’s Stakhya with 
the Sdmkhya Kdrikd of as Krishna (v. Colebrooke, 
“ Essays,” i. 272; J. Davies, “ Hindu Philosophy,’ London, 


ANNOTATIONS. 267 


1881). Both werks teach mokska by means of knowledge, 
and contain here and there the same subject-matter. It 
must be observed that of those illustrative tales which 
Alberuni’s Sdarkhya gives in full length, short indications 
are found in the Sémkhya Kdrikd. Its auther, [évara 
Krishna, says at the end of his bock that he has written 
his seventy Sdiras, excluding illustrative tales. This is not 
quite correct, as sometimes, though he has net teld them, 
he has at all events indicated them. His words show 
that he has copied from a book like the Séaakhya of Albe- 
runi, in which the tales were not only indicated, but related 
at full length. Cf A. Weher, Vorlesungen iber Indiscke 
Literaturgeschichte, Berlin, 1876, p. 254, nete 250. Hall 
considers the S. Pravacanam to be yeunger than the S. 
Kérika. 

li, in the third place, we examine the Bhdshya of 
Gaudapida, we find that it is net identical with Alberuni’s 
Sdirkhya, but a near relative of it. Cf the Strickhya 
Kérikd, &c., translated by Colebrocke, also the Bhdshya 
of Gaudapada, translated by H. H. Wilson, Oxford, 1837; 
Celebreeke, “Essays,” i. 245. Most of the quotations 
given by Alberuni are feund only slightly differing in 
Gaudapdda, and some agree literally, as I shall point out 
in the notes to the single passages. Almost all the illus- 
trative tales mentioned by Alberuni are found in Gauda- 
pada, being, as a rule, more extensive in Alberuni than in 
Gaudapida. The latter seems to have taken his inferma- 
tion from a work near akin te, or identical with, that 
Sdirkhya book which was used by Alberuni. 

According te Colebrooke (in the preface of the work 
just mentioned, en p. xiii), Gandapada was the teacher of 
Sarnkara Acdrya, whe is said to have lived in the eighth 
Christian century. Cf. alse A. Weber, Vorlesungen, pp. 
179, 254, and 260: Alberuni does not mentien Gaudapada, 
as faras [can see. Or is he perhaps identical with Gauda 
the anchorite, whom Aiberuni mentions even before Kapila ? 
Cf. the passage, i. 131-132: “ Besides, the Hindus have 
books, &c.,on the process of becoming Ged and seeking 
liberation from the world, as, ¢g. the book composed by 
Ganda the ancherite, which goes by his name.” 

Kapila, the father ef the Samkhya philosophy, is men- 
tioned by Alberuni also as the author ef a book called

I understand the passage 9s <b yell azo, (\*, 11, 12) as 
meaning the prohibition of the study (not discussion, as T 
have translated, which would be 5bt-s5') of a subject, t.¢. 0 
question of a religious bearing; but I am not aware what 
particular event the author hints at by these words. At 
the intolerant religious policy of the Khalif Alkddir ? 
King Mahmiid was a great Ketzerrichter. Probably a stont 
adherent of the theory of the harmony of throne and altar, 
which his contemporaries Al-‘Utbi (in his preface) and 
Alberani (i. 99) call éwins, he tried to cover the illegitimate, 
revolutionary origin of his dynasty, which was still fresh 
in the memory of the men of the time ; he maintained the 
most loyal relations with the spirittal head of Islam, the 
Khalif of Bagdad, Alk&dir (a.n. 381-422), who had clad 
the usurpation of hia family with the mantle of legitimacy ; 
and in order to please him, he hunted down the heretics 
in his realm in Khorasan as in Multan (¢f. Reynolds, L 1, 
p. 438 seq.), impaling or stoning them. He tried to rid

the Khalif of the real or suspected votaries of his oppo- 
nent, the Anti-Khalif in Egypt, the iamous Hakim, famous 
by his madness and by being considered by the Druzes as 
the originator of their creed. The religious policy of Msh- 
mifid may be retraced to the following principles :— 

(1.) Perfect toleration for the Hindus at his court and in 
his army. 

(2.) Persecution of certain Muslim sectarians in the 
interest of the Khalif, of the Karmatians and other sects 
of Shiitic tendencies, (Cf. A. von Kremer, Geschichte der 
herschenden Ideen des Islam, Leipzig, 1868, p. 127.) 

(3.) Predilection for a Muslim sectarian from Sijistan 
by the name of AbQ-Abdillah Ibn Alkiram, by whose 
influence both Sunnites and Shiites had to suffer (ef. 
Alshahrastdnt, p.*). How long the influence of this man 
had lasted, and how far his doctrines had been carried into 
practice, does not appear from Alshahrastant’s account. 

That, notwithstanding all this, there was a larce margin 
for liberty of religious thought under the rule of Mahmfid 
and his immediate successor, is sufficiently illustrated by 
the tenor of Alberuni’s worl: - Altogether, it must be 
. kept in mind that before Alghuszali the Muslim Church 
was not that conceutrated organisation nor that all-over- 
whelming force which it has been ever since and keeps up 
iu our days. To those who only know the centuries of 
Muslim history after the establishment of the orthodox 
Church, it sounds next to incredible that the military chief 
of a Khalif should have been an infidel (2 Zoroastrian 7)

tas Téyvas, ed, Abrah. Willet, Lugduni Bat., 1812, chap. ix.

The two passages on p. 36 are probably taken from the 
Protrepticus too. With the former compare the words in 
chap. ix. (on p. 22 editio Kiihn, vol. i): Ei & ov é@éreus 
éyo08 mreiOecbat, Toy ye Oeov aidéobyre Tov ITvgov. 

Shortly afterwards follows the second quotation, verses 
quoted by Galen from Herodotus, i. 65: 


“Hees, & Avndepye, €uov worl miova voy.

P. 35. Plato.—he author quotes the following works 
of Plato :-— 

(1.) Phedo. 

(2.) Timeus (cf. also Proclus), 

(3.) Leges. 

Of the three quotations on this passage, the middle one 
is found in Timeus, 41A:—Eme & ody mdvres x. 7. X,

The first and third quotations are not found in the Greek 
text, and Ed. Zeller, to whom I applied for help, thinks 
that both aro taken from a commentary on Zimaus by 
some Christian author, as eg. Johannes Philoponus, the 
former having been derived from 40D (aepl 8¢ Tay GAY 


272 ALBERUNT'S INDIA. 


Sarudveor eiwrety cal yrdvas Ti yéveow x.7.d.), the latter 
from passages like 32B and 92. 

The index of the works of Johannes Philoponus er Scho- 
lasticus (Steinschneider, 4l-Fdrdbdi, p. 152 seg.) does not 
mention a commentary on Timeus, if it is not concealed 
under the title of one of his books, daily eg! 05, tLe. On 
existing and perishing. As he was a literary opponent of 
Nestorins, he seems to have been a strict Monophysite, 
which would be in keeping with the third quotation, “God 
is in the single number,” &c. €/. the note to pp. 56, 57. 


P. 36. Johannes Grammaticus (identical with J. Philo- 
pouus and Scholasticus) is five times quoted, There are 
three extracts from his Refutatio Procli, and two more, the 
origin of which is not mentioned, but probably taken from 
the same book. The passage here mentioned is found in 
Joannis Grammatici Philopont Alevandrini contra Proclum 
de Mundi eternitate, libri xviii, Venetiis, 1551, Greek and 
Latin, in the 18th Adyos, chap. ix. (there is no pagination ; 
of. the Latin trauslation, p. 95) :—

I have’ not succeeded in identifying the other four 
quotations, i. 65, 226, 231, 284. Cf. on this author, Fihrist, 
p. 254, and Dr. Steinschneider, Alfardbi, pp. 152, 162. 


P. 37. Baal.—The form of the word 3# (Syriac Tso) 
shows that the Arabic Bible-text which Alberuni used had 
been translated from Syriac. 


P. 39. Mant.—Vide note to pp. 7, 8 

P. 40. Gitdé—Cf. with these words ‘the Bhagavad-Gita 
(of J. Davies), xv. 14, 15 -— 

“ Entering into the earth, I sustain all things by my 
vital force, and becoming a savoury juice, I nourish all 
herbs (v. 14). 

“TI become fire, and enter into the bodies of all that 
breathe, &c. And I am seated in the hearts of all: from 


ANNOTATIONS. 273 


Me come memory, knowledge, and the power of reason,” 
&o. (v. 15). 

Davies supposes the whole of verse 15 to be an interpo- 
lation, but this remark mnst, as it seems, be limited to the 
final sentence of verse 15 only, 4c. to the words: “I form 
the Vedanta, and I am one who knows the Vedas.” 


P. 40. Apollonius —A Greek book of Apollonius of 
Tyana of this title is not known to me, but it exists in 
Arabic, Jlatt b wbS (Lider de Causis), in the library of 
Leyden, cf. Wenrich, De Auctorum Gracorum Versionibus 
et Commentariis Syriacis, Arabicts, &c., p. 239. 


Pp. 40-44.—The Samkhya doctrine of the twenty-five 
tattvas is found in the commentary of Gaudapdda to the 
Samkhya Karika of tévara Krishna, where also the saying 
of Vyasa (here i. 44 and 104) is found. Cf the translation 
of H. H. Wilson, p. 79, i. 14. 


P. 40. Buddha, dharma, saiigha.—This note on the 
Buddhistie trinity probably rests on the authority of 
Zurkin, as he was quoted in the book of Hrdnshahri : ef. 
note to pp. 6, 7. It shows that Alberuni had no original 
information regarding Buddhism, and it justifies his harsh 
judgment on the worth of the tradition of Zurk4n, », i, 7. 

The name #uddhodana is nothing, and by mistake 
derived from Suddhodana, the name of Buddha's father. 
Perhaps Zurkin had read not gy24 but g25,~, which 
would be Sauddhodani, ie. the son of Suddhodana or 
Buddha. 


P. 41. Padyu Puréna.—Of the Purdnas the author had 
the Aditya, Matsya, and Vayu Purdnas, i.e. only portions 
of them (i, 130), and probably the whole of Vishnu- 
Purdna. Most of bis Pauranic quotations are taken from 
Vayu, Vishnu, and Matsya Purdnas. Cf. on the Puranas, 
A. Weber, Vorlesungen, p. 206, aud note 206 on p. 208. 


P. 42.—The jive mothers are a blunder of the anthor’s 
instead of the five measures, i.e, paticamdtrani (paiicatan- 
mdirdnt).

as it is given here and on p. 43, also occurs in the VaiSe-

shika—philosophy of Kanda: ¢f: Colebrooke, “ Essays,” i. 
293 eg. Compare also Vishnu-Purdna, i, 2, p. 35, and Halle 
note 1. There are similar elements in the philosophy of 
the Banddhas or Saugatas: v. Colebrooke, fc. i. 416, 417. 


P, 42.—The quotation from Homer is not found in the 

. Greek text, nor do I know the Greek original of the second 

verse. Were they taken from some Neo-Pythagorean 
book ? 


P. 43. Porphyry.—This is the only quotation from Por- 
phyry, from a book of his which is not extant in the Greek 
original. According to Wenrich, lc p. 287, there has 
once been in Syriac a translation of the fourth book of a 
Liber Historiaruwm Philosophorum, probably identical with 
the work here mentioned. The note on the Milky Way 
(i. 281) is perhapa taken from this same source. 


‘P. 43. Lacuna.—In the Arabic text (\\, 15) is missing 
the relation between the hearing and the air, the comple- 
ment to the words hearing airy in L 14. 


P. 43. Plato—As the author does not mention the 
source whence he took these words, I conjecture that they 
were derived from Timeus, 77, A, B, or from some commen- 
tary on this passage: ¢f. note to p. 35. 


P. 45. Aatres simplices—Cf note to p, 42. On the 
Simkhya theory regarding the union of soul and matter,

v. 21).

P. 49. The soul is in matter, &c.—The soul compared to 
@ charioteer, v. in Gaudapada, p. 66 to v. 17. 


Pp. §2-54. Vdsudeva speaks to Arjuna, déc.—Of these 
quotations trom Géid, compare the passage, “ Eternity is 
common to both of us, &c., whilst they were concealed 
from you,” with Bhagavad-Gitd, iv. 5: “ Many have been in 
past time the births of me, and of thee also, Arjuna. All 
these I know, but thou kuowest them not, O slayer of foes!” 

Of the other quotations on these two pages, I do not 
see how they could be compared with any passage in 
Bhogavad-Gitd, except for the general tenor of the ideas. 
With the phrase, “ For he loves God and God loves him,” 
ef. Bhagavad-Gitd, xii, 14-20, “ Who worships me is dear 
to me.” 


P. 54. Vishnu-Diharma.—Alberuni gives large quota- 
tions from this book. He speaks of it i. 132, and trans- 
lates the title as the religion of God. 

I do not know the Sanskrit original of the book, for it 
is totally different from the Vishnw-Smriti, or Vishnu- 
Sitra, or Vaishnava Dharmasdstra, translated by J. Jolly 
(“ The Institutes of Vishnu,” Oxford, 1880), a law-book in 
a hundred chapters, similar to those of Apastamba, YAjna- 
valkya, Vasishtha, the Grilyasitras, &c. Our Vishnu- 
Dharma is a sort of Purana, full of those lezends and 
notions characteristic of the literature of Puranas; but 
the author does not assign it to them. Most of the ex- 
tracts here given are conversations between the sage 
Markandeya and Vajra, others a conversation between the 
king Pariksha and the sage Satiuika, The extracts treat 
of mythological subjects (i. 54); the twelve suns (i. 216, 
217); the pole (i 241); the planets and fixed stars (1. 287, 
288) ; star-legends (i, 291); the story of Hiranydlsha (ii. 
140); the names of the Manvantaras (i. 387); the domi- 
nants of the planets (ii. 121); in particular, of chrono- 
logical and astronomical subjects. The author has taken 
several series of names from the Visinu-Dharma. He 


276 ALBERUNPS INDIA. 


seems to quote it sometimes without mentioning its title. 
So, eg. Iam inclined to attribute the traditions of Saunaka 
(i. 113, 126) to this book. The qnotation (ii. 398) on 
Vasndeva, Sarhkarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, as 
the names of Hari in the four Vugas, is found likewise 
amoug the doctrines of the Vaishpava sect, the Paficaré- 
tras, or Bhagavatas : cf. Colebrooke, “ Essays,” i. 439, 440. 
Vishnn is the chief god af those Hindus with whom 
Alberuni held relation. Were they Vaishnava sects, and 
was the Vishnu-Dhkarma a special code of theirs? On 
the heterodox sect of Vishnu or Vasudeva worshippers 
just mentioned, ¢f. Colebrooke, ic. pp. 437-443. 

Colebrooke mentions a book, Visinu-Dharmottara- 
Purdna, which is said to have comprehended the Brahma- 
aiddhauta of Brahmagupta: ef. “ Essaya,” ii, 348. This 
work is perhaps identical with the Vishnu-Dharma used 
by Alberuni, As he had a copy of the Brahmasiddhdnta, 
he had it perhaps as a portion of this larger work. 


P. 54. Lakshmt, who produced the Amrita.—For the 
legend of Lakshmi v. Vishnu-Purdna, i, 9, where it is 
Dhanvantari who brings the Amrita-cup, not Lakshmi. 
Apparently this goddess is meant here, and not Lakshmana, 
aa the manuscript bas it, the brother of Rima When 
Alberuni wrote this, he seems to have mistaken Lakshmt 
for a masculine being, or else we must write 4e;a in the 
text tv, 3, instead of si. 

The Arabic hand’a (= aitsance, félicit¢) is an attempt of 
Alberuni’a to translate the Sanskrit amrita—ambrosia, 
which scarcely any one of his readers wili have understood. 
Cf. the Arabic text, '", 6 (here i. 253). 


P. 54. Daksha, who was beaten by Mahddeva.—Cf. the 
story of the destruction of Daksha’s sacritice by order of 
Siva, as communicated by Hall in his edition of Wilson’s 
Vishnu-Purdna as appendix to i. viii. p. 120 seq. (Sacrifice 
of Daksha, from the Véyu-Purdna). 


P. 54. Vardkamihira.—Of this author Alberuni quotes 
the following works :— 

(1.) Brihatsamnhid, 

(2.) Brthaydtakam, i 158, 219, 220, ii 118. 


ANNOTATIONS. 277 


(3.) Laghusdiakam, i. 158. 
(4.) Paftcasiddhantikd, i. 153, ii. 7, 190. 

Books of the eame author, which Alberani mentiona 
without giving extracts from them, are Shatpanedsika and 
<57@ et yy@ (2), both with astrelogical contents (i. 158). 
Perhaps the two books called Vogaydtré and Tikant (?)- 

dird (i. 158) are also to be attributed to Varahamihira. 

ides there are mentioned several commentaries, one of 

the Brihat-Samhitd by Utpala, from Kashmir (i. 298), 
and one of the Brihajdtakam by Balabhadra. 

One of the sources whence Alberuni has drawn most 
copiously is the Brikat-Samhid, or, as he calle it, the 
Samhita: v. the edition, of the Sanekrit original by Dr. 
Kern, Calentta, 1865, and his tranelation in the “ Journal 
of the Royal Asiatic Society” for the years 1870, 1871, 
1873, 1875. Alberuni praises Varihamihira as an honest 
man of science (i. 366), and maintains that he lived 526 
years before his own time, which is a.D. 1030. Accord- 
ingly, the date of Varihamihira would be aD. 504. Cf 
ii, 86. 


In the preface to the edition, p. 61, Kern mentions the 
Shatpaiicdsikd and the Yogaydird, Both the Brihat-Sam- 
hitd and Laghujdtakam had heen translated into Arabic 
by Alberuni. 

The passage here (p. 54) quoted is found in chap. iii. 
v. 13-15 (“Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,” 1870, 


Pp. 446).

the following :—

words (“Our souls lead an existence of their own,” &c.) 
cannot be combined with the Greek text, and I auppose 
they were taken from some commentary. 

The second quotation is found 

72E. Gre nui 1) wadOnots oun Ao Ts f} avayvynows THyyaves

In some sentences the Arabic and Greek texts agree 
literally; in others they differ to such an extent that this 
extract, too, does not seem to be taken from a simple trans- 
lation of the text of Phado, but rather from a work in 
which text and commentary were mixed together, and the 
original form of a dialogue was changed into that of a 
aimple relation. Alberuni erroneously held this to be the 
original form of the book. We have arrived at a similar 
result in the case of Plato’s Timaus. 

Proclus has composed a commentary on the saying of 
Plato that the soul is immortal, in three sections : ». Wen- 
rich, De Auctorum Grecorum Versionibus, &., p. 288; and 
Zeller, Philosophie der Griechen, iii. 6, 780,1. Thia was 
probably an Arabic edition of Phado, and possibly that 
one which Alberuni used. Cf. note to p. 35. 

The qnotationa from Phedo given farther on (pp. 65-67) 
agree more accurately with the Greek origi but in 
them, too, the dialogistic form bas disappeared. 


P. 57. Proclus is twice quoted, here and i. 86. Both 
extracts seem to be derived from some commentary on 
Timeus, which was different from that commentary known 
in onr time and edited by Schneider, Breslau, 1887. The 
words here mentioned probably refer to Timeaus, 44 ABC :—

ANNOTATIONS, 279 


The commentary of Proclus referring to these words 
(pp. 842, 843, ed. Schneider) is entirely different from the 
Arabic words. 

The other quotation (i. 86) is derived from the same 
book, and refers to Timaus, 44D:—eis o ides copa 
evednoay, todro 8 viv xehadip errovopalopev, 0 Gedtatoy T 
€or) xai Tay ev nes travr@y Seavrotoup, «.7.d. 

The commentary of Proclus (ed. Schneider) breaks off a 
little before this passage, at the beginning of 44D. 

I am inclined to believe that the work, simply intro- 
duced by “ Proclus says,” is identical with that one which 
he calls Timarus (cf. note to page 35), a work which was— 

(1.) Not a simple translation of the book, but a transla- 
tion and a commentary together, the one running into the 
other; and which 

(2.) Was ditierent from the now extant commentary of 
Timeeus by Proclus. Therefore Proclus must either have 
made two editions of Zimeus, or he is not really the author 
of the book used by Alberuni. In the one place the name 
is written (~U,y, in the other -ld,z1. 


P. 57.—The seat (f\) and the throne (.»%) of God. 
By these two words Muhammad calls the throne of God 
in the Koran, Allah's sitting on his throne, as mentioned 
in the Koran, has been a subject of deep speculation among 
Moslim theologians. Cf Zur Geschichte Abulhasan Al- 
Aésari’s, von W. Spitta, Leipzig, 1876, pp. 106, 107, and 
the note on p. 144. 


P. 60. Vishnu-Purdna.—tThe passage is found in Book 
II. chap. vi. (Wilson-Hall, ii. p. 216). The order in

P. 68. Ignorance, knowledge. —Cf. Sdirkhya Karikd, v. 
44, “By knowledge is deliverance; by the reverse, bond- 
age.” 


PB. 69. These eight things, &c.—Cf. the Commentary of 
Bhojaraja to “The Yoga Aphorisms of Pataijali,” &c., v. 
xlv., also Gaudapiida’s Bhdshya to the Sdmkhyd Karika, 
v. xxiii (pp. 83, 84), where he quotes the work of Patai- 
jali (Patafijela). 


P. 69. Passing through several stages—Cf. with these 
four stages of knowledge the “seven kinds of enlightenment” 
‘in “The Yoga Aphorisms,” ii. v. xxvii., and Commentary. 


284 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


The fourth stage of Alberuni’s Pataijali corresponds to the 
seventh kind of Bhojadeva. 


P. 70. In the book Gttd—There is no passage like this 
in the Bhagarad-Gitd, The words, “pleasures which in 
reality are pains” (p. 71, 6), may be compared with 
Bhagavad-Giid, v. 22: “For the pleasures that are born 
of (these) contacts are the wombs of pain.” 

A similar sentence recurs in another quotation from 
Gttd here on p. 78,1, pen: “ Pleasures of a kind which, in 
reality, are disguised pains.” 


P. 71. Socrates.—The following quotation is composed 
of the two passages, Phedo, 65 B-pD and 674 :—

The words s dive ese (T*, 8) are barbaric Arabic= 
tore eCavatarat on’ atrov. Probably the Syriac transla- 
tion had a passive word with owso= én’ avurod, and this 
waa literally rendered in Arabic by 4. The reading of 
the MS, 4«« cannot be accounted for in any way. 


ANNOTATIONS. 285 


P. 71. From the book Gtid.—The text is not found in the 
Bhagavad-Gitd. 


P.72. Kapila, for he was born knowing.—Cf. Colebrooke, 
_ “Egsays,” i, 242. — 


P. 72. Cupidity, wrath, and ignorance—‘ The Yora 
Aphorisms,” ii. 3 seg., mention five affictions: ignorance. 
egoigm, desire, aversion, and ardent attachment to life. 
Perhaps we may also compare Sdmkhya Karikd, v. |xiii., 
where seven modes are enumerated by which nature binds 
herself: virtue, dispassionateness, power, vice, ignorance, 
passion, and weakness, 


P. 73.—The three primary forces are rajas, tamas, sattva. 


P. 73. To stop all motions, and even the breathing.—Cf. 
on the stoppage of motion and the expulsion and retention 
of breath, “Yoga Aphorisms of Patafjali,” i, xxxiv., aud 
the notes of Rajendralala Mitra. 


P. 73. In the book Gitd.—The two quotations as given 
here are not found in the Bhagavad-Gtid. Only the com- 
parison with the lamp occurs in vi, 19: “As a lamp 
sheltered from the wind does not flicker;” this is 
the wonted simile of the Yogin who is subdued in 
thonght,” &e. 

Also the comparison with the waters of the rivers not 
increasing the ocean is found ii, 70: “He attains to 
peace into whom all desires enter as rivers enter into the 
ocean, which is ever filled, and (yet) remains within its 
bounds,” &c. 


P. 74. The following nine rules—Five of these command- 
ments are mentioned in “The Yoga Aphorisms,” ii. xxx., 
and the other four seefh to be identical with the five 
obligations mentioned in ii. xxxii. 


P. 75,—Pythagoras.—I do not know the Greek original 
of this saying. ‘The idea of the body being a fetter to the 
soul is uently met with in the book of the Neopytha- 
gorean philosophers, as Apollonius of Tyana and others ; 


286 ALBERUNI'S INDIA. 


éf. Zeller, Philosophie der Gricchen, iii. 2, p. 156. For two 
more sentences of Pythagoras, v. iL p. 85, where Alberuni 
states that he has taken them from Ammonius, ». note to 


p. 35. 


P. 75. The book Sdinkhya says—It is difficult to say 
whether the Arabic manuscript has 4éle or 42, and not 
knowing a Sanskrit parallel to this saying, I am thrown 
upon conjecture. Preferring the latter reading, I trans- 
late: “Everything which man opines (ie. on which he 
forms an opinion) is a terminus to him, for he does not go 
beyond it,” which may mean that as long as the thinking 
faculty of soul has not ceased, it is not liberated, has 
not attained moksha. Cf. Sdirkhya Kdrikd, v. lxviii.: 
“When separation of the informed soul from its corpo- 
real frame at length takes place, and nature in respect 
of it ceases, then is absolute and final deliverance accom- 
plished.” 


Pp. 75, 76. Gttd.—The three quotations from this book 
are not found in the Bhagavad-Gitd. 


P. 76. Socrates.—The quotations given here are found 
in Pheedo, 84-858 :—

In the middie a passage has been left out by Alberuni, 
or by the author of that edition of Phado which he used. 


P. 76. In the book of Patafiyjali.—To the explanation of 


ANNOTATIONS. 287 


the four parts of the path of liberation on pp. 76-80 I do 
not know a parallel from a Sanskrit source, 


P. 77. In the book Vishnu-Dharma—Cf. on this the 
note to p. 54. The Arabio text has not Parikshit, but 
Pariksha, which name is mentioned by Hall in a note to 
Vishnu-Purdna, iv., chap. xx. p. 154. 


Pp. 78,79. The book Gitd4—These three extracts are not 
found in the Bhagavad-Gitd. The words, “He who mor- 
tifies his Inst,” &., compare with Bhagavad-Gitd, iv. 21, 
“Void of hope, self-restrained in thought, performing 
inerely bodily work, he contracts no sin.” Regarding the 
passage, “ Pleasures of a kind which, in reality, are dis- 
guised pains,” v. note to p. 70. 

The expression, the nine doors of thy body (p. 79, 8), is 
also found in Bhagavad-Gitd, v. 13: “in the city of nine 
gates,” ic. in the body. Cf also Sdaikhya Kdrikd, v. 
XXXY, 


Pp. 79, 80. The book Gitd.—These quotations cannot be 
compared with anything in the Bhagavad-Citd. 


P, 81. Patafijali—There is a certain resemblance be- 
tween these words and the last of “ The Yoga Aphorisms ” 
(iv. xxxviii.): “Isolation is the regression of the qualities 
devoid of the purpose of soul, or it is the abiding of the 
thinking power in its own nature.” 


Pp. 81, 82. Sdskhya—The comparison with the wheel 
of the potter (not the silk-weaver) is also found in 
Sdinkhya Karikd, v. \xvii. 


P, 82. In the book of Pataiyali.—I have not found these 
two passages anywhere else. As to the faculties of the 
perfect Yogin, ¢f. “ Yoga Aphorisms,” iii. 42, 44, 45. 


P. 83. The Saft explain the Koranic verse, &e.—Being 
asked about the story of Dhulkarnaini (Bicornutus, i. 
Alexander), Muhammad says, “ We (ie. Allah) have made 
room for him on earth; ” or, as Sale translates, “ We stab- 
lished for him on earth,” which means, We have given him

@ position of well-established authority or on earth, 
and this authority or power is faverpestea by | Safi com- 
mentators in accordance with their tenets, perfectly har- 
monising with those of the Yoga philosophy. 


Pp. 83, 84. Sdmkhya.—With the tale of the men tra- 
‘yelling in the night with bis pupils compare a similar one 
in Gaudapida's Bhdshya to Sdmkhya Kdrikd, v, xxx, (on 
p. 106). 


P. 85.-~—Ammonius, a philcsopher of the Neoplatonic 
school, v. Zeller, Phtlosophie der Gricechen, iii.c. 829 8c. 
A Greek Wook of his which contains these extracts from 
Pythagoras and Empedocles is not known. He has been 
known to the Arabs as commentator of Aristotle: v. Wen- 
rich, De Auctorum Grecorum Versionibus, p. 289; Fibrist, 


Pp. . 

By Heracles in ne pee “ Empedocles and his suc- 
cessors as far as Heracles,” is probably meant Heraciides 
Ponticus. 


Pp. 85, 86. Socrates says—The first extract is identical 
with Phedo, 79D, the second is composed of 8oB, 804A, 
8148, the order of the Greek text having been aban- 
doned.

sentences are found in Bhagavad-Gitd, vi. 28-31, describ- 
ing the union of the soul with Brahman, 


Pp. 87, 88.—-On Abi-Bakr Ash-shibli ¢f. Ibn Khallikan, 
translated by De Slane, i. 511-513; Abulmahdsin, Annales, 
ii. 313. He lived in Bagdad, was a pupil of Junaid, died 
A.H. 334>=4.D. 946, in Bagdad, and was buried there. Ou 
Abfi-Yazid Albistimi cf. Ibn Khallikan, nr. 311. He 
died 4.H. 261=A.D. 875. Jamt has articles on these two 
mystics with many quotations from them in his Nafahdt- 
al'uns (Leo’s “ Persian Series,” the Nafahdt-alons, &c., or the 
Lives of the Soofis, by Jami, Calcutta, 1859, pp. 201 and 62).

puting among yourselves (the one throwing the blame 
on the other), whilst God was bringing to light what 
you concealed, then we spoke: Beat him (the killed per- 
son) with part of her (the killed cow mentioned in the 
preceding”). In that case the killed person will again 
me alive and tell who murdered him. “Thus God 
brings to life the dead ones,” &e. Cf. A. Geiger, Was hat 
Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen? Bonn, 
1833, p. 172. Muhammad has moulded this part of 
Sira z from elements taken directly or indirectly from 
Numb. xix. 2 sqg., and Deut. xxi. 2 seg. 
The Sufies try to show by this sentence that the body 
must be mortified before the heart can become alive by 
wyatic knowledge.

author means saumya = .s*y~, but it would have been 
better to write py~ in accordance with #15 = daitya. As 
all the other words of this ennmeration stand in the sin- 
gular, it is not allowable to read this word in a plural

P. 90. In the book Gitd.—The first quotation on the

xiv. 6-8 seg.

P. 96. Europe, the daughter of Phenix, &e—In_ tho 
source whence the author drew his information about 
Greek legends, Greek, Hebrew, and Persian traditions seem 
to have been mixed together. It was synchronistic like 
the Chronicon of Eusebius, with which it is nearly re- 
lated (note to p. 105), comparing the dates of Greek his- 
tory with those of the Biblical and Persian history. Julius 
Africanus and Ensebius are the fathers of this kind of 
literature, but I do not know by whom the book which 
Alberuni used had been composed. Cf. Lusebi ehronicorum 
canonum que supersunt, ed, A. Scheene, ii. p. 13 (Zeus), 
26 (Cecrops), 32, 34 (Asterius); also the Syriac Epitome,

P. 97. Aratus—The author quotes the Phanomena and 
a commentary to them, which exhibits certain relations 
with the scholia edited by Immanuel Bekker, but is not 
identical with them. As I learn from my colleague, Pro- 
fessor C. Robert, this commentary is to be combined with 
the Catasteriemi of Pseudo-Eratosthenes, 

The first quotation from Aratus is v. 1 seq.

are well known, called Sanddlia by Ibn Khurdidhbih 
(Elliot, “ History of India,” i 16). The Hadis and Dom 
are mentioned hy Colebrooke, “ Essays,” ii, “ Enumeration 
of Indian Classes,” p. 169, note 3. On the latter (cf, Rom, 
the naive of the gipsies), v. “Memoirs on the History, 
Folk-lore, and Distribution of the Races,” &c., by Elliot, 
edited hy Beames, London, 18669, i: p. 84. Are the Bad- 
hatau identical with the Bediyds, mentioned in the note 
of Colebrooke just quoted ? 


P. 103. Vasudeva answered.—The first quotation from 
Gita is *aentical with Bhagavad-Gitd, xviii. 41-45; the 
second is similar to ii. 31-38.

P. 104. Vdsudeva.—This quotation from Giidé much 
resembles Bhagavad-Gtid, ix. 32, 33. 


P. 105. Minos.—I cannot acquit the book on ancient 
history which Alberuni used of the blunder of having 
split the Minos of Greek traditions into two persons, a 
Minos and a Mianos (sic). Cf. on this source note te p. 96.

P. 116. Jalam Ibn Shaibén.—The pronunciation of the 
former name is conjectural, the history of this Karma- 
tian chief nnknown. The expedition of King Mahmid 
against Multén took place A.D. 1006, in the ninth year of 
his rule, the seventh year of his nsurpation of sovereignty, 
in which he had left out the name of his SAmani liege- 
lord on the coins and in the public prayer, and had received 
the investiture, a robe and a title, from the source of all 
legitimacy in the Muslim world, the Khalif AlkAdir, the 
great enemy and persecutor of the Karmatians. Cf. on 
this expedition Elliot, “ History of India,” ii. p, 441.

As Alberuni gives but 216,432 years, it seems he has 
omitted by inadvertence the cipher 1 (Schram). 


P. 117, 1. 7.—The above snpposition is confirmed by this 
passage; it ought to be the 132 years instead of the 432 
years. One can consider 132 years as a kind of arbitrary 
equivalent for the snm of about 100 years, but 432 years 
cannvt be an equivalent for about 100 years (Schram).

P. 126. Vasukra.—This reading does not quite accu-

tioned in the St. Petersburg Dictionary as the name of a 
man who occurs in the Veda as a poet of Vaidic hymns. 


P. 127. Galenus.—The quotation from Galenus must be

tion of the four pdthas, padapdtha, kramapétha, &e. Cf. 
Colebrooke, “ Essays,’ i. 18. 


P. 128. Kdndin.—The word <s/\5 evidently refers to the 
divisions of the Yajurveda called kandiii. “The text of 
the Yajurveda is composed of Kénri, and its name (the 
name of Yajurveda? what name of it?) is derived from it 
(from kdnré ?), 4c. the collection (or totality) of kdnré.” It 
does not. appear which one of the names of Yajurveda is 
here meant by the author as having been derived from 


ANNOTATIONS. 299 


kdnrt. Ia there a name of Yajurveda like hdndika or 
kéndin, meaning consisting of kandtkds ? 

In kdnri=kandikd the cerebral @ is rendered by an 
Arabic 7, a3 in S kudava, whe vyddi, y garuda, 9 
dravida, s6 nddi, 98 vinddi, eye vaiddrya, &. The 
termination in long 4 seems to be characteristic of the 
vernacular form of Indian speech, and is probably a sur- 
vival of the more ancient termination tka, ikd. Cf R. 
Hornle, “ Comparative Grammar of the Gaudian Lan- 


guages,” § 195, 203, 205. 


P. 128. Ydjnavalkya—Cf. Vishnu-Purdna, book iii. 
chap. v. 


P. 129. The well-known story.—It is told by Alberuni 
himself, i. p. 396. 


P. 131. Vishnu-Purdna.—This index of the Puranas 
occurs in book iit, chap. vi. p. 66, 67. In the Arahic 
text 4, 12, read yy instead of »,5. 


P. 131. Smriti.—The author erroneously calls it a book. 
It is the literature on law, and the twenty sons of Brahman 
here mentioned are authors of Dharmaédstras. Cf. on smite 
(opp. éruét), Colebrooke, “ Essays,” i. 337, 466; A. Weber, 
Vorlesungen, p. 296, note 327; Indische Studien, 1. 232. 

Alberuni sometimes quotes the book Smriti. However, 
he had not the book himself, but transferred those quota- 
tions from the Brahmasiddhdnta of Brahmagupta. In 
reality it is the latter author who quotes it. As, according 
to him, the book smriti was eomposed by Manu (v. here 
ii, 110, 111), he means the Dkarmasgastra of Manu. This 
law code is only once clearly referred to by Alberuni (ii. 
164), but in a manner which makes me think that it was 
not in his hands. On Manu, as the author of the great 
Ménasa (a work on astronomy and astrology ?),v. p. 157.

no relation to the NyAya philosophy or logical system of 
Gautama (cf. Colebrooke, “ Essaya,” i, 280), but are clearly 
identical with the Mim&zhs4 philosophy of Jaimini, whois 
here mentioned a few linea farther on. However, Ido not 
know another mode of reading the word. That Kapila 
was the author of such a work does not seem to be known. 

Mimdriisd.— Cf. Colebrooke, “ Essays,” i, 319. In oppo- 
aition to Kapila, Jaimini teaches that the Veda ia primeval 
and superhuman. Thia theory and the discussiona through 
which it has passed are also found in the history of Isiam 
applied to the Koran. According to Islam, the Koran 
teo is primeval and superhuman. 

Laukdyata: read Lékayata.—It is the materialiatic doc- 
trine of the Carvaka sect that perception alone is a meana 
of proof. C7. G. A. Jacob, “ Manual of Hindu Pantheism,” 
Vedantasira, p. 74; Colebrooke, “ Essays,” i. 426 s¢q., 456 
seq.; J. Muir, verses from the Sarva-daréana-sangraha, 
&c., illustrating the tenets of the Charvikas or Indian 
materialists,“ Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,” 1861, p. 
299, and “Journal of the German Oriental Society,” xiv. 5 19. 

Brihaspati is the founder of this achool; his sdtra is 
qnoted by Bhiskara-fcirya. The Bérhaspatyastiram is 
mentioned by A. Weber, Vorlesungen, p. 263. 


P. 132. Agastya—His doctrine is not known to me. 
Is it identical with that of the Jainas? C/. Colebrooke, 
“ Essays,” ii, 173. 

Vishnu-Dharma.— Vide note to p. 54. 


P. 132. Bharata, ie. Mahdbhdrata, which ia repeatedly 
mentioned by Albernni. Bhagavad-Gitd is a part of it 
(i 132). The story of the birth of Vasudeva and of his 
five brothers (i 401-406) is taken from Mahabharata. 

I am not quite certain whether Alberuni had a copy 
of the work. When giving quotationa from the book, he 
does not. mention it, which he probably would have done 
if he had had it in hand. 


P. 133.—With the index of the chapters of Mahabharata 
ef. Monier Williams, “ Indian Epic Poetry,” p. 91 seg. The 
list of Alberuni exhibits some remarkable differences. 


P. 135. Pdnini—The reading of the MS. is pdnriti, 


ANNOTATIONS. jor 


wy, which I cannot explain. If gpk pdariné is the cor- 
rect reading, we must remember that in the sound 2 there 
is an admixtnre of the sound r. So Hérnle, “Compara- 
tive Grammar,” p. 15, saya: “ The cerebral # contains the 
eound of r, being somewhat like rn.” In this way Albe- 
runi has transliterated the » in the word banzj, which he 
writes git barnty. Accordingly we should expect to find 
v}% pirnini, but the auther seems to have written ot 
panrini, 


P.135.—Theword «4%» = sishyahita,bas been deciphered 
by Prefessor Kielhorn, Gottingen. 


P, 136. Sdtardhana.—Other forms of the name are 
Sdlavdhana, Sdlivdhana (Hemacandya, i. 211); but Albe- 
runi clearly notes the pronunciation Samalvdhana, which 
is net known to me from other sources. 


P. 136—Instead of mdudakam read modakam = ma 
udakam. 


P. 136.—Abulaswad, &c., is, according to the literary 
tradition, the originator of their grammatical science, Cf 
G. Fliigel, Grammatische Schulen der Araber, p, 19 seq. 


P. 136. Chandas—lIn translating the chapter on metrits, 
I have derived much help from Colebrooke, “ Essays,” ii, 
p- §7 (on Sanskrit and Prakrit poetry), and from Weber's 
edition of the Sitras of Pitgala (Zndische Studien, vol. viii). 
Alberuni, however, seems to have used other sonrces and 
to have fcllowed another system, which has greatly in- 
creased the task ef the translator. 


P. 137. Pitgala—What are the Sanskrit forms of the 
names sly calitu, aun gaisitu, sid) auliydndu ? 

The chapter of Brahmagupta’s Brahkmasiddhdnta, of 
which the author here (p. 147-150) communicates a few 
extracts, is chap. xxi, On the calculation of the measures of 
poetry and on metrics, V. i. 155. 


P. 138.—Alkhalil, also mentioned i 147,18 in Arabic 
literature the father of the science of metrics. Cf G. 
Fliigel, Grammatische Schulen der Araber, p. 37. 

Sabab.—Cf. Freytag, Arabische Verskunst, p. 64, 65. 


303 ALBERONTS INDIA. 


P. 140. Madhya.—I do not know this term in Sanskrit, - 
and the signs 4 admit of different transliterations. Both 
the terme madhyd and madhu are used in metrical ter- 
minology, but with different meanings. C/ Colebrooke, 
“ Essaye,” ii, 141 (madhu), and ii, 136, 141 (madhyd), 


P. 141.—Harithafja ?—This name is not known to me 
as that of an author of a Jexicographical work The MS. 
clearly writes kariuddu, which may represent various 
other forms of Sanskrit names, 


P. 141.—The single letters m, y, r, &., denoting the 
single feet, are mentioned by Colebrooke, “ Essays,” i. 63. 


P. 142. Place the numeral 2, &c.—The rule, as explained 
in ll. 4, &c., differs from that one which is followed in 
the example (Il. 11-14), in so far as in the former place 
the subtraction of 1 (“and from the product (4) he sub- 
tracts 1") has been omitted. But even if we correct the 
text of the rule according to the exemplification, it cannot 
be correct, and we agree with Alberuni that something in 
the manuscript must have been wrong (also in the ge 
below, 11. 30-34). For it can be applied not to all eight 
feet, but only to two, viz, to 


|}< (2X 2=4—123xX2=6—1=5) 
and to 


|<] (2x 2~4—-173x2=6), 


i.¢. these two feet occupy respectively the fifth and sixth 
places in the arrangement on p. 141 (below), 


P. 143. The Greeks, too, &e.—The comparison with Greek 
metrics is unintelligible, as something must have been 
dropped in the Arabic text. 


P. 143- Consonant or syllaWe—I suppose the author 
meanseyliable. The Arabic word » has the same incon- 
venience as Sanskrit akshara of meaning both syllable and 
sound (mostly consonant). 


P. 143. Aryd.—This reading is a conjecture of mine, as 
the MS. has arai, which I cannot expiain. The descrip- 
tion given by the author seems to be applicable to the

Vardhamthira.— Vide note to p. 54. 


Pp. 153,154. Brakmagupta.—His work, the Brakma- 
siddhdnta, has been vary largely used by Alberuni. It 
exists in manuscript, but has not yet been completely edited 
or translated. Alberuni translated it into Arabic when he 
wrote the Indica (a.p. 1030), We do not know whether he 
ever finished it. 

Brabmagupta was only thirty years of age when he 


304 ALBERUN?I'S INDIA. 


wrote this work. He is accused af the sin against con- 
science of having propagated futilities and liea in order to 
please the bigoted priests and the ignorant rabble of his 
nation, in order to avoid those dangers in which Socrates 
perished. Vide chap. lix. on eclipses, and specially ii. 111. 
Besides, Alberuni accuses him of undue animosity against 
Aryabhata (i. 376). 

Brahmagupta halds a remarkable pie in the history 
of Eastern civilisation. It was he who taught the Arabs 
astronomy before they became acquainted with Ptolemy ; 
for the famous Sindhtind of Arabian literature, frequently 
mentioned, but not yet bronght to light, is a translation 
of his Brahmasiddhdnta ; and the only other book on 
Indian astronomy, called Alarkand, which they knew, was 
a translation of his Khana yaka. 

The latter work (here ii. 7) is also called Xaranakhan- 
dakhddyaka (i. 156). It was explained in s special com- 
mentary by Balabhadra (ii. 187). 

A third composition of Brahmagupta’s called Utiara- 
khandakhddyaka, is mentioned i. 156, and quoted ii. 87, 91. 

Cf. on Brahmagupta Colebrooke, “ Esssys,” ii. 409 seg. + 
Dr. Bhiu Daiji, “ Brief Notes on the Age and Authenticity 
of the Works of Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, 
&c.,” in the “Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,” 1865, 
vol. i. 392 seg. 

Notes from Vardhamihira’s Paiicasiddhantikd have been 
edited by G. Thibaut in the “Journal of the Asiatic 
Society of Bengal,” 1884, vol. liii. p. 259. 

Sindhind is mentioned ii, 191, as the only source of the 
information of Muslims on Indian astronomy and astrology. 
According to ii. 90, the Indian computation af the heliacal 
risings of the stars and the moon is identical with that 
given in Sindhind. It is called the great sindhind (Sid- 
dhdata) ii. 18. 

Alberuni has written a treatise on it. See preface to the 
Arabio edition, p. xx. 


P. 154. Pudise—This name and Paolisa are written 
Puliéa and Pauliga in Utpala’s commentary to the Samhitd 
of Varahamihira; but as Alberuni writes them constantly 
with s ys, not Ww, I am inclined to believe that he and 
his Pandits pronounced Pulisa and Paulise. Alberuni has

drawn from the Pulisasiddidnta almost as largely as from 
the Brahmasiddhkdnia, and was oceupied with translating 
it (v, also i. 375). 

The relation between Pulisa and Paulisa is this :— 

Fautisa is the sage who communicates his wisdom in 
this Siddhdnia. He was a native of Saintra, te. Alexandria. 

Pulisa is the redactor or editor of the book, The one 
as well as the other is called .JVg, Greek (not (sy, Byzan- 
tine Greek). |“ Pulisa says in his Siddhdnia that Paulisa 
the Greek had mentioned somewhere,” &c., i. 266. 

A commentator of this Siddhkdnta is mentioned i. 339 
med., where I now prefer to translate: ‘“‘ The commentator 
of the Stddhdnia of Pnlisa,” &. 

Pulisa quotes Paragara (ii. 208), and is himself quoted 
by Aryabhata jun. (i. 316). 

Paulisa is quoted by Brahmagupta, i. 374 (v. note). 

Cf. on the Pulisasiddhdnta H. Kern, The Brhat Sanhitd, 
preface, p. 48. 


_ P. 156.—Aryabhata senior is clearly distinguished from 
Aryabhata junior, who is mostly called “that one from 
Kusumapura,”1., Pataliputra (Patna), Alberuni knows him 
only through the quotations in the works of Brahmagupta. 
He mentions two of his works, Dagagitikd and Arydsh tasata, 
which have been edited hy Kern, Arya-bhattyam, 1874. 
Cf. Dr. Bhau Daji, “ Brief Notes on the Age and Authen- 
ticity of the Works of Aryabhata,” &c., p. 392. 


P. 1586. Balabhadra,—Oit his works are mentioned :-— 

(1.) A tanéra. 

(2.) A Savihitd. 

(3.) A commentary of the Brikajdtakam of Varahami- 
hira (p. 158). 

(4.) A commentary to the Kkandakhddyaka of Brahma- 
gupta. 

; (5.) He is supposed to be the author of the book Khan- 
dakhddyakatippa. 

Alberuni always calls him the commentator, and fre- 
quently quotes him without indicating from what particular 
book he quotes. He gives on his authority the latitude 
of Kanoj and Taneshar, and passes harsh judgment on 
him i. 244,275. Cf. also note to p. 27.

P. 156. Bhkdnwrajas (also on p. 1§7).—The Arabic MS, 
writes Bakdaarjus, which I cannot identify. A slight 
alteration (of (~ojle to u=vzie) would give Bidnuyasas, 
which name was suggested to me by G. Biihler. 


P. 156. Kira-babayd.—As kira means rice, let, babayd, 
must mean mountain. Is it a vernacular form for parvata? 


P. 156. Khanda-khdd: .—The MS, has tappd 
or tippd (tuppd), of which I do not know the Sanskrit 
form. \Y changed to wy would be = fippant or com- 
mentary. 

Vijayanandin.—Alberuni quotes from him a method for 
the computation of the longitude of a place (i. 313), a note 
on the dominants of year, month, and Sond (i. 343), on the 
circumpolar stars (ii. 90), an ahargana rule (ii, 49, 50). 
An astronomer of this name is mentioned by Dr. Bhau 
DA&ji as anterior to Srishena, the anthor of Romakasid- 
dhdnta: v.“The Age and Authenticity of the Works of 
Aryabhata,” &c. (“ Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,” 
' 1864), p. 408. 


P, 156. Bhadatta (? Mihdatta)—The MS, reads wg. 
Bhadatta is mentioned by Kern in the preface to his Brhat 
Sanhitd, p. 29. Alberuni quotes from the work of Vitte- 
évara a note on the motion of the Great Bear (i. 392), on 
the mean places of the stars (ii. 60), on the diameters of 
sun and moon (ii. 79), the latitude of Kashmir (i. 317), 
the era used in the book (ii 7). It must have been trans- 
lated into Arabic before Alberuni wrote the Jndica, because 
he complains that that part of the book which he had was 
badly translated (ii, 55).

The book-title rdhunrdkarana, i.e. breaking of the Ka-

P. 157. On Manu as an authority in astronomy and 
astrology, v. Kern, preface to Brhat Saiihitd, p. 42. Cf 
note to p. 131. 


P. 157. Puticala (?).—The author qnotes from him 6 
statement relating to the precession of the equinoxes; he 
apeaks highly of him, and says that a theory of his was 
adopted by Utpala (i. pp. 366, 367). 

I do not know of auch an Indian name, The nearest 
approach to it is Muda, that of an astronomer quoted 
by Colebrooke, “ Essays,” ii. 330, 332. 


P. 157. Bhadila (?).—The MS. has bahattal, and I snp- 
pose that the correct reading is Bhafjida. The name is 
perhaps a derivation (diminutive ?) from bhaf{a, as kumd- 
ria from kumdra, pushandhila from shandha. Alberuni 
quotes him, ii, 208, in the chapter on the yogas, 

On Pardéara and Garga ef. Kern, Brhat Sanhitd, preface, 
pp. 31, 33; on Satya, Jivagarman, p. 51; on Manittha, p.

Vorlesungen, p. 270. 


P. 158. Of Vardhamihira, &e—Thia author has com- 
posed not only the Shatpatcdsikd and Hordpaicahotriya (2), 
but also the Yogaydtrd, Tikantydtrd (1), and Vivdhapatala: 
v. Kern, Brhat Saithitd, preface, pp. 25, 26; his translation 
of the Yogaydtrd in Weber's Indische Studien, x. 161. 

The name of the author of the book on architecture is 
missing in the Arabic text. If it was not likewise a work 
of Varihamihira’s, it may have been composed by Nagnajit 
or Viévakarman: v, Kern, 2, ¢ p. 51. 


P, 158. Sridhava.—I do not know the corresponding 
Sanakrit form, It seems to be some relative of sruti. If 
Srutayas had currency in the meaning of traditions, I 
should identify it with srédhava, Ia it = grotarya? 

The word is the title of two different books, one by 
Utpala from Kashmtr (v. note to p. 157), and the one here 
mentioned, on omina and portenta, lucky and unlucky

days, &c. It probably contained the names of the twenty- 
four hord (i. 344); it mentioned the names of the third 
parts of the day (ii. 120), the names of the vish{i (ii. 201), 
the unlucky days of the year (ii. 192), the name of Vikram- 
Aditya (ii. 6, vide note to the place). 

The reading of the word J\“» as Bangdla is probably 
not correct. Is it = punyakdla ? 


P, 158. Gudhdmaaa (7), in the Arabic sérdman.—As the 
word is translated by wxknown, one thinks of a derivation 
of the word guh=to conceal (v. gédha). The Arabic 
characters may also be read cilddmant, If pragna fard- 
man (?) really meant what Alberuni says, one would expect 
gédhapragna. 


P. 158. Sangakila, Ptruvdaa—lI do not know the San- 
skrit equivalents of these two names. The former might 
be a word like ériakhala or ériagald (Syncellus?). Pritht- 
daka is the author of a commentary on the Brahmasid- 
dhdnta: v. Colebrooke, “ Essays,” ii 411. 


P, 159. Caraka.—The encient Arabic translation of his 
medical work is sometimes quoted hy Alberuni, and to 
judge from these quotations the translation was not free 
from blunders nor the manuscript-tradition free from the 
effects of carelessness: v. 2 quotation on weights, i. 162, 
163; one on the origin of medicine, i, 382. Gf. Weber,

P. 162. Caraka.-The Arabic translation of this book 
is not extant. The Indian words which occur in the 
extracts from this book are not so accurately written as 
those in Alberuni’s own work, and offer more difficulties 
in the way of identification: v. note to p. 159. 


P. 162. Jivagarman—The words“ As I have been told 
(by him),” may better be translated “ As I have heard it 
from him.” Alberuni does not quote from a book of his, 
but only says “he has told, mentioned,” “ I have heard from 
him.” Accordingly, he seems to have been a contemporary 
and personal acquaiptance of Alberuni’s, in the same way 
as Sripfla, Alberuni relates on his authority details 
regarding a festival in Kashmir and Svat, ii, 181, 182, 
Besides, a Jivagarman is mentioned as the author of a 
Jétakam, i. 157, who seems to have been a different person

Parvan, v. 1336 seg. 


P. 165. Alfazdrt is one of the fathers of Arabian litera- 
ture, the first propagator of Indian astronomy among the 
Arabs, His works are, as far as J am aware, not extant, 
Probably this Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Alfazari, was the 
son of Ibrahim Ibn Habib Alfazari, the first constructor of 
astrolabes among the Arabs, who as a surveyor partook in 
the foundation of Bagdad. Cf. Fihrist, pV, Gildemeister, 
in his Seriptorum Arabum de rebus Indicis loci, p. 101, gives 
the translation of an article of Alkifti on our Faz4rt. 

According to the quotations of Alberuni (v. index s. v. 
Alfazari), this scholar used the word pala in the meaning 
of day-minute; be reckoned the circumference of the earth 
in lyr, ic. yojanas ; he (together with Ya'kib Ibn Tarik) 
mentions a town, Téra, in a sea in Yamakoti; he givea a 
method for the computation of the longitude of a place 
from two latitudes; his book contained the cycles of the 
planets as derived from Hindw scholars, the members of an 
embassy from some part of Sindh, who called on the Khalif 
Almanstir, a. 154 (== 4D. 771). Alberuni charges him 
with having misunderstood the meaning of the word Arya- 
bhata, which he is said to have used as meaning you Of 
the measures of the great Siddhanta, i.e. the Brahmasid- 
dhdnta of Brahmagupta. Lastly, Alfazari (together with 
Yakfb) has used the word 4: (padamdsa?) in the 
sense of adhimdsa (lesp-month). On the whole, Alberuni 
finds that the tradition of Indian astronomy by Alfazari 
is not very trustworthy, and that in it the names or éerminé 
technici are often corrupt and badly written. 

As Alfaziri and Yakfb Ib. f4rik are sometimes men- 
tioned in the same context, there must have been a close 
relation between these two authors, the nature of which I 
have no means for examining. Have both learned from 
the same Hindu scholar, and have they independently of 
each other committed their information to writing? Or

has the one made a new edition or a commentary of the 
work of the other? Vide note to p. 169 (Ya kib). 


P. 165. Siii.—The word occurs thrice, and is written 
ese (siyé 2); only in one place it seemed to be cs, but on 
repeated comparison of the MS, I find that originally here, 
too, was written .5-. Ido not know a measure of sucha 
name. Perhaps it is the Sfsi, of which 16=1 panéf (p. 
166, 1. 2 in Somanath). Cf Colebrooke, “ Essays,” i. 536; 
sixteen bisis = one pantt, 


P. 166. Khwdrizmvan.—The comparison of the measures 
of this country, the modern Khiva, will remind the reader 
that it was the native country of the author.

ing this quotation in his Samitd. 


P. 167. Vardhamthira—The passage here quoted is 
Samhitd, chap. xviii. v. 26-28. 


P. 167. *Ajedn.—Alberuni only mentions the plural 
form, not the singular, which would be jun or jaun, j6n. 
I take the word to be the Arabized form of yojana. Tho 
change from yojana to jén was perhaps facilitated by a 
Prakritic pronunciation on the part of the Hindu teachers 
of Alfazari, according to which aj between two vowels may 
be dropped. Cf. gao=gaja, raadam, rajata (Vararuci, ii. 2). 


P. 168.— Archimedes fixed 7 as a measure between 3} and

P. 169.—Ya'kilb Ibn Térik seems to have been the most 
prominent predecessor of Alberuni in the field of astro- 
nomy, chronology, and mathematical geography on an 
Indian basis, Heéis frequently quoted in the Zndica, much 
more than Alfaziri. 

Here he gives the measnres of the circumference and 
the diameter of the zodiacal sphere in yojanas, in which 
Alberuni recognises the system of Pulisa, He speaks of 
a city, Taira, within a sea in Yamakoti (i. 303). He gives 
the measures of the radius, diameter, and circumference of 


312 ‘ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


the earth in yoyanas (i. 312), a statement on the latitude 
of Ujain, and a quotation from the book Arkand on the 
same aubject (i. 316). He mentions the four mdnas or 
measures of time, sauramdna, cindramédna, &c. (i. 353)- 
His work contained tablea of the revolutiona of the planets, 
borrowed from a Hindu who had come in an embassy 
from Sindh to the court of the Khalif Almansiir, a.. 
154 (=A.D. 771), but Alberuni finda in these tablea con- 
siderable deviations from those of the Hindus (ii, 15). He 
is accused of having misunderstood the word Aryabhata, 
so as to take it not for the name of an author, but for a 
technical term meaning y;7'55 of the measures employed in 
the great Siddh4nta (that of Brahmagupta), on 11. 18, 19. 
He called the leap-month 4\4 (padamdsa ?) instead of 
adhimdsa (ii. 23). He gives an incorrect method for the 
computation of the solar daya in the akargana and for the 
reduction of yeara into days (by the aide of a correct one) 
on ii. 26, 34, 38. He gives further detaila of the ahargana 
computation (ii 44, 45), and a table indicating the dis- 
tances of the planets from the earth, borrowed from a 
Hindu, au. 161 (=D. 777, 778), on ii. 67, 68. 

Accordingly the work of Yakib seems to have been a 
complete syatem of astronomy, chronology, and mathema- 
tical geography. It is called Compositio Spherarum and 
also gtyt, 1.6. Canon. 

Alberuni sometimes criticisea Yakfib, and maintains 
that he had committed errors, that he mia-spelled the Indian 
words, and that he aimply borrowed the tables from his 
Hindu authority without examining them by calculation. 

On his relation to Alfaz4ri, ». note to p. 165. 

When Alberuni wrote his Chronology, he did not possess 
the work of Ya'kfib, fort here he gives a note on the four 
mdnas and on the word é.\edy (padamdsa ?) on the autho- 
rity of Ya kdb, but taken from the work of another author. 
Vide my tranalation, p. 15. 

As Yakib studied in the years AH. 154 and 161 (A.D. 
771, 778), he must have lived in the second half of the 
eighth Christian century (probably in Babylonia), This 
_ is nearly all we know of him. C/. Reinand, Mémotre sur 
PInde, p. 313; Steinschneider, Zeitschrift der Deutschen 
Morgenldndischen Gesellschaft, 24, 332, 354. ; 

The #thrisi, p. ¥4, has a note on him in which there 


ANNOTATIONS. 313 


is some confusion. The work Compositio Spherarum is 
erroneously mentioned among the works of ‘Utarid Ibn 
Muhammad, whilst it is apparently identical with the 
work here called Canon. It consisted of two parts, one on 
the sphere and one on the periods (the yugus?). Accord- 
ing to Fihrist, he had written two more books, one on the 
division of the sine in kardajdi, and another on what is 
derived from the arc of the meridian. 

Regarding the embassy from Sindh, from which the 
Arabs are said to have got the first information on Indian 
astronomy, in fact, the two works of Brahmagupta, the 
Brahmasiddhdnta (Sindhind) and the Khandakhddyaka 
(called Arkand), I cannot find any historical account in 
the Arabic annals. We do not learn anything from Ibn 
Wadib or Tabari of the presence of a Sindhi embassy in 
Babylonia in the year 154 (A.D. 771), as Alberuni has it, 
nor in the year 156 (A.D. 773), a8 Alhusain Ibn Muhammad 
Ibn Alidami maintains (Gildemeister, Seriptorum Arabum 
de rebus Indicis loci, p. 101), nor of the presence of Hindu 
scholars in Babylonia in the year 161 (A.D. 777). This 
only is related by Ibn Wadih, that when Abulabbis Saffih, 
the first Abbaside Khalif, was dying in Anbar, there 
arrived at his court an embassy from Sindh, a.H. 136 (A.D. 
753). At all events, at the time of the Khalif Almansfir, 
Sindh obeyed this prince, and Islam had spread not only 
in Sindh, but far beyond it into the adjacent countries, 
both by war and by commerce. There must have been 
many occasions for petty Hindu princes in Sindh to send 
special missions to the political centre of the Muslim 
realm. 

When Ya kdb wrote, the Arkand (Khandakhddyaka) had 
already been translated into Arabic. By whom? By 
Alfazirt? 

In the first fifty years of Abbaside rule there were two 
periods in which the Arabs learned from India, first 
under Mansir (A.D. 753-774), chiefly astronomy, and 
secondly under H4rfin (786-808), by the special influence 
of the ministerial family Barmak, who till 803 ruled the 
Muslim world, specially medicine and astrology.

This somewhat enigmatic sentence seems to have the

changed into the diminutivo form, i.e. kuraish (a small 
sea-animal, ay a proper noun, the name of the tribe to 
which Muhammad belonged). The diminutive form serves 
the purpose of magnifying the form of the word: ¢f. Kash- 
shaf to Koran, 106, 2, arte pArell, (not pect), If the 
Hindus magnify their nouns by giving them the feminine 
gender, this must be referred to some of the piconastic 
suffixes, ¢.7. d, 4, which are added to Indian noune without 
altering their meaning. In appearance they ere the ter- 
minations of the feminine gender, in reality euphonic

P. 197. The configuration of the northern coast of the 
Indian Ocean seems to have been a favourite subject of 
Alberuni, for he mentions it again on p. 270. 


P. 199. Mdahitra, so written by Alberuni, is written 
3°, Mahura, by his elder contemporary Al-nthi, more in 
keeping with the Sanskrit vowels (Mathurd). 

Alberuni reckons the distances in farsakh, regarding the 
measure of which he unfortunately does not give accnrate 
information. According to i. 167, 1 yojana= 3 32,000 yards 
=8 miles; : mile=4000 yards; and according to i. 200, 
§ farsakh=4 miles=1 kuroh; 1 farsakh=16,000 yards, 
Cf. also Aloys Sprenger, Die "Post- und Reiserouten des 
Orients, Vorrede, p. xxvi., who proves that one Arabian 
nile=preter propter 2000 metres=2186 yards, whilst the 
English geographical mile = 2025 yards. If we, therefore, 
want to compare Alberuni’a distances with English tniles, 
we must reckon— 


1 English mile=1y,¥5 Arabian mile. 
1 Arabian mile= }$7§ English mile. 
1 farsokk =4 Arabian miles= 37/3, English miles. 


P, 200. Alberuni givea sixteen itineraries which seem 
to have been communicated to him by the military and. 
civil officers of King Mahmfid (on some of these roads he

had marched with large armies, ¢.g. to Kanoj and to 
Somanftha), from merchants and aailors, from Hindu and 
Muslim travellers. The starting-points of these itineraries 
are Kanoj, Mihira (now Muttra), Anhilvara (now Pattan), 
Dhar in Malava, and two lesa known places, Bari, the tem- 
orary capital of the realm of Kanoj, after the old capital 
had been taken by the Muslims, and a place called Bazina. 
These itineraries are—1. From Kanoj to Allahabad, 
and thence towarda the eastern coast of India as far as 
K4fici (Conjeveram), avd farther south. 2. From Kanoj 
(or Bari) to Benares, and thence to the mouth of the 
Ganges, 3. From Kanoj eastward as far as Kamroop, and 
northward to Nepal and the Tibetan frontier. 4. From 
Kanoj southward as far as Banavisi on the southern coast. 
5. From Kanoj to Bazdoa or Narayan, the then capital of 
Guzarat, 6. From Muttra to Dhar, the capital of Malava. 
7, From Bazina to Dhar and Ujain. 8. From Dhar in 
Malavé towards the Godévarit. g. From Dhar to Taina, 
on the coast of the Indian Ocean. 10. From Bazina to 
Somanitha, on the south coast of Kathiavar. 11. From 
Anhilvara to Tana, on the west coast, north of Bombay. 
12, From Bazana vid Bhati to Loharini, at the mouth 
of the Sindh river, 13. From Kanoj to Kashmir. 14. 
From Kanoj to Panipat, Attok, Kabul, Ghazna. 15. From

P, 200. Barhamshil = Brikmanadatla = Brahmin’s 
rock (?). 

Theof Praydga=: Allahabad, at the confluence of Ganges 
and Jomna. ; 

In line 20 after 12 farsakh (in the Arabic only 12 with- 
out fersakh) there is apparently 3 lacuna. ——- 

Uwaryahdr.—One expects an indication of Orissa 
(Ortyadega). The word might also be read Uriyahdr, 
Is Uriyadhdrd meant? Urdabtshau perhaps = trdiva- 
vishaya. 

Jaur's possessions, te. the Cola empire; #. also here, 
i. 209, and Lassen, Jndische Alterthumskunde, ii. 435, iv. 
230 seg. 


P, 200. Bari.—Regarding the situation of this place the 
following statements must be taken into account :—It was 
situated ten farsakh or three to four daye’ march distant 
from Kanoj towards the east, east of the Ganges, in the 
neighbourhood of the confluence of the rivers +~®, and .s¥3* 
and Sarayu. It was twenty-five farsakh distant from Oudh. 
The name Béré occurs also in Elliot-Beames, “ Memoirs,” 
ii, $3, as that of a subdivision of the district Agra, 


P. 201. Kémrd is apparently Kémardpa and Tilvat = 
Tirhoot, The latter is by mistake also written Janvat. 
Are we to read Tirdt? The word is perhaps composed of 
Tari, the name of the nation who lived there, and a word 
like bhukti. 

The empire of Shilahat.—Is this to be identified with 
Sylhet, the province of Assam ? 

Bhoteshar seems to be bhaufta-tévara, lord of the 
bhauftas, or Tibetans. 


P. 202. Kajtrdha is = kharjira-bhdga. 

Tiaurt.— According to a well-known rule of Prakrit 
(Vararuci, ii, 2), the name Tiarovpa (Ptolemy, vii. i. 63) 
would become something like Tiaurt. As there is a lacuna 
in the Arabic manuscript, the situation of this place cannot 
be accurately defined. 

Kannakara.—This is probably identical with Kamkar, 
the realm of the Balhard, according to Mas‘ddi: », Elliot, 
“ History of India,” i 25.

Jaddra.—This reading is uncertain. Perhaps all the 
signs of the Arabic text (8s%)=1) are the name of a place.

Ldrdesh = Aapix? of Ptolemy, vii. i. 4. 

Bihroj = Broach = Bapvyafa, G. Smith, p. 263. 

Rihanjir is probably identical with "Aypwdyapa (Pto- 
lemy, vii. i. § 63). Two consonants frequently undergo a 
metathesis, if one of them is a liguid. Agrinagara has 
become Arginagara, and the g is here represented by an h, 
as in Candardha = Candrabhdgd. 

Lohardnt seems to be identical with AwrlBape of 
Ptolemy, vii i § 2. A metathesis of the middle conso- 
nants has taken place, and 6 has become 4. It is also 
called Lohdniyye (i. 316).

this ronte along the coast that one given by Ibn Khurdadbih 
in Elliot, “ History of India,” i. 15, 16; A. Sprenger, Die

of these names terminated in short x, as manghiru. Cf. 
the Hindustani names in Dowson’s “Grammar of the 
Urdi,” 1887, p. 259. : 

The vernacular names of the suns are perhaps to be 
prononnced : radi, bishnu, dhdta, bidhdia, arjamu, bhagu, 
sabita, pisha, tvashta, arku, dibdkaru, anshu. 

The difference between vernacular and classical speech

overlooked in translating: “And further he (ie Vasu- 
deva) has spoken in the Géd, ‘Iam like the vasanta, tc,

When King Mahmfid, 4m. 408 (aD. 1017), had returned 
from Khwarizm-Khiva after the conquest of the country, 
and had carried along with him the princes of the con- 
quered house of Ma’mttn, many scholars (among them 
Alberuni), officers, and soldiers, did he send some of these 
(among them Alberuni) as state prisoners to Multan, 
which he had conquered years before? In this way, nine- 
teen years later (a.m. 427), the princes of the family of 
Altuntash, who had ruled Khwarizm after the Ma’miinis, 
were treated by Mahmfid’s grandson, Majddid, who sent 
them as state prisoners to Lahore. At all events, it is 
perfectly certain that Alberuni cannot have been in favour 
with King Mahmid, or he wonld have dedicated one of 
his books to him. Cf Sachan, Zur ditesten Geschichte und

i, 316 (where he quotes Pulisa and Prithusvimin), on the 
day of the Devas and that of the Pitaras, i 330. He calls 
the cashaka vinddi, i. 335. From a book of his it is quoted 
that 1008 caturyugas are one day of Brahman; half of it is 
utsarpind, the other half avasarpint (Jaina terms), i i. 371. 
Unfortunately I canuot read the title of this book; the

Alberuni warns the reader not to confound this Aryabhata 
with the elder scholar of this name, to whose followers he 
belongs, In this place (i. 246) Alberuni does not seem to 
have used a work of Aryabhata junior himself, but to 
have taken these words of his from a commentary of 
Balabhadra. We learn here that the book had been trans- 
lated into Arabic, but do not learn which particular work 
of Balabhadra’s, Was it his commentary on the Khanda- 
khddyaka of Brahmagupta? Vide note to p.156, That 
Alberuni had made a new edition of the Arabic versiou of 
the Khandakhadyaka is known (v. edition of the Arabic 
original, pref. p, xx.); perhaps he had also procured him- 
self an Arabic translation of Balabhadra’s commentary. 
Cf. on this younger Aryabhata, Kern, Brhat Safihitd, pre- 
face, pp. 59, 60, and Dr. Bhéu DaAji, “ Brief Notes on the 
Age and Authenticity of the Works of Aryabhata, Vara- 
hamihira,” &c., p. 392. Alberuni always calls him Arya- 
bhata of Knsumapura (Patna), to distinguish him from his 
elder namesake,

P. 274, L. 37.—Ta being the sine of 3$° is equal to 225’, 
its square to 50,625; TB the versed sine of 33° is 7’, and 
HT = radius — TB = 3438’ — 7 = 3431 (Schram). 


P. 275, 1. 3—The following calculation seems to have 
been made very negligently, for there are several faults in 
it. The radius 795° 27’ 16” is correctly determined, for 
employing the ratio 7: 22 between diameter and circum- 
ference, we are indeed led to this number, But already in 
the determination of Bc there is a fault, Alberuni seems 
to have converted 0° 7’ 42” into yojauas, instead of con- 
verting 0° 7’ 45" ; for 360° being equivalent to 5000 yojanas, 
we get for 1° 13 yojana, 7 kroéa, 444$ yards, for 1’ 1 kroéa, 
34073} yards, and for 1” 1233} yards, and reckoning with 
those numbers we get 0° 7’ 42”, and not 0° 7’ 45”, which 
corresponds to 57,035 yards. Further, the rule he makes 
use of is completely erroneous; it is not true that the 
relation between the height of two observers is the same 
as the relation between the sines of their respective 
fields of vision. Jf this were the case, we should have 
sec a—1:8in a=sec S—1:sin 8, or the quotient a 
would be a constant for every value of a, which, of course, 
is not the case, But even with his incorrect rule we 
cannot find the numbers he has found. This rule is 
4 yards : sine of field of vision = 57,035 yards : 225’, 80 one 


would have sine of field of vision = ee but he finds 


334 ALBERUNI'S INDIA. 
the sine of the field of vision equal to o° o' 1” 3”, which 


corresponds to ao and not to ate Therefore Albe- 
runi seems to have reckoned 4 x 225 = 1000 instead of 900. 
Also the length of each degree is not quite correct; It is 
not 13 yojana, 7 kroga, 3334 yards, but, as above stated, 13 
yojana, 7 krofa, 444§ yards. Lastly, if we convert by means 
of this number 0° oO 1” 3” into yards, we find 129% yards, 
so that the 291% yards he speaks of seem to have been 
arrived at by an erroneous metathesis of tha original 
ciphers (Schram).

Alarkand, Ibn Tarik —Cf. note to p. 169. 


P. 312.—Al-arkand is identified by Alberuni with the 
Khandakhddyakea of Brahmagupta (ii 7). In another 
place (ii. 48) the author identifies the word arkand with 
ahargana. Both of these identifications can hardly be 
justified phonetically, and therefore I prefer to suppose as 
the Sanskrit original of Arkand a word like Aryathanda, 
whilst apparently the word Aarkan (title of an Arabic 
calendar, ii. 52) is identical with ahkargana. 

The author complains of the Arabic tranalation of 
Al-arkand being a bad one, and at aome time of his life 
(probably after the composition of the Zndica) he has pub- 
lished a new and amended edition of this translation. Cf 
preface to the Arabic edition, p. xx. The Arabic Arkand 
has not yet been discovered in the libraries of Europe. 
The author has borrowed from this book the following 
notes :—(1) 1050 yojanas are the diameter of the earth 
(i. 312, 316). (2) The latitude of Ujain is 22° 29’, and 
that of Almansfira 24° 1’ (i. 316). Here the author states 
that also Yakdb Ibn Tarik had quoted the book, but 
erroneously. (3) The straight shadow in Lohardnii is 53 
digits (i. 316). (4) Alberuni quotes from Alarkand a 
method for the computation of the era Shakh, by which 
the Gupta era is meant (ii. 48, 49). 


P. 312.—~On the relation between yojana and mile, v. 
note to p. 199. : 


P, 312, 1,22.—Using the ratio of 7 : 22 between diameter 
and circumference, we find 3300 yojanas as the circum- 
ference corresponding to a diameter of 1050 yojanas. So 
3300 yojanas is the circumference of the earth given in 
the handbook Al-arkand. This agrees with the last lines 
of p. 315, where it is aaid that 3200 yojanas are 100 yojanas 
less than the value given by Al-arkand (Schram).

the calculation and reduce the parts of the great circle to 
yojanas, according to this method we get the number 
3200.” But to get 3200 we must multiply °4° by 80. 
The rule, “ Multiply the Faron of the distance between 
two places by 9 and divide the product by 80,” serves to 
convert this distance given in yojanas into degrees. This 
distance, then, is considered as the hypothenuse of a 
right-angled triangle, one of the sides of which is the dif- 
ference of the latitudes, the other the unknown difference 
of the longitudes; this latter is found by taking the root 
of the difference of the squares of hypothenuse and known 
aide. This difference of longitude is then expressed in 
degrees; to get it expressed in day-minutes we must 
further divide by 6, as there are 360° in a circle, but only 
6o day-minutes in a day (Schram).

valorous, as in Toghrultagin, ic. valorous like a falcon. As 
tle, jilghan, means a large spear, one might think of

is very uncertain. Another name of a similar formation 
ja kutlughtagin, katlagh, hut probably entirely different.

Situation unknown. According to the author's Canon

ham, “ Ancient Geography of India,” p. 54. 

Mandakkakor (the name is differently written) was the 
fortress of Lahore, according to the author's statement in 
his Canon Masudicus. 

Nandna is explained by Elliot (“ History of India,” ii. 
450, 451) as a fort on the mountain Balnath, a conspicuous 
mountain overhanging the Jailam, and now generally called 
Tilla, Cf. also Elliot, @. c. ii. 346, note 347, 366. 

The places Dunpir (pronunciation perfectly uncertain) 
and Kandé (also read Kiri), the station of the Amir, seem to 
have been on the road from Ghazaa to Peshavar. Near 
the latter place was fought the decisive battle between 
King Mas‘fid and his blinded brother Muhammad, a.p. 
1040, and there the former was murdered by the relatives 
of those who ten years earlier had thonght to win his 
favour by betraying his brother, and were killed or mal- 
treated in reward. Cf Elliot, dc. iv. 199, note 1, 138, 
ii, 150, 112 (Persian text, p. 274), 273, note 3. 


342 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


I conjecture Dunpfir to have been identical with Jala- 
labad or some place near it. Latitude of Jalalabad, 34° 
24’; that of Dunpfr, 34° 20’. 

Kandi, more sonthern than Dnonpfr and nearer to 
Kabul, must have been a place like Gandamak or near it. 
If it is called the station (post-relat) of the Amir, We may 
understand by this Amir the father of Mahmdd, the 
Amir Sabuktagtn, who first constracted the roads lead- | 
ing to the Indian frontier, ag Alberuni informs us on

not know which dialect this was, nor, whether there are 
any traces of it in our days. The change between v and 
m is also observed in the following examples :-—u-~, 
carmanmal =carmanvalt (Chambal), ows himamant = 


himavant, OLS jdgamalku = ydjnavalkya, sy macct=

civil Greenwich time, whilst the real instant of the solstice 
is March 15, 12h. 15 m, civil Greenwich time, so that the

the Sanskrit text, in so far as he does not always combine the 
same Vyasa with the same Dv4para, particularly towards 
the end of the list. The names agree in both traditions, 
except Zrivrishan, for which the Arabic has something like 
Trivarta or Trivritia. Besides, in the word Rinajyeshtha 
(in Arabic Rinajertu) the anthor has made a mistake. 
The Sanskrit verse runs thus— 


kritamjayah saptadase rinajyoshtddage smritah. 
Alberuni has read rinajyeshfosh{ddaége instead of rinajycsh- 
tddage, and has wrongly divided these words into rinaj- 
yeshjo-ash{adase instead of rinajyo ashtddage, Further, he 
has been guided by the analogy of jyaishtha (the name of 


the month), which in vernacular was pronounced jertu, in 
changing rinajyeshta into rinajertu.

P. 403. The children of Kaurava, &e.—The following

the five brothers by the curse of the Brahmin from book 
Xvi, or mausalaparvan ; their going to heaven from book 
XVil., or mahdprasthanikaparvan. 

The introductory sentence of this relation, 43% gS 
Rosealt 9 (le 9595, literally, “The children of Kaurava 
were over their cousins,” is odd, and perhaps not free 
from a lacuna, Pandu had died, and his children crow 
up in Hastinapura, at the court of Kaurava, ie. Dhrita- 
rashtra, their uncle, the brother of Pandu. One expects a 
sentence like “ The children of Kanrava cherished enmity 
against their cousins,” but as the Arabic words run, one 
could scarcely translate them otherwise than I have done. 
fe children of Kaurava had “the charge of their cousins,”

VOL. II, 


P. 1~-The famous chronological chapter xlix. consists 
of two parts of very different value. Part ion p. 2-5,an 
explanation of the mythical eras of the Hindus, is taken 
from the Vishnu-Dharma, on which work ¢f. note to i, 

» 54. 
. Part ii, on p. 5-14, containing information of a historical 

character, has not been drawn from a literary source. If 
the author had learned these things from any particn- 
lar book or author, he would have said so. His infor- 
mation is partly what educated people among Hindus 
believed to be historic and had told him, partly what he 
had himself observed during his stay among Hindns and 
elsewhere. That their historic tradition does not deserve 
much credit is matter of complaint on the part of the 
author (on pp. 10, 11), and that altogether the description 
of historic curonology, as far as he was able to give it, is 
by no means in all points satisfactory, is frankly admitted 
by the author himself (on p. 9). Whatever blame or 
praise, therefore, attaches to this chapter must in the first 
instance be laid to the charge, not of Alberuni, but of his 
informants. What he tells us is to be considered as the 
vulgata among educated Hindus in the north-west of India 
in his time. 

Although the tales which had been told Alberuni may 
not have been of a high standard, still it is much to be 
regretted that he has not chosen to incorporate them into 
his Indica (ef. p. 11, I-6). 

Whether his hope (expressed on p. 8), that he might 
some day learn something more ef this subject, was realised 


"358 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


“or not, I cannot make out. However, the stray notes on . 
Indian chronology scattered through his Canon Masudicus, 
which he wrote some years after the Indica, do not seem 
to betray that his Indian studies had made much progress. 

In all researches on Indian chronology, Alberunt’s state- 
ments play an eminent specially those relating to the 
epochs of the Saka and Gupta eras. Cf. among others 
the following publications :— 

Fergusson, ‘On Indian Chronology,” “ Joarnal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society,” vol. iv. (1870), p. 81; and “Qn the Saka, Samvat, and 
Gupta Eras,” vol. xii. (1880), p. 259 :

P. 2—As the author had to compare a number of dif- 
ferent eras with each other, he stood in need of a common 
standard to which to reduce all of them, and for this pur- 
pose he chose the New-Year’s Day or first Caitra of the 
year 953 of the Saka era, which corresponds to— 

(1.) AD. 1031, 25th February, a Thursday. 

(2.) A, Hijrae 422, 28th Safar. 

(3.) A. Persarum 399, 19th Ispandarmadh-M&h. 

The Nanréz or New- Year's Day of the Persian year 400 
fell on oth March 1031 4.D., Which is the day 2,097,686 
of the Julian period (Schram). 


P, 2, 1. 30.—This refers to the year of the kaliyaga 
3600, as there have elapsed 10 divya years or 3600 years 
of the present yuga. On the next page Alberuni makes 
the calculation for the gange-year, or the year 4132 of the 
kaliyuga. A kalpa being a day of Brahman, 8 years, 5 
months, 4 days correspond to 8x 720+-5 x60+4x 2, or 
6068 kalpas, or 26,213,760,000,000 years. Of the present 
kalpa there have elapsed six manvantaras or 1,840,320,000 
years, seven samdhis or 12,096,000 years, twenty-seven 
eaturyugas or 116,640,000 years, the kritayuga or 1,728,000 
years, the tretayuga or 1,296,000 years, the dvaparayuga 
or 864,000 years, and of the kaliyuga 4132 years; 60

elapsed of the caturyuga; adding to it successively the 
other numbers of years, we find the numbers given Il. 29-31 
of this page. The Arabic manuscript has 26,425,456,200,000 
instead of 26,425 456,204,132 (Schram).

P. 6, The epoch of the era of Saka, &c.—Alberuni speaks 
of this era in his Canon Masudicus (composed during the 
reign of Mas‘dd) in the following terms: ugl Jay wii 
oN Bye sty Aad partly Sule Uelare OIF AS BSD Lie ye mens 
LGW Gyo Sold dere 55, (Beginning of the sixth chapter, 
book i, copied from the Codex Elliot, now in the British 
Moseum.) 

Translation: “ Time is called Kéla in the language of 
the Hindus. The cra most famous among them, and in 
particular among their astronomers, is the Sakekdia, ie. 
the time of Saka, This era is reckoned from the year of 
his destruction, hecause he was ruling (rather, tyrannising) 
over it (¢.e. over that time). In this as well as in other

eras it is the custom to reckon only with complete, not 
with incomplete or current years.” 

Then the anthor goes on to give rules for the comparison 
of the Saka era with the Greek, Persian, and Muslim eras. 

A later author, ’Abi-Sa'id ‘Abd-alhayy Ibn Aldahbak 
Ibn Mahmfid Gardézi (Gardez, a town east of Ghazne), 
has reproduced the information of Alberuni on the Saka 
erain Persian. Not having the original (MS. Ouseley 240, 
Bodleian Library, Oxford) at my disposal, I give a trans- 
lation made years ago :— 

“The Hindn era is called ji», because JlS (Ada) meana 
time, and «ls (Saka) is the name of a king whose death 
was made an era; he did the Hindna a great deal of harm, 
ao they made the date of his death a festival” (Oxford 
manuscript, p. 352). 

The place Kardr is also mentioned in the Chachndma. 
Vide Elliot, “ History of India,” i, 139, 143, 207. 


P.7. Alarkand—Cf. note to i. 312. The book does 
not seem to exist in the collectiona of Arabic manuscripts 
in Europe. 


P. 8.—The pronunciation of the names Kanir, Bardart, 
Martgala, and Nirahara (Nira-griha ?) is more or less con- 
jectaral. 

Alberani identifies Bdrtgala with Takshagila (vol. ii. 
302), te. the Taxila of the ancients, The name Mdrigala 
seems to be preserved in that of a range of hills lying only 
too miles to the south of Shahdhesi (Cunningham, “ Ancient — 
Geography of India,” p.111). The place is also mentioned 
in the Zabakdti-Ndgirt. Vide Elliot, “ History of India,” 
il. 271, 273. 


P. 9.—Durlabha, a native of Multan, is only twice men- 
tioned. Here the author quotes from him a method for 
the computation of the Saka era, and p. 54. method for 
the computation of ahkargana. According to him, the 
Indian year commenced with the month Mérgaéirsha, hat 
the astronomers of Multén commenced it with Caitra 


(p. 10).

place, If it were an Indian name, I should think of some- 
thing like Vrikathina (or Vrikathelu oa). If it is 
Turkish, it is a compound, the second part of which is 
tagin (as in Toghrultagin and similar names), As the 
author declares the dynasty to be of Tibetan origin, the 
question is whether the name may be explained as Tibetan. 


P, 10. Var—aAs the Arabic verb may be connected 
either with the preposition bi or with the accusative, we

P. 11. Kanik.—Only the three consonants KWK are 
certain. We may read them Kanik or Kanikku, which 
would be a Middle-Indian Kanikkhu for Sanskritic Ken- 
ishka. Thus the name Turk was pronounced by the 
Middie-Indian tongue as Turukkhu, and Sanscritisized as 
Turuskha. 

This Zopyrus-story was reproduced by Muhammad 
‘Aufi, Cf Elliot, “ History of India,” ii. 170. 


P. 13. Lagatérmdn.—The unconth formation of this 
name seems to point to a Non-Indian (Tibetan ?) origin. 
I at first thought to combine it with the name of the 
Tibetan king, Langtarma, who abolished Buddhism, a.p. 
899 (v. Prinsep, “‘ Useful Tables,” ii. 289), as our Lagatir- 
man was the last of @ series of Buddhistic kings, and as 
the names resemble each other to some extent. However, 
this combination seems delusive. 


The name Kallar is written Kallr x. Could this name 
be combined with Kuluska (Kalusha ?), which e.g, occurs as 
the name of the Brahmin minister of the Mahratta Raja 

‘Sambaji? =

Kamala was a contemporary of the prince ‘Amr Ibn

172. Is the name a hypokoristikon of one like Kamalav- 
ardhana ?

- Anandapdla, Bhimapdla, and Trilocanapdla mean hav- 
ing Siva as protector. If, therefore, these princes, like the 
Indo-Scythian kings (¢ Drouin, Revue Numismatique, 
1888, 48), were Siva-warshippera, we must explain the 
name Jaipdl perhaps as Jaydpdila, i.e. having Durgd (the 
wife of Siva) as protector. Cf. the Hindu kings of Kabul 
in Elliot, ‘History of India,” ii 403 seg. (in many points 
antiqnated). 

The name Trilocanapdla (here Tardcanpél) has been 
much disfigured in the Arabic writing. Vide the Paru 
Jaipal in Elliot, ic., ii. 47, 463, 464. 


P. 13,1 14. The latter was killed —The Arabic manu- 
script has J+, which may be read Je} (narratum est) or 
J (interfectus est). I have not been able to ascertain 
whether the year in question was that of the enthronisa- 
tion of Trilocanapala, or that of his death, I prefer, how- 
ever (with Reinand), to read 3, “he was killed,” becanse 
evidently the author stood so near to the events in ques- 
tion that he could have ample and trustworthy informa- 
tion, and that, in fact, an on dié (,}3) seems here entirely 
out of place. 


P, 13, L 22. The slightest remnant, literally one bow- 
ing fire,a well-known simile for nobody. Cf. eg. Hasan

Muhammad Ibn Ishak of Sarakhs is mentioned only 
here and in the tables on pp. 16 and 18, besides in 
Alberuni’s “ Chrenology ” (English edition, p. 29). 


P. 16, 1. 6 of the table.—It is not clearly ssid in the 
text that the anomalistic revolution is meant, but the 
numbers which Alberuni quotes leave no doubt on the 
subject. The days of a kalpa are 1,577,916,450,000, which 
being divided by the number 57,265,194,142, give for one 
revolution 273}2$sisaies Gays, or 27 days 13 h. 18 min. 
33 sec., Whilst the anomalistic revolution of the moon is 
equivalent to 27 days 13 h. 18 min. 37 sec., an agreement 
80 very close, that every doubt that there could be meant 


. ANNOTATIONS. 363 


anything but the anomalistic revolution is completely ex- 
eladed. Moreover, the number of the revolutions of the 
apsis, 488,105,858, being augmented by 57,265,194,142, is 
equal to §7,753,300,000, the number of sidereal revolu- 
tions ; and, indeed, the revolutions of the apsis, plus tle 
anomalistic revolutions, must be equal to the sidereal re- 
volutions (Schram). 


P. 16.—The note in the table “ The anomalistic revolu~ 
tion of the moon is here treated,” &c., is not quite clear, and 
probably materially incorrect. ‘That the term yal dele 
means the anomaly (dvwyaria in Greek, kendra (xévrpov) 
in Sanskrit), was first pointed out to me by my fmend and 
colleacue, Prof, Forster; but this note, which seems to be 
intended as a sort of explanation of the term, does not 
exactly render what astronomers understand by anomaly. 
Literally translated it runs thus: “The Hégsat-alkamar 
stands in the place of the apsts, because the result is its 
(whose? the apsis’?) share, since it (the hdggat-alkamar) 
is the difference between the two motions” (os es. be «3

(English edition), p. 15. 


P. 27,—The rule given in the first fifteen lines of this 
page is completely erroneous, and consequently the ex- 
ample calculated after this rule is so too. The right 
method would be the following :—* The complete years are 
multiplied by 12; to the product are added the months 
which have elapsed of the current year. The sum repre- 
sents the partial solar months. You write down ‘the 
number in two places; in the one place you multiply it 
by $311, te. the number which represents the universal 
adhimésa months. The product you divide by 172,800, 
te. the number which represents the universal solaz 
months. The quotient you get, as far as vé contains com- 
plete months, is added to the number in the second place, 
and the sum so obtained is multiplied by 30; to the pro- 
duct are added the days which have elapsed of the current 
month. The sum represents the candradhargana, ie. the 
sum of the partial lunar days.” These two proceedings 
would be identical, if we were not to omit fractions; but 
as an adhim4sa month is only intercalated when it is com- 
plete, we must first determine the number of adhimiss 
months, and, omitting the fractions, change them to days; 
whilst when we multiply beforehand by 30, the fractions 
of the adhimfsa months are also multiplied, which is 
not correct. This is at once seen in the example which 
he works out after this rule, and we wonder that Albe- 
runi himself did not see it. He is calculating the ahar- 
ganas for the beginning of a year, conseqnently also for 
the beginning of a month, and, notwithstanding, he is not 
at all surprised to find (p. 30) 28 days and 51 minutes of 
the month already 

The adhimfsa days are nothing else than adhimfsa 
months converted into days, As the number of the adhi- 


ANNOTATIONS. 365 


Misa months must be a whole, so the number of the 
adhimfsa days must be divisible by 30. Accordingly, the 
number quoted, p. 29, 1. 30, not being divisible by 30, is 
at once recognised as erroneous, and it is astonishing when 
he saya in the follo-ving lines, “1f,in multiplying and 
dividing, we had used the months, we should have found 
the adhimfsa months and multiplied by 30, they would be 
equal to the here-mentioned number of adhimfsa days.” 
In this ease certainly the number ought to be divisible 
by 30. Perhaps he would have found the fault, if not, 
by a strange coincidence, the difference between the true 
value and the false one had been exactly 28 days or 
four complete weeks, so that though the number con- 
aidered is an erroneous one, yet he ‘finds, p. 30, L. 9, the 
right week-day. 

Alberuni finds, p. 29, 1. 2, as the sum of days from 
‘the beginning of the kalpa to the seventh manvantara 
676,610,573.760. Further, he finds, 1. 7, that from the 
beginniug of the seventh manvantara till the beginning of 
the present caturyuga there have elapsed 42,603,744,130 
days, and, 1, 12, that till the beginning of the kaliyuga 
there have elapsed 1,420,124,805 days of the present catur- 
yuga. Adding these numbers, we find that the sum of 
days elapsed from the beginning of the kalpa to that of the 
eaturynga is 720,634,442,715; but as he finds, p. 30, 1. 5, 
that from the same epoch to the gauge-date there have 
elapsed 720,635,951,963 days, so the gauge-date would be 
1,509,248 days after the beginning of the kaliyuga, Now 
we know that the gauge-date is 25th February 1031 (see 
p. 2, 1. 17, and note), or the day 2,097,686 of the Julian 
period, whilst the first day of the kaliyuga, as is generally 
known, coincides with the 18th February 3102 before 
Christ or with the day 588,466 of the Julian period, so 
that the difference of the two dates is 1,509,220, and not 
1,509,248 days. 

To this’ result we shall also come when working out 
Alberuni’s example after the method stated in the begin- 
ning of this note. Instead of p. 29, L 16, we should then 
have: the years which have elapsed of the kalpa up to 
that year are 1,972,948,132. Multiplying them by 12, we 
get as the number of their months 23,675,377,584, In 
the date which we have adopted as gauge-year there is

no month, but only complete years; therefore we have 
nothing to add to this number. It represents the par- 
tial solar months. We multiply it by 5311 and divide 
the product by 172,800; the quotient 727,661,6333300 
represents the adhimasa months. Omitting the frac- 
tions, we add 727,661,633 to the partial solar months 
23,675,377:584, and get 24,403,039,217 as the partial 
lunar months. By multiplying this number by 30 we 
get days, viz., 732,091,176,510. As there are no days 
in the normal date, we have no days to add to this 
number, Multiplying it by 55,739 and dividing the pro- 
duct by 3,562,220, we get the partial finaritra days, viz., 
11,455,224,57543es22- This sum of days without the 
fraction is subtracted from the partial lunar days, and the 
remainder, 720,635,951,935, represents the number of the 
civil days of our gauge-date. Dividing it by 7, we get as 
remainder 4, which means that the last of these days is a 
Wednesday. Therefore the Indian year commences with 
a Thursday. The difference between 720,635,951,935 
and the beginning of the kaliyuga 720,634,442,715 is, 
as it ought to be, 1,509,220 days (Schram).

found above 727,661,6333$$5 for the adhimasa months ; 
the wholes represent the number of the adhimdsas which 
have elapsed, viz., 727,661,633, Whilst the fraction is the 
time which has already elapsed of the current adhimisa 
month, By multiplying this fraction by 30 we get it 
expressed in days, viz. ¥4°° days, or 28 days 51 minntes 
30 seconds, so that the current adhimass month wants only 
1 day 8 minutes 30 seconds more to become a complete 
month (Schram).

P. 31, 1. 24.—The nomber of days from the beginning 
of the caturyaga to the gauge-date is here found by 
Pulisa'a method to be 1,184,947,870, whilst p. 33,1. 16, 
the number of days from the beginning of the caturyuga 
to that of the kaliyuga is found to be 1 5183. 438,350. Tho 
difference between both numbers is (as it ought to be) 
1,509,220 days (Schram). 


P. 33, 1. 24.—The method of Aryabhata is the same 
as that given before, only the numbers by which we are tu 
multiply and to divide,are different according to his system, 
which supposes 2 different number of revolutions in a 
kalpa, According to Aryabhata the elder, a caturyuga has 

1,577,917,500 days (see vol. i. p. 370, 1. 28). As to the 
revolutions of sun and moon, dies seem to be the same 
as given by Pulisa. The tables, pages 16 and 17, are not 
quite correct in this, as they give, for instance, for the 
_ Tevolutions of the moon’s node and apsis the roooth part 

of their revolutions in a kalpa, whilst in vol. i: p. 370, 1. 
16, it is said that, according to Pulisa and Aryabhata, the 
kalpa has 1008 catnryugas. But p. 19, ]. 15, the numbers 
4,320,000 for the sun and 57,753,336 for the moon are 
given as possibly belonging to the theory of Aryabhata. 
The same numbers are cited by Beutley i in his “ Historical 
View of the Hindu Astsu-uomy,” London, 1825, Pp. 179, as 
belonging to the system of the so-called spurious Arva 
Siddhanta, It is doubtless the same system, for if we 
compare the number of days between the beginning of the 
kalpa and that of the kaliyuga, which Bentley atates in 
the above-cited book, p. 181, to be 72 $447,570625, with 
the aame sum quoted by Alberuni, p. 33, 1. 29, there can 
scarcely be a doubt as to the identity of both systems, 
especially as this number 725,447,570,625 is a curious 
one, giving Thursday for the first day of the kalpa, whilst 
the other systema g give Sunday for this date. Of this book 
Bentley says, p. 183 : : “It would be needless to waste any 
more time in going over its contents; what has been 
shown must be “perfectly sufficient to convince any man 
of common seuse of its being a downright modern for- 
gery ;” and p. 190, “The spurious Brahma Siddhanta, 
tocether with the spurious Arya Siddhanta, are doubtless 
the productions of the last century at farthest,” Perhaps

he would have chosen more reserved expressions, if he had 
known that this “production of the last century” was 
already cited by Aiberuni. 

When we adopt these numbers for a caturyuga, te, 
1,577,917,500 civil days, 4,320,000 revolutions of the sun 
and 57,753,330 revolutions of the moon, and consequently 
53,433,330 lunar months, we fiud the numbers belonging 
to a yuga by dividing the above numbers by four, as in 
this system the four yugas are of equal length. Thus 
we get fora yuga 394,479,375 civil dsya, 1,080,000 solar 
years, and consequently 12,960,000 solar months, and 
388,800,000solardays,1 3,358,334 lunar months,400,750,020 
lnonar days, 398,334 adhimasa months, and 6,270,645 
finaritra days, To find the number 725,449,079,845 men- 
tioned, p, 33, 1. 31, a8 the sum of days between the be- 
ginning of the kalpa and the gauge-date, we are to proceed 
as follows :—-From the beginning of the kaliyuga to our 
gange-date there have elapsed 4132 years, which multi- 
plied by 12 give 49,584 as the partial solar months. This 
number multiplied by tne universal adhimfisa months 
398,334, and divided by the universal solar months 
12,960,000, gives 1523¢4637 as the number of adhimfsa 
months. This number, without the fraction added to the 
solar months 49,584, gives §1,107 as ‘the number of the 
partial lunar months, which multiplied by jo gives 
1,533,210 as the number of the partial lunar days. This 
number multiplied by the universal finaratra days6,270,645 
and divided by the universal lunar days 400,750,020 
gives 23,0903473725 as the sum of the partial dnaritrs 
days; and 23,9y0 subtracted from the partial lunar daye 
1,533,210 gives 1,509,220 as the civil days elapsed of the 
kaliyuga till the gauge-date, identical with the number 
found in note to p. 27, These 1,509,220 days added to the 
725,447,570,025 days which separate the beginning of the 
kalpa and the kaliyuga, give the number of 725,449,079,845 
days cited p. 33,1 31. Finally, the number of days elapsed 
of Brahman’s life before the present kalpa, is got by multi- 
plying the number of days in 4 kalpa, ze. 1,590,540,840,000 
(see page 370, vol. i.) by 6068, the number of the kalpas 
elapsed before the present one (Schram), 


P. 34, 1. 32.—There is here the same fault as that which

led Alberuni to a false result, p. 27. The multiplication 
by 30 must be made after dropping the fraction of the 
adhimasa months, not before (Schram). 


P. 36, 1. 1.—The lacuna must have contained a phrase 
like this :—“ In three different places; they multiply the 
number in the lowest place by 77, and divide the product 
by 69,120.” This follows clearly from the explanation 
whicn he gives in the following page (Schram). 


P. 36,1. 9 —Read lunar instead of solar, in the Arabic 
(we, 7, last word), dyes! instead of Sem«tIl. 


P, 36, l. 10.—The expression is a very concise one, 50 
that it is not quite clear what is meant (1 14) by the 
“middle number.” —It is to be understood in the following 
manuer: “This number of the partial lunar days is written 
down in two different places, one under the other. The 
one of these is “in the uppermost place” (l. 17); they 
multiply the lower number by 11, and write the pro- 
duct under i#. Then they divide it, ie. the product, by 
403,963, and add the quotient to the middle number, ze. 
to the product of eleven times the partial lunar days 
(Sehrant). 


P. 36,1. 26—A certain number of months A is to be 
divided by “sy\/o5. If we wish to get the same result 
by dividing only by 65, we must subtract from 4 a cer-

above in a general way, but he has made it ouly for a 
special case, for the gauge-date. He finds the fraction 
uvrzy, Which he would find for every other date, as this 
fraction is independent of the number 4 (Schram). 


P. 37, L 26.—Here again a certain namber of finaritra 
days 4 is to be divided by 6353455. If we wish to get 
the same result by dividing only by 634¥, or, which is the

P. 39, |. 20.—Here he grants that the 28 daye which 
we get over 727,661,633 months are to be reckoned after

Caitra (Schram). 


P. 39, L 24.—The middle number was multiplied by 
$$e¢; solar year has 3653335 days (1, 36), or 52 weeks

number of years multiplied by $355 to this number itself, 
we get the sum of daya by which these years exceed 
whole weeks. The rest of the calculation is sufficiently 
explained by Alberani himself (Schram), 


P. 41, 1. 19.—This is the same case as p. 36, only the 
numbers are a little different. If 4 is the number of

Alberuni has again made the calculation for a special case, 
the gauge-date, and found the same fraction (Schram). 


P. 41, L 20—* This number of days,” viz., the number 
of solar days corresponding to the given date (Schram), 


P. 41, 1. 33.—The MS. has 974 instead of 976. 


P. 42,1. 3.—The number of solar days, 1,555,222,000, 
is here taken as divisor instead of the number of adhimasa 
months, 1,593,336. The fraction ought to be 9767.94.55, 
=976¢3585, the common divisor 24 (Schram). 


P, 42, 1. 6.—Alberuni does not seem to have understood 
Pulisa’s calculation which is correct, although there seems 
to be a lacuna in its explanation. According to Pulisa’s 
theory, there are in a caturyuga 3,55 5,200,000 solar days 
and 1,593,336 adhimdsa months. Dividing the first num- 
ber by the second, we get as the time within which an 
adhimdsa month sums up 976yy5's5°4; days. So one would 
get the number of adhimasa months by dividing the given 
number of solar days by the number O76 Ste ; but 
Pulisa prefers not to reckon with the fraction, so he 
diminishes the number of given days by a certain ‘amount 
and divides only by 976. The number which is to be 
subtracted from the given days is uly found by the 
following equation :-—

- PB, 42, 1, 22.—Not only is it not “ quite impossible that 

this number should, in this part of the calculation, be used 
as a divisor,” but it needs must be used as a divisor. 
This we sea at once when, instead of working out the cal- 
culation with apecial numbers, we make it algebraically. 
Let S be the number of solar days in a caturyuza, and 4 
the number of adhimase months in a caturyuga. Then the 
number of days within which one adhimisa month sums 
up, will be found by dividing S by 4. By this division 
we shall get wholes and a fraction; let the wholes be 
represented by @ and the numerator of the fraction hy RB. 


We thon have S q+ or S=AQ+R. Now if, the 
given number of solar days being D, we have to divide D 
by +4 to get the number of adhim4sa months, but as 


we wish to divide by @ alone, we must subtract from D 
a number 1, which will be found by the equation 


D R 
-P p-x 4 _p(_2 
QB ~r-0( 45) x=0(723) 


As AQ +2 is equal to S, we have x-De, where § is the 


number of solar days in a caturyuga, which must necessarily 
be a divisor in this part of the calculation (Schram). 


P, 42, 1. 31.—As one finaratra day sums up in 635933 
lunar days (see p. 37, 1. 17), we have again the equation 
ett) ia aba (cet) or X=Z (48 $825) 


where Z represents the number of the given Innar daya, 


P. 44, 1 1—The nomber 720,635,951,963 is not 
correct, as we have seen in note a a 27. It is too 
by 28 days. But the number of adhimisa days, 
21,829,849,018 (1. 10), is also 28 daya too great. So the 
difference is again correct. There is the same fault as at 
p.27. The calculation onght to ran as follows :—The par- 
tial civil days which have elapsed up to our gange-date are 
720,635,951,935. This number is given, and what we 


ANNOTATIONS. 373 


want to find is how many Indian years and months are 
equal to this sum of days. First we multiply the num- 
ber by 55,739 and divide the product by 3,506,481; the 
quotient is 11,455,224,5753¢¢ere¢ Unaratra days. Weadd 
11,455,224,575 to the civil days; the sum is 732,091,176,51G 
lunar days. Dividing this number by 30, we get as qno- 
tient 24,403,030,217 lunar months (and no fraction; so we 
see that the date in question consists of a number of 
months only, or, what is the same, that the date corre- 
sponds to the beginning of a month). Multiplying the 
lunar months by 5341 and dividing the product by 178,111, 
we get 727,661,63317$77¢ adhimfsa months; 727,661,633 
adhimaisa months subtracted from the 24,403,030,217 
lunar months give 23,675,377,584 solar months, which 
divided by 12 give 1,972,948,132 years aud no fraction. 
So we find the given date corresponding not only to 
the beginning of a month, but also to that of a year. We 
find the same number of years of which the gauge-date 
consists (see p. 29, L 17) (Schram), 


P. 45, |. 12.—Thia rule must indeed be based on some 
complete misunderstanding, for it is absolutely « toneous, 
as Alberuni rightly remarks (Schram), 


P. 46, 1. 1.—-If we calculate from the beginning of the 
kalpa or the caturyuga, there are in the epoch neither 
fractions of the adhimfsa months nor of inaratra days; 
but as the great number of days embraced by such long 
periods makes the calculation wearisome, the methods set 
forth in this chapter start neither from the beginning of 
the kalpa nor from that of the caturyuga, but from dates 
chosen arbitrarily and nearer to the time for which they 
are to be employed, As such epochs are not free from 
fractions of the adhimasa months and finardtra days, these 
fractions must be taken into account (Schram). 


P. 46, 1.27.—The nnmbers employed here do nat belong 
to Brahmagupta’s, but to Pulisa’s aystem. The year taken 
as epoch is the year 587 Sakak4la. As we have seen, p. 31, 
ll. 810, that in the moment of the beginning of our 
gauge-date or of the year SakakAla 953, there have elapsed 
3,244,132 years of the caturyuga, there must have elapsed 


374 ALBERUNTS INDIA. 


3,243,766 years of the caturyuga till the beginning of the 
year 5&7 Sakakila We must now first eal ate the 
adhimfsa months and fnarftra days for this epoch. After 
Pulisa’s method (p. 41, 1. 29), we have: 3,243,766 years 
are equal to 38,925,192 solar months or 1,167,755,760 
solar days. This number multiplied by 271 and divided 
by 4,050,000 gives 78,13839$5. As here the nearest num- 
ber is to be taken, we get 78,139, which, subtracted from 
1,167,755,760, gives 1,167,677,621. This latter number 
divided by 976 gives as the number of sdhimfsa months 
1,196,391 ¥3s- Now 1,196,391 adhimisa months are eqnal 
to 35,891,730 adhimfisa days, which, added to 1,167,755,760 
solar days, give 1,203,647,490 lunar days. According to 
Pulisa’s theory (see p. 26, 1. 9), there are in a caturyuga 
1,603,000,080 lunar and 25,082,280 finaratra days; so one 
Gnaratra day sums up in 6393373 Innar days, Therefore 
we shonld have to divide the given number of lunar days 
Z by 6365343, but we prefer to snbtract from Z a certain 
number X, and to divide the reat by 6319 or 49°. The 
number X will be given by the equation eters = ag =

_ Now JZ being equal to 1,203,647,490 lunar days, 11 Z will 
be equal to 13,240,122,390 lunar days; this nomber di- 
vided by 111,573 gives 118,667y;;"s;7s. Taking the nearest 
number, we subtract 118,668 from 1 3,240,122,390 and get 
- 13,240,003,722, which divided by 703 gives 18,833,575¢35 
as the number of finaritra days. This added to the 
1,203,647,490 lunar days gives for the date of our epoch 
the number of civil days 1,184,813,915. 

This number divided by 7 gives § as remainder. Now 
the last day before the present caturyuga was a Mon- 
day (see p. 33, 1. 11), therefore the last day before our epoch 
is a Saturday, and any number of days elapsed since 
that epoch if divided by 7 will indicate by the remainder, 
the week-day counted from erro | as 1, a8 it is said,

as thoroughly correct. Instead of multiplying the partial 
solar daya by zyiiton, we multiply them by ie Pahioh

Aa besides the whole adhimfisa months there is yet a 
fraction of 57, adhimisa months in our epoch, we add 5 
before dividing by 976. The calculation of the fivardtra 
days has already been explained; but as in our epoch 
besides the whole finardtra daya there is still a fraction of 
$o5 Onaratra days, we must add 497 before dividivg by 
703. The whole proceeding is thus explained (Schram). 


P. 48, 1. 11.—The calculation has been made for the 
complete years elapsed Lefore our gange-date. So we get 
the week-day of the last day defore the first Caitra of the

The first day of this epoch corresponds to the day 
1,964,031 of the Julian period. Adding 133,655 to 
1,964,031, we have for the first Caitra 953 the day 
2,097,686 of the Julian period, as it ought to be (Schram),

P. 50, 1. 1.—The method here employed is based on 
Pulisa’s theory, According to this theory, the solar days 
must be divided by 976¢‘¢s's, to get the adhimasa months.

or at least equal to £32593, So the multiplications and 
divisions of this method are explained. 

The constant numbers which are to be added, are in- 
herent to the epoch. The year 888 Sakak4la corresponds 
to the year 3,244,067 of the caturyuga; 3,244,067 yeara 
are equal to 38,928,804 so.ar months, or 1,167,864,120 
solar days. These solar months multiplied by 66,389 and 
divided by 2,160,000 give 1,196,5027£$S85 imisa 
months, or 35,895,060 adhimiisa days. This added to the 
1,167,864,120 solar days gives 1,203,759,180 lunar days. 
Eleven times this number is equal to 13,241,350,980 ; this 
latter number divided by 111,573 gives 118678,9945%, 
or the nearest number 118,679. Subtracting this from 
13,241,350,980, the remainder is 13,241,232,301, which 
being divided by 703, gives 18,835,323753 finarfitra days; 
these days subtracted from the lunar days give for the 
number of civil days 1,184,923,857. Dividing this last 
number by 7, we get the remainder 5; and as the last day 
before the  prare caturyuga was 8 Monday (see p. 33, 
L 11), the day before the epoch here adopted is a 
Saturday, so that any number of days elapsed since that 
epoch, if divided by 7, will indicate by the remainder

t sate & counted from Sunday ast. The first day 
of.this epoch corresponds to the day 2,073,973 of the 
Julian period. We have found in our epoch the fraction 
of adhimisa month 749425, which is equal to econ sees 


or very neatly yofzy adhimisa month, so we must add 
661 before dividing by 29282. 


The fraction of finaritra days #32 is equal to a,6ootss 
or nearly to sYores Therefore we must add 69,601 before 
dividing by 210,902. Alberuni has, instead of this number 


69,601, the number 64,106, 4 instead of 9, and the last 
three numbers reversed (Schram). 


P. 50, b. 35.—We had 780 months; adding thereto the 
23 adhimiza months, we have 803 months, which being 
multiplied by 30 give 24090, and not 24060 daya. All the 
following faults are the consequences of this one (Schram), 


P. 51, 1. 2.—It ought to be “adding thereto 69,601, we

srovoz, te, the avamas.” (In the Arabic text, p. , 17, 
the reading of the MS, onght not to have been altered.) 
The correct result is 23,713 civil days. If we divide 
this number by 7, we find the remainder 4, which shows 
again that the last day before our gange-date is a 
Wednesday. By adding 23,713 to 2,073,973, we get for 
the first Caitra 953 the day 2,097,686 of the Julian period, 
a3 it ought to be (Schram). 


P. 51, J. 4.—Read 377, instead of 307. 


P. §1, 1, 9—This method works with numbers much 
less accnrate than the preceding ones, It is assumed that 
one adhim4sa month sums up in 324solar months, So the 
solar months are divided by 327 or by 225, or, what is the 
same, they are multiplied by siz. For the time within 
which an finaratra day sums up, there is simply taken 
633%, and the lunar days are divided by 63}¢ or 433, or, 
what is the eame, multiplied by 7';. The epoch corre- 
sponds to the year 427 kila, or the year 3,243,606 
of the caturyuga. This number of years is equal to 
38,923,272 solar months, which, multiplied by 66,389 
and divided by 2,160,000, give 1,196,33130¢06 adhimasa 
months. The author has taken 1,196,332 adhimasa months 
and neglected the little fraction »%355, 80 that he has no 
fractions of adhimdsa months, These 1,196,332 adhimisa 
tmonthe added to the 38,923,272 solar months give 
40,119,604 lunar months or 1,203.588,120 lunar days. 
Multiplying by 11, we have 13,239,469,320, which divided 
by 111,573 gives 118,661 94475 or 118,662. Subtracting 
this from 13,239,469,320, we have 13,239,350,658, which 
divided by 703 gives 18,832,6468§3 for the number of 
Qnaratra days. So the fraction of finardtra days is $5%, 
very near to that adopted by the author of the method, viz., 
$43. By subtracting the Gnaratra days from the lunar days 
we get as the number of civil days 1,184,755,474, which 
is divisible by 7. So, as the last day before the caturyuga 
was Monday, the last day before this epoch is also Monday, 
and the number of days elapsed since this epoch if divided 
by 7, will give a remainder which indicates the week-day,

counting Tuesday as 1. The first aay of this epoch corre- 
aponds to the day 1,905,590 of the Julian period (Schram). 


P. 51, 1, 24 —It is easily nnderstood why this method 
is called that of the Siddhanta of the Greeks. It is assumed 
that an adhimésa month sums up in 32$ or 22® solar months. 
Now 22° solar months are equal to 4? solar years, There- 
fore this method is apparently an application of the cycle 
of nineteen years of the Greeks (Schram). 


P. 52, lL. 2.—32 months 17 days 8 ghati and 34 cashaka 
are only another expression for 32} months (Schram), 


P. 52, 1. 10.—The number of civil days is 192096; 
dividing by 7, we have as remainder 2. As in this method 
(see note to p. 51, 1.9) Toesday is to be reckoned as 1, 
this gives for the last day before our gauge-date Wednes- 
day. Adding 192,096 to 1,905,590, we get as the first 
Caitra 953 the day 2,097,686 of the Julian period, as it 
ought to be (Schram).

tables and calculations, Whether it was an original com- 
position in Arabic or translated from Sanskrit, and from 
what original, we do not learn from him. The word seems 
to be an Arabio rendering of ahargana. Alberuni quotes 
irom this book the computation of an era the epoch of 
which falls 40,081 days later than that of the Persian era, 
and compares it with the gange-date (p. 53). 


P. 52, L. 22,—If the epoch should fall 40,081 days after 
that of the era Yardajird, it would fall on the first Caitra 
of the year 664 Sakakala; but this is not the case. The 
first of Sha'bin of the year 197 coincides with the begin- 
ning of Vaisikha 735. As there are 72 years to be sub- 
tracted, we should come to Vaiéikha 663, and to begin 
with the beginning of a year, the epoch must be postponed 
to Caitra 664. But this is of no importance, as we shall 
see that Alberuni altogether misunderstood the method 
here given (Schram). nik

P. 52, 1. 24.—These two dates do not agree te a day. 
The first Ferwerdinmah Yazdajird coincides with 16th 
June 632; 40,081 days later was Monday, 12th March 
742, whilst the 21st Daimah of the year 110 of Yazdajird 
corresponds to Sunday, 13th March 742, But as the date 
itself is erroneous, this is of no importance (Schram). 


P, 52, 1. 27.—As the numbers which form multiplica- 
tions and divisions in this method are identical with those 
of the Pafica Siddhantika (p. 51), we can reckon the cor- 
stants by the directions there given, The epoch of the 
method of Al-harkan is the beginning of Sha‘ban of the 
yeat 197. But this date corresponds to the beginning 
of Vaigakha 735 SakakSla. So we snould have for this 
date the following calculation :—Snubtracting 427 from 735 
years and 1 month, we get 308 years 1 month, or 3697 
‘moonths ; 3697 multiplied by 7 and divided by 228 gives 
for the number of adhimisa months 113335; the 113 
adhimisa months added to the 3697 solat months give 
3810 lunar months or 114,300 lunar days. This number 
multiplied by 11 is 1,257,300; we add 514, which gives 
US 1,257,814; this divided by 703 gives for the number 
of fnaritra days 17893$3. So we should have all the 
numbers wanted for out epoch if, in fact, this epoch were 
the true epoch, Fxtwe have iv add 864 months to the 
interval. Therefore these 864 months, which must always 
ve added, must first be subtracted from the epoch, so that 
this latter is thrown back by 72 years. Now 72 years or 
864 solar months multiplied by 7 and divided by 228 give 
the number of 2633§ adhimasa mouths. These tocether 
with the 864 solar months are 890 lunar months or 26,700 
lunar days, which multiplied by 11 and divided by 703 
give 4172$5 finaritra days. So we have to subtract from 
the numbers first fonnd 26322 adhimésa months and 
417743 Qnaratra days, The number of adhimfsa months 
inherent to our true epoch wili then be 113325—26233= 
86223, or with sufficient accuracy 87 without a fraction, 
and the number of finardtra days 1789333 —4179335= 
1371383. Therefore no fraction is to be added to the 
adhimasa months, whilst to the finaratra days there must 


be added 383, or nearly +3*28, Therefore we must add 28 


{not 38) before multiplying by yy. The 114,300 lunar

days of the first epoch diminished by the 26,700 lunar 
days of the 72 years, give 87,600 lunar days. Subtract- 
ing therefrom 1371 finaratra days, we have 86,229 civil 
days, which being divided by 7 give as remainder 3. So — 
the last day before this epoch is Thursday, and the number 
of days elapsed since the epoch of this method, if divided 
by 7, will give a remainder indicating the week-day, count- 
ing Friday as 1. The first day of this epoch corresponds 
to the day 1,991,819 of the Julian period (Schram). 


P. 53, L. 1.—It must be 28, not 38 (see preceding note) 
(Schram), 


P. 53, 1.6.—We must add 1, if we wish to have the week- 
day of the date itself, not that of the last day before it. 


P. 53, 1.8.—Here Friday is considered as the first day 
of the week, not, as in the Indian books, Sunday. This 
ought to have been remarked (Schram). 


P. 53, 1. 9.—Alberuni’s notes to this method of Al- 
harkan are perhaps the weakest part of his work. His 
very first remark ehows a complete misunderstanding of 
the whole calculation. The method ia correct, for the 
months of the seventy-two years with which it begins are 
solar. If, as Alberuni would have them, they were lunar, 
and the rest of the months, as he understands it, were lunar 
too, then the calculation would simply be nonsense; for 
finding adhimasa months is nothing else than finding the 
number which we must add to convert solar months into 
lunar ones. But when the months are already lunar, how 
can one add anything to them to make them once more 
. lunar? (Schram). 


P. 53, 1. 15.—The example he works out is es erroneous 
as the remarks on the method itself. It must be clear to 
anybody who examines the method given on p. 52, that by 
the words (1. 29), “ Add thereto the months which have 
elapsed between the firat of Sha‘ban of the year 197 and 
the first of the month in which you happen to be,” there 
can only be meant solar months. The author fixed the 
initial epoch in his calendar by saying “1 Shabin 197,” 
instead of fixing it in the Indian calendar by saying 


ANNOTATIONS, 381 


“ first Vaigakha 735.” This accidental circumstance, which 
is of no consequence, induced Alberuni to think that he 
was to take the interval in lunar months, as the Arabic 
calendar has only lunar months, and he did not notice 
that lunar months in this part of the calenlation would be 
absolutely impossible. He takes, in fact, in the example, 
the interval in lunar months, for there are 2695 Innar 
months between the first Sha ban 197 and first Rabi‘ I. 422, 
and to these 2695 lunar months he adds the 864 months 
which he knows to be solar. Then he changes all these 
mingled months, of which the greatest part are already 
lunar, to lunar ones, as if they all were solar, and at last 
he wonders that the resnli is nonsense, end tries to amend 
the method, The only fault in the matter is that he did 
not nuderstand the method. 

If we wish to exemplify the method of the canon .Al- 
harkan in the case of our gauge-date, zc. the first Caitra 
953 Sakakale, we must proceed as follows :—Subtracting 
from 953 years 735 years 1 month, we get as interval 217 
years I1 months or 2615 solar months; adding thereto 
864 solar months, we have 3479 solar months. This 
multiplied by 7 and divided by 228 gives for the number 
of imisa months 106}$%; adding the 106 adhimisa 
months to the 3479 solar months, we get 3585 lunar 
months, or 197,550 lnnat days. We add 28, and multi- 
plying 107,578 by 11, we have 1,183,358, which number 
divided by 703 gives the number 1683733 for the finaratra 
days. Subtracting the 1683 fimardtra days from the 
107,550 lunar days, we have 105,867 civil days. We 
add 1 iu order to get the week-day of the first Caitra 953, 
and dividing by 7, we get as remainder 7. And as here 
Friday is cousidered as 1,80 7 corresponds to Thursday, 
and the first Caitra 953 is found to be Thnrsday. By 
adding 105,867 to 1,991,819 we have for the first Caitra 
of the year 953 the day 2,097,686 of the Julian period, as 
it ought to be (Schram). 


P. 53, L 33.—The emendation is as erroneons as the 
example was, The 25,958 days are counted from the 
epoch falling 40,081 days after that of Yazdajird to the 
first Shabin 197. But 25,958. days are equal to 879 
Arahic months, or 73 years and 3 months, Further, ha

takes again the interval in lunar months, so that now in 
the amended method he has nothing but lunar moriths, 
which he changes to lunar months as if they were solar, 
So he gets a number which is, of course, absolutely errone- 
ous, bot he thinks it to be correct, for in the last instance 
he commits a new fault by subtracting 1 instead of adding 
it. Andso by an accidental combination of different faults 
he finds by chance a week-day which agrees with that of 
the day before our gange-date (Schranz). 


P, 54, 1. 12.—As the multiplications and divisions of 
this method have already been explained in the note to 
pp. 36 and 37, we have here to account for the constant 
numbers ouly which are inherent to the epoch. The 
epoch is 854 Sakakala, which corresponds to the year 
1,972,948,033 of the kalpa, Multiplying 1,972,948,033 
by 12, we find 23,675,376,396 solar months, which mul- 
tiplied by 1,593,300,000, the adhimfsa months of a kalpa, 
and divided by § 1,840,000,000, the solar months of a kalpa, 
give the quotient 727,661,5974%%5 23 the number of 
adhimasa months. Adding the 727,661,507 adhimisa 
months to the 123,675,376,396 solar months, we fea 
24,403,037.993 lunar months or 732,091,139,790 lunar 
days. This cer number multiplied by 25 pep eea the 
@nardtra days of a kalpa, and divided by 1,602,999,000,000, 
the lunar days of a kalpa, gives for the number of fioaratra 
days 11,455,224,000sfse3- Subtracting the 11,455,224,000 
finaritra days from the 732,091,139,790 lunar days, we 
find as the number of civil days elapsed from the begin- 
ning of the kalpa to this epoch 720,635,915,790, a number 
which divided by 7 gives as remainder 0. So, as the last 
day preceding the kalpa was a Saturday (see p. 28, L 31), 
the last, day before this epoch is also a Saturday, and 
any number of days elapsed since this epoch, if divided 
by 7, shows by its remainder the week-day counted from 
Sunday as t. The fraction of the adhimasa months in- 
herent to the epoch haa been found to be S455. Now 
Vit’s is equal to =OTAt09, or very nearly 27: so we add 29 
before dividing by 65. The fraction of the huaratra days 

267073 
is $4352). Now again $$3$84 is equal to eesshaaee 2, or 
nearly $§5 ; so we add 686 before dividing by 703. 


ANNOTATIONS. 383 


The first day of this epoch coincides with the day 
2,061,541 of the Julian period (Schram), 


P. 55, L 5.—This method consists in finding first the 
difference of the mean longitude of aun and moon. The 
numbers are Pulisa’s, There are in a caturynga 4,320,000 
tevolutions of the sun, and 57,753,336 revolutions of the 
moon, The difference, 53,433,336, is the number of lunar 
months. In every lunar month the moon gains one revolu- 
tion or 360 degrees aver the aun. Dividing 53,433,336 by 
the solar years 4,320,000, we find as the number of lunar 
months belonging to one solar year 12323330. So in every 
solar year the moon gains over the sun 12133555 revolu- 
tions, 

Omitting the whole revolutions which have no interest, 
the moon gains over the sun 137376 revolutions, or, what 
is the same, 132y'50% degrees. Now yyy degrees are equal 
to 46;%5 or to 4675 minutes. So the moon gains over 
the sun in every solar year 132 degrees 4634 minutes, 
By multiplying the number of years by 132 degrees 
4634 minutes, we find the nnmber of degrees which 
the moon has gained in the given interval over the 
sun. Now if in the beginning of this epoch sun and 
moon had been together, this would be the difference 
of the mean longitude of sun and moon, But as this 
was only in the beginning of the caturynga, but not at 
the moment of our epoch, there is an initial differ- 
ence between the longitudes of sun and moon which 
must be added, Our epoch, or the year 821 Sakakila, 
correspouds to the year 3,244,000 of the caturyuga, 
Multiplying 3,244,000 by the number of lunar months 
53,433,336, aud dividing by the number of solar years 
4,320,000, we find that in these 3,244,000 years the 
moon gained over the sun 40,124,47733% revolutions, 
Dropping again the whole revolutions, we see that the 
moon was in advance of the sun at the moment of our 
epoch by 35% revolutions, or 112 degreea. Therefore these 
112 degrees must be added, and all the numbers of this 
method find in this their explanation. The result for our 
gauge-date, 358° 41’ 46”, is the number of degrees, minutes, 
and seconds by which the moon is in advance of the sun 
at the moment of the beginning of the aolar year 821, that 


384 ALBERUNPS INDIA. 


is, in the moment when the sun enters Aries. As in the 
beginning of the luni-solar year sun and moon must have 
been in conjunction, the beginning of the luni-solar year 
has preceded that of the solar year by an interval which 
was just sufficient for the moon to make 358° 41’ 46” in 
advance of the enn. Now as the moon gains 360 degrees in 
a lunar month or 30 lunar days, so she gains 12° in every 
Invar day. Therefore dividing 358° 41° 46” by 12, we get 
the number of lunar days and fractions by which the loni- 
solar year’s beginning preceded that of the solar year. The 
fractions of the lunar days are changed to ghatis and casha- 
kas. Thereby we get 29 days 53 ghatis 29 cashakas as the 
time by which the beginning of the Inni-solar year pre- 
ceded the sun’s entering Aries, in agreement with the frac- 
tion of the adhimisa month found on p. 31,1 17. For 
44035 adhimasa months are also equal to 29 days 53 ghatts 
29 cashakas. The number 27 days 23 ghatis 29 cashakas 
which he gives, p. §§, 1. 25,.is obtained by dividing 328° 
4i’ 46", and not 358° 41’ 46", by 12 (Schram). 


- P.§5,117.—The Arabic manuscript has 328 instead 
of 358. 


P. 55,1. 33.—The number is 132° 4624, and not 132° 46’ 
34” (as the Arabic eke has). Therefore the portio 
anni is not 11° 3° 52" so”, but 11 days 3 ghatis 53 
cashakas 24"; and the portio mensis uot o° 55° 19" 24!" 
10", bnt o days §§ ghatts tg cashakas 27% 

The reason of this calculation is the following :—In 
a year or 12 solar months the moon gains over the sun 
132° 463%. As she gains 12 degrees im every lunar day, 
the twelfth part of these degrees will represent the sum 
of lunar days and their fractions which the solar year con- 
tains over 360, that is to say, the sum of adhimisa days 
and their fractions. One solar month containing o 
adhimasa days 55 ghatis 19 cashakas 27'", the number of 
solar months within which one adhimfsa month or 30 
lunar days sum up, will be found by dividing 30 days by 
o days 55 ghatis 19 cashakas 27". This gives 2 years 8 
months 16 days 3 ghati §5 cashaka,

civil days of a kalpa, viz., 1,577,916,450,000. So we get the 
revolutions and part of a revolution which the planet has 
made during the time elapsed since the beginning of the 
kaliynga, But in the beginning of the kaliyuga all planets 
have not been in conjunction; this was only the case in 
the beginning of the kalpa. Therefore to the fractions 
of revolutions which the planet made aince tha beginning 
of the kaliyuga, we muat add its place at this begin- 
ning itself, ic. the fraction of a revolution which every 
planet had at the beginning of the kaliyuga, the whole 
revolutions being of no interest. But Brahmagupta adds 
these numbers before dividing by the civil days of the 
kalpa, and this ia quite natural, both fractions having by 
this proceeding the same divisor. Therefore what he calls 
the basis, ought to be the fraction of every planet at the 
beginning of the kaliyuga multiplied by the civil days of 
the kalpa; but he has made a great mistake. Instead 
of multiplying the fractiona by the civil days of a kalpa, 
viz., 1,577,916,450,000, he bas multiplied them by the 

ears of a kalpa, viz., 4,320,000,000, Therefore all num- 

rs given on p. 60 as the bases are entirely erroneous. 
To find the fractions for each planet and the bases we have 
the following calculation:—From the beginning of the kalpa 
to that of the kaliyuga there have elapsed 1,972,944,000 
years; so to gat the places of the planets at the beginning 
of the kaliynga we ought to multiply the revolutions 
of each planet by 1,972,944,000, and to divide them by 
the years of a kalpa, 4,320,000,000. As these two num- 
bers have the common divisor 432,000, we multiply the 
revolutions of each planet by 4567 and divide them by 
10,000, Thia will give ua the place of the planet at the 
beginning of the kaliyuga. We have thus for the single 
planets :— 

For Mars, 2,296,828,522 revolutions multiplied by 4567

For J upiter, 364,226,455 revolutions multiplied by 4567

For Venus, 7,022,389,492 revolutions multiplied by

For Saturn, 146,567,298 revolutions multiplied by 4567

and his place is °y%% 9949 revolutions. 

For the sun's apeis, 480 revolutions multiplied by 4567

The detail in the history of KAbul here alluded to is 
not known from other sources, e.g. Balddhurt. During the 
Omayya Kaliphate of Damascus, both Kabul and Sijis- 
tan bravely fought sgainst the Muslims. During certain 
years they wers subdued and had to pay tribute, but 
Kfbul always remained under the sway of its Hindu 
(Brahmin) kings of the Pala dynasty, It was incorporated 
into the Khalifa empire under the Abbaside Ma’miin; it 
had to receive a Muslim governor, but retained at his side

the Hindn Shah. The same donble rule existed in Khw§- 
rizm. 
About A.D. 950-975 the city of Kabul was already 
Maslim, whilst the suburb was inhabited by the Hindus 
and by Jews). Ka4bul was the coronation-city for the Pala 
ynasty, a3 Kéniosberg in Prussia for. the Hohenzollerns, 
Even when they ceased to reside in Kabul, they had to be 
crowned there. 

By the Ispahbad, mentioned by Alberuni, I under- 
stand the Hindu governor who ruled over the city for the 
Pala king. Our author applies a title of the Sasanian. 
empire to the official of a Hindu empire. 

In what year the negotiation referred to by Alberuni 
took place is not known. Perhaps under Ma’min, when 
the city was definitely ceded to the Muslim conquerors. 

It seems to have been the public opinion among Mus- 
lims that Hindus considered fornication as lawful, as Ibn 
Khurdadhbih expresses it (Elliot “History of India,” i. 
13), whilst, according to Alberuni, they considered it in- 
deed as unlawful, but were lax in punishing it.

P. 177.—-The here-mentioned bhtshma-pafica-rdtri seems

Wilson, “ Essays and Lectures,” ii. 203. 


P 177.—The name Gaur-t-r, ¥yy5, occurs also ii, 179, 
and is apparently a vernacular form for gaurt-iritiyd. Cf. 
Wilson, 4. 4 p. 185. 


P. 178.—With this calendar of festivals are to be com-

laires des Hindous, Paris, 1834. This chapter, as well as 
the preceding one, would perhaps receive much light from 
the Jyotiroidhdbharanam, chap. xxi. Cf, Weber, “ Journal 
of the German Oriental Society,” vol. xxii. p. 719, and 
Ziv. p. 399 

This chapter has been translated into Persian by Abi- 
Said Gardezi (manuscript of the Bodleian Library in 
Oxford, Ouseley 240). Cf note to ii. 6. 


P. 178, Agdts—The Arabic has only ceyS', which 
might be aomething like ajya-divasa. 

Muttai.—This pronunciation is given by the mannescript. 
The name, not to be confounded with the Arabic name 
Matté (Matthwus), is perhaps identical with the name of 
a prince of Siwistan mentioned by Elliot, * History of 
India,” 3. 145-153.

ingly the last line must ran thus: “(Le 1 day 15' 30% 224

P. 190, 1. 7.—The bhdgahdra is not 572, a3 the manu- 
script has, but 576, and the fraction {7% (Schram). 


P, 190.—Audiatta (2). The name is written cs\e ge 4,1. 
A more literal rendering is this: “And that which A. the 


ANNOTATIONS, 399 


son of S. has dictated of the same (subject), is based on 
the theory of Pulisa.” This author seems to have been 
contemporaneous with Alberuni, as also Samaya (ii. 188).

P. 197.—The names of the common karanas are found 
in Strya-Siddhdnta, ii. 69, note. 

The other names are Indian numerals of a vernacular 
stamp, The corresponding Sindhi forms are barkhu (2), bid, 
trid, cothd, panjo, chahd, sat6, athd, nad, daho, ydrhé, bard, 
térhé, codhd. Cf. Trumpp, “Sindhi Grammar,” pp. 158, 174. 
The form pancdhé (=the 15th) has, as far as 1 can see, 1» 
analogy in the vernacular dialects. 


P. 199.—Sarirkrénti means the sun’s entrance into a sign 
of the zodiac. Cf Sérya-Siddhdnta, xiv. 10, note. 


P. 200. Alkindi.—The way in which this scholar has 
transformed the Hindu theory of the karanas is iustruc- 
tive, as ehowing how Indian subjects were handled by the 
Arabs before Alberuni, even by the most learned and 
enlightened among them. The first knowledge of these 
things was probably communicated to the Arabs by the 
translation of the Brahma-Siddhdnta (Sindhind) and Khan- 
dakhddyaka (Arkand) of Brahmagupta. On Alkindi, ¢7.

G. Fliigel, Alkinds, genannt der Philosoph der Araber,

P. 201.—The names of the vish{is,as taken from the 
Sradhava (of Mahideva?—cf. note to ii, 120), are not 
known to me from a Sanskrit source. However, vadand- 
mukha, ghora, and kilardiri seem to be certain. The 
words s8 and Jly might be plava and jodla, bat jis? 

The other series of names of the vishfis, according to 
Alkindt, which by a mistake have been omitted in the 
Arabic text, may be transliterated in this way :— 


(1.) Shilpt (¢dlapadi 2). 
(2.) Jamadtid (ydmyodadhi /). 
(3.) Ghora, 
(4.) Nastarinish. 
(5.) Darunt (dhdrint 7). 
(6.) Kayali. 
- (7.) Bahay&mani, 
{8.) Bikata (vyakte ?). 


P. 204. On the yogas.—The contents of this chapter are 
near akin to those of chap. xi. of the Sdrya-Siddhdnta. 
Compare algo in the same book ii. 65,66. The technical 
term pdia, which literally means fall (for its astrological 
meaning, ¢f. J. ¢. xi. 5, note), has in Arabic been rendered 
by the word by, ic. falling (page f, 11, 24), here ii. 207, 
208, 209. In the Arabic text on p. 4, 7, read joy instead 
of #4, and to the word w+, 1, 16, it must be added that 
the manuscript has «2.

from Kashmir who had become a Muslim, and wanted, by 
means of an Arabic book, to be informed on certain chap- 
ters of Hindu astrology, The pronunciation Sydvabala is 
not certain. The Arabic manuscript has siydwpal,

P. 208.—On the Brahmin Bhaffila, of. note to i. 157. 
The names of the yogas which he mentions are not known

P. 210.—With the names of this table ef. Sdrya-Sid- 
diinta, ii. 65, note (also p. 432). The ,* of the Arabic 
seems to be a mistake for pS45 vishkambha ; No. 15, +5, o 
mistake for +5, ganda. 

Instead of dyushmant (name of the third yoga), the 
Arabic has aS, (rdjakama ?); instead of ryatipdta it has 
whus (gatipdia ?). 


P, 211.—The contents of this astrological chapter are 
principally taken from the Zaghujdtakem (i.e. the smaller 
book of nativity) by Vardhamihira, of which the chapters 
i. ii. have been translated . Weber (Indische Studien, 
2, 277 8eq.), whilst the ier has been translated by 

HL. Jacobi (De Astrologia Indice lor& appellate origini- 
bus,. Accedunt Laghujdtaki capita inedita iii—xii., Bonn, 
1872). Alberuni does not always adhere to the order of 
the paragraphs which we have in the Sanskrit text, and 
for certain parts he seems to have drawn from some com- 
mentary. 

The exact meaning of the term seconds of the stars (the 
same page, ll. 23, 24), eee) ty, is not known to me. 


Pp. 213-215.—The table of planeés is taken from chapters 
ii. iii, iv. of the Laghujdtakam. 
' For the reading of the terms natsargika, vimiéra, and 
shaddya (p. 215), I am indebted to Prof. H. Jacobi, Kiel. 
The number 25, 45, in the colamn with the heading The 
scale of their magnitude, seems to be a mistake for 3, ¢. 


Pp. 217-219.—This table of the zodiacal signs has been
