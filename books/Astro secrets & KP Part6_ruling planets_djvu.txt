Balance of Guru dasa (Vimshottari) at birth O Year, 11 
Months, 8 days. 


In the above chart, Mars, Venus, Mercury and Ketu are in 
the fourth house, all in Scorpio. In Uttara Kalamritha, Kalidas 
elucidates that nodes offer the results of the planets with 
which they are conjoined or by which they are aspected, if 
any, only when there is no conjunction or no aspect do the 
nodes offer the results of the lords of the signs where they 
were deposited. 


RULING PLANT 


This native had won a prize in the lottery. (His ticket 
No.022220). It was on 23-12-1969. He was running Budha 
dasa, Ketu bhukti, Sani anthra at thai time. Ketu bhukti started 
on 10-3-1969 and ended on 7-3-1970. 


Ketu is in the constellation of Budha lord of 12. 
Budha, Dasanatha, is lord of 12. 
Saturn, is in 12h bhava. 


According to Hindu traditional astrology, the occupant of a 
bhava, the bhava lord and the planet conjoined with the lord 
when all three are connected with the 12m house, how 5s tit 
that the native had gains without pains? Powertully influence 
that bhava. Here sani, Budha and Ketu are strongly connected 
ta 12° house. 


Look : sub-lord is the deciding factor. 


Ketu is in the sub of Venus lord of 11. {Constellation lord is 
the owner of 12h house means investment; gives money to 
buy the ticket. Sub-lord, lord of 11, promises gain, profit, 
fulfillment of desire. Hence Ketu is a benetic). 


Budha is in Mars sub. (Mars is a planet to compete, and he 
is lord of 5 ta speculate and also 10). Sh house gives the mind 
to speculate. 10in shows success. Hence Mercury dasa 
contributes to success in competition and gain in speculation. 


Satum is in 12. It is in Satum's star and Sub of Jupiter. 
Jupiter is lord of 6, Victory over enemies. It is conjoined with 
lard of 2, Sun. Jupiter himself is in 3 sub of lord of 11 and also 
in the constellation of Rahu, significator of 10 and 11 houses. 


Therefore, the conjoined penod of Mercury, sub-penod of 
Ketu and Sub-sub Saturn gave him the fortune of winning a 
prize in the lottery on 23-12-1969. 


The amount was received during Mercury dasa, Ketu Bhukti, 
Mercury anthra. 


Hence, ane can note that the sub-lord decides ane's fate: 
the constellation lord Rahu is aspected by Mercury, Lord of 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHAT! 


12m and a Planet in the constellation of the Lord of the 10h ie. 
Moon. 


Kethu is in the sign owned by Venus, Ketu is aspected by 
moon. Lord of the 10" house and by Saturn, a significator of 
Sn and 12 house. 


As the signiticators are many, beneficial significators are to 
be selected, rejecting the useless ones. To select the beneficial 
significators, there are two methods and both have to be 
scrutinized. 


(a) Note the ruling planets at the time of Judgement. 


(b) Note the Sub Lord of the significators. If the Sub Lord is 
one of the significators then the planet deposited in such 
a sub is beneficial, otherwise not. 


Ruling Planets 

(11.38 am. (IST) on 7-2-1971) 
Day Lord sun 

Sign Lord Mercury 
otar Lord Jupiter 
Lagna Lord Mars 


Lagna Star Lord Venus 


{Ketu is in Leo sign, owned by Sun. Rahu ts in Aquarius 
sign, owned by Satum and is aspected by Mars, a ruling planet). 


Ketu is posited in Sun star and sub ts ruled by Jupiter, who 
is Lord of 3rd. Mercury is posited in Moon star and sub of 
Rahu, who is a strong significator as stated above. 


Ketu dasa, Mercury bhukti operate between 26-3-1971 and 
23-3-1972 In this period Ketu anthra will start from 6-5-1977 
and ends on 7-6-1971. Thereafter Venus anthra operates 
upto 6-8-1977. 


Venus is in Jupiter star and sub of Venus, who is significator 
of 3° house and is Lagna Star Lord at the time of Judgement. 
50 Venus may reflect the event in her Sub Sub-period. 


AULING PLANT 


Sun transits in Venus sign (The sign occupied by Ketu at 
the time of birth) in Moon star (Lord of the constellation in 
which the bhukthinatha, Mercury is posited) between 25-5-71 
and 8-6-71. Moon will be in Mars sign - Mercury star on 8th 
and 9h June 19771. Ketu will be in Moon sign - Mercury star. 
So | expect that the native must be transferred by aid week 
of June 1971, which come very correct. 


RULING PLANETS 
NEVER ERR 


{based on Krishnamurti padhdhati) 


Om Gurubhyo Namah. Om Ganpataya Naman. 


The concept and principles of Ruling Planets, to judge the 
day-to-day events as well as the nativity, propounded by our 
revered Guruji Sothidamannan Prof. KS. Krishnamurti, are 
free from any doubts and complications and are indicating the 
results clearly if they are applied properly. This article is neither 
testifying nor in testimony of the principles, but is just to show 
the miraculous and marvellous results. 


At the outset | recall the discussions held in the First ever 
All India Seminar on KP. Astrology on Sub-Sub Lord — 
inaugurated by Sothidamamani Sri K Subramaniam S/o. Late 
Jyotish marthand Prof. KS Krishnamurti on 20" May, 1990 
at Pune, convened by Prof. Dada alias GV. Hasabnis of the 
Shree Phal Jyotirvidya Mandir, Bombay. Throughout the day, 
the Seminar was conducted under the Chairmanship of Shri K. 
Subramaniam, Editor, KP. & Astrology 


On 20th May, 1990 the Moon was transiting in uttara 
Bhadrapada (Uttrattathi} star ruled by Saturn. Since Saturn 
was represented by Rahu, being in the Sign of Saturn and 
Saturn being retrograde, the node Rahu was strongest Ruling 
Planet among Jupiter Moon sign lord}, Saturn (Moon Star Lord) 
to show and depict the minds of delegates as well as the 
discussions. 


While presiding over the first session of the Seminar wherein 
research papers were presented by Prof. Hasabnis, and others 
on the Sub-Sub Lord and its effects, | found that in all the 
cases studied the Ruling Planets ‘Rahu' was present even on 
the date of discussion.

(Note : In case study from VI to X, the longitude of Moon was also 
scrutinized since these were the Horary chart and only Moon reveals 
the mind of the querrent} 


lt can be easily seen that Rahu (Representing Satum) has 
appeared as the strongest significator (Ruling Planet) as Sub- 
sub Lord in 8 cases and as sub-lord in one case and representing 
oatum in one case, which clearly indicates that the discussions 
on scrutiny of Sub-Sub Lord is on the right path. K was 
applauded by the house, when it was revealed to the delegates 
and participants, by me in my concluding address, Thus 
whatever discussions we do the Ruling planets always are 
present, if scruitinised upto Sub-Sub Lord. 


Further on 21st May, Monday, | was to leave Pune by 
Jhelum Express for New Delhi and | went to station at 10.00 
a.m. on 21-05-1990 to know the status of my reservation in 
train for berth and | was much worried when given to 
understand that my number is 31st in the waiting list. | came 
back to the place where | was staying and was worried about 
my journey. 


At about 14.56 hours (1ST), | put a horary question with 
the number 119 which came to me instantly, that whether | 


KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 
will have a happy Journey on 21-05-90 and thereon. 


The Lagna Lord for the horary number was Mercury with 
Moon as its star Lord and Venus as its sub-Lord. 


The Ruling Planets at the time of judgement were, Lagna 
being in Kanya 10°18" and Moon 23°15’28" and being Monday 
- in order of the strength were Lagna Star Lord - Moon; 
Lagna Sign Lord - Mercury Moon Star Lord - Mercury; Moon 
sign Lord - Jupiter, and Day Lord - Moon. Moon is being 
represented by Kethu being in its sign. The sub lord of Moon 
is Moon who signifies 11'°cusp (being its lord) and Kethu, the 
representative of Moon is in the 11th, then it was assured in 
me that the journey will be a happy one, but the delay and 
obstacles can not be ruled out as the Satum was aspecting 
Moon, the Lord of 11th house, the 11th house and Kethu. 


Venus, the sub lord of Horary number also associates the 
Moon and hence due to someone's association | will get the 
reservation and will travel happily with blessings of Lord Ganapati 
was indicated to me by the Ruling Planets. 


| reached the station at Pune at about 4.30p.m. as the 
train was scheduled to leave at 5.40 p.m. but it was announced 
that it will depart only at 9.30 p.m. (see the results of the 
aspect of Satum on Moon, kethu and eleventh house). | was 
much anxious to know about the reservations and | just went 
to one bookstall having the books on the teachings of spiritual 
Gurus and being managed by an elderly person. | just took 
one book on day to day thoughts and it was written for the 
day - ‘Do not worry. Do not be anxious. Just love your God 
and your worries will be over. A faithful smile as well as confident 
one, appeared on my face which was noted by the elderly 
person and he enquired about it to me. | narrated him my 
anxiousness and findings in the book. He then directed me to 
one of the Railway staff and | could get my birth reserved 
before | entered the train, but the effect of Saturn. (i.e. 
delay) was inevitable - which was taken care of by the blessings 
of our Guruji and Lord Ganapathi and | had the most 
comfortable journey in my life till date. 


ING ELAN 
Thus, if applied properly, the results Dy Ruling Planets are 
miraculous and Ruling Planets never Er. 


Good Luck. 


THE CELESTIAL STARS 
THROUGH K.P. 


The MRF. conducted a series of matches in Cricket, last 
year and people all over were glued to their television sets. 
The whole nation was caught with Cricket fever. 


There is a popular saying "Cricket is a game of luck". Though 
the saying is popular, it is debated vociferously both ways. If 
India wins, praise is showered on the players and they become 
"Heroes and Stars", and if they loose fans dismiss them as 
hopeless and as a fiction of politics in a game which is the 
pride and prestige of the nation. 


twas 28th October, 1989, my weekly-off day, and | was 
also one of the TV spectators that day watching the cricket 
match between India and Pakistan, just begun, though | am 
not a Cricket fan. But as an Astrologer, | was keen to see 
whom the "Celestial Stars" favour. Miss Shanthi, my sister-in- 
law, an ardent Cricket fan did not want to wait for hours for 
Knowing the outcome, instead wanted me to tell the result in 
ten minutes, by the time the Openers had barely begun after 
the toss. 


The question she asked "Will India Win the Cricket Match 
against Pakistan?" The number she gave beween 1 and 249 
was "45",

{a} Lagna cusp sub lord Sun in V in the star of Rahu in Ix 
representing Saturn in Vil and Mars in V ts definitely in 
favour of the opponents. V, IX & VII naturally being gain 
to the opponenis. 


(b)3™ cusp sublord Jupiter in lagna in the star of Rahu in IX 
representing Saturn in VIl and Mars in V is repetition of 
the disadvantage explained in (a} above. 


(c) V cusp sublord Mercury in V is in the star of Mars in V, 
only consolidates (a) and (b) above. 


(d}XI cusp sub lord Kethu in III representing Moon by 
occupation of Cancer signifies IV and by occupying Mercury 
star signifies V. Kethu occupying Cancer once again signifies 
V¥ since Moon is in the star of Mars. 


Pakistan (please see significations, counting from the VII) 


(a) Lagna cusp sub lord Mars in the XI in tts own star is 
strongly advantageous. 


(b) Sd cusp sublord Jupiter in VII occupying Rahu star, Rahu 
in Ill is quite favourable. Rahu also signifies lagna and 
the XI by occupying Saturn sign; and by occupying a star 
of Mars. 


(c) ¥V cusp sublord Kethu in Cancer in IX represents Moon in 
the Ath and Mercury in the Al by occupying a Mercury 
star. X and Xl give a boost to prestige and achievements. 


(d)Xl cusp sublord Mercury once again occupying X and 
tenanting a Mars star strongly promotes the X th house 
matters as Mars is in the same Al house. This is a 
signification consolidating resoundingly, the position of the 
Opponent over and above the already quite advantageous 
signification of the "Celestial Stars" as in (a), (b} and (c} 
above. 


The decision 


Quite naturally | said “Pakistan will win decisively" and they 
won decisively by a margin of 36 runs. 


| was quite happy at the end of the match that | have 
learnt “K.P” which is one Science that is sure in the world and 
| repeat my Pranams to Lord Uchista Mahaganapathy, Sri 
K.S.K. our Guruji and living guide in the umpteen doubts that 
crop up in us. 


ARE WE GOING ABROAD 
BY THE NEXT FLIGHT? 


My wife and |, along with my daughter aged 5 years went 
to the Sahar Airport in Bombay to take the Sabena Royal 
Belgian Airlines’ flight to Singapore at 4.00 a.m. on 16-3-90. 
The flight was overbooked and since we did not have confirmed 
seats on the flight we were denied the chance. Naturally, we 
were frustrated. 


| had a standby ticket on Air India which would leave 
Bombay for Singapore on the same day at 745 a.m. We 
tried for that flight and to our entire dissatisfaction, we could 
not take even that flight. 


We were quite unhappy with the feeling of going back to 
our friend's house where we were Staying in transit in Bormbay. 
We were in absolute darkness whether we could take the next 
flight to Singapore, or atleast return to Madras and cancel the 
overseas frip. 


In the above circumstances, | had total confidence in 
astrology (Krishnmaurti system), that it would guide me to 
know the future course of events. | asked my wife who was 
much against cancellation of the trip, to give me a number 
between 1 and 249. She put the question, "Are we going to 
singapore by the next Air India flight?" and gave the number 
100. 1 worked out the cuspal and planetary positions at 12.15 
p.m. for Bombay Latitude, as given below.

For going abroad, | studied the XII cusp sub lord Rahu. 
Rahu in the constellation of Moon in Ill and owning the All 
indicates journey and overseas travel. Hence the answer to 
the horary query is positive confirmation. 


Wth total confidence and faith in the Knshnamurti System, 
| assured my wife and my hosts in Bombay that we are 
definitely going to Singapore by the next Air India flight. The 
next flight was on 18-3-90 and my wife, my daughter, and | 
flew happily to Singapore on 18-3-90 by Air India. 


My pranams to Lord Uchista Mahaganapathy for guiding 
me to delineate the future, and pranams to Pujya Sn 
Krishnamurtiji for giving Us this unfailing and clearcut system. 


A PEEP AT THE MARAKA 
STHANAS AND THE 
BADHAKA STHANA 


On 12-9-90 Sri Gopalan, my colleague and my intimate 
friend brought one of our colleagues for astrological advice. 
smt. Vyjayanthi wanted to know if her younger sister's 
husband, suffering from throat cancer and undergoing 
treatment at Bombay would recover and live long. 


At the outset | suggested that a number between 1-249 
be obtained from her younger sister. But Smt. Vyjayanthi 
preferred to give the number herself as her sister could not 
be contacted on phone because they were in Bombay only 
for this hospitalization having come from Ahmedabad. 


Though it would be round-about and cumbersome, owing 
to the helpless situation | agreed, and she gave the number 
"107". 


| investigated this query at 8-35 p.m. the same day at 
Madras. The cuspal and planetary positions are as follows -

The 3rd house denotes the younger sister. The 7" from the 
gra denotes her husband. Hence | took the IX for the 
ascendant of the person about whom the query Is and 
discussed accordingly. 


The VI tells about the disease 


The VI cusp sub lord is Mercury. Mercury in the IV negates 
recovery. Mercury is in the star of Venus. Venus in the IV 
consolidates the negation. 


It is discouraging that the IV denotes the last phase of 
one's life, or final retirement. 


Mercury is in the sub of Mars in lagna. Mars denotes cancer 
apart from inflammations, cuts and burns. 


Lagna contributes to health and survival. But to my 
dissatisfaction Mars and sublord of Mercury has Moon in its 
constellation, thus weakening its strength of occupying lagna. 


KAISHNAMUATI PADHDHATI 1f 


Mars instead signifies the 7tn and 12 houses there being no 
planets in Vrischika or Mesha, and the 2na by occupying a 
constellation of Moon. 


| was feeling too sad that the vicious circle was complete 
by significations of the makara sthanas, 2, 7 and 12. 


Mars in tts own sub was alarming that the end of life was 
not far away and it would be abrupt. 


The V for recovery if it is strong. 


The V cusp sub lord is Jupiter. Jupiter is in the Ill and owns 
the Xl. No planet occupies the Al. 


Will the person survive? This was a momentary satisfaction 
for me. Jupiter and Kethu occupy the same degree and sub 
of Moon. What if there are no planets in the Al, or no planet 
occupies Jupiter's stars. Kethu by conjunction takes away all 
the strength. 


Badhakasthana 


Jupiter on the contrary is weak by occupying Saturn's star. 
saturn is the badhakathipati for Taurus acscendant. Jupiter ts 
in the sub of Moon. Moon is in Il, a marakasthana. Moon 
signifies 2, 7 and 12 by occupying a martian star. 


Judge the XI for recovery 


XI cusp sub lord is Mars. Mars signifies maraka houses as 
discussed earlier. 


Iwouid not give up 
| Have read KP. "Judge 1, 3 and 8 for longevity" 


| discounted the | and II! because the sub lords concerned 
are Jupiter and Mars which are not fruitful as already detailed 
above. 


The VIII cusp was the last straw on the camel's back, and 
my fresh area for investigation. The sub lord is Venus. Venus 
is in the IV occupying the sub of Mercury in the IV again. 


18 RULING PLANT 


Mercury the sub lord of Venus hits the fatal blow by tenanting 
again a venusian star. 


| sadly went about the Ruling Planets at 8.35 p.m. for the 
timing. They were as follows :- 


Lagna sub ~—- Jupiter 

Lagna star Kethu 

Lagna Lord Mars ~WMesha 
Moon Star Mars 

Moon Rasi Mercury 

Day Mercury 


Lagna sub lord Jupiter's occupation of Moon sub indicated 
to me that the death was too soon. But | would not have the 
guts to inform the lady the next day in office that the death 
of her younger sister's husband was on the threshold. 


| was spared of the predicament. 


As scon as | entered office the next day, Sri R. Gopalan 
informed me that the person concemed passed away on 13- 
9-90 early moming and that Smt. Vyayanthi was on her way 
to take flight to Bombay.

EXAM MARKS 


Miss Suruchi is studying in third year engineering degree 
‘ course. She has failed in four theory subjects in second year 
University exams held in April / May '90; but University has 
allowed herto keep terms in the third year provided she clears 
at least one theory subject (back log} in the first semester of 
this third year. She has also made an application to Pune 
University for “REVALUATION” of her marks in two subjects. 
Her query to me Is :-

Analysis 
| tried to solve this problem in the following manner 
A. To check whether her ambition will be fulfilled or not. 


B. The fulfillment of ambition should be connected with 4m 
house which denotes education 


C. To check whether she will win this litigation. | considered 
this querry as litigation. The reason is that she has applied 
for revaluation of her marks in a paper, which has already 
been assessed once by the exarniner and at the request 
of Miss Suruchi, University will not employ the services of 
another examiner for the reassessment of the paper. In 
other words the assessment has been challenged by the 
applicant through an application given to the University 
for REVALUATION. 


ee RULING PLANT 


lf all the above points come in her favour then | must tie- 
up the case with “Poonaraphoc” Yoga, as Saturn and Moon 
are in conjunction in 6th house. 


Now we shall see for each point what are the rules advocated 
by our Guruji late prof. KS.K. 


a. One's ambition will be fulfilled ifthe sub lord of the 11th 
cusp is the significator of the 1st house. 


In this case sub lord of the 11th cusp is Moon. Moon is 
the house lord of 1st house and posited in 6th house. This 
guarantees fulfillment of desire. 


b. The sub lord of 11th cusp Moon also signifies 4th house as 
Moon is in Venus star and Jupiter Sub. Venus is house 
lord of 4th house. The sub lord Jupiter, though posited in 
Tam house it is beneficially aspecting Qn house i.e. house 
for higher education. So both Venus and Jupiter are 
favourable carrying some negative charge with them being 
posited in 12" house. 


c. To win an appeal or litigation, the sub lord of the 3ra cusp 
should be in a constellation of a planet which ts significator 
of Gh and 11th house. 


In this case the 3rd cusp sub lord is Mercury. Mercury Is in 
Venus star and Venus sub. The sub lord Venus is in the 
constellation of Jupiter. Jupiter is the lord of Gin house Mercury 
in 2™ house is favourable. Venus signifies 4th, 6h and 11th 
houses. Again Venus and Jupiter are favourable with some 
negative force. 


Considering all above points | started thinking that according 
to KP. she must win the litigation Le. she must get through in 
revaluation of Marks. Generally in practice, revaluation is such 
a matter that luckiest only wins. So on one side KP. says she 
will win the race and on the other'side the University has got 
their standard profoma of writing "No change in Marks". What 
to do! My mind was in dilemma. And also there is one more 
point that Saturn and Moon are in conjunction which means 


KAISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI 23 


success only after few attempts. Then how to combine alll 
these points together. University Is not going to examine the 
papers again and again. It will be only and only at one time 
and that's all. One may pass or may fail. 


There must be some clue to this puzzle. | started unfolding 
the whole lot once again and tried to find out the answer as 
follows : 


Result 


Miss Suruchi has failed in four subjects. She has applied for 
revaluation in two subjects. So two subjects are still left for 
further attempts. Then considering other negative sides of 
the planets ie. Jupiter and Venus occupying Tan house and 
Satum in retrograde direction | declared that she will get through 
at least in one subject out of the two after revaluation of 
marks. 


In due course of time she received ihe letter from the 
University saying that there is not change in marks after 
verification of marks, however the papers are in the process 
of revaluation and the outcome will be informed shortly. 


Finally she received another letter on 13-12-90 saying that 
after revaluation her marks have been increased from 24 to 
49 out of 1600 maximum marks in one subjects and there is 
no change in marks in other subject. 


In this way KR has come out successfully with such an 
accuracy which is beyond imagination. While writing this article 
a thought came to my mind that was It possible to pin-poini 
the subject in which she will get through and how many marks 
will she obtain in that subject. "This is left to the students of 
KP. followers". 


RULING PLANETS 
AND RECEIPT OF POWER 
CONNECTION 


The advanced stellar theory of Astrology Known as KP. 
has revolutionised the whole predictive Astrology and it is a 
definite improvement over the old traditional system of 
predictions. It has given a new vision to the astrologer and tt is 
only after the introduction of KP. that we call Astrology a 
science. But the masterpiece of the whole work of Shri KSK 
is the invention of Ruling planets. The ruling planets can better 
be named as the master key which can be fitted to any 
problems, which one may face in any walk of life. May be tt is 
a question related to one's marriage, child birth, receipt of gas 
cylinder or Restoration of power supply etc. whether it may be 
a major or a minor eventthe Ruling planets ts infallibly helpful 
In correctly fixing the time of that event. 


| am narrating here one such example out of many where 
the Ruling planets have been correctly used to fix up the time 
of occurance of an event. 


| constructed my new house and occupied the new premises 
on 26-10-90. | gave application for the supply of domestic 
power supply (electricity) to the concemed officials, well in 
advance i.e. during the 1st week of Oct. 1990. | was told by 
the officials that the power supply will be given within a month. 
But no response to me till the first week of November and 
again | contacted the official and was told that the meter has 
gone to Lab for testing and will be received shortly. | did not 
receive the power supply till the 1st week of December 90. | 
was vedxed by the officials of Electricity Board and finally 
ruling planets of our sub lord theory only carne to my rescue. 


26 HAULING PLANT 


| wanted to know the exact date of the receipt of power 
supply to my new house with the help of ruling planets 


| wanted to test the theory of Ruling planets and | took up 
the matter for calculation on 3-12-1990 Monday, the time of 
calculation 847 p.m. IST at Madras 13°04’ N Lat / 80°17°E 
Long. Ayanarnsa used 23°37’ (K.S.K.). The ruling planets are 
as under :- 


The Moon was transiting in Gemini in Mrigasira star (66°14") 
The ascendatnt was rising in Cancer sign in Jupiter star 
(Punarvasu) (91°07"}. So the Ruling planets are : 


Day Lord - Moon (Monday) 

Moon sign lord - Mercury (Gemini) 
Micon star ford - Mars (R) (Mrigasira) 
Asc. Sign lord - Moon (Cancer) 

Asc. Star lord - Jupiter (R) (Punarvasu) 
Asc. Sub lord - Mars (R) 


Kethu was transiting the sign of cancer ruled by Mon. 


90 the Ruling planets are Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and 
Kethu. 


With this Ruling Planets | wanted to findout simply the date 
of power connection from EB. At this juncture | reproduce 
here what our Late Guruji Sri KS.K has told about the Ruling 
Planets on Page 131 of Horary Astrology. 


lf a matter is to be materialized in days, and within a 
month, you may take the position of Moon and there-from 
you calculate. But if it would take more than a month, move 
the Sun from the present position of the Sun. Ifthe matter is 
to fructify in some years Mars move Jupiter from the position 
occupied by Jupiter at the time of Judgement. 


For example if one asks which" month | can celebrate the 
mariage of my daughter in that year, Sun must reach the 
position goverened by, Ruling planets. But ifone asks in which 
year one will build house, move Jupiter to the sensitive points 
of Ruling planets. 


KAISHNAMURTI PADHDHAT! 27 

If oné wants to know when the Gas cylinder will be received 
or arrival of a friend or a relation, receipt of postal letter or 
Restoration of power supply etc. move the Moon. ff it ts 
expected on the same day take the lagna likewise we have to 
judge according to the nature of Query. 


In our present example the receipt of the Electnc power 
supply connection to my house is already over due. Hence, 
this matter has to be fructified within a copule of days. Hence 
we have to move the Moon to the sensitive points governed 
by the Ruling planets for fixing the correct date of giving the 
power supply to my new house. 


Power supply when’? 


On ihe date of judgement on 3-12-90 Moon was transiting 
in the star of Mars. The time was already 9-00 p.m. hence 
the chance of getting connection on that day was ruled aut. 
More over Mars was in retrograde position. 


4-12-90 Tuesday & Arudra star day. Rahu was not amonst 
the Ruling planets. Hence this day was also rejected. 


212-90 Wednesday & Punarvasu star day ruled by Jupiter 
was in retrograde motion. Hence this day was also rejected. 


6-12-90 Thursday & Poosam star day. Satum was not 
amongst Ruling Planets. 


f-12-90 Friday & Aslesha star day. Friday ruled by Venus 
and Venus was nota Ruling planet. 


8-12-90 Saturday & Makam star day. Saturday ruled by 
saturday and Satum was also not a Ruling planet. 


9-12-90 Sunday & Pooram star Both Sun and Venus not 
Ruling planets. 


10-12-90 Monday but Uthram star day ruled by Sun and 
hence rejected. 


11-12-90 Tuesday & Hastham star day. Both Mars & Moon 
are in the Rulingplanets. Moreover Moon was a fruitful Ruling 


28 RULING PLANT 
planet and Moon was lagna lord at the time of judgement.- 


Hence | decided that the E.B, officials will come and give 
Electric power supply connetion on that day on 11-12-90, 
Tuesday, Hastham star day. This day also happened to be 
my birth day. Hence | was sure that my prediction will not go 
wrong. 


Results : 


As predicted by me the officials of E.B. came by 5-00 p.m. 
on 11-12-90 and gave electric supply from the neighbouring 
light post to my new house and their power connection work 
lasted for nearly an hour & my son switched on the light 
points and my hose was full of brightness with electric lights at 
6-05 p.m. on that day. 


Thus the efficacy of the system of Ruling planets has been 
once again testified and proved correct and the entire credit 
goes to our late Guruji Prof. KS.K. who had devised this 
system of using Ruling planets as an important weapon in his 
famous KP., sub lord theory, which ts useful in giving un-erring 
predictions. 


With great respects to our Guruji, | conclude this article. 


K.P. ANALYSES 
GAS CONNECTION 


One of my relatives is from Bombay. He has got a flat in 
Bombay and he and his brother's family were staying together 
for more than 15years. In the course of time both the families 
Inceased in numbers and the flat which was initially sufficient 
for both, fell short for comfortable staying. Ultimately one had 
to find out another place and had to be shifted to other house. 
While vacating the brother who leftthe house, took away the 
gas which was registered in his name. As there was only one 
gas, the family who stayed behind had no gas. We can imagine 
nowadays in a place like Bombay if there is no gas, the trouble 
for a house wife for cooking specially when she is a working 
lady also. So one day his wife sent me a message through 
her husband to find out when she can have the gas connection 
In her house. This problem was solved by KP. system and 
the complete analysis is given as under.

KP. Ruling : The querry is regading house hold matters 
take 4m house. Then we have to consider 3% and 11t houses 
also as 3ra house is for allotments, communications and 11inis 
for fulfillment of desire. Let us now find out the signiticators of 
these houses. 


Signifcators :

11 Jupiter (R} 
Jupiter - moon - Kethu are in conjunction 
Mercury 's in kethu star 


Analysis : 


The Sr cusp sub lord is Moon is in 3d house and in 
conjunction with Jupiter and Kethu. Jupiter is lord of 11tn house. 
Similarly 11th cusp sub lord is also Moon and Moon signifies 3rd 
house. The #" cusp sub lord Jupiter also signifies 11house. 
Though there are other factors also to find out the answer, 
the above planetarysituation itself is sufficient which guarantees 
that the native should get the GAS connection in his house. 
Now we have to find out when? 


The native was running Mercury dasa, Mercury Bhukti. 
Mercury indicates more than one source. Kethu ts stronger 
than Jupiter and Moon. Mercury is in Kethu star. Considering 
the Ruling Planets of the day Mercury is the only planet which 
fulfils the desire. So | informed the native that he will get the 
gas connection in Mercury dasa, Mercury bhukti and Kethu 
inter period i.e. between March and April 97. 


1 RULING PLANT 
Actual Result: 


Although due to petroleum crises the new gas connections 
are stopped temporarily, surprisingly his friends came forward. 
One offered spare requlator, ihe other a spare cylinder and 
the third one gave his spare burner and on 10-3-91 his wife 
cooked the food on the gas. Recently he has Informed me 
that very shortly he will be getting regular gas connection also.

Jupiter is the first grade ruling planets as well as significator

and 10th House. Mars is significator of ad and Sth. As the 
question is that the job will be within one month. As 11th sub 
lord Sun in the star of Moon denotes that the native should 
get Job within one Month. Hence, | observed only the transit 
of Moonin Mars sign Kethu star, Moon sign Jupiter star and 
Jupiter sign Kethu star as these planets ie. Mars, Ketu, Moon 
and Jupiter are the significators of 6, 10", 11" as well as ruling

the same and he waited for the another appointment letter 
on 11 th as already my forecast came true on 4th Feb. ‘87. 


He recetved one more appointment. Order from another 
company on 11th Feb. 1987 And he joined on 23rd Feb. '87. 
Note Jupiter is the strongest significator of 10m and 11™house 
and kethu was the significator of 6h and 11m. On 111m Feb. 
Moon transit over Moon sign Jupiter star and on 23rd Feb 87 
Moon transit over Jupiter sign Kethu star. 


After a month my friend paid 100-after receiving the salary 
of first month. 


KP. and RP. is really a superb method which will be very 
useful in predicting any matter of life whether the subject is of 
a job or of Birth time rectification or child birth or mamage etc. 


Good Luck. 


SHALL WE GET SUCCESS? 


The doctrine of Astrology is that our destiny written in the 
stars only, closer union between the mental reflection of man 
and his celestial prototype. The less dangerous are extemal 
conditions and subsequent reincamations. There must be sore 
thing vital in the theory of reincomations and also sore grounds 
for the belief in Karma or self create fate and destiny. There 
are external and internal conditions which affects the 
determination of our will power upon our actions through horary 
astrology. Though, man, cannot escape his ruling destiny, he 
has choice of two paths, itis in his purview to follow either or 
any one. Those who belteve in karma theory, have to believe 
in destiny too, which prevail from birth to death. The destiny 
is govemed by the voice of celestial heavenly bodies, the 
invisible prototype by our intimate astral friends. 


One day my two colleagues came to me for astrological 
counselling when | was busy in my domestic routine. They 
were interviewed for promotion and want to know their result. 
Actually both came to me before the interview for the result 
through horary. But as per “Geeta Updesha' | suggested them 
to get result after the completion of task. Because if the 
result is adverse astrologically it will affect the physchology 
whereas adtrology is the science which gives mental strength 
to go ahead materially and mentally. 


Both the Persons were judged by me one by one. The

Interview means discussion between two persons which 
pertains to third house, nineth house and eleventh house. 
The third house is the house parakrama, deeds done by one 
self, the nineth house shows agreement between themselves, 
the eleventh house is universal house of fulfillment of desire. 
It means for the success, sub lord of the third house should 
be the strong significator of eleventh house and nineth as 
well, 


In the concerned chart query Is vivid. The third house sub 
lord is Saturn occupant of scorpio the eighth house, which is 
twelfth from nineth, a house of negation. The Saturn is 
signifying nineth and eleventh houses as 9h starts from 27° of 
scorpio and it is the owner of eleventh house. As per above 
rule chart shows success. But house at negation also plays an 
important role, because it is one of the malefic house among 
6, 8, 12. Hence chart shows no Satisfactory agreement 
between themselves, but Saturn is strong significator of 
eleventh reveals fulfillment desire. Being the maleic Satum 
promotion will be delayed, and | boldly predicted that there is 
fulfillment of desire, The Moon struck my brain to check her 
influence, | abruptdly asked what is your desire, spontaneously 
he replied that [do not want to get success’, After declaration 
of result he came to me and said that there is no fulfillment of 
desire but | got failure | told him that on the very same day 
you said that your desire was also not to get success. He said

Half an hour elapsed in discussion, then | took second 
horary for discussion and analysed as under :- 


In this case third sublord is benevolent Jupiter which is 
retrograde and occupant of fiery and barren sign Aries on 6ih 
house {as per cuspal position it is in Sth) the sixth house is also 
a malefic house among others. By any means Jupiter is not 
connected to nineth and eleventh houses. Which are the houses 
of agreement and fulfilment of desire respectively. As per KP. 
reader Gh page No. 146, if the horary planet is retrograde and 
deposited in direct motion planet's Star indicated after so many 
obstacles matter will materialize. If it is in constellation of 
retrograde planet never success. The principle shows that 
Rahu and Kethu should not be treated as retrograde. In this 
case Jupiter is deposited in the star of Kethu ever shows 
retrograde motion and not connected to nineth and eleventh 
houses, hence one should not hesitate to predict the failure.

BREAK IN PARTNERSHIP 
AND DIVISIONS OF 
INDUSTRIAL UNIT 


One of my friends, who happens to be my good critic also, 
got deep interest and faith in Krishnimurti Padhdhat. He wil 
argue out for a case, if date given by Horary map, fails, and | 
used to carry out recheck of Horary chart to locate the fault, 
if at all, in selection of significators. Rechecking significators, 
ruler of time period for happening of matter, if & is delayed 
helos me a lot to reach nearerto correct selection of significators 
of events, and more close to correct time prediction in the 
First week of May, 1982, he came to my house, with a person, 
whom he introduced as Managing Director of one of the leading 
Pharmaceutical Units based at Bombay. That gentleman 
wanted to know Astrologically, whether partnership in industrial 
set up will continue or it will lead to separation of the units 
owned by present management? He gave no, 54 (out of 
249). This question was judged by principles laid down by 
Prof. Krishnamurti, for Horary Astrology. The details of the 
Horary chart is as given below. 


No. 54, 14-5-1982, 10.15 A.M. (IST), Friday, Surat. 


Look at the Moon. Moon is in the 7h house {lord of II). 
Moon is in constellation of Sun (Sun is lord in Ill in XI), and 
sub of Kethu (Kethu is in 7th). It shows question regarding 
business, partnership (7) and about continuation of it (11). 


Kethu ts in Sagitarrius, represents Jupiter {in 4th and lord of 
7 & 10), which also shows the problem in home, family due to 
status / business (19), partnership (7), Kethu also represents 
Venus, Venus Is lord of 5 & 12, sitting in 9. Hence it indicates 
change of profession (9), worries for separation to querist 
(12) and its releation to first child (5). 


44 AULING PLANT 


Moon is also a sublord of 1* and 2nq Cusp Rahu is sitting 
near to Ascendant, which shows that person is having lot of 
mental worries also. 


All these shows that person has problem regarding 
continuation of parinership in the business. This problem of 
separation of partnership is due to the dispute in the family of 
querist, mainly because of first child. Moon being sublord of 
ascendant afflicted by Rahu, it shows person Is in having self- 
dispute, what to do? Moon as sublord of 2nd cusp also shows 
family and finance problems at the same extend. 


Will partnership Break : 


sixth reader, page no. 252, 253 if Ah cusp sublord ts 
significator of 6 or 12 house, partnership will break. And it Is 
added that if sublord of 7h cusp ts in sub of a retrograde 
planet, attempts will be made to separate but separation will 
not be there. 


In present case, 7th cusp sublord is Rahu, is in 1st house 
Rahu is to give the result ofthe house occupied by the lord of 
constellation. (Page 252 VI reader}. Rahu is in the constellation 
of Jupier, Jupiter is significator of 1, 4, 7 and 10. Jupiter is 
retrograde Rahu is in sub of Saturn, which is significator of 2, 
4, 7, 8, 9. Both, Jupiter and Saturn are retrograde and sitting 
4in house. As per the rule stated in above para Rahu, being 
sublord of the 7 cusp, in sub of retrograde Saturn shows 
attempts to separate but separation should not be there. 


But, before deciding the matter, | tried to analyse it in 
different manner. 


Rahu, is in constellation of Juipter and of Saturn. Both Jupiter 
and Saturn are in 4th house. Jupiter is significator of 1, 4, 7 
and 10. Now, we take a rule that if 7in cusp sublord signify 5 
or 11 house it shows more perrrrenant ties, as both houses 
denote friendship. Therefore, houses 12m to 5 and 11 must 
be detrimental for friendship. Hence, 4 and 10 becomes negative 
for friendship. Rahu, being sublord of 7#cusp, is in constellation 
of Jupiter, which signify 4 and 10 which is negative permenant 


KRAISHNAMURT! PADHOHAL 45 


tie i.e. indicator of break in friendship. Now question left is of 
retrograde Saturn. Saturn is also in 4th house. Saturn is in the 
harmony with sublord of 7" cusp, Rahu to signify the same 
matter, which strengthens the negation of permanent ties. 
Besides | (judged) Rahu, result from its sign lord. Rahu is in 
Gemini sign. Hence Rahu will signify Mercury. Mercury is in 12" 
house (on the 12th Cusp) Mercury, is in Moon constellation, 
(Moon in 7 is lord of 2) and sub of Kethu (Kethu in 7). Kethu 
is sign lord Jupiter is in 4 and Kethu's constellation lord Venus is 
in 9 (is lord of 2 &5}. Hence Mercury sitting in 12 strongly 
signify 7m house and Kethu its sublord is related to 4th house. 
Hence Mercury, in 12th shows negative continue partnership. 


Hence, | decided that partnership must break. And sublord 
of 7h cusp Rahu, a significator of 12m house. (Rahu's sign 
lord. Mercury in 12th house). Hence querist will insist for 
separation and he will get separated. Constellation lord and 
sublord of Rahu (Jupiter and Saturn) both are in 4m house, 
which suggests that family dispute will play important role in 
partnership break. 


When? 


Partnership should break in conjoined period of signiticators 
of 6th and 12n house. 


Gin house : Neptune is in 6m house. Mars is lord of 6th 
house. There is no planet in Mars constellation. 


12m house : Mercury is in 12h house, Venus is in Mercury 
constellation. Venus is lord of lan house. Kethu is in Venus 
constellation. 


Thus Mars, Venus, Mercury and Kethu are significators of 
G6 and 12. 


Rahu will give fruit of Mercury.

Jupiter and Saturn both retrograde are cancelled from

Mars aspects with 8in aspect to Sun and Sun is also in sub 
of Rahu who is decisive for partnership querry. Sun can be 
included as siginficatory to represent Mars. 


In horary chart balance Sun dasa was 1Y-4M-1D. Sun dasa 
Kethu bhukthi Ketu antra is running. Now let us decide the 
rulers of time event. 


Sun is aspected by Mars, and Sun is in sub of Rahu. Sun 
dasa should decide the matter. At present Ketu bhukti is running. 
Ketu Is in 7th house; tts constellation lord Venus is in Sth house 
and sublord Saturn is in 4m house. Ketu is a strong significator 
of 5“: house. Hence Ketu bhukti will not give result. Sun dasa 
Venus bhukti starts from 15-9-1982 to 15-11-1983. Venus Is 
the strongest significator of 12" house. Hence | decided that 
Sun dasa Venus bhukti Venus antra 15-9-1982 to 15-11-1982 
separation must take place. It will show result when Sun wiil 
transit in Mars constellation, ie. 11-10-1982 to 24-10-1982. I 
had accordingly informed to the person concerned. 


Then, | got the information that first son of the Querist 
was the main reason for separation, and the pharmaceutical 
Unit having partnership of app. 25 years and having No. of 
units at different places was separated into three groups. The 
separation of partnership was observed on papers some where 
in middle of October, ‘82. But the divisions of Units was 
practically observed only in 20 June to 10 July 1983. 


It shows that eventhough separation took place in October, 
‘82, practically it was implemented after 9 months. In light of 


KRISHNAMURTE PADHDHATI 47 


this event | tried to analyse chart in details and transit position 
in October '82 and June-July 1983. The points given below are 
to explain the delay in event. 


i. ¥m cusp decisive cusp for partnership its sublord Rahu is 
also a sublord of 8m house (@m is house of delay). 


li. Rahu the sublord of 7th cusp is in sub of Saturn. Saturn 
is only sublord of 12m cusp (separation) Saturn by nature is 
very slow planet. And Saturn is a strongest and only significator 
of 8m house. 


li. Rahu - gives fruit of Mercury sitting in tan house 
strongest to signify separation. Mercury is also sublord of only 
6m house (separation). Mercury is sitting over 12°*cusp and is 
in 180° to Gm cusp. The significator of 12" Venus is in sextile 
aspect to Mercury to expidiate the matter; but 8m lord Saturn 
is in Trine aspect to Mercury which delays the matter. 


iv. Venus (significator of 12m) is sublord of X and XI cusp, is 
sitting over X cusp. X cusp and Venus are in 180° to Saturn 
(significator of 2, 4, 7, 8 and 9) and in square to Rahu and 
Ketu. Which shows family, finance and partnerships 
dissatisfaction. Delayed bhagyodaya. The separation can 
seriously affect name and status of each partner and company 
as a whole. 


v. Ketu - sitting in 7m house, which signify partnership and 
being strongest significator of 5'" cusp, is sublord of 5m and 4m 
cusp. It suggests parinership (7}; Negative for permanent 
ties (4) due to Son (5). 


vi. Jupiter is sub-lord of 3 (new adventure) and 9 (change 
offield is significator of 1, 4, 7 and 10. Jupiter is in square to 
Moon (significator of 2, 3, 7 and 11). It shows that the matter 
of dispute must be about financial gain in partnership and 
starting of new adventure. 

vii. Mars significator of 6 (separation) and 11 (gain} is in 
Square to Neptune sitting in 6", which suggest disputes and 
dissatisfaction during separation. 


48 RULING PLANT 


Transit: B 


In October, 1982, separation of the partnership took place. 
Dasa period of horary chart Sun dasa, Venus bhukti, Venus 
antra operates from 15-9-1982 to 15-11-82. In first week of 
August, 1982. Transit Rahu passed over Ascendant of Horary 
chart and transit of Rahu is 12m and Keltu in 6m started. 


In the last week of October, 1982, the planetary transit is 
favourable for separation, Jupiter (Jupiter-Mercury), Satum 
(Mars-Venus),, Rahu (Rahu-Mercury), Ketu (Venus - Venus), 
Uranus (Satum-Venus). Neptune (Ketu - Venus), Sun -Rahu 
constellation; Venus —Rahu constellation Mercury - Mars 
constellation. 


The significator of 11 and 6 Mars conjoined with Neptune in 
6in house at 241° (in Ketu constellation). Thus ail the planets 
transit in constellation and sub which signify 4 (negative for 5 
fnendship) 6 (separation) 10 (negative of 11) and 12. The 
rulers of this time event are sun and Venus. Sun (significator 
of 11) is semi square to Venus (significator of 12, 4 and 5). 
Venus is very close to X cusp. Hence it gives result of IX and 
X. Venus is opposition to Saturn (significator of 4, 7 and 9), 
shows delay. The planets in 7“ house -house of partnership 
also gives clue, Moon is nearer to 8th cusp shown delay in the 
matter. Moon is square to Juipter (in 4)_. Keltu (significator of 
5, 7, 9and 12), in 7 is in square to Satum significator of 4, 7 
and 8. 


Separation of division was practically observed during 20th 
June to 10 July ‘83. From 15-9-1982 Sun dasa Venus bhukti of 
Horary chart was operating, and 6-5-1983 to 3-7-1983 was 
under control of Saturn antra. At this time (last week of June) 
Saturn transit in retrograde motion (Libra-4) in Mars 
constellation; retrograde Jupiter conjoined with retrograde 
Uranus (219°-222") in Saturn constellation. Neptune {R) 
(Sagittarius 4°) in Ketu constellation in 6th house of Horary 
chart is in opposition to conjunction of Rahu, Mars, and Mercury 
in 12th house. Rahu, Mars and Mercury transit in Mars 
constellation. All the planets transit in Mars or Saturn 


KRISHNAMURTT PADHDHATI 49 


constellation, Sun also transit in Rahu constellation from 12th 
house. Hence last week of June ‘83 is the time for separation 
between 29-6-83 to 5-7-84 Saturn is stagnant and then comes 
in direct motion, and on 3-7-83 Mercury antra starts. Hence 
planetary effect is almost similar in first week of July “83 and 
antra of Mercury starts. Dasa lord Sun is significator of 3 and 
11;Bhukti lord Venus is sub Lord of 10 and 11 and significator 
of 4, 5 and 12. Antra lord Mercury is sublord of 6th cusp and 
significator of 2, 7 and 12, but not related with Sth or 11th 
house which shows that Mercury antra is right time for break 
in relation and division of units. Thus tirst week of July 1983 
agrees from transit as well as dasa wise for separation. 


| wish that learned followers of stellar Astrology should keep 
open mind to accept and verify the failures. This only can lead 
us to reach the real goal for which Prof. Krishnamurti has laid a 
foundation stone.

Health is no doubt, wealth and such wealth which stands on 
Job of money wealth. The proverb is true that money is lost 
nothing is lost. Health is lost-something ts lost. Character is 
lost everything is lost. Sickness or diseases are always to be 
avoided at any cost. There are some diseases which can be 
pulled on. But there are some type of diseases which are to 
be cured at any cost. Sexual debility is such worstithing. The 
frustration cause is both mental as well as body. And this is 
not limited to the patient only, but his life partner is also worried. 
Because in this matter no other can do anything. My friend 
was worried due to such sexual compiextions. Due to friendship 
| too. He also is sufferer of money like me. Times of Deamess 
is also a factor. He had tried himself by using Advertised 
medicine but of no use. He decided to go for proper treatment, 
but question was whether Ayurvedic treatment or Homeopathic 
treatment. Homeopathic treatment was cheaper. Ayurvedic 
treatment was not only costly but about five to six times than 
homeopathy. | asked to give two numbers for two treatments. 
He gave number 172 for Ayurvedic medicine and 210 for 
Homeopathic medicine. It was 8-40 hrs. moming on 15-3-90 
and at Ratlarn. Its Horary horoscope will be as under :- 


Fifth house stands for getting cure and eleven stands for 
fulfillment of Desire hence for getting cure sub lord of fifth 
should not be Retrograde and should be the significator of 
fifth house or eleventh house. For no. 172. here no planet is 
Retrograde means sub lords of fifth and eleventh are not 
Retrograde now in the star of Retrograde planet. Sub lofd of 
fifth house is Moon, Moon ts in eleventh house i.e. House of

desire and sights fifth means Moon ts significator of 5th house. 
House of cure and eleventh house ie. house of fulfillment of 
desires. Further Moon is in the star of Juipter, Jupiter is occupant 
of “7th house and owner of lagna and _  *tfourth.

Jupiter is sighted by Mars, Mars is conjoined with Venus owner 
of eleventh house. All this indicates that Ayurvedic medicine 
will cure. Sub lord of eleven is Venus is fast planet. Occupant 
of eleven Moon is fastest planet, and not sighted by slow 
planet means getting cure will be at earliest possible means 
say 15-20 days through critical. 


Whereas No. 21/ tts sub lord of fifth house of Kethu, kethu 
is In sixth house actually in House of disease. Means no question 
of getting cure. Further kethu represents Moon which occupant 
of eighth worst. Kethu is in star of Mercury who is owner of 5th

medicine will not cure on the contrary it will create some 
complications. 


So | told him not to waste money in homeopathic medicine 
and take only ayurvedic medicine though costly. My friend did 
not close the matter then and there. But asked further when

She left the room but again entered after few seconds to ask 
the consultation fee. | clearly told her that whenever any 
question is related with the longevity of anybody, the problem 
is solved free of cost, no change is needed there. At this she 
smiled and leftthe room. 


The number was taken at 6-30 a.m. ISF on 29-11-91 for 
jJudgemnet. The cusps and planets were set as following. In 
the fourth issue this son was born. So XI house indicates the 
lagna of the son. 


Our Gurujee has advised in KP. Redaer VI Page NO. 160, 
take that house which represents the relationship. For father 
and for strangers take only the 9th house.

Find out where the cusp falls. Ifthe sub lord of the cusp is 
in the constellation of the planet who is significator of Badhaka 
and marakasthana, boldly declare that he is dead. Itwill prove 
to be very correct. 


Here, the sub lord of the lagna of the son is Saturn. Saturn 
is In the star of Sun. 


For the son, 7th house is the marak as well as badhakasthana 
.@. the 5 house from this chart. Saturn is the occupant here 
and in the star of Satum Sun: is posited. So Sun is strong 
significator of the marak and Badhak house for Son. 


No doubt, Sun is the owner of 3d and occupant of Sth from 
son, but it Is strongly signifying the 7th house from son. So the 


KRISHNAMURTI_ PADHDHATI 57 


son is dead, without any doubts. Now, for rumour, according 
to Gurujee in the same book on page 171, find out the sub 
lord of the 3™ cusp, note in which constellation the sub lord Is 
deposited. If the lord of the constellation in which the sub lord 
is deposited happen to be Saturn, the report is false. But if it is 
Mars, then it is mischtevous and false otherwise true. 


Here the third cusp sub lord is Jupiter having no planet in its 
star and Jupiter is posited in the star of Venus, so, the report 
is true. 


She again came at 9.00 a.m.on 29-11-91, | replied that 
there Is little chance of your son being alive but go on searching, 
as the son was nearly 20 years old and it was beyond courage 
to declare that the son is dead before the mother. So | advised 
in such form. But after three or four days of searching, she 
was confirmed about the immature death of her son. It is 
KP. which can give always correct result and to help the 
astrologer the soul of our Gurujee is always ready. 


PURCHASE OF LAND : 
KRISHNAMURTI 
PADHDHATI PROVIDES 
CLUE 


My elder sister who lives in Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, 
had come to Bangalore with her children to spend their summer 
vacation. One evening, as we were conversing with each other, 
the subject of astrology somehow came in. Since, at that 
time, her husband was interested in buying a plot of land in 
Kanchi, she asked me to find out the astrological indications 
for the same. Her husband (my brother-in-law) had not come 
with her, | had to proceed with my analysis on the basis of the 
number she gave. The number was 117' between 1 and 
249. According to the Krishnamurti Padhdhati horary scheme, 
the querent is asked to speak out a number as above, and 
with the help of the number a horary figure is cast for the 
moment and place of judgemnet and prediction arrived at. 
The foundation of horary atrology rests on the belief that a 
querent will put a qury only when there is a senous urge in his 
mind and the planets in the heavens have complete relation 
to the matter enquired about. The traditional way is to erect 
the horary figure for the time and place of judgement, but 
the late prof. Krishnamurti found some pitfalls in this method 
and recommended ihe fixing up of the lagna for the querry 
on the basis of a number between 1 and 249, the number 
itself meaning by itself nothing except referring to a certain 
part of the Niraryana Zodiac. In the scheme of Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati, the number 117 corresponds to the Nirayana sign 
Kanya (virgo) 17°46'40" governed by Mercury (Budha) as the 
rasi-lord, Moon (Chandra) as the nakshatra lord and Mercury 


50 HULINGPLANT 


as the sub lord {lord of the sub-division the star). His defence 
in favour of this number scheme was that if the querent is 
disposed to make a querry only at particular time he is equally 
disposed to give only such a number which will have absolute 
relevance to the query in question. He taught his method to 
others only after he had put it to rigorous test himself and 
found it answering extremely well. In one instance, he was 
reported to have asked for a number fromm a querent and 
gave his prediction in as short a time as three minutes which 
caused a bit of doubt in the querent's mind whether the late 
professor had really applied his mind. In the words of the 
querent hirnself, the prediction proved right to the last letter 
‘T, both the events predicted, viz., the date of betrothal and 
the date of marriage coming exactly true to the date and 
time. What is important in all that has been said here is that 
the prediction was based on the same principles as enunciated 
in Prof. Krishnamurti’s famous work "Horary Astrology" and 
was given by him with dear conviction. 


Since the number is given by my sister and not her husband, 
the astrological reading will have to be done assuming that the 
7m house, which represents her husband, will form the basis 
for prediction. In other, word, the houses will have to be re- 
arranged taking the 7m house as the lagna, the 8h house as 
the 2nd, the 9tn house as ihe 3a and so on for our purpose. 
On this basis, the number given in brackets indicates the house 
with respect to her husband. 


For buying land or house, we are told in Krishnarnurti 
Padhdhati, the houses to be considered are 4, 11 and 12. In 
astrological symbology, one's residence, house, property 
(immovable property as distinguished from movable assets or 
cash) are placed under the control of the 4th house. The 11th 
house has reference to desire and its realization, and the 12n 
has relation to loss, expenses including those connected with 
investments. If the contemplation is to buy a house already 
constructed and readily available, then in Such a case in addition 
fo the houses, 4, 11, and 12 spoken of earlier those of the 6th 
and the 9m will also have to be perused. Why? The 7m stands 


KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 61 


for the seller or the person from whom you are going to buy. 
The 6m becomes twelfth counted from the 7th; and the 9th 
stands as the twelfth to the 4th from the 7" house, and so his 
parting away with his house, Logically, it would appear that the 
5m (which is the 11th assuming the 7m to be the lagna} as well 
as the 8m (the 2na or financial gain from the 7") should also be 
associated, standing as it does for the gain of the person 
described by the 7m. 


Now, what is the condition, speaking astrologically, for one 
to buy land or house? According to the Krishnamurti Padhdhati 
theory, the sub-lord of the cusp of the 4m house should not 
be retrograde and placed in the nakshatra a retrograde planet 
and further, the sub-lord should be a significator of houses, 4, 


11 and 12 and having some connection with Mars, the ‘grih 
Karaka’

In like fashion, if a vehicle (personal conveyance) is to be 
bought, such sub-lord should have connection with Venus, the 
‘Vahana karaka'. 


62 RULING PLANT 


The Horary Chart forming the basis for our judgement of 
the query, framed for the latitude of Bangalore at 4-43 p.m. 
(IST) on Friday the 4m May 1979 is reproduced below. As 
mentioned earlier, the numbers in brackets by the side of the 
house cusps refer to the house assuming the 7m (husband) 
to be the lagna. 


The star and sub positions of all the planets and that of the 
relevant cusps are as given below : 


Planet of cusp Star Lord Sub lord 


Sun Venus Rahu 
Moon Mercury Moon 
Mars Mercury Jupiter 
Mercury Mercury Jupiter

The question is ifthe husband can buy a land or not; and if 
yes, when. 


All of our learnéd readers are well aware that Moon, the 
reflector of the mind and the sublord of the querent's 
Ascendant indicates that nature of the question. 


Here the Moon is lord of 3 in 5 in the star of Mercury and in 
her own sub. Mercury is lord of 4 in 1, in his own star and 
aspected by the benefic Jupiter, a significator of houses 4, 11 
& 12. Again, Moon is conjoined with such a Jupiter and aspects 
the 11™ house. 


The sublord of the querent's Ascendant is Mercury in his 
own star. Mercury's star position has been discussed above. 


KRISHNAMURT) PADHDHATI 63 


The sub occupied by it is ruled by Jupiter which is in 4 in the 
star of Saturn, lord of 11 and 12. Mercury ts conjunct Mars, 
the Grihakaraka. Hence the nature of the querry is very clearly 
revealed by the position of Moon and the sublord of lagna. 
For the purchase of a land, as already stated earlier, the 
sublord of 4 (1) should not be retrograde, (2) sublord not be 
posited in the star, the lord of which is retrograde, (3) should 
be a significator of house 4 or 11 or 12 and (4} must have 
some connection with Mars (grihakaraka)}. 


In the present case, the sublord of the 4 cusp (to the 
husband} is Venus which is not retrograde. Venus is in the star 
of Mercury, which is lord of 4 and not retrograde Mercury is 
conjunct (only 1°25° away) Mars, the Karaka. Also, Venus 
itself is conjoined with Mars and Mars is also in the star of 
Mercury, lord of 4. 


Therefore, we find that the sublord of 4. 
(a)is not retrograde; 
(b) is deposited in a star, the lord of which ts not retrograde 
(c) is a significator of 4 
(d} has connection to Mars, the karaka for land (and houses} 
Hence, he will be able to buy a house. 
The significators of the houses connected with matter are ; 


Fourth : Occupant is Jupiter; Kethu ts in its star; Mercury is 
the owner 


Moon, Mars, Venus and Mercury are in its stars. Therefore 
the significators of the fourth are Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
Venus and Kethu. 


Eleventh / Twelfth : Kethu is in 12'°; Saturn is lord of both 
houses; Rahu is conjoined with Saturn. No planets in the stars 
of Rahu or Kethu; 


Jupiter is the only planet in Saturn star. Therefore, the 
significator of these two houses are Rahu, Kethu, Jupiter and 


64 AULING PLANT 
Saturn. 


As a number of planets have connection, we need to find 
out who, among the many, are more fruitful. This takes us to 
the consideration of Ruling Planets. 


They are ° 


Daylord - Venus : lagna lord - Mercury (Virgo) lagna star 
lord - Mars; Lagna sub lord -Moon; Moon sign lord —Moon; 
Moon star lord - Jupiter. 


Jupiter is in Moonsign. 
Mars, Mercury and Venus aspect the ascendant sign. 


Hence the ruling planets are Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus 
and Jupiter. 


Moon is in her own sub lord of 5 in 5 and in the star of 
Mercury iord of 4 (property) and 7 (seller) in 1 (Success). 
Actually, lord of 5 in 5 is also favourable because the 5 is 11°” 
to the seller indicating gain to him. Now, when a land or a 
house is bought from the other party, we give him a cheque 
or cash equivalent to the price of the said land or house. In 
this not again to him? This point is delicate and needs to be 
understood well. Therefore, the Moon is favourable. 


Mars and Mercury are in Jupiter sub and Jupiter is in 4 in 
the star of Saturn, lord of 11 and 12 in 5. 


Venus is in her own sub in 1, in the star of Mercury, lord of 
4in 1. 


Jupiter is in Kethu sub in 12, signifying 5 and 12. 


Therefore we find that all the ruling planets are favourable 
even by their sub-positions. 


In Mercury dasa, Moon bhukihi is already on. Both are 
favourable planets. However, Moon bhukithi cannot be fruitful 
because Saturn is lord of 11 to the husband and is an occupant 
of 11 to the querent. Also, it is the sublord of 11 to him and ts 


KAISHNAMUATI. PADHDHATI 65 
in a fixed sign, indicating sufficient delay. 


Next bhukthi is that of Mars and it is a strong ruling planet 
because it is the lagna star lord and aspects the lagna sign. 
Hence Mars bhukthi is in Mercury dasa will be conductive. 


We are now left with Moon, Jupiter and Venus. Moon is 
only Moon sign lord, while Jupiter is an occupant of the Moon 
sign. Occupant being stronger than ownership, Jupiter is 
stronger than Moon. Then, Venus is only daylord and this 
makes it weak. But it should be noticed that it aspects the 
lagna sign, making it considerably strong as a ruling plant. 
Further, Jupiter aspects Venus by the 9m aspect. (A ruling 
planet aspecting another ruling planet considering only the special 
aspects of Mars Jupier and Saturn} makes the latter stronger. 
Thus, Venus becomes a very strong ruling planet; therefore, 
its anthra can be rightly chosen. 


Mercury dasa, Mars bhukthi, Venus anthra runs from 1/-6- 
80 to 16-8-80. 


Venus (anthra lord) is retrograde from 25-5-80 to 7-7-80. 


Therefore it has to be between 23-7-80 and 16-8-80. During 
this period, we have the sookshama period of (i) Jupiter (until 
25-7-80} (ii) Saturn (25-7-80 to 4-8-80) (iii} Mercury (4-8-80 
to 12-8-80) (iv) Kethu (12-8-80 to 16-8-80) 


Since Saturn and Kethu are both not ruling planets, their 
sookshama periods will not cause the event. Hence, It has to 
be Jupiter or Mercury sookshama. 


Sun, the luminary, is in Saturn star (not a ruling planet} 
through out Jupiter sookshama. Therefore its period cannot 
be fruitful. This leaves us with only Mercury sookshama (4-8- 
80 to 12-880) during which period, Sun is transiting in the 
favourable star of Mercury, the dasa lord. 


To find a correct date, the transit of the dasa a hand or 
bhukthi lord should be considered, whichever is slower. Here 
Mars (bhukthi lord} is slower than Mercury (dasa lord} and 


66 RULING PLANT 
therefore we must consider its transit. 


Mars is in Venus sub {in Moon star in Virgo) until 12-50 
p.m. on 7-8-80: after which it enters Sun sub and remains in 
sun sub throughout Mercury sookshama. 


Mercury (dasa lord) enters Moon sub {in Jupiter star in 
Gemini) at 10-18 a.m. on 4-8-80 and stays (next) in Mars 
sub (in Jupiter star in Cancer) until 9-24 p.m. on 5-8-80. 


Moon is in Venus star (aries) until 8-42 a.m. on 4-8-80 
which is before 10-18 a.m. the same day. Then Moon enters 
own star (Taurus) at 7-45 a.m. on 5-8-80. 


Sun enters Venus sub (in Mercury star of Cancer} at 7-59 
a.m. on 5-8-80. 


Venus (anthra lord enters Moon sub (I Mars of Gemini) at 
1-20 p.m. on 5-8-80. 


Hence the time has to be between 1-30 p.m. and 5-30 
p.m. as the sub register office closes by that time on 5-8-80. 


At 1-30 p.m Moon is at 13°27' (Taurus) ie. Moon star, 
Rahu Sub. 


At 5-30 p.m. Moon is at 15°33" (Taurus) ie. Moon star, 
Jupiter sub. 


Rahu is not a ruling planet and Moon enters Jupiter sub 
only at 2-34 p.m. 


since 2-34 p.m. is lunch time, 3-00 p.m. can be taken, as 
the office starts then after the lunch break. 


Hence the registration has to bebeween 3-00 p.m. and 
5.30 p.m. on 5-8-80. 


At 3-00 p.m. the ascendant at Kancheepuram (12°N50’; 
79°E45°) will be Sayana 21°45’ or Nirayana 27*56' of Scorpio, 
(Sidereal Time 11-45-20) ie. Mars, sign, Mercury star, Saturn 
sub. 


At 5-30 p.m. the ascendant at Kanchi will be sayana 26°52’ 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI 6? 


of Capricorn or Nirayana 3°23’ of Capricom (Sidereal time 14- 
15-43) i.e. Saturn sign, Sun star, Saturn sub. 


since Saturn is nota ruling planet, Capricorn (Makara} cannot 
be the lagna sign. Further, Saturn sub in Mercury star also can 
be neglected. 


This leaves us only with Sagittarius, a Jupiter sign, containing 
stars of Kethu, Venus and Sun. Venus is the only ruling planet 
and therefore, its star position can be very rightly chosen. 


Venus star in Jupiter sign (Sagittarius) nses at 16-07 hrs 
(sidereal time 12-52-28) and lasts until 17-03 hrs (sidereal 
time (13-48-33). 


Thus the final conclusion is that : 
a. Her husband will buy the land 


b. It will be between 16-07 hrs and 17-03 hrs on 5-8-80, 
Tuesday. 


This was duly conveyed to my sister and the matter stood 
at rest. 


When | had been to her place {in Karachi) in the month of 
November 1980 for Diwati, it was confirmed that my brother- 
in-law did actually buy the land exactly on 5-8-80 as predicted. 
she however could not recollect the exact time, though she 
added that it must have been after 4-00 p.m. and definitely 
before 5-00 p.m. because he had come back home around 
5-15 p.m. 


The above instance very clearly confirms the undoubted 
accuracy of the horary method propounded by the late Prof. 
K.S. Krishnamurti after long years of toil and experimentation. 


A FEW HINTS 


A few hints on the fructfication of an event, mostly in 
horary preditions in KP. Systems 


1. Ifthe 11th cuspal sub lord is a fast moving planet and in a 


a. MOVABLE SIGN : fructifies the matter within a very 
short period, and here move the lagna 


b. in a fixed sign, the matter fructifies within a few days 
and here move the Moon. 


c. in a common sign, the matter is very complicated 
and throws much doubt in judgement. However move 
Sun to find out the correct period. 


2. Ifthe 11 th cuspal sub lord is a slow moving planet, 


a. and in a movable sign move the moon to find out 
the penod of fructification. Here forget about the lagna. 


b. in a fixed sign, move the Sun to find out the period 
of fructification. 


c. IN a common sign it Is very difficult to come to a 
judgement. Here move Jupiter to find out the penod of 
fructification. The lagna, Moon, Sun, and Jupiter play very 
vital role in judging the period of fructification. It all depends 
upon the nature of query and the impact of the urge of 
the querist. The acceleration of the lagna, Moon, Sun 
and Jupiter over the significators, is a decisive factor, and 
all these four (lagna, Moon, Sun, Jupiter) or majority of 
them should transit in the star of SUB of the significators 
and the Dasa bhukthi anthara should also agree. 


For example : 


* 


oingificators of mamiage : Mars - Rahu - Venus - Mercury 


70 RULUNG PLANT 


lf it is a long short prediction Jupiter should transit in the 
star or sub of the significator. If the Dasa bhukthi projects the 
results in one year, Sun should transit in the star or sub of the 
above signiticators. 


lf the results are to be expected in a month of Moon 
should transit in the Star and not in the sub of the above 
siqnificator. 


lithe results are expected in a few days lagna and Moon 
should transit in both the Star and sub of the significators. 


In all you must follow the Vimshottari Dasa system for all 
type of prediction. 


2. Till the new publication of Mahabala Table of Houses, 
students are advised to follow Raphaels Table of Houses. 


3. From the Ruling Planets, select the siginficators in the 
following order of strength. 


a. Ascendant - StarLord 
b. Ascendant - Lord 
c. Moon - Star lord 


oO 


. Moon - Sign Lord 
e. Day Lord 


4. li the tenth (10m} and 6m cuspal sub lords are not 
connected to 2, 6 or 7" and if the person is engaged in 
business or in services it means that the horoscope if wrongly 
cast. Please rectify the birth time according to the principles 
laid down in KP. and judge the horoscope. This will never 
mislead you. 


5. A planet that is direct while making judgement will give 
result only during its direct motion and not during its retrogration. 


6. Ruling planets should be worked out at the 
commencement time of the prediction and not at the time of 
the judgement after finishing the chart. 


7. There are no fast rule for transfers within the same 
building, inside the city, or outside the cily. If the 9n or 12% 
house cuspal sub lord are connected also to 4th and Bin houses, 
the transfer will be in the same compound and same city 


respectively. If otherwise, it is a distant place if well connected 
to 9m or 12h house.

According to the position of Moon, we have to verify whether 
the chart indicate the mind of the querent or to say whether 
the querent has given thenumber when he or she is having 


the urge. 


KRISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI 75 


Inthis chart, Moon is posited in 5 owns 9. It Is in the star of 
Mercury, who is the owner of 11 & &. In the sub of Jupiter, 
owner of 2 & 5. 


Therefore the position of Moon indicate the urge or it Is 
about child birth. 


As the lordo f the constellation of Moon, Mercury is a 
significator for 8 shows surgical aid during confinement. 
Conjunction of Mars with Moon indicate sickness during this 
period as Mars is the lord of 1 & 6. 


Sub Lord of 5" Cusp. 


Sub Lord of the 5m cusp if the indicator for child birth. 5m 
cusp falls in the sign of Jupiter, Pisces Star of Saturn and Sub 
of Mercury. 


Mercury is in the constellation of Jupiter, lord of 2 & 5 and is 
the lord of 11. Therefore child birth is promised. Sub Lord 
Mercury is in retrograde motion at the time of Judgement. 
Due to this, the expectation will not be fulfilled till Mercury 
comes in direct motion. As Mercury is deposited in star of 
Saturn, who is in direct motion, he is in a position to give 
positive results. 


The period of confinement will be when the significators for 
2,5 & 11 are in agreement with the dasa and bukthi lords in 
operation. The date will be selected when the significators and 
luminaries are transiting in sensitive points. 


Significtors : 


For 2nd : (house showing the increase of family members 
or gain) Kethu is posited in the Star of Rahu, who is in occupation 
of 2nd bhava. Mercury is in the star of Jupiter, who ts the lord 
on 2. 


For 5m (indicating Progeny} Jupiter and Saturn are in the 
constellations of Moon and mars respectively, who are in 
occupation of 5° bhava. Mercury is in the star of Jupiter who 
owns the 5m too. 


‘6 RULING PLANT 


For 11th (Fulfilment of expectation and 5in from partner} No 
planet is posited in this bhava. Moon and Mars are in the 
constellations of Mercury, who is the owner of 11th. 


So the total significators for 2, 5 & 11 are: 


Kethu, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu, Moon, Mars & Mercury. As 
the number of significators come to seven, | applied the theory 
of Ruling Planets to select the fruitful ones. 


At the time of judgement, the ruling planets are - 


Day Lord - Sun 

Rasi Lord —Jupiter 

Star Lord - Venus 
Ascendent Lord - Jupiter & 
Asc. Star Lord - mercury 


So the common planets among the significators and ruling 
planets are, the fruitfuls are; Jupiter & Mercury. 


Rahu represents Jupiter and Kethu by being posited in their 
signs. Therefore the fruitful planets are : Jupiter, Mercury, 
Rahu & Ktehu. 


The period running according to the Horary Chart was the 
Mahadasa of Mercury and its Bhukti of Jupiter till the 4* October 
1973. | selected this period as the lords are very powertul 
signiticators and therefore the expected date of continement 
should fall with is this period. In this Jupiter bukthi, Rah antara 
also runs till 4m October 1973. As the retrograde mercury was 
also starts its direct motion by this time, | estimated that the 
confinement should come through before this day 


Luminary Sun transits in the sign of Mercury, Virgo from 
17m September to 17" October 1973. In its own star till 27m 
september 1973. 


So the expected date should lie between : 
17h to 27m September 1973. 
Moon is in Mercury sign, Gemini on 19m, 20m & 21st. 


KRISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI Tt 
ls in Rahu star from 3.48 a.m. on 20t to 2.27 a.m. on 
21st. 
Day is ruled by Jupiter. 


Accordingly | declared that the expectation will be fulfilled 
on the 20t September 1973 before 7.12 a.m. as Moon is 
transiting in the Sub of Rahu from 3.48 a.m. to 7.12. a.m. 


As predicted, she has given birth to a girl on the 20m at 
4.45 a.m. in Kandy Hospital with little surgical aid. 


FOREIGN TRAVEL - 
WHEN? 


"When will | go abroad?" was the question propounded by 
a consultant. The problem was solved through horary system 
of advanced stellar astrology. The number given by the 
consultant between 1 and 249 was "81".

Balance of Mercury Dasa : 14 Y-2M -25 Days 

The procedure of mentioning a number within 249 and 
casting a horary chart based on the lagna corresponding to 
such number has been advocated by Late professor KS. 
Krishnamurti. Practically itis not numerology but a pure scientific 
astrology. The Zodiac of 360° is divided into 12 signs each of 
30°. Thee are 27 constellations (nakshatras) in the zediac 
with the area 13°20’ each. Late Prof. Krishnarnurti divides the 


80 RULING PLANT 


zodiac of 27 constatellations into 249 paris as per vimshotlari 
system. Each part being ruled by three planets as sign, 
constellation and sub lords respectively. The number "81" 
mentioned by the querent corresponds to 24°6'40" in Cancer 
in the Nirayana Zodiac, Taking this as lagna, the cusps of the 
other houses are calculated for the latitude of Calcutta (22°34'N 
& 88°24'E}. The query was judged on 9-4-76 at 7.40 p.m. 
(IST}. The Horary Nirayana Chart prepared by me is given 
below :

Mars Mercury Rahu Venus 
Mercury Mars Kethu Mars 
Jupiter Mars Kethu Saturn 
Venus Juipter Saturn Kethu 
saturn Moon Jupiter Rahu 
Rahu Venus Jupiter Jupiter 
Kethu Mars Venus Jupiter 


Nature of the query : The Moon reveals mind of the querent. 
Here Moon is posited in the 12m house in the star of Mercury 
and sub of Kethu. Mercury, lord of 3 and 12 occupies 9" 
house. Kethu is also in the 9m house. 3 house stands for 
short journey and leaving permanent residence. 9" house 
denotes long journey, 12t house shows separation from family 
members and life in a foreign place. Thus the nature of the 
query is clearly indicated by the position of Moon. 


Is Overseas Travel Promised? 
According to KP we have to judge the 12m cusp sub lord. 


KRISHNAMURTL PADHDEATI BT 


lf the sublord of the 12" cusp is not deposited in the star of 
retrograde planet and signifies the 3rd, 9'° or 12m house, then 
travel abroad is certain. In this case sublord of the 12m cusp Is 
Mercury. The sublord Mercury, lord of 3 and 12 is in the 9m 
house in the star of Kethu occupying 9. So overseas travel Is 
promised. 


When will | go abroad? 


For overseas travel, we have to consider the 3rd, 9" and 
12m houses and find out the significators. 


3 house : Only Rahu occupies this hose. Mars is in Rahu's 
star. Mercury owns this house. Sun and Moon are in Mercury's 
star. So Mars, Rahu, Sun, Moon and Mercury are significators. 


9m house : Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, and Kethu are in the 9m 
house. Sun and Moon are Mercury's stra, Saturn and Rahu 
are in Jupiter's star, Mercury and Jupier occupy Kethu's star. 
Owner of the 9m is Jupiter. So the significators are Sun, Moon, 
Saturn, Rahu, Mercury, Jupiter and Kethu. 


12tn house : Moon and Saturn are occupants; Venus is in 
Saturn's star. Mercury owns this house. So Venus, Moon, 
Saturn and Mercury signify thishouse. Hence all planets are 
the significators of houses 3, 9 and 12. 


Now we have to select the fruitful significators from the 
above. This is done by using the ruling planets at the time of 
Judgement. 


Ruling Planets * 


Daylord Venus 
Rasi Moon 
Mon Star Mercury 
Lagna Venus 


Lagna Star Jupiter 


Kethu is conjoined with Mercury and Jupiter. Saturn *aspcts 
Mercury and Jupiter by 10t, aspect and joins Moon. Therefore 
the ruling planets are Venus, Moon, Mercury Jupiter, Kethu 
and Saturn. Hence the fruitful significators (common among 


&? AULING PLANT 


the significators and ruling planets) are Venus, Moon, Mercury, 
Jupiter, Kethu and Saturn. 


At the time of judgement the querent was running Mercury 
dasa and Kethu Bhukti upto 28-11-76. In Kethu Bhukti | elected 
Jupiter Anthra. Mercury Dasa, Kethu Bhukti and Jupier Antara 
was in operation from 23-6-76 to 11-8-76. Then | considered 
the transit of Sun the luminary. Sun transited the Moon's sign 
and Saturn's star from 19-7-76 to 2-8-76. Moon and Saturn 
are strong significators of 12m house. So | decided that the 
consultant must go abroad within this period. The consultant 
actually left for New York (USA) on Saturday the 31st July 
1976. The day was ruled by Saturn, occupant of 12th house 
and a strong ruling planet. On this day, Moon was transiting 
the sign of Mercury, the dasa lord and the star of its own. 
Dasa lord Mercury transited in the star of Kethu, the bhukti 
lord. The Bhukti lord Ketu transited in the star of Venus a 
strong significator of 12m house. The anthrax lord Jupiter 
transited in the star of Sun, occupant of 9t house and in the 
sub of Saturn. So the transits of luminaries and dasa / bhukti 
/ anthrax lords perfectly corroborated the event. 


Good Luck. 


RULING PLANETS 
NEVER ERR 


Mr. Sampath, a KP. Student, called on me in the moming 
hours of this Monday, the 13” instant. 


In the course of our talk, the N.G.O. strike also figured our 
topics. 


The other friend who accompanied Sampath suddenly posed 
the question as to how long will the strike continue and when 
will it end, in a testing tone. 


As an ardent student of KP. Sampath took up the issue 
and worked out ihe Ruling Planets at 9.46 a.m. on 13.3.78 
Place : madras 


But unfortunately, he worked out the lagna degree wrongly. 


S50 | took up the issue; and by now it was 9.55 a.m. | 
worked outthe ruling Planet and the particulars are as under.

and Mars as Rasilord) 

It was Monday Ruled by Moon 


mming up, the Ruling planets are 


sun  Lagna Star Lord 
Venus Lagna Rasi Lord 
Venus Moon Star Lord 
Mars Moon Rasi Lord 
Moon Day Lord 


a4 RULING PLANT 


Moon being day lord, | rejected, it being a weak ruling 
planet. As Venus was seen twice as Ruling planet, | gave 
credence to Venus and fixed Venus Rasiday, with Moon in Sun 
star in Venus Rasi, with Venus sub in Sub star, corresponding 
to Mars day and told them that final settlement will be brought 
about in the above time when Moon transits the above Venus 
sub and strike will be withdrawn by that time. 


The above Venus sub falls between 10-42-10 P.m of 
14.3.78 and 3-3-1 a.m. of 15.3.78 ie. the Midnight of Tuesday 
ruled by Mars (night of 14.3.78} 


As indicated above, and as seen in papers the NGO's 
representatives met the Minister around Midnight of 14.3.78 
(Tuesday night} and conveyed to him their decision to withdraw 
the strike (at 146 a.m. of 15.3.48) 


Though the same ruling planets give a clue that the withdraw! 
of the strike can take place as far as on 26.3.78, a Sunday, 
with Moon in Chithira (Mars star} and Venus sub in Chithira in 
the Libra position of Venus Le. between 1-38-54 to 3-54-30 
Pm. of 26.3.78 which is a far fetched date: and | rejected 
the same since the sublord of the Lagna degree (30°6'13") 
gave clue as it was ruled by Rahu, who in turn is controlled by 
Moon as star lord; Moon tells matters to move very fast and 
the same Moon at the moment was deposited in Aries, a 
Cardinal sign (chara rasi} which tells of matters that move 
very fast. That is the reason why I took up the nearer date 
(i.e. nightof 14.3.78 itself) wnen the Ruling planets are controlling 
the Day, Star and Rasi (Day Tuesday ruled by Mars, Star 
Karthigai ruled by Sun, Rasi Rishbam ruled by Venus and Venus 
sub in Sun's Star). 


Further | may bring home to the readers that as the Lagna 
degree 0°5'13" (Taurus) is well aspected by Saturn by 10" 
house aspect (Hindu method), from Leo 1°45’, this tells the 
query to be purely a labour problem, corresponding to the 
nature ofthe aspecting planet Saturn who represents Labour, 
strikes and matters connected to labour disputes. 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHAT a5 


Now reverting back to the working of the KP. student Sri 
Sampath, he erroneously arrived atthe Lagna degree as 0°30° 
In Aries and noted down Ketu as star lord and Mars as Ras 
Lord of Lagana. He never did such mistakes hitherto and tt 
was unusual. 


As we all know that Monday the 1&m instant was the last 
date of Tamil month Masi, under rough working I arrivd atthe 
lagna degree for that moment (i.e. 9-46 a.m.} to be just 
beginning of Rishaba lagna (Taurus) (by adding in Sun nse 6- 
22, the durartion of meenam lhr 42 mts and Mesham Lhr 
47mis.) 


So | took up to the working at 9.55 a.m. and arrived at the 
matter as explained above. 


Hence coming to the point that, if | have net checked up 
and blindly took up the Ruling Planets of my friend we could 
not have arrived at the correct indication and would have 
landed somewhere. So | may be allowed to advice the KP. 
followers to please check up and recheck before they venture 
predictions under KP. 


| need not reiterate the fact that KP. alone is predictive 
and Ruling planets as advised by Sri KS.K alone guide one 
properly. So Prof. Krishnamurti will get the whole credit for his 
invention. 


| feel that | am obliged to reproduce the following words 
rightly told by Sri Nirmalandi Bhattacharyya of West Bengal in 
the end of his article "Why KR is more predictive" on page 5 
of Sep. 1969 issue of Astrology & Athrishta : 


“Were it be the old age - The age of Parasara or Brigu and 
were Krishnamurti lived then, he would have been crowned 
with A Rishi or Maharishi"

ASTROLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
OF ABSCONDING CHILD 
AND SAFE RETURN 


Our late Guruji Sothida Mannan, Jyothish Marthand Prof. 
KS. Krishnamurti served the noble cause of the sick, the 
down trodden and the common man by enlightening us with 
the various aspects of life, through his meticulous astrological 
work famed as Krishnamurti Padhdhati. The Astrology and 
Athrishta was also founded by him. | say befits the occasion, 
because | managed to help an agonized parent in solving the 
whereabouts of his son, in a humble way of my own, and 
thus keeping with the noble traits of our Guruji, whose sole 
aim of life was to serve the distressed. 


On 17-1-78, a fine morning, a respectable gentleman, with 
terrible anxieles on his face, called on me and reported that 
his child aged 11 was missing from home since the previous 
day 5-30 p.m. The gentleman had. reported the matter to the 
police as well. 


Having pacified my friend with soothing words, | requested 
him to furnish me a number within 1 to 249 and soon the 
reply came as 156. It was exactly 7-20 a.m. and | took up 
the matter immediately and prepared the following horary chart 
as per KP. using the "Horary Tables of Houses" by A.E. Manu 
for the given number.

Now let us analyse the chart in a crystal clear term. Let me 
also first particularly point out that the missing boy Is the 
querist's first progeny. So the 5* house from Scorpio i.e. Pisces 
16°30’50" is the lagna ofthe son for all practical purposes. 


KRISHNAMURT| PADHDHATI 89 


The Moon reflects the mind. Like the X ray that penetrates 
flesh in the body, the ray of the Moon, penetrates the mind 
and reveals us the truth. The Moon is posited in the 5m house 
which shows that the querist is terribly worried about his son. 
Further, the Moon is poised in the constellation of Venus the 
lord of 3 house, which as significance to houses 3, 9, 12 
from the boy's lagna, denoting the boy running away from 
home. So it is extremely clear that the father is terribly worried 
about his son's sudden absence from home. 


Now the walking out of the house should be judged as per 
KP. vide houses 3, 9, 12 from the son's lagna that is Pisces. 
As per Vimshottari dasa, the period running on the day the 
body left home was Venus dasa @rd house}, Venus bhukti, 
Rahu anthra, Jupiter sookshma which was from 15-1-78 to 9- 
2-78. So it is confirmed thatthe boy ran away during significant 
period. Well, ifthat is the case let us find out his return. KP. 
vide Horary Astrology page 260 reads thus. "For every action 
done by one; the 12th house there from is to undo it, 
Separation came because the significance of 3, 9, 12 counted 
from the related lagna". Se the houses to be judged are 2, 8, 
11. Here the 2" house falls in Aries the lord of which is Mars. 
The planets posited in the constellation of Mars is Jupiter. The 
8m house which falls is Libra is vacant and the lord of which is 
Venus. Moon is posited in Venus star. Further Kethu is in 11th 
house. Saturn and Mercury are posited in Kethu star. So 
summing up, the significant planets are Juptier, Moon, Kethu, 
Saturn and Mercury. Now here lies the most intriqueing and 
interesting aspect of the play ofthe significant planets. Jupiter 
despite the fact, is in retrograde motion and posited in the 
star of Mars which is also retrograde. It may be observed 
that it is in the sub of 8m house. Guruji has vehemently pointed 
out throughout his writings to study particularly the "SUB" as 
the Sub is the final deciding factor, no matter how and in what 
way the related planet itself is in retrogression. Here despite 
Jupiter's retrogression and tenanted in the constellation of Mars 
it is in the sub of Venus, the 8 lod.This definitely denotethe 
safe return ofthe boy within the Jupiter sookshma, which was 


SO RULING PLANT 


from 15-1 -78 to 9-2-78. But our friend wants a clear cut answer. 
Alas my desperate endeavour, led me earer to the truth. 
Guruji had taught us that the Sun and Moon are fructifying 
planets. Here Moon is a potential significator of 8m house by 
being posited in Venus sub. The lucky Moon on that day was 
transmitting the lucky star of Venus, the lord of 8 and the 
duration of which was exactly 24 hours. 


So, | boldly predicted to my esteemed friend not to worry 
and his son would definitely return within 24 hours. My friend 
with a great sigh of relief returned home. On the same day in 
the evening at about 5.30 p.m. | paid a sudden visit to my 
friend's house and | was tremendously surprised to gather 
that the boy returned home through the kind courtesy of a 
Taxi diver. My friend showered on me all sorts of praise. Well 
| told him that the credit should go to none but to the wonderful 
teaching of KP. 


With profound reverence to Guruji. 


STELLAR ASTROLOGY 
RP 


What could an astrologer following the age old Indian 
traditional systernm have replied to the consultant when ithe 
following was the positon of the heavens at question time? 
The placement of Jupiter, lord of the 12° in the lagna; the 
occupation of the 6th by the lagna lord, Saturn, associated 
with the Sun, the 8" lord, and Ketu, natural malefic; and the 
positioning of the marakasthara adhipathi, the Moon, in the 
lagna would surely have left him confounded and he was bound 
to err. Those who follow the stellar system, otherwise known 
as Krishnamurti Padhdhati, however do not encounter any 
difficulty as the method of prediction is simple, easy and clear- 
cut. 


It was 7-23 p.m. (IST) on 15-7-73 when Mr. Sadhya, my 
colleague, who had recently amved on transfer, approached 
me for consultation. His son had appeared in the Higher 
Secondary School Examination that year, and, as known to 
everyone, he was one of those ‘One Lakh’ students whose 
name did not find a place in the list of successful candidates 
which appeared on the newspapers. He then left for his native 
place for securing his marksheet, Transfer Certificate etc., but 
did not return so far nor informmed the reason for his overstay 
to his parents. This caused anxiety to Mr. Sadhya as to when 
his son would come back. He tried to make a telephonic contact 
to his native place but due to heavy rains the telecommunication 
system was completely disrupted and nothing could be known 
about the boy. Since | was badly busy, there was no time for 
me to deal with his problem on horary basis, and he was so 
much vexed that | had perforce to say something to him by 
way of consultation. | therefore noted the planetary situation 
and tried to reply to him through ruling planets. The map of 


92 RULING PLANT 


the heavens at 7.23 p.m IST on 15-7-72 (Sunday) at Bhopal 
was as under : 


Saturn 
Kethy 
Sun 


Mercury {R)

NIRAYANA 


Lagna 4°22

The Rukng planets were as follows ; 


Day Lord Sun 

Lagna Sign Lord Satum 

Lagna star Uthrashadha ruled by Sun 
Lagna sub lord Saturn 

Micon sign Makara ruled by Saturn 


Moon star Uthrashada = ruled by Sun 


The positon of the lagna rising at the time of judgement 
coincided with that of the Moon, Satum and Sun were the only 
ruling planets. The lagna sub lord, Saturn, was in the constellatin 
of Mars (Mrigasira), lord of houses 4 and 11 of the consultant 
placed in the 3d house (11'"to 5‘*, son). Thus Saturn, though 
despited as a natural malefic and an evil | planet denoting delay, 
dejection and disappointments, showed a very hopeful 
indication for the boys' return. Hence | looked for the transit 
of Moon. Moon, at the time of judgement, was transiting in 
makara sign ruled by Saturn, in the constellation of Utharashada 


KAISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI o3 


governed by the Sun and in the sub of Rahu. So when she 
moves to Satum's sub and reaches 5-6-40" the boy must 
return. The moon would reach this point just about sunrise on 
16-7-1973. So | predicted that the boy must reach the house 
next morning. .eé. on 16-7-1973 and the parents need not 
WOITy On any account. 


Further, as the lagna sub lord, Saturn, was a significator of 
ad and 11th houses, | was expecting that the boy's return 
would be intimated on trunk Telephone and it did happen. As 
soon as Mr Sadhya was coming down, the telephone bell 
began to ring and | was told to convey to Mr. Sandhya that 
his son was starting the same night by Itarsi Passner reaching 
Bhopal at about 7-15 am. next morning. Mr Sadhya was 
overjoyed to get the information and thanked me for the 
accurate answer. The boy came back on 16-7-73 moming as 
predicted. This is how Stellar Astrology works. 


Good Luck. 


THE REAL APPROACH TO 
K.P. HORARY 


The most important discovery of the late Shri Krishnamurti 
was his difference with the traditional astrology in respect of 
the horoscopes of the twins. The twins bom at an interval of 
the some minutes may have almost the same horoscopes as 
they may have the planets in the same house, in the same 
star and in the same sub so they wilt all signify the same 
‘house’ but still we see a great difference in the destinies of 
the twins. Why? Where is the difference? And here comes 
the greatness of out Guruji. He discovered thatthe difference 
is in sublord of the different houses as the sub Lords will all be 
different even though the difference in the birth time is of only 
a few minutes; the Great Astrologer shouted this thing is in his 
every reader but even to-day very few pay heed to this while 
allotting the significators. 


The horoscope should be prepared according to the KP. 
The planets should be given the different star and sub lord. 
But for allotting the different houses which they signify divide 
each house in lord, star and sub lord and then according to 
these star and sub lords assign the significators. Suppose 
Jupiter is at 13. 40 in Aries then it ts in the star of Venus ts the 
star lord of 2 and 3 houses and sub lord of first house then 
Jupiter will give the results, two, six, ten and first house and 
as the sub is more important it will give mostly the results of 
the first of the first house. 


| have found this theory of our late Guruji quite successful 
in the judgement. Recently | received a letter from my brother- 
in-law Dr. P. KR Verm a who is a class one officer in U. P. Health 
Service at Allahabad. A great Tantrik and astrologer told him 
after reading the horoscope of my sister that the time after

| reached Allahabad on 5' Feb 78 and asked my sister to 
take a number between one and 249. She affer bowing her 
head to the almighty, took number 189. | started the work at

Major Events : 


Buming - She was bumt badly on 13-11-47. The burning 
was serious and she was confined to bed for a long period. 
Shé was running Mercury Dasa Jupiter Bhukii Mars Antara 
and Saturn Soeokshma. 


Typhoid - 4.8.49 


one was running Mercury dasa, Satum bhukti, Venus Antara 
and Saturn Sookshma 


May 76 to 27-10-76; Atthe time she was running Venus 
Dasa, Mercury Bhukti, Saturn Antara. She had to face many 
troubles. Her younger brother was seriously ill at Allahabad, 
her grand mother-in-law died on 17-6-76, she had an accident 
on 17-86-76 and underwent a major operation for femerbone 
on 8-9-76. All during Saturn Antara. 


llness 17-1-77 - she fell ill and had high temperature. She 
was running Venus Dasa Ketu Bhukti Venus Antara and Saturn 
sookshma. 


All these show that during all her illness and accidents and 
other troubles Saturn was the chief planet, then Mars, Venus 
Mercury. If we look at the table we will see that Saturn is in 


102 RULING PLANT 


the sub of Moon which ts the sub lord of five, seven and 12 
houses, 12 stands for illness, trouble, loss, hospitalization, 
etc, 7 stands for Maraka house. Venus ts in the sub of Jupiter 
which is the sub lord of 7th house. Mars signifies 1, 2, 3, 8 and 
9. Mercury signifies 4 and 6 houses. All bad causing illness. 


But Satum signifies 5, 7, 9, 10,8 and 12 houses. So far her 
husband, Satum will signify 11, 1,6, 3, 4, 2 and 6 houses. All 
are good for service and promotion. 


12-4-73 Transfer to home town Allahabad. After much 
efforts he could manage to corne to his home town. The 
order was known to him on 12-4-73 when she was running 
Venus Dasa, Saturn Bhukti, Rahu Antara and Satum Sookshma. 


Promotion on 1-5-74; She was running Venus Dasa. Mercury 
Bhukti, Mercury Antara and Satur Sookshma. 


25-8-77 - Transfer to Allahabad. She was running Venus 
Dasa, Ketu Bhukti, Satum Antara and Satum Sookshma. 


Now we see that besides Satum which signifies her 11, 1 
and 6 houses, Mercury, Ketu are also good, Venus is also 
good for his service. Mercury signifies his 10, 12, Venus 1, 
Ketu (Jupiter) 10, 12, 6 houses. 


IN this way from wife's chart we can know about the major 
events of husband life. 


Marriage - the marriage took place in the last week of May. 
She was running Venus Dasa, Venus Bhukti, Rahu Antara. 
Venus and Rahu are in the sub of Jupiter which is the sub lord 
of 7tn house - the house of marnage and union. 


House construction, sale of property - She sold many of 
her landed property of more than 50 thousand rupees between 
28-4-75 to 27-5-75. She was running Mercury Bhukti and Moon 
Antara. Mercury signifies 4, 6, 1-1, 4 and 1 house. Moon 
signifies 1-1-1 houses. We know 4th house signifies property. 
House Gh benefit from other, 11 gain and 1 shows self. On 
10-10-75 she entered her newly constructed house and got 
Rs. 4500/- on that day as the arrears of long due rent. She 


KAISHNAMUATL PADHDHATI 103 


was running Mercury Bhukthi Rahu Antara and Mercury 
sookshma. Rahu represents Mercury and Mercury signifies 4, 
6, 11, 4and 1 house matters. All pertaining to the issue. 


Therefore we see that KR Horary Astrology throws light 
not only on the particular problem or question but on almost 
all the matters. The actual birth time is difficult to Know in 
almost all the cases and even a difference of a few seconds 
may change the sub lords of many houses and then tt will be 
impossible to predict. So why to bother about the birth time 
and birth chart when by applying the horary system of Shri 
Krshnamurt, we can easily judge the chart and the events 
correctly. 


Moon shows the mind. In the chart Moon is the lord of 7m 
house which is a maraca house and is in 12m which shows 
danger and trouble. So the question taken bythe sister was 
correct but as Sun Dasa started from 27-12-77 and Sun signifies 
11 and 1 house matters; although 1 11h will be a maraka house 
for her but | will give her protection and the entire penod of 
oun Dasa will be good for her. 


But one must have faith in the almighty as per late Shn 
Krishnamurt's teachings should have a right pious life and 
avoid doing wrong acts then only one can have success. Once 
again | pay my deepest tribute to honourable late Shri 
Krishnamurti who by introducing the Stellar and sub lord theory 
did the miracle. 


RULING PLANETS SOLVE 
PROBLEMS 


|. There are many innumerable systems of Astrology but 
no system is as accurate and perfect ‘KRISHNAMURTI 
PADHDHATHI' in the rectification of birth-time, and fixing the 
position of lagna or Moon. This marvel was discovered by 
Guruji Sir KS.K by taking Ruling planets. Ruling planets are 
planets ruling or goveming the moment when a query is taken 
for judgement. He proved that the ruling planets at moment 
of judgement and’ those at the time of fructification of an 
event are the same. This too was confirmed by KP. followers 
in many practical cases. 


Guruji has said that one can consult an astrologer only at 
such a time so that the ruling planets at that moment agree 
with the ruling planets at his or her birth time or his or her 
running Dasa, Bhukthi. 


Below | have discussed the problem of fixing the lagna 
sign, its position with the ruling planets and hence find the 
correct birth iime. In some cases, which are few, the Moon's 
position also get with the very same ruling planets; but this is 
not the case at all times. Ruling Planets provide the answer 
only to what you want to know. So when Moon's position does 
not coincide with the same Ruling planets, there is no reason 
to get perturbed; as it can be arrived with the help of ruling 
planets at the next sitting. 


Il. On 2-7-1978 (Sunday) at 3.05 PM. [5S.T. a friend of 
mine came to me to Know in which lagna he was born, whether 
sun sign, LEO or Mercury sign, VIRGO. He wanted to know 
the exact position of his lagna and hence his birth-time. So he 
said me to find itt using KP. He mentioned No.43 a number 
between 1 to 249. 


106 RULING PLANT 


Bowing to Guruji, | took on the subject immediately at 3.06 
P.M. I.S.T on the same day 2-7-1978. Sunday. The ruling 
planets then, were: 


DAY LORD - SUN 

LAGNA LORD - VENUS (Libra) 

LAGNA STAR - JUPITER 

MOON SIGN LORD - VENUS (TAURUS). 
MOON STAR LORD - MOON. 


Hence the ruling planets at the moments of Judgement 
are Sun, Venus, Jupiter, Moon. Here it is to be noted that Sun 
is in exact conjunction with (distance of 5* apart} Jupiter, the 
Lagna Siar lord. Sun ts to a faster planetthan Jupiter. As such 
Sun is stronger ruling planets than Jupiter, and Jupiter is redered 
weak. 


Ill. The person firstly wanted to know his birth-sign —ifit 
was Sun sign, LEO or Mercury sign, VIRGQ. Taking a look at 
the ruling planets. We find that Mercury does not appear as 
one at all where as Sun isa ruling planet. So we can boldly say 
that his Lagna is not VIRGO but Sun Sign, LEO. Fixing the star 
in the lagna is the next step. In LEO, we have stars of KETHU, 
VENUS and SUN. Kethu is not ruling planet and it can be 
dropped. Venus and sun are the ruling planets. Howto choose? 
All KP. followers are aware that in Ruling planets, Lord of 
Lagna sign is stronger than lord of lagna star; Lord of Moon 
Star is stronger than Lord of Moon Sign; which is in turn stronger 
than the Day-Lord. We find that in Ruling Planets Venus appears 
twice as Lord of Moon and Lagna signs; there by gains 
strength. Hence the Lagna has to be in Venus star and Venus 
Sub. Venus Sub is choosed because no:43 was given between 
1 and 249 which falls in Venus star. Another reason as to why 
| rejected Moon and Jupiter is because if they would have 
been governing the position of the lagna, the querist would 
have asked on a Monday with Jupiter star. In Venus Sub. Sun 
sub sub is to be taken as it is next in strength and Moon Sub 
sub sub, In Sun Sub sub. Hence, the lagna position is Venus 
olar, Venus Sub, Sun Sub Sub and Moon Sub Sub ie. of (LEQ) 


KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 107 
13°-43°. The position of his lagna is therefore LEO 13°-43”. 


According to him his birth date is 23-10-1965, The find out 
his birth time the Nirayana position of the lagna cusp is 
converted to Sayan a , sideral Time is calculated and birth- 
time is worked out. 


The procedure ts as follows: 


Nirayana Position of Lagna 


Cusp - 13°-43' of LEO 
Add Ayanamsa 
For year 1965 - 23°-16'

IY So | said him he was born in LEO Sign, VENUS, STAR 
and VENUS sub, the position of the Lagna Cusp being 13°-43° 
He said his was correct as he had already got it done by 
another KP. follower. He simply wanted to testthe correctness 
of KP. As is seen, in hundreds of practical cases. KP. is 
infalliable, very accurate and the same result Is arrived at all 
time. It is simple and crystal clear in its approach to problems. 
The efficiency of the system of Ruling planets is once again 
testified and proved to be correct. 


My friend was greatly impressed by it and not to mention 
it. | was too proud of what | had done with Guruji's and Lord 
Uchista Ganapathi's blessings.

11th lord is Jupiter conjoined with lord of Lagna. 3rd lord 
Mars is aspecting them. Therefore meeting is promised. Now 
we will select the powerful ruling planets among the above. 
Ruling planets, which are in the Star or Sub of another Ruling 
planets should be considered as strongest Ruling planets. So 
Saturn is powerful. Jupiter iS the Lagna star lord occupies the 
sub of Saturn. So Jupiter is also Powerful. Mercury is Lagna 
Sub lord. He is posited in the star and sub of Venus, which is 
not a ruling planet .So Mercury is very weak. Mars is powertul, 


KRISHNAMURTI_PADHDHATI 115 
because he is posited in the constellation of Jupiter. 


Kethu represents Saturn. So Kethu is powerful than Saturn. 
Besides it occupies the sub portion of Mercury. Rahu is in the 
olar of Saturn and sub of Mercury. So the powerful Ruling 
Planets according to their order of strength are Kethu, Mars, 
Jupiter, Satum and Hahu. Mars and Satum are aspecting each 
other. Besides Mars throws his aspect to Kethu and Jupiter. 
Jupiter forms trine aspect to Kethu. 


Now we have to fix a sensitive point in the Zodiac which is 
governed by the above ruling planets. The matter will 
matenalize when the luminaries will pass through this point. 
since Satum a delaying {slow moving) planet aspecting XIth 
house, some delay is indicated. Among the ruling planets Kethu 
was selected as powerful one. So the event should take place 
in a Kethu Star day. The date of analysis was on an Aswini 
star day. Next comes Makham star in Leo, ruled by Sun. 
since sun is not a strong ruling planet we can confidently avoid 
its sign. Next comes Moolam Star in Sagittarius. It is ruled by 
Jupiter a ruling Planet. Since a delay is indicated as Stated 
earlier, the event can not happen on this Star day. On 
september 16, 1981, Moon transits in Aswini Star in Aries 
ruled by Mars. So | decided that | can meet my friend only on 
16-9-1981. 


TO my Surprise my friend came to me on 16-9-1981 itself 
at 7-05 p.m. [S.T. Being an enthusiastic admirror of KP. | 
worked out the ruling planets to the above time for study 
purpose. The Lagna was nsing 12°35' pisces, Jupiter sign, 
Saturn's Star and Mars Sub. Moon was posited in Anes ruled 
by Mars in Aswini Star lord of which is Kethu.

Bom on 7-12-1943, Tuesday at 10-28 a.m. 
Place of Birth - SRIRAMSAM(Near Trichy) 
No other particulars were supplied. 


Here, a doubt arose as to the birth time. During 1942-1945 
Indian Standard Time was advanced by one hour for war 
purposes. Any recorded time should therefore be reduced by 
one hour to get the correct Indian Standard Time. As no 
information, about this was given to me, | wanted to fix the 
correct time of the preson by the K.PMethod of Ruling Pianets 
before the erection of the horoscope. 


Now 10-28 a.m. must be either war time or present Indian 
standard Time. These are the only two possibilities. 


Taking 10-28a.m. as war time we have to find the 
Ascendant. Reducing the time by one hour and after subtracting 
the correction time for Sri Rangam as per Longitude, we get 
one Local Mean Time. When the Asc. is worked out it comes 
to 4°6" in Makara Rasi (Capricom). It is in sat sign, sun star 
and sat sub. Let this be marked as I. 


Taking 10-28 a.m. as Indian Standard Time and applying 
the correction for Sri Rangam, we get the Local Mean Time. 


When Asc. is worked out, it comes to 19032 in Makara 
Rasi. Its position as per KP. is, Sat Signs, Moon Star and 
Mercury sub. This can be marked as II.

As Moon is powerful as the star lord at the time of judgement, 
it is concluded that the time given is LS.T. and not war-time. 


So Satum can be substituted for Rahu Mercury and Moon 
are powertul in the Ruling Planets. As Ascendant agrees very 
well with the Ruling Planets, we have to conclude that the time 
of birth given is LS.T. only, and not war time. Affer this fixation 
a letter was sent to the person concemed for the clarification 
of birth time. In reply confirmed that one hour correction had 
been given to the recorded time atthe time of birth Hundreds 
of Practical example like this have proved the utility of KP. 
system in Astrology. In the No.II case, Sun is weak, being 
date Lord only. So No.!I must be the correct birth time. 


RULING PLANETS - 
MINOR EVENTS 


Every KP. follower knows very well about the Ruling Planets 
and their utility at every stage in the predictive part of stellar 
Astrology. So, it is needless to write an additional paragraph 
on the theory of Ruling Planets. Already a number of Articles 
of various KP. followers on the subject of prediction with the 
help of Ruling Planets have been published in various issues of 
this Esteemed Magazine. | wish to add a few examples on 
Ruling Planets. 


I.My eldest son is a teacher in the S.E.Rly. High School, 
Bandamunda near Rourkela. He wrote to me in a letter that 
his school would be closed for summer vacation from 23-5-85 
and that he would come to Khurda Road with his family on 25- 
5-85. He wrote in such an ambiquous manner that | could not 
understand whether they would start on 24th evening to reach 
Khurda Road on 25" Morning or they would start on 25m 
evening to arrive Khurda Road on 26*. There are only two 
direct trains from Rourkela to Khurda Raod. One train Kalinga 
Express arrives Khurda Road in the night and the other Utkal 
Express arrives in the morning. My son always prefers night 
journey so that he can arrive in the morning hours. The morning 
train arrives Khurda Road by 6-30a.m 


| wanted to know with the help of Ruling Planets, whether 
they would come on 25m or 26m May, 85 and at what time 
they would reach home on that date. So, | worked out the 
Ruling Planets at 8-07 a.m. on Friday 24-5-85 at Khurda Road. 
At that time Moon was at 27-11 in Gemini and Lagna was at 
20-33 in Gemini. Se, the Ruling Planets were 


Laqna Star - Jupiter 
Laqna Lord - Mercury 


129 RULING PLANT 
Moon Star - Jupiter 
Moon Sign Lord -Mercury 
Day Lord - Venus 


Therefore the Ruling Planets were Jupiter, Mercury arid 
Venus. 


Here the question consists of fwo parts. The first part is 
whether they would come on 2om or 26m May, 85. The second 
part is at what time they would reach home on that date. 


Regarding date of arrival: 


25th is Saturday and Pushyami Star day. Saturn is not a 
Ruling Planet. 26m is Sunday and Aslesha Star day. Mercury is 
a strong Ruling Planet. So, they should come on Aslesha Star 
- day on Sunday, Aslesha is in cancer ruled by Moon who is in 
the Ruling Lagna. Sun is aspected by the strong Ruling Planet 
Jupiter. So, it was finally decided that they would arrive Khurda 
Raod on 26-5-85 only but not on 25-5-85. 


Regarding time of reaching home:- 


The train arrival time is 6.30 a.m. which corresponds to 
Venus sign, Taurus, Mars Star, Satum Sub. Venus is a Ruling 
Planet but Mars and Saturn are not Ruling Planets. So, the 
train should come late. Here | am not concemed with the 
train arrival time but | want to know the time of their reaching 
home. From the Ruling Planets Jupiter and Mercury are very 
strong. So, my son should reach home when the lagna transits 
Mercury sign, Gemini, Jupiter Star from 7-57 a.m. to 842 
a.m. a long range of 45 minutes. So, the sub position should 
be determined. Now Jupiter is the star lord of Moon and lagna 
and also the lagna sub lord. Mercury ts the lord of the Moon 
sign and lagna. Thus Jupiter is stronger than Mercury. 
Therefore the positon should be Jupiter sub and Mercury 
sub-sub. But Mercury is conjoined with Rahu. Therefore it 
should be Jupiter sub and Rahu sub-sub. That means the 
lagna should be at Mercury sign, Jupiter Star, Jupiter sub and 
Rahu sub-sub, from 21-30-40 to 21-46-40 in Gemini. This 


position corresponds to 8-3-24 a.m. to 84-37 a.m At that 
time Moon would be in its own sub in Mercury star, Aslesha. 


What had actually happened is stated below. My children 
could not understand the ambiguity of the information in the 
letter. So they were very particular to attend the train on 
saturday 25-5-85. In order to satisfy then | took them to 
station on 25" by 6-15 a.m.We came to know that there is no 
train at all on Saturdays but there is the morning train on 
sundays. | did not know this fact till that day. Thus the first 
part of my prediction was partly correct. We went to the 
slation on 26 by 6 a.m. and got the information that the 
train was running late by 2 hours. So, it has to come around 
8.30 a.m. This contradicts my prediction. We returned home 
and immediately | checked up my calculation and found no 
mistake. As per Rly. Information we can start from home at 
about 800 a.m but if my prediction were to come true, we 
must go to station earlier. Also there was the pressure of my 
children. So we started again by 7.30 a.m. It is only a few 
minutes walk about 10mts. Just as we reached the station, 
the train arrived. My son got down with his family and we all 
reached home just by 8-04 a.m. Thus prediction entirely proved 
to be correct. 


Il. Restoration of Electricity 


During summer vacation when we were in our native place, 
electric current was off at about 10 p.m. or so (night) on 
Saturday 15-6-85. There was no restoration of power till evening 
on Sunday 16-6-85. It is remote village and no information 
could be gathered about the approximate time of restoration 
of power. Everybody was vexed with the situation and was 
very anxious to get the power again. At last | had to resort to 
the method of Ruling Planets to find out when the power 
would be restored. 


| worked out the Ruling Planets at 4-12 p.m. on Sunday 
16-6-85. Moon was at 80-27" in Sun Star Krittika in Venus sign 
Taurus. The Lagna was at 1°-13' in Jupiter star Visaka in Mars 
sign scorpio. Hence the Ruling Planets were as stated below. 


124 RULING PLANT 
Lagna Star - Jupiter 
Lagna Lord - Mars 
Moon Star Lord - Sun 
Moon Sign Lord - Venus 
Day Lord -Sun 


From the above Ruling Planets how to arrive at the correct 
decision? At the moment of analysis scorpio Lagna 
commenced. The next lagna is Sagittarius ruled by Jupiter 
who is a strong Ruling Planet. So, power should be restored 
during Dhanur lagna. Sagittarius contains the stars of Kethu, 
Venus and Sun. Even though Kethu is in Venus sign Libra, it is 
conjoined with Saturn. Therefore Kethu mainly represents 
saturn who is not a Ruling Planet. So Kethu star is eliminated. 
Among the Ruling Planets Venus is the Moon rasi lord while 
sun is the Moon star Lord and the day lord. So, Sun ts stronger 
than Venus. So, Venus cannot claim the star lord-ship. 
Therefore Sun attains the star lordship. Now among the Ruling 
Planets namely Jupiter, Mars, Sun, and Venus, the sign lordship 
and star lordship claimed by remaining are Mars and Venus 
who are Lagna sign lord and Moon sign lord respectively. So 
Mars has to occupy the status of sub lord. The last planet is 
Venus who is conjoined with Rahu. Therefore Rahu should be 
taken for Venus. Hence Rahu should go to sub-sub. In short, 
the power should he restored when the Lagna transits Jupiter 
sign Sagittarius, Sun Star Mars sub. This position occurs from 
8-20 p.m. to 8-24 p.m on the sameday. Moreover among 
the Ruling Planets Jupiter, Mars and Sun are Stronger than 
Venus. Hence leaving Venus aside, the combination of Jupiter, 
Mars, Sun occurs once only in the entire Zodiac and that is 
Jupiter sign Sun star Mars sub. Actually the power returned 
exactly at 8-21 p.m. the same day. This moment is ruled by 
Rahu sub-sub in Mars sub. 


l11. Reading Home 


3) Our school reopened on Friday 28-6-85 after Summer 
Vacation. We reached Chipurupalle Rly. Station by 7 a.m. on 
Thursday 27-6-85. We had to make our journey by Madras. 


KAISHNAMUATI PADHDHATI 125 


Howrah Janata Express which leaves Chipurupalle Station by 
7-39 a.m.. | came to know that the train would arrive a few 
minutes late but there was no trace ofthe train till 815 a.m. | 
had the following idea in my mind. The next day (28-6-85) 
being the day of Return car Festival of Lord Jaganath of Puri, 
the Rly. Authorities may convert the train as passenger between 
Berhampur and Khurda Road. Even if there would be no such 
arrangement, Chain pulling is common from just about 10 
stations before Khurda Road. So, ordinarily it is difficult to say 
when the train would reach Khurda Road. With these ideas in 
mind | wished to know from Ruling Planets when we would 
reach home. 


| worked out the Ruling Planets at 8-20 a.m. At that moment 
Moon was at 29-25 in Virgo in Mars Star. Lagna was at 20-17 
in Cancer in Mercury star. Hence the Ruling Planets were:- 


Lagna Star --Mercury 
Lagna - Moon 

Moon Star - Mars 
Moon Rasi - Mercury 
Day Lord - Jupiter 


50, the Ruling Planets are Mercury. Moon, Mars, Jupiter. 


Journey generally takes about 7 hours. So Moon star or 
Mars star in Mercury sign Virgo is ruled out. The next Lagna is 
Libra ruled by Venus who is not a Ruling Planet. Then follows 
scorpio Lagna ruled by Mars, Who is Ruling Planet. So wer 
have to reach home in Scorpio Lagna. We may take Dhanur 
Lagna as Jupiter is a Ruling Planet but this sign has no star of 
Moon or Mars or Mercury. So, it is decided that we should 
reach home during Scorpio Langa only. This sign has the stars 
of Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury. Now Jupiter and Mercury are 
Ruling Planets. Mercury is Lagna star Lord and Moon sign lord 
and Jupiter is the day lord. The Mercury star should be taken. 
The remaining Ruling Planets are Moon and Jupiter. Moon ts 
Lagna lord and Jupiter is day lord but Jupiter is aspecting the 
Ruling Lagna and the Moon, and is aspected by the Ruling 
Planets Mars and Mercury and is in the star of Moon. So 


126 HAULING PLANT 


Jupiter is also a sufficiently strong Ruling Planet. Therefore we 
must reach home when the Lagna transits Moon sub. Jupiter 
sub-sub or Jupiter sub, Moon sub-sub. Now af the time of 
analysis, Lagna was in cancer and Saturn was in Libra. So, the 
Lagna was aspected by Saturn. So, the earlier chance should 
be omitted. Moon sub, Jupiter sub-sub is earlier than Jupiter 
sub, Moon sub-sub in Mercury star. Hence | decided that we 
should reach home when the Lagna transits Mars sign, Mercury 
slar, Jupiter sub, Moon sub-sub from 27%-22'-14" to 27°-3l'- 
07" in Scorpio. This position corresponds to 5-21 p.m. to 5-22 
at Khurada Road. 


The train arrived Chipurupalle at 9.a.m. Generally the trains 
halt for a minute or two at that station but konark express 
was running late by about 6 hours on that day. So, to give 
precedence to it, out train was detained at Chipurupalle. Hence 
our train left the station at 9-15 aim. The train was not 
converted as passenger form Berhampur but there were Chain 
Pullings. However, the train arrived Khurda Road Station just 
by 5 p.m. which falls in Moon sun. It was raining atthat time. 
So we stayed for some time in the station and then reached 
home at 5-21 p.m. when Lagna was transiting Mars sign 
Mercury star, Jupiter sub and Moon sub-sub. 


| conclude this article with pranams to lord Uchishta Maha 
Ganapathy and with due respects to our beloved Guruji who 
invented this unique method. 


FIXING OF MARRIAGE WITHOUT 
EXAMINING THE HOROSCOPES - 
K.P. ONLY ANSWER 


Some family friends very cose to us have visited my house 
on the evening of 1-5-86 for astrological consultantions. One 
of them is a doctor and another is a wife of an Income Tax 
Officer. 


During the course of discussions, the doctor told that though 
astrology Is a divine science, people are not much believing as 
a sciene, as the predictions do not come true and every thing 
becomes commercialized as business. But my husband 
disagreeing stated that science is a science for ever and the 
results can be verified at any time and at any place without 
reference to the reservations if the principles are followed as 
propounded by Guruji late Prof. Krisnhnamurti,whnose unrelented 
search for the lacunae and missing links of traditional astrology 
for correct predictions and offer accurate predictions, which 
can be verified cent per cent very very correctly without fail. 
As already told by the late Prof. that it can because of this 
science being handled by quacks to eam their living that it lost 
all its grandeur. 


My husband wanted to convince the doctor in a natural 
way and explained that how many doctors who have obtained 
their degrees and gold medals from the Universities have 
become popular and famour in their fields. Really speaking all 
are not successful in their fields due to many reasons. Due to 
this, we cannot conclude and say that the medicine is not a 
science. Similarly people know and speak astrology, can we 
Call all of them astrologers? No Certainly not! 


128 RULING PLANT 


Another friend observed that now a days | am not telling 
correctly. | could not keep quite at this remark and questioned 
her that what | have not told correctly regarding the marriage 
of her daughter, four years back She was, perhaps, not 
satished with the prediction in this regard, rather she consulted 
quite a number of great astrologers who predicted the date of 
marnage which has not materialized so far. One thing | can 
appreciate her when ever she consults any body, the next 
dayshe comes to my house and informs whatever they told 
about the marriage of her daughter and the period they have 
given and asks me whether if is correct. 


| always advice the lady let us wait patiently and see and 
hope for the good. When the said period is passed on without 
any sign of mariage matters, it becomes routine for me to 
console her. | have already told that the mamiage is not going 
to be materialized before 86, whereas other told her something 
which does not turn true. IS my prediction not correct? 


Finally both of them accepted and agreed that what | have 
predicted has come true, whereas the predictions offered by 
professionals failed. 


At lastthe lady friend asked me to predict whether fixing of 
maimage will be settled with the boy whose horoscope she 
brought with her. She also narrated that everything is OK and 
only they have to give green signal for this. Some astrologers 
also assured her that the martiage surely will take place this 
time. She wanted to verify my prediction in KP. knowing her 
mind. | have not viewed the matter very seriously. | do not 
want to clash with others and their knowledge and thereby 
getting into troubles. Further | do not myself consider great 
and | still feel a learner. 


Even if | say something she will not Keep quite and used to 
consult professionals, quacks etc. and spend a lot on this 
purpose and observe whatever they suggest for the remedy. 
SO / coolly advised her, if that is the case, please give green 
signal and see what will happen. Destiny is Destiny, Fate cannot 
be dodged as we like. 


KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 129 


| never denied her request at any time and impress them 
now also to prove that KP. alone can stand the test of accuracy 
and correctness of its results. Qur Guruji has told already in 
his books the ruling planets of the lagna of the boy or girl must 
reflect the houses 2,7,11 of others then only they become life 
partners other wise not. | do not want to proceed straight 
away examining individual horoscopes and approach the 
problem with another method, whether it promises the 
settlement, then only the detailed work can be taken up form 
the individual horoscopes. | have obtained a horary number 
?? from her as a consultant for matching the horoscope and 
the time of judgment was 8-10 p.m on 1-5-86. The chart is 
as follows.

Lagna Sub Lord Venus. Moon in Mars star and Mars sub. 
The position of houses and planets are not furnished as the 
same are not considered necessary here. 


Rule: If the Moon occupies 1,3,5,7,10 and 11 and the 
Moon is in good aspect with Jupiter (30,60,120} then declare 
that the marriage will take place. If Jupiter is retrograde or 


130 AULING PLANT 


Saturn squares the Moon the mariage between A an B will 
not take place. If Moon occupies 2,4,6,8 and 12 even inspite 
of good aspect the marriage will not take place. 


Though the above rule appears to be properly and correctly 
applied and seen in the above char, the judgment is given not 
in favour of settlement. The reason it, though the Moon is in 
7m house, it is in the star of Mars in 6" which negates the 
marriage. 


The theory of Gulbarga observations if the sub of lord of 
the number given happens to the star lord of Moon or 
Ascendent in the ruling planets the reply is yes otherwise No. 
The ruling Planets at the time of judgment of this chart were- 
Daylord Mercury (Wednesday) 2Rasi lord-Saturn 3.Star lord- 
Mars 4..agna lord-Venus and 5.Lagna star lord-Rahu. Here in 
the chart the sub-lord of the given No. is venus. Venus is not 
either star lord of Moon or Ascendent representing the ruling 
planets. As such is not in favour of settlernent. 


| have evolved a technique, which is very very simple without 
many cumbersome calculations, whether the given query will 
materialize or not, can be known and tested many occasions 
and proved with very satisfactory results. The method Is to 
take a number preferably from 1 to 249 or any number as 
they like and divide the number by 12. If the remainder is 
02,6 and 11 the result is favourable. 1,3,7 and 9 the result is 
late. 4,5,8and 10 the result is unfavourable. In this case, the 
number 77 when divided by 12, the reminder is five. The 
result indicated for 5 is unfavourable for the query. 


Taking all the above factors into consideration, it was 
concluded that the setthkerment will not materialize. 


The prediction seems to be disheartening to a great extent, 
as the conclusion is not anticipated by them. | requested my 
friend notto be upset for this and do whetever we have to do 
to maximum extent and leave the result to got as per the 
teachings of Lord Sn Krishna in Geetha. We have to do our 


KAISHNAMURT) PADHDHATI 1 


karma according to our fate, which cannot be altered. The 
time nearing 9-30, they left depressed. 


After this incident, | forgot everthing. My friend also had 
not visited my house nearly for two weeks. She suddently 
appeared on one day at about 11.00 a.m. and narrated the 
things happened during these days. The boy and his relatives 
have seen the girl and communicated by post due to some 
domestic problems, the idea of marriage has been dropped. 
In the mean while, she has verified the antecendents of the 
boy and came to know that the boy's character is not good 
and he is working as a class IV in some private concern and 
education is also not an par with the girls. They have furnished 
all false information. The girl being a first class science graduate 
did not like this match. Thank got that the proposal fell through 
and it is good for us. Man proposes but god disposes Is a true 
proverb. 


Astrology being a divine science, in all cases any method 
will give the same answer. It is a wonderful science. Simple 
and straightforward method producing the same results even 
though the astrologers are different. 


The aim and intention of this paper is not to hurt any body 
in the field of astrology and their predictions, which may vary 
and give different results and the consultant will be confused 
further. My only sincere request and suggestion to belovd co- 
astrologers is to put their heart into the depth of the problem 
In a lucid way, minimizing the contradictory opinion and to 
enhance the prestige of astrology as a divine science as 
dreamed by our revered Guruji.

As per KP. theory the following guidelines are indicated to 
know whether the party will come or not, and if the arrival is 


promised whether it is sooner or later etc. 


KRISHNAMURTL PADHDHAT 139 


1. Ifthe 7th cusp sub lord is deposited in the constellation of 
a planet signifying 3, 9, 5, 7, 4m houses along with 11th 
house the party come sooner and it is imminent. 


2. Ifthe 7" sub lord is deposited in the constellation of a 
planet signifying, 8, 12along with 10th house the party will 
net come. 


3. Ifthe 7th sub lord is deposited in the constellation of a 
planet signifying 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 11" houses along with 10, 
8, and 6m houses the party will cme and it denotes late 
due to for 6, 8,10 and 12m houses. 


Now let us analyse the chart taken for the purpose. In this 
chart the 7m sub lord Rahu ts deposited in the star of Mercury 
which signifies 3, 4,5, 9 and 11tn houses. Though the Mercury 
Is In retrograde it is inthe starof Rahu which ts never retrograde. 
So the arrival of party is promised. As the 7m sub signifies 
positively the arrival of the party indicates sooner. Though 
they expressed that there was no possibility of coming here 
for 15 days there from. | do not believe that itwill take such a 
long time to occur the happening. Since the 7m sub is in the 
star of Mercury which signifies 3, 4, 5, 9 and 11th houses 
brilliantly we should assure that it will take place with in a few 
days. Bearing this in our mind we should move the Moon's 
transit until ittouches the cuspal point in which the combination 
of beneficial significators fall in line. 


Next we should find out the significators for the houses 
taken for analysis. 


ad houses - Meeting 


Venus, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Kethu. Among these 
Venus and Moon are posited in the star of Sun who is the 
significator of 10m houses they are not favourable. So we 
choose Saturn, Jupiter, and Kethu. Satum which is in Mercury 
star signifies 9, 11, 1 and 4m houses Jupiter which is in Saturn 
star signifies 1, 4, 3 and 5m houses Kethu is in the star of 
Moon signifies 3, 9, 10 and 1 1th houses. — 


136 RULING PLANT 
9th house - Party’s departure 


saturn, Rahu, Mercury and Kethu. 


4th house - My House 


saturn, Jupiter are the significators of the 4m house. Moon 
and Venus are also significators of 4m house. Among these 
Saturn and Jupiter are good. 


Sth house - fulfillment of the party 


Mercury, Jupiter, Sun, and Rahu are the significators of this 
house. Of all these, Mercury and Jupiter are more favourable, 
because of Mercury is in the star of Rahu in 5m and owner of 
9 and 11th house and Jupiter is owner of 5m house and signifies 
1st house. 


11th house - fulfillment of Ambition 


Saturn, Ranu, Mars, Mercury and Kethu are the significators 
of this house 


Among these we choose the significators forthe houses 


3 Saturn Jupiter 
Ath Saturn Jupiter 
5m Mercury Jupiter 
1st Saturn Jupiter 


9m Rahu, Saturn, Kethu, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter (because 
of Jupiter aspects of Kethu) 


11°". fulfillment of Ambition 


Rahu, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Kethu are 11th houses, 
significators. 


so we may arrange the planets according to the cuspal 
position

KRISHNAMUATI. PADHDHATI 137 
We may take this position to the moon's transit. 


The remaining significators are Mercury, Rahu and Kethu. 
When we take the Moon's transit to the cuspal position of the 
significators refered formerly, we should wait until the Lagna 
on that day touches the cuspal position of Mercury, Rahu and 
Kethu. At last we have found out the two sensitive points. 


So we should arrive the date and time when the two points 
coincide with the Mon and Lagna transit. The Moon at the 
time of Judgement is in uthara darn star. The Moon should 
move to the Jupiter star (i.e. Poorattathi), On 28-2-87 at 2-15 
p.m. the Moon transits in the sign Saturn Star Jupiter 
(Poorattathi) and the sub Jupiter at that time. The Lagna 
transits in the sign Mercury, star Rahu, and the sub Kethu at 
2-15 p.m on that day on 28-2-87 at 2-15 p.m. both the Moon 
and, Lagna transit in the respective cuspal position where the 
favourable significators become the rulers of the cuspal positions 
that will cause the expected result. 


After having assured myself the date and time (i.e. on 28- 
2-87) at 2-15 p.m.) | noted the time with analysed chart in a 
paper and put it in a senled cover. 


Exactly on that day (28-2-87) at 2-10 p.m. party that put 
the test before me entered my room. During that time, | was 
engaged in giving astrological advice to another party. They 
came and seated themselves in my drawing room. After a 
few minutes they looked at me with an interrogative mark in 
their face. | silently handed over the cover that | have already

the time than they were struck with dump. After that they 
wanted to know the analysis step by step. | helped them with

PURCHASE OF VEHICLE 
THROUGH BANK 


In the present time the strength of Jupiter is waning where 
as that of Venus is waxing. This decreases the interest in 
Vaidheek Ceremonies, satya Karma etc., essential for Para- 
loka-Suka and more and more indulgence in Iha-Loka-Suka. 


Venus is the Karak of music, fine arts, Bharatha Natya, 
Vehicle, conveyance Wealth, Ornaments, ladies etc. But here 
| am interested in vehicle only, the Karak of which is Venus. 


Now a days it has become the matter of prestige for people 
to have atleast one vehicle at the door otherwise according to 
them there is no regard, no honour in the Society. 


It is easty to buy the vehicle at present as there is no need 
of spending money in total from their pockets rather to take 
the help of bank whois ever ready to give financial support to 
the purchaser of the vehicles. 


Here | am going to discuss the same type of case where a 
man who was not capable to purchase the vehicle paying full 
amount from his pocket, takes the help of the bank, a financing 
body to fulfill his desire. 


A young man entered my room on 26-5-85 nearly at 1 
p.m. and requested me to predict the date at which a truck 
chassis would be handed over to him for which he was trying 
and seeking the help from the bank. He further said that the 
manager of the Bank had promised to give the draft within a 
week. But it is not possible for me to wait even one week so 
please predict the date at which the draft will be handed over 
and the chasis will come in my hand. 


Listening his story | asked him to give a number between 1

to 249 and the number given was 3. Then | told him to meet 
again in the evening after 6 p.m. as he was to leave Serghati 


at 8 p.m the same day. 


The -calculation was made at 2-55 p.m. on 26-5-85 at

Whether a horoscope promises vehicle or not is judged by 
the 4tn Cusp and Venus, If the sub lord of the 4th cusp or the 
star lord in which sub lord is posited is significator of 4* cusp 
and any way connected with Venus, promises the vahan Joga, 
otherwise not. 


Here the 4" cusp sub lord is Mercury which is the sign lord 
of the 4m cusp and Venus is in the star of Mercury, hence 
vehicle is promised. 


For the type of vehicle we see that Venus and Moon are 
the significators of the 4" house and Mars is posited in the 
sign of Venus, Taurus. This indicates that there will be engine 
and Petrol or any fuel will be required to drive the vehicle. 


Now the sub lord of the 4th cusp is Mercury which is deposited 
in a movable sign as well as a bestial sign Aries which indicates 
4 wheeled vehicle. 


Here it is clear that the native will have 4 wheeled Vehicle 
according to the horary chart. Nowthe thing left IS to calculate 
the time only, when he will have the same. 


Itis the 1i™cusp which clearly indicates that whether the 
desire of the native will be fulfilled or not in horary. The 11" 
cusp sub lord isVenus which is indirect motion and Venus is 
posited in the star of Mercury which is also indirect motion 
hence the desire will be fulfilled. Here sub lord Venus is in the 
12m house indicating some delay, disappointment and 
frustration. 


Moreover the sign lord of 11" cusp retrograde Saturn is 
aspecting the 11%cusp, so until and unless it becomes direct 
there is no chance of fulfilling the desire of native. 


142 RULING PLANT 


To have a vehicle the significators of houses 4, 9, 10 and 
11 are considered. The purchaser has to pay the cost, hence 
12h house along with ad will be taken. And in the case where 
the help from bank is taken the 6th house is also considered as 
the 7m represent Bank and 6 isthe 12h to 7m. Therefore the 
significators of the houses 2, 4, 6, 9, 10 11 and 12 are to be 
taken. All the nine planets are the singificators. 


Asihe significators are all the nine planets so to decide the 
date of purchase, the ruling planet is the only aid which will 
give the clue. 


Ruling Planets are ,; 


Day Lord Sunday Sun 
Moon sign lord Moon 

Moon star lord Mercury 
Moon sub lord Jupiter 
Lagna sign lord Mercury 
Lagna star lord Mars 

Lagna sub lord Rahu 


Satum iS aspecting Jupiter and is in mutual aspect with Sun 
and Mars. All these three are the ruling planets, hence Saturn 
will also act as a ruling planet. 


At the time of judgement Mercury dasa Jupiter Bhukt and 
Mercury Anthra was running. 


Jupiter and Mercury are the ruling Planets, hence will give 
vehicle in this period Saturn will be direct on 27-7-85 hence 
there is no chance of getting the vehicle before 27m July ‘85. 


The Anthra of Mercury will be ending on 12-8-85. So, | 
predicted that you would get the vehicle before 12-8-85 and 
after 27-7-85. Therefore no chance of getting the chasis within 
a week from the day of judgement. 


Time of tructification 


1. Bank Manger handed over the draft fo him on 23-7-85 
on Tuesday lord of which has appeared as lagna star 
lord. 


KRISHNAMURT| PADHDHATI 143 


2. He submitted the draft to the company from where he 
was to get the chasis on 27-7-85 on Saturday, day when 
Saturn came in direct motion. 


3. The chasis was handed overto him on 28-7-85 on Sunday 
on the same day Mercury went in retrograde motion in 
Shookshama period of Saturn. 


Transit on 28-7-85 


a. Sun inSaturn star and Moon sub in Cancer sign. 
b. Moon in Vrischika rasi and Mercury Star. 

c. Mercury-Sun sign Leo Kethu star and Venus sub. 
d. Jupiter-Makara Rasi Moon star and Mercury sub. 
e. Saturn in Libra sign-Jupiter star and Venus sub. 


Conclusion 


Here from this case study it is celar that any ruling planet 
which is in retrograde motion at the time of judgement but in 
the star and sub of direct motion Planet will give the result only 
after getting the direct motion. 


But any planet which is appearing as the ruling Planet in 
direct motion and in star and sub of planets in direct motion 
will not deny togive result even when they come in retrograde 
motion at the time of fructifying the event. 


Here at the time of Judgement both Juptier and Mercury 
are in direct motion and posited in the star and sub of direct 
motion planets. And at the time of fructification both Jupiter 
and Mercury are in retrograde motion but no not deny the 
result. 


Now | think that this is the suitable and of the article with 
Pranams to our beloved Guruji. 


Good Luck 


CONSIDERATION OF 
RULING PLANETS 


Every student of astrology Knows that a particular moment 
on any day, a certain planet governs the sign (rasi) tenanted 
by the Moon (Chandra), another planet the nakshatra 
(asterism) occupied by the Moon, a third planet the nakshta 
sub division {called the sub) where the Moon was at the 
moment, and soon. The week day again, Is ruled by a certain 
planet. These planets are what we refer to as "Ruling planets”. 
The position of the Moon being the same for all places on the 
Earth, the Moon rasi, Nakshatra and sub lords will be the 
same for all places, but the lord of the week day may not be. 
The seven days of the week are ruled as follows : 


Sunday is ruled by the Sun; 
Monday by the Moon; 
Tuesday by Mars; 
Wednesday by Jupiter 
Thursday by Jupiter; 

Friday by Venus and 
Saturnday by Saturn. 


In addition to these, and even more important than these, 
are the planets which co-rule the point of the Zodiac which 
nses at that moment in the locality. Obviously, these will be 
different for different places. The lords of the sign {rasi), 
asterism (nakshatra}) and the sub-division of the nakshatra of 
the Ascendant (lagna) rising at the place are the strongest 
Ruling Planets. 


Thus the Ruling Planets will be 
1. The lord of the sign rising in the east 
, 2. The lord of the star in the ascendant then rising; 


—_s 
mm 
op 


RULING PLANT 
. The lord of the sub in nakshatra nsing in the lagna; 


3 
4. The lord of the sign in which Moon is placed at the 
moment; 


5. The lord ofthe asterism transited by the Moon: 


6. The lord of the sub division in the nakshatra then occupied 
by the Moon, and 


7. The lord of the week day 


lf Rahu or Kethu were conjoined with, or occupy, a sign 
owned by any ofthe Ruling Planets, the nodes Rahu or Kethu 
are said to be stronger than even such planets. For example, 
if Rahu is conjoined with Venus or is in Taurus (Rishaba) or 
Libra (Tula) ruled by Venus, then Rahu should be taken as a 
ruling planet if Venus happens to rule the week day in question 
or when Taurus or Libra nses on the lagna at that moment or 
happen to be the signs where the Moon was deposited, or 
when the asterism nsing in the lagna or the astensm occupied 
by the Moon belongs to Venus. 


All Krishnamurti Padhdhati followers know very well the 
importance and relevance of the ruling planets while making 
prediction, whether it be in a horary chart or natal chart. They 
assume significance, irrespective of whether the event under 
consideration is a major or minor one. 


The Ruling planets act as the guides and assist in selecting 
the strongest significators and the time when the projected 
event will culminate. 


When applied to the natal chart, the Ruling Planets will agree 
fully with the dasa, Bhukthi and anthrax periods in operations. 


In my humble experience the Ruling Planets should be paid 
due attention because the significators of any house cusp for 
a particular problem can easily be obtained while the mode of 
consideration of the strength and the choosing of Ruling planets 
can be very well understood only by an expenenced follower 
of Krishnamurti Padhdhati. This, however, does not mean that 


KAISHNAMUAT! PADHDHATI 14? 


— 
a 


one ned to be an experienced follower of Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati in order tounderstand the ruling planets well. Any 
average student can be sufficiently good in the delineation of 
the ruling planets and fixing the fruitful periods, if he is quite 
conversant with the fundamentals of Krishnamurti Padhdhati. 


The Ruling Planets consititute the key to successful prediction. 
A wrong analysis or a misjudgement of the ruling planets can 
very easily affect a prediction adversely. 


Based on my own personal expenence as an eamest follower 
of Krishnamurti Padhdhati | wish to make a few observations. 


1. The ruling planets, as mentioned earlier, are the day lord, 
lagna - sign lord, lagna star lord, lagna sub lord Moon - 
sign lord, the Moon star lord and the Moon sub lord. 


2. Rahu or Kethu in the sign of ruling planets or aspected by 
them or conjoined with them become strong ruling planets. 


3. The lagna sub lord should also be taken as a ruling planet 
in every case. Moon sublord can be considered as a 
ruling planet only when the matter is expected to fructify 
soon; otherwise, it need not be considered. In some cases, 
hawever, the Moon sub-sub lord was found to have some 
connection with the event and it may also be taken as a 
ruling planet, but only when the matter under judgement 
can tructify very early and also if such a sub-sub lord (of 
Moon) appears as a fruitful significator of the matter being 
judgd. 


4, Planets occupying the lagna sign and Moon sign are arse 
ruling planets. 


5. A ruling planet aspected by another ruling planet makes 
the former stronger than the latter. Here, | would advocate 
the consideration of aspects according to the Hindu 
systeml,the aspects of the all planets on all those in the 
7m from therm, and the special aspects of Jupiter on th 
5m and 9m from its position, and similarly of Mars on the 
4* and 8th and of Satum on the 37 and 10:. 


148 RULING PLANT 


6. Any other planet can also be taken as a ruling planet ff, 
and only if, itis aspected by a strong ruling planet. Here, 
the 7” house aspect can also be considered in addition to 
the special aspects. 


7. Planets in close conjunction with, or in close proximity 
(upto 5°) to,the ruling planets may also be assumed as 
ruling planets. Ifthe former is a faster-mong planet as 
compared to the latter, it becomes a strong ruling planet. 


Among these, those which are retrograde will cause delay 
as long as they are so and will be fruitful only after they- 
become direct in motion. 


The Ruling planets placed in ihe sub of those detrimental to 
the matter under judgernent may be given up and only those 
which are in the sub of promising planets to be considered. 


Earlier, it used to be thought that a ruling planet deposited 
in a retrograde planets nakshatra would not be fruitful, but it 
has now come to light that such a planet is not entirely 
ineffective, especially if it be a strong significator of the houses 
having a bearing on the matter under consideration. 


| would place the strength of the ruling Planets in the 
following descending order : 


1, Lagna sub lord 

. Lagna star lord 
Lagna sign Lord 
. Moon sub lord 

. Moon star lord 

. Moon sign lord 

. Day lord 


Here, | should like to offer a few comments on the manner 
of chosing the Bhukthi and anthrax lords after weighing the 
strength of the ruling planets. | have observed that some 
practitioners give up those planets which are in the 12th (sign) 
to that occupied by the dasa lord or Bhukthi lord i.e. when the 
Bhukthi lord is in the 12" (sign) to the dasa lord or when the 


SAO ON 


KAISHNAMUATL PADHDHAT| 149 


anthra lord is stationed in the 12 (sign) reckoned from the 
sign occupied by the Bhukthi lord. This principle, | must say, is 
faulty. Whether the Bhukthi lord or anthra lord is in the 12h 
sign to the dasa lord or Bhukthi lord respectively has no direct 
beanng on the horary chart and the fructification of the said 
matter. If such Bhukthi lord or anthra lord ts fruitful by the 
mstellar manner of reckoning and if it be reasonably strong as 
a ruling planet, then there is not reason why we should reject 
the Bhukthi or anthra of such planet as of no consequences. 


similarly the Bhukthi or anthra of any planet occupying a 
sign which is 6h or 8" to the sign containing the dasa or 
Bhukthi lord respectively should not be left out of consideration, 
merely on the basis that the placernent in Gh or 8h consititutes 
a detriment. Such a planet no doubt will be ineffective if it also, 
be placed in the star/ usb of planets detrimental to the matter 
in question, but not when they are favouably placed by star / 
sub etc. | would in this connection, rely on a few articles which 
appeared in the earlier issues of this esteemed magazine; 


1. Page 15 of November 78 issue. 


Job was secured dunng Kethu / Jupiter / Moon period. 
Kethu, is in 6 in the sign of Mars, lord of 2. It is in its own star 
and the sub of Mercury, lord of 11 in 11 (realization of desire). 
Jupiter, the Bhukthi lord, is in the star of Sun lord of 10 in 10 
and in the sub of Kethu. Moon, the anthra lord, is in 6 inthe 
star of Kethu and the sub of Jupiter. All the 3 planets are 
therefore fruitful significators and are also rulingplanets. It will 
be seen that the Moon (the anthra lord) is in the 12h sign 
from Jupiter (the bhukti lord), but this did not prevent the 
Moon from giving the person a job in tts anthra in Jupiter 
Bhukthi. 


2. page 10 of March * 79 issue 

Birth of child occurred during Sun /Saturn /Saturn. Whether 
these planets are fruitful significators and promising ruling 
plaents, can be worked out by the enthusiastic readers. How 
did Satum casue child birth in its Bhukthi and anthra if it had 
not been a strong and fruitful planet for such an event! Here 


Satum anthra Lord is in the 12n sign to Sun (the dasa lord). 
Does this instance not reveal the absurdity of the assertion 
that planet in the 12" to the dasa lord acts detrimentally to 
the affairs influenced by the latter’? 


3. Page 43 of Annual Number, 1979 

Transfer was effected during Sun/Satum Jupiter period. 
Satum (the Bhukthi lord) is in the 12h sign to Sun (the dasa 
lord) and Jupiter (the anthra lord) is in 12h sign to Satum (the 
Bhukthi) lord. But their conjoined period did give transfer to 
the consultant. 


4. Page 161 of KP. Reader VI 

The querent bought a refrigerator during Venus /Saturn 
period and Saturn is in 12™ to Venus, but this did not deny the 
purchase. 


Similarly instances can be multiplied to show that anthra 
and Bhukthi lords placed in the 6th and 8th from Bhukthi and 
dasa lords respectively have caused desirable results in their 
conjoint period. 


After working out the singificators and ruling planets it would 
do good to bear in mind the following hints : 


1. Planets that are retrograde will cause delay so long as 
they are retrograde and will give the desired results once 
they assume direct motion. 


2. A Rukng planet in the sub of a planet that is detrimental to 
the matter under judgemnt should be rejected. 


3. A ruling planet posited in the nakshatra of a planet which is 
retrograde, should not be rejected. It should be assessed 
whether such a planet is favourable by its star / sub / 
position to the matter under consideration. 


4. The Bhukthi of a planet which is in the 12 (sign) to the 
dasa lord, or the anthra of a planet in the 12m sign from 
the bhukthi lord (or dasa lord) should not be mistakently 
rejected. Likewise, a planet's placement in Gh or &h 


KAISHNAMURTE PADHDHAT! 151 


counted from the one occupied by the bhukthi / dasa 
lord should not be constructed as unfruittul, especially tf 
the former was favourable to the matter by its star /sub 
placement. 


5. Lord of 11, or the sublord or 11 in the Horary Lagna, 
denotes success. 


6. Sublord of 11 in a movable sign, or in the star of a planet 
posited in a movable sign, denotes early fructification. 


7. Saturn owning or aspecting 11 or any of the relevant 
house cusp (depending uon the matter under judgement) 
portends delay. 


The above are the results of my humble experience as an 
eamest follower of Krishnmurti Padhdhaii.

Analysis : The lagna indicates the querent. The lagna sub 
lord indicates the mind of the querent. In this horary chart the 
lagna sublord of 7th (marriage). Saturn is also in the star of 
Moon in the 3 house (Negotiations). So the lagna sublord is 
clearly indicate that the querent has put the question when 
she was having the urge about marriage. 


For marriage we have to judge house 2 (Kutumbasthanam 
and adding one more to the family) 7th. (Mamiage, life partner) 
and 11" (fulfillment of desire and happy manied life). Whether 


KAISHNAMUATL PADHDHAI 155 


the querent is destined to marry or not is indicated by the 7th 
cusp. Ifthe sublord of the 7" cusp is a significator of houses 2 
or 7 or 11,the marriage is promised according to Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati. 


Here the sublord is Saturn. Saturn is also lord of 7th. Saturn 
is in the star of Moon in 3 (Negotiation) Saturn is also posited 
in Kanya rasi, i.e. the 2nq house and having connections to 2“ 
cusp by 5° orb. Hence, the sublord of the 7th is a strong 
significators of 7in house and the marriage is promised to the

Marriage when? The marrage will be celebrated during the 
conjoined periods of the significators of houses, 2, 7 and 11; 
and their dasa periods in operating with the agreement of 
transit of luminaries over sensitive points, for marriage on the 
horary chart. 


Significators from 2™ : No planet in this bhava. No planet in 
the stars of Mercury lord of 2. 


Significators from 7m : Mars is in the cusp of 7m. Venus in 
Mars star. Rahu in Saturn star lord of 7m. Jupiter also signify 
their house as he is conjoined in the Saturn in the same degree. 


Significators from 11 : Rahu is posited in the bhava. No 
planets in Rahu's stars. No planets in Mercury's star lord of 
11" house. 


Kethu represents Saturn. Therfore the significators of 2, 7 
and 11 are Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, venus, Saturn, Rahu and 
Kethu. 


To eliminate the unfruitful significators, out of these planets, 
the theory of ruling planets is applied. 


Hence the common significators of 2, 7 and 11 and the 
fruitful significators for marriage are Jupiter, Venus, Kethu and 
Rahu. 


At the time of Judgement, the Mahadasa of Jupiter was in 
operation. Hence the period is very favourable for marriage. 


156 RULING PLANT 


Venus bhukthi runs upto 12-5-1981. Venus, a strong significator, 
and ruling planet and general significator (Karaka planet) for 
marriage and hence. | selected the Venus bhukthi and decided 
that the marriage must take place during the bhukthi itself. In 
ruling planets Kethu and Rahu (nodes) has come as strong 
significators. So | selected Kethu anthra. Kethu anthra runs 
for 16-3-1981 to 12-5-1981. So | pitches upon the Rahu 
sookshama another node in the anthra of Kethu. Rahu 
sookshma operates from 18-4-81 to 26-4-81. So | decided 
that the marriage should be taken place between 18-4-91 to 
26-4-81. 


18-4-81 Saturday - Moon will transit in her own star in 
lagna bhava not fruitful. 


19-4-81 Sunday - Sun is not a ruling planet and hence no 
good 


20-4-81 Monday- Moon is also not ruling planets and hence 
no good. 


21-4-81 Tuesday - Mars is also not ruling planet and hence 
no good 


22-4-81 Wednesday -Moon will be transitting in the star of 
saturn, a significator of lagna and hence not fruitful 


23-4-81 Thursday - Moon will be transiting in the star of 
Mercury a significator of 615 and transits of Moon in the 
sign of Mars is also no good as Mars is nota ruling planet 
at the time of judgement 


So, | predicted that the marriage will be celebrated in 24-4- 
81 Friday ruled by Venus. Moon transiting in Dhanur rasi ruled 
by Jupiter in the star of Moolam ruled by Kethu. 


On 20-4-81 | got a letter fromm the querent along with her 
wedding invitation. She praised me a lot for my accurate 
predictions. The marriage was actually celebrated on 24-4- 
1981 itself at the ruling planets at the time of marmage are 
also as those on the day of query.

The querent also praised the accuraseness of this system. 
she has written to me, to clarify whether this is a magic or are 
you a magician? | replied that this is not magic or | am not a

This scientific analysis and the predictions done with the

OVERSEAS TRAVEL 


An admirer of Krishnamurti Padhdhati, who was an Asst. 
Executive Engineer in the Neyveli Lignite Corporation wrote to 
me saying that he was desirous of seeking a job in one of the 
Arabian Gulf countries and wanted to know his prospects 
astrologically. According to his birth chart Venus Dasa, Hahu 
Bhukti, Satum Antara would commence on 22-12-76. As the 
sublord of the 12th cusp promised foreigh travel and as tynese 
planets were signicicators according to KP. | suggested that 
he would succeed in the matter early in this period. The 
gentleman had an offer a littel earlier than this period but had 
io give it up, atthe notice given was too short. He wrote to 
me in January 1977 that he had resigned his job at Neyveli on 
20-12-76 and joined a firm in West Bengal on 25-12-76. The 
beginning of Saturn Antara gave the native a change of job 
involving a long distance journety but he could not cross the 
borders of our Motherland. Life in the new place ws Hell for 
him and hw saw no hopes of escape. He wanted to know 
astrologically whether he would at all have redemption from 
this Hell and be able to find a suitable job in some fireign 
country. The number mentioned by him forthe horary analysis 
ofthe problem was 165. Even inveterate critics of Krishnamurti 
Pahdhdati are forced to admit KP. Horary Astorlogy (Reader 
VI) as a horary methiod par excellence giving very accurate 
results. 


Tne matter was taken up for analysis on Sunday. 13-2-77 
at Madras (1304'N; 80017°E) at 10.00 A.m._ ist. 
Prof.Krishnamurit likens the time of query to the time of 
conception (Adnana lagna) and the different stages of passage 
of the query to the Astrologer to the various stages -of 


160 RULING PLANT 


pregnancy. According to him the time at which the Astrologer 
commences judgement corresponds to the time of birth of 
the child (viz. the time at which the child is completely form 
the mother and starts independent life on earch, This is marked 
by the entry of the fifth element air into the lungs, which 
coincides with the first cry ofthe child. The lagna raising at this 
time is the Bhupatana lagna} . Even as one would base 
predictions on the life fof the child only on Bhupatana lagna, 
horary problem should be judged only from the planetary 
positions at the time of commencement of judgement when 
only the problem is actually delivered and the correct truths 
concerning the problem would dawn on the mind of the 
Astrologer. The houses and ruling planets should be worked 
out for the place of judgement and the time of commencement 
of judgement respectively. 


The Ayaamsa for 13-2-1977 the date of judgement would 
be 23032'32" according to the Universal Tables of Houses. 
No. 165 corresponds to 2606'40" in the sign Scorpio, i.e. 
2306'40". From the initilal point of Nirayana Aries. Adding the 
Ayanama, the sayana cusp of the lagna at Madras (1304'N 
lat} on that day would be 259039'l2", In Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati, the subs of cusps are of supreme importance as 
unfailing indicators of the matters represented by the relevant 
cusp. In cases of doubtful birth-time rectification, which ts at 
times risky. In the horary methods, however, the subs of the 
cusps of the lagna and remaining houses are automatically 
fixex by the number and the accuracy of the subs does not 
depend on the time factor. It being so, one can aim at high 
accuracy mn the horary method. Raphael's Tables of houses 
give the nonangular cusps correct to the degree only. The 
use of Raphael's Tables, therefore, implies the possibility of 
error in the subs of non angular cusps. To obviate this possibility! 
it is advisable to use the Universal Tables of houses for preparing 
horary charts. The UTOH, in addition to giving the non angular 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI 16] 


cusps correct to the minute provides a ready reckoner for 
cuspal movement, making inter polation an easy task. As per 
the UTOH, the Savana cusp of ihe lagna of rLat 130N and 
140N for sidereal time 11 hrs 36 mts are 259018' and 258054' 
respectively. By interpolation, the Sayna cusp of the lagna at 
Madras (1304N} for sidereal time 11hrs36 mts is 259016' 
24". The rate of motion of the sucp at the stage of 11has36 
mts (sidereal time) for 130N Lat (nearer to Madras) is 55° per 
4 secs. The sidereal time interval for the cusp to move to 
259039'12" (the value corresponding to No.165)is 1 minute 
30 sec (correct to the second). THat is to say, the Sayana 
point of space corresponding to the number 165 would be /at 
the horizon at Madras (Lat 1304'N) at 11 hars 37mts 39 sec 
of sidereal time. The remaining 11 Sayana cusps have to be 
worked out accurailey for this sidereal time and converted to 
the Nirayana cups by deducting the Ayanamsa of 23032'32",

The houses that govern foreign travel are 3,9 and 12. The 
Ath house represents permanont residence and the third which 
is at 12 to it denotes journey away from permarent residence. 
The 9th house indicates long distance journey strangers and 
foreigners and contanct with them.The 12th house dencts life 
in aforeigh place (entirely new environmnents) and separation 
from family. Let us see whether the Moon, the representative 
of the mind reflects the mind of the querist correctly. Moon 
owns 9 and also the sub on the cusp of 12 and is in the 
constellation of Mercury, who owns the constellation on the 
cusp of 9 and is aspecting 9. Mercury is in rapt conjunction 
with Mars, the owner of 12 and the constellation lord of the 
3rd cusp. The chart thus reflects the proport on the querey 
(viz foreign travel} correctly. Moon in the constellation of 
Mecury, the lord of 10 and the sublord of the cusp of 2 in 2 
indictes the purpose of the journey (viz. job and acquistion of 
wealth as well. 


KP. teachers that for one to go abrod, the sbu lord of the 
cusp of 12 should be a significator of 3,9 or 12. Ifthe sublord 
of the cusp of 12 is a significator of 9, and conversely , the 
sublord of the cusp of 9 is a significator of 12, that is to say, if 
the cusps of 9 and 12 are inter connected through their subs, 
one cannot but go abroad. In the chart the sublord of the 
cusp of 12 is the Moon, who has already been discussed. The 
sublord of the cusp of 9 is Jupiter, who owns the constellation 
on the cusp of 12, without any planet in his constellations. 
The querist is thus sure to go abroad. 


The period operative at the time of judgement is Mercury 
Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti, Venus Antara (upto 13-3-77}. Mercury 
owns the constelltion on the cusp of 9 and is in the constellation 


KRISHNAMURT) PADHDHATI 163 


of Sun in 3 and the sub of Venus, the lord of 7. The 7th house 
opposes the lagna, which represents native surroundings. As 
such,the 7th house denctes journey away from native 
surroundings. Mercury's ublord Venus owning 7 is, therefore, 
auspicious. Venus is alos in excellaent trediciie aspect with the 
Moon, the lord of 9 and the sublord of the 12th cusp.Let us 
here clarifythe concept of significator in Krishnamurt padhdhat. 
A significator of a house say 9, is net necessarily a planet in 
the consiellation fo the occupant or onwer of 9. A planet in 9 
or the owner of 9 is itself a siqnificator of 9, thugh a planet in 
the constelation of the occupant of 9 is regarded as the 
strongest singificator of 9, the planet in 9 the next in strength, 
theplanet in the constellation of the onwer of 9 the next, and 
owner of 9 the last in strength. Even a planet in association 
with or aspected by or forming a significator. For a sigqnificator 
to be furitful it is essential that it should occupy the constellation 
ofa planet which does not deny the result and sub, the lord of 
which is a significator of the relevant house(s}. It is however, 
not necessary athat the sublord is a significator by contellational 
position. Itis sufficient that the sublord is a significator otherwise, 
that is by ownership or occupation. Ownership of the 
constellation on sub on the relevenat cusp(s} and aspect or 
conjunction are also auspicious. This aspect has been clarified 
through the coloumns of this esteemed magazine frequently 
by the learned editor and other learned writers. In as much as 
significators occupying such subs are found to give results in 
actual practice their pronouncement shuld be regarded as a 
valid ruling Mercury in the sub of Venus in the context is 
therefore, a fruitful significator, though Venus the sublord is 
not a fruitful significator as we shall see shortly. Mercury Is 
also in close conjunction with Mars,the lord of 12and the 
constellation lord ofthe 3rd cusp. Jupiter owns the constellation 
on the cusp of 12 and the subs on the cusps of 9 and 3. 
Jupiter is in the constellation of Sun in 3 and the sub of Mars, 


164 AULING PLANT 


the 12th lord conjunct Mercury the Dasanatha. Mercury Dasa 
Jupiter Bhukti is, therefore, auspicious, Venus, the Antaranatha, 
though a significator as discusses above is in the canstellation 
of retrograde Satum in 8 Here again some clarification is 
necessary. A significator occupying the constellation or sub of 
a retrograde planet does not necessanly deny results in Horary 
Astorlogy. Such a significator is found to offer results in actual 
practice under certain circumstances. If a planet is a fairly 
strong significator of a matter by occupation or ownership by 
virtue of its constellation being untenantd, it gives results even 
if its constellation lord or sub lord ts retrograe, provided the 
constellation lord does not representdenying houses and the 
sublord is connected with the houses(s) in question. This will 
be particularly true when the planet with whose period we are 
concemed onws the constellation or sub on the relevant cusp(s). 
This observation applies to transit as well as we are going to 
see eventually. Further research should confirm this. In the 
present case, apart from the retrogression of Venus 
constellation lord Saturn, Venus herself is not a strong significator 
of the matter and Is not represented on the constellation or 
sub of any of the relevant cusps. Her constellation lord Saturn 
is in 8 {the house that denies Sth house matters.) Venus 
would not, therefore, offer the result. Instead, Venus in 4 in 
her sub sub period should tie the querist down to the native 
soil and give htm enough mental agony as a significator of 8. 
In act it happened so, as later correspondence showed. The 
next Antara, which is that of the Sun runs from 13-3-77 to 24- 
4-77, Sun is in 3 in the constellation of Mars, the 12th lord and 
the sub of Mercury, the Dasanatha both of whom have already 
been discussed. 


As regards the ruling planets at the time of judgement, 
oun the Antaranatha is the day lord. Jupiter, the Bhuktinatha, 
apart fram being the sublord of the Moon at the time of 


KAISHNAMUAT! PADHDHAT! 165 


judgement, is in the constellation of Sun, the day lord and is in 
association with Ketu, the constellationo lord of the lagna rising 
at the time of judgement (Aries) Jupiter is also aspected my 
Mars. Mercury, the Dasanatha is the constellation lord of the 
Moon at the time of judgement. All the three are thus ruling 
planets. One may, therefore, say thatthe matter would frutify 
In Mercury Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti, Sun Antara ( between 13-3- 
7? and 24-4-77}. 


Now let us trun to the cuspal period for confirmation. The 
great importance of the cuspal period especially in Horary 
Astorlogy has been discussed in detail by the learned Prot. 
KP. Singh in the series of articles under the title "Deeper 
implications of the sublord theory" published in the earlier issues 
of this esteemed magazine. The cusp with which wer are 
concerned inthe 9th which indicates the journey which would 
land the querist in foreign soil amidst strangera sna foreigners. 
The 9th cusp in the chart is at 270197" in the sign Cancer,in 
Mercury's constellation, Jupiter sub and Sun's sub sub. The 
Sun's sub sub extends upto 27022'14" which means that the 
cusp has yet to traverse 37" to cover Sun's sub sub. The are 
37" corresponds to 24 days in Mercury's period. That is to 
say, according to the period indicated by the constellation on 
the 9th cusp Mercury Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti Sun's Antara would 
last till 7-3-77 and Moon's Antara would run from 7-3-77 to 15- 
5-77. Moon owning 9 and occupying the constellation of 
Mercury, the constellation lord ofthe 9th cusp is more directly 
related to the 9th cusp with which we are concerned than the 
oun. Moon also owns the sub on the i2th cusp. We may, 
therefore, say that, the point of view of the cuspal period the 
matter would fructify during Mercury Dasa, Jupiter Bhukti, 
Moon's Antara. 


Sun, the lumunary and a significator would be transiting 
Jupiter's sign, (Pisces) Mercury's constellation from 31-3-77 


166 RULING PLANT 


to 12-4-77. It Wwa concluded that the matter would fructify 
when the Sun reaches his own sub on that of the Moon and 
the Moon and other signiticators would be in favourable transit. 
|, therefore, wrote to the gentleman that he would by God's 
Grace, be surely out of his present Hell in the 1st week of April 
1977. He wrote to me on the 8th of April 77 intimatint that he 
was safely perched at Abu Dhabi on 5-4-7? and thanking me 
for the hpes held out to him on the basis of Horary Astrology. 
He left our Motherland on Tuesday, 5-4-1977 by the Bombay 
Abu Dhabi flight scheduled for 20 hrs 30 mts. The flight was 
actually delayed by 10 minutes. The transit position at the 
time of departure is as follows. The day is ruled by Mars, the 
lord of the cusp of 3. Mars is inclose conjuction with Mercury, 
the Dasantha and is in the constellation of Sun in 3. Sun, the 
luminaray and the Antaranatha was transiting the sign of 
Jupiter, the Bhuktinatha (Pisces), the constellation of Mercury, 
the Dasanatha, and his own sub. Moon the luminary and 
significator was transiting the sign Libra in opposition aspect 
with Jupiter, the Bhuktinatha in the chart, int he constellation 
of Mars, the lord of 12, who has been dicussed above. Mercury 
, the Dasanatha was transiting Aris in the constellation of Ketu 
and the sun ofr Saturn, the lord of 3. Mercury was transiting 
in association with Jupiter, the Bhuktinatha was transiting the 
sign Taurus in the constellation of Sun, the Antaranatha and 
the sub of Mercury, the Dasanatha. The lagna cusps rising at 
Bombay (18055'N; 72054'E} at the time of flight was in the 
sign Libra, the constellatin of Rahu and the sub of Sun in 3. 
Transit of the Moon and Mercury affords the important 
confirmation that transit inthe subs of retrograde planets does 
not deny results. Saturn, the sublord was retrograde both at 
the time of judgement and at the time of fructification of the 
event. 


It may be mentioned that in the Horary Chart and the 
Sagittarius Ascdt. Nativity of the gentleman the Sun and the 


KAISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI 167 


Moon (who are also significators) were transiting the 4th Bhava 
and the 11th Bhava respectively. The 4th house represents 
slay in permanent residence. One may say that the 17th 
house denotes fulfilment of desire. Butthe 11th house stands 
for return (Agamana), reunion with family and so on. How 
could transit in these houses bring about journey away from 
permanent residence and separation from family? A ward on 
transit may not be out of place here. In traditional Astrology, 
transit with its system of Vedha is reckoned in terms of the 
signs counted from Janmarasi (Moon sign at birth). 
Prof.Krishnamurti has, in KP. Reader V on “Tranist” (an 
invaluable guide in fixing the time of fructifucation of events), 
established with facts and figures that the traditional system 
of transit is not a dependable one. Honour and fulfilment of 
desire come to one on the so-called inauspicious chandrasnhtama 
day (Moon transiting the 8th sign from the Janmarasi). Might 
gains accure to one during the much treaded “sade sali" period 
and so on. Only the constellation in these cases. The sign 
tranisted, of course, has significance as the zone owned by a 
significator of the matter but not as the “nth sign counted 
form the janmarasi. On page 136 of KP. Reader V (Sep. 1973 
edition) Prof. Krishnamurti gives the horoscope of gentleman 
with Sun and Satum inthe 12th Bhavba and mars in the 8th 
Bhava (even if Bhavas are reckoned in the Sripatipattern of 
traditional Astorlogy). But the gentleman had gain, fortune 
and success in the sub penods of these planets for the simple 
reason that these planets were in favourable constellations 
and subs. Qur Guruji says that such things opened his eyes 
and set him thinking as to what the real basis of prediction 
should be. His intense urge had the response from Goad and 
the astrological world has been blessed with a scientific and 
accurate system of prediction viz. Krishnamurti Padhdhat. Mars 
in 6 can give mamage if he is in the constellationand sub of 
planets signifying the houses goveming marriage. This principle 


16 RULING PLANT 


applies to tranist as well. A planet tranisting 12 can give gains 
and one transiting 4 foreign travel provided the constellation 
and sub tranisted are favourable to the matter in question. 
That is to say the "primary consiseration” in reading the results 
of planetary periods or fixing the time offructification of events 
by transit should be the constellation and sub and not even 
the Bhava (Mundane House} That ts the very basis of Stellar 
Astrology as propounded by our late revered of the basic 
principles of Krishnamurti Padhdhati has already been 
established beyond doubt. 


Good Luck. 


PLEASE TELL ME THE 
WHEREABOUTS OF MY 
FATHER'S CASH 


In the small hours of 7-10-81, my friend, from 
Purasaivakkam, entered mys room with a very disturbed state 
of mind and posed the above query. 


At the first instance, | could not catch the real gravity of 
the query and so | asked him to explain me under what 
circumstances and back ground, he was forced to put such a 
query. 

He presented the maiter as follows : 


It seems his father had a bank balance to the tune of 
60,000. Around 20th September his father asked him to look 
for a house for purchase with the above amount. 


On 5-10-81, he received a phone call that his father had 
passed away. After performing the last rites to his father, he 
asked his mother regading the above amount. She expressed 
complete innocence of such an amount. Hence, with no other 
source, he approached the Bank and found, to his surprise, 
that the amount was withdrawn by his father himself, duly 
closing the Bank account, just a day before his demise. 


Telling this, he uttered the No. 248 between 1 and 249

KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 171 
Query is rather indicated and how to proceed? 


At this juncture, let me reiterate the following information 
to the readers and the students of Krishnamurti Padhdhati 


When a person had queried regarding his financial matter, 
the 2nd cusp and house tells about his financial matter (i.e. 
money of the querent). 


4h cusp and house tells about the money matters of the 
younger brother or sister. 


Similarly, the Sth cusp and house, tells about the money 
matters of hismother. 


6th cusp and house tells the money matters of his children. 


7* cusp and house tells about the money matters of his 
servant, maternal uncle etc. 


8" cusp nad house tells about the money matters of his 
wife or his business partner. 


And likewise, the 10m cusp and house tells about the money 
matters of his father; and so on. 


With this background, | proceeded with this case. 


As the query Is pertaining to the money matter of his 
father, the 9th cusp is taken as Lagna of his father, and so, 
the 10h cusp is to be taken as the house of money of the 
father (i.e. the 2" cusp (house) for his father) and thus find 
out his financial dealings and matters connected to finance. 


So the 2nd cusp from Sth (i.e. 10h cusp) sub lord is looked 
into. It is Jupiter. The position and significators of Jupiter will 
clearly portray the status and position of his father's money 
dealings, under reference. 


Here Jupiter is on the 7ih cusp from the querent's laqna. So 
it can be initially visualized that money has gone out of his 
hands finally; since Jupiter on the 7" cusp, posited without 
any planet in its stars and thus getting full signification of 7th. 


12 RULING PLANT 


And further the same Jupiter (as the sublord of the ad 
cusp (from 1) is situated in the star of Mars, depositor of Sth 
from the querents lagna. Sh is the Dhanabhavam of the 4th, 
which stands for Mother of the querent. So | declared, that 
the money in question, is in the custody of his mother only. 


Yesterday (28-10-81), he (my friend) again came to me 
and informed that he could get authentic information, in the 
meantime, that the said amount had been handed over by

With deep respects to our revered Guruyji sri KS.

the predictive technique, with the result the stuatus of Astrology 
is being regained. 


IS LOST PROPERTY 
RECOVERABLE? 


We know that horary astrology is the best method to pin 
point the time and date of any event. There are a large 
number of methods used by Eastern and Westem astrologers 
for horary astrological analysis. Horary section developed by 
Prof. Late Krishnamurti, popularly known as KP. is the best 
and accurate modified scientific method to give the exact and 
only correct answer fo any question.

| narrate an incident that happened in my house on 23-9- 
86 for the benefit of readers. My husband lost his cycle locked 
and kept inside the compound, between 1, 15. and 1.45 p.m.on 
23-9-86. We noticed that the cycle was found missing at about 


174 RULING FLANT 


1.45 p.m. My husband was depressed so much for the loss 
of his cycle. The efforts could not bear fruit even after making 
thorough search all round the area. 


When a theft is committed, tt is natural that the affected 
person consults an astrologer. Similarly | too got the urge to 
know and verify astrologically how KP. reveals the truth of 
lost article and whether the article is recoverable. 


As usual a number for this purpose was obtained from my 
husband and taken for judgement at 4.00 p.m. on the same 
day at Madras. An analysis done strictly according to the 
principles of KP. is furnished below.

Dasa at the time of Judgement : Sun Dasa (Ketu Bhukti

The lagna indicates the querist, whose property has been 
stolen and whichever matter the sub-lord of the ascendant 
signifies is what hé would like to know. One who deprives you 
of your movables is a thief. Seventh house indicates the theif 
or the criminal at large. 


The matter lost is shown by the lord of 2%cusp. Recovery 
is indicated by the 11th cusp and the time of recovery by the 
significators of 2, 6, 11th houses. 


The 8m house shows the possession of the thief / criminal. 


The 4m house his profession and the 5* his gains owing to 
the crime committed. 


Find out the significators of 11t) house for the time of 
recovery of the lost property. 


Property lost will be judged from the houses 2, 6, 11 from 
the house indicating the criminal. 


lf the significators of houses, 2,6, 11 counted from the 
house indicating the person, whose property is lost with the 
ruling planets of the moment of judgement, the property lost 
will be recovered. If the same ruling planets are connected 
with 5, 8 and 12th houses, it ts lost once for all. 


similarly, if the Dasa lord is not connected with 2,6, 11 
houses, in that dasa the property cannot be recovered, as tt 
would be significators of 5, 8 or 12in houses, which are 2, 6, 
11 in terms of houses representing the criminal. 


The sub-lord of 7" shows the age of the criminal and its 
connection to other house indicates the relation of the criminal. 


The above are some ofthe important rules regarding theft 
/ crime and the criminal. 


Now come to examine the above chart. The ascendant 
falls in Virgo (Kanya) 23°20" Mercury house - Mars star - 
Mars sub Mars sub sub. The sub/sub Lord Mars owns 3, &' 
houses in 4m star. Sun owns 12 and deposited 12m in its own 
star. The sub-lord Mars aspects 7m houses. So Mars Is the 
significator of 3, 4, 7, 8 and 12t houses. The Seventh house 
indicates the thief. The 8m house indicates possession of 
movable property by the thief. The 4m indicates his possession 
etc. 


The description of the thief is known from the sub-lord of 
7m cusp and the sub-lord shows whether the thief is young or 
old. Here in the chart, the sub-lord is Mars shows him to be 
aged and of full stature and sub-lord Mars in the star of Sun 
lord of 12m, who is a strong signiticator of 12th. Here the 
significator of 12m, indicates a stranger, begger, very poor in 
circumstances, one in miserable plight, who is a professional 
thief. 


Whether the article lost will be recovered or not depends on 
the sub-lord of the 11t cusp. The 11tn cusp falls at 22°03’22" 
in Cancer; ruled by Moon-Mercury-Sun-Mercury as sign star. 
Sub-Sub-Sub respectively. The sub sub lord Mercury owns 
10m in 12" in the star of Moon owns 11th in 8m. The sub sub 
sub has to cause the results of the Lord of the constellation 
according to the constellation Lords occupation. Moon is situated 
in 8" and the Sun is situated in the 12% house. Moon being 
owner of 11 and deposited in 8 and Sun owns 12m and 
deposited in 12 is powerful to give the results of 8m and 12m 
house. Therefore, the sub lord and.sub lord Mercury and Sun 
of 11th cusp does not promise recovery of the lost property. 


The ruling planets Mars, Sat, Sun, Venus were also connected 
with the houses 5, 8, 12 indicating that the property is lost 


KRISHNAMURATI PADHDHATI TF? 


once for all. Further ifthe dasa Lord is not connected with 2, 
6, 11 in that dasa the property cannot be recovered, as it 
would be significators of 5, 8 and 12m which are 2, 6, 11 in 
terms of houses representing the criminal. In the present 
case, the running Dasa Lord is sun strong significator of 12m. 
Net result is that the property lost is lost once for all. 


A police complaint was lodged with the influence of higher 
officers for tracing out the culprit and recovery of cycle. Even 
after three months, nothing is detected to recover the article 
or book the culprint. Further, friends of my husband influenced 
to such an extent to get an alternative cycle unclaimed by 
anybody from the police station, which also did not materialize. 
The police are still hunting to catch the thief as many cycles 
were lost in my area during that period. 


Finally | would say that KP. system is like a gold mine and 
it all depends upon how deep you go into such a mine and get 
the desired golden result. 


The KP. system is therefore one of the wonders of this 
20th century to the world of astrology

Lagna lord Mars is debilitaed in 4th house. Moon, the 4th 
lord is inthe Lithin the star of Jupiter. Jupiter is the lord of 9th 
and 12th houses. Jupiter is placed in 3rd bhava. Jupiter is also 
the star lord of 4th house. 


Jupiter is connected with houses 3,9 and 12. Jupiter is the 
sublord of houses IV I] as per Chart -B. As he is connected 
with houses 3,9 and i2, 1 predicted that there is a change in 
the place of residence. As Jupiter is in 3rd house | also predicted 


182 RULING PLANT 


that he may settle down nearer to Salemm instead of going 
to his native place which is about 180 miles from Salem. 


Rahu is the sub-lord of IV houses as per Chart-A. Rahu is in 
the sign of Mercury and inthe star of Moon. So Rahu replaces 
Mercury and Moon. 


As lord of 3 placed in 12th house, Mercury also indicates 
change. Moon is the lord of 4th placed in the sub of Jupiter 
who is the lord of 9 and 12 placed in 3rd. So Mercury and 
Moon also indicate change. Since Rahu replaces Mercury and 
Moon, as sub-lord of 4th house, Rahu gives change in the 
place of residence. It is also significant to note that Rahuis 
also the sub-lord of 9th house. Mars Is situated in IV house in 
the star of Saturn and sub of Jupiter in 3rd bhava. Saturn is in 
4th house. As our guruji told in his readers that if a planet 
signifies [Vth house and also its detrimental house, 3rd then 
during that period native will hava a chage of residence (place 
and also travel. There are no planets posited in Mars star. 
Hence | anticipate mars anthara must do him his change of 
place. 


In the first week of June 1978 he shifted his place of 
residence about 25 miles away from Salem. Jupiter dasa, 
Saturn Bhukti, Mars Anthra was operating at that time. 


Dasa lord Jupiter as lord of 9 and 12 placed in 3 (as per 
chart A) indicates change. Bhukti lord, Saturn is planed inV 
house. Saturn is in the star and sub of Kethu. Kethu is placed 
in 12th house. He is associated with Mercury, lord of 3rd 
house, and he is in the house of Jupiter, lord of 9 and 12 
houses. So Bhukthi lord, Saturn also indicated change. Anthra 
lord, Moon (lord of 4th house) is in the star of Jupiter about 
whom we have discussed above. So in the conjoint period of 
Jupiter Dasa, Saturn Bhukti Moon Anthra, there was a change 
in his residence. 


Thus KP. unfolds the secrets of nature in a mysterious 
way.

RESEARCH STUDY 


Imagination was running a riot while | was scanning the 
leaves of my diary to select an interesting case for the New 
Year issue of this esteemed Magazine. My wife arrived 
unexpectedly and requested me to find out astrologically 
whether we are blessed with foreign assignment. She quoted 
No, 1066. 


Momentarily | became speechless since there are certain 
delicacies involved in the matter under consideration. Firstly, 
my personal knowledge that for ta well-settled practitioner of 
15 years’ experience, foreign assignment is neither tempting 
nor advisible. Tempermentally too | dislike it. The second 
delicacy is that | have to present the finding to my own life- 
partner, who will readily smile away at my prdictions in furture 
and for life if the present one fails. However, the long hours 
spent by me in Astrological work do not escape her appreciation, 
though grudginly. 


Undeterred by these delicacies | started working out the 
problem by preferring Horary to Natal Chart since a minor 
mistake in birth -time could alter the entire prediction by changing 
the sublord of All cusp who exerts exclusive influence in the 
matter. | have attempted to corraborate by analysing the the 
chart.

1} from lagna as well as VII house (lagna of the husbank 
of the Querient). 


2) Working out the cuspal dasa system of XII cusp VI 
Cusp (XII from VII Cusp} 


Impressive enough, Moon which indicates the mind of the 
Querient is in conjunction with M.C and is in the star of Sun, 
lord of 9 in 10, indicating foreign travels with an assignment 
(Professional). In addition, Moon Is conjunct with, Rahu, sub- 
lord of Xli Cusp, in 9 in the star of Sun, lord of 9 in 10. Thus 
foreign assignment is promising from lagna. A review from VII 
house is equally promising. The sub-lord of VI cusp which is 
12 from 7, is Saturn who ts lord of 9 in 3 aspecting the IX and 
Xli bhavas. Summing up, the sub-lords, of XII Cusp and VI 
cusp,saturn and Rahu both are connected with Foreign 
assignment, individually or collectively, either from lagna or 
from VII house. Brushing aside my prersonal factors and 
based on academic analysis, | venture to say that this 
prediction will not fail. 


The next issue, a major and more difficult and that, it 
timing the event. Once again the significators are selected 
both from lagna and VII house. 


Significators f 3,9,12:- 


From both lagna and VII house significators are selected 
by the 4 step method advocated by Sri.K.S.Krishna Murthi. 


Jupiter, Saturn, Ketu, Rahu are the most powerful significtors. 
ou, the Dasanatha is a weak significatorr as lord of IX from 
Lagna and Ill from 7th house. However he is inthe sub of 
Jupiter who isthe most powerful" significator. A doubt has araisen 
whether Sun would promise the assignment during his period. 
A review of significators is attempted with the help of Ruling 
planets.

Once again, Sun Is the least powerful among ruling planets. 
However since Sun is a significator as well as a ruling planet, | 
decided that Sun is capable of blessing the Queenent with 
foreign travels. According to Vimshothari Dasa system Sun 
Dasa-Saturn Bukthi runs from 28-9-78 to 10-&-79 during which 
penod othe desire will fructify. Saturn become retrograde from 
25-12-78 to 10-5-79 which portends hurdles and post- 
ponements due to one reason or other. Rahu, a shadow planet 
who has become a powerful significator, whose inter period 
operates sorm 9-6-79 to 30-7-79 Is selected to cause 
fructification of the event.

an 


Cuspal Dasa System: is worked out on the same lines as 
Moon's progression in a particular star according to Vimshotthar 
Dasa system. The relevant Cuspal point displaces Moon and 
other calculations are identicla. The All Cusp is in Scomio at 
30 01° in the star of Jupiter. The balance of Jupiter dasa in 4 
months and 17 days,likewrse the VI Cusp i.e. 12 from 7 is in 
Taurus 3001' in the star of Sun, It has traversed 6021' in the 
star of Sun in 3 years 1 month 21 dyas. It is interesting to 
note that the VI Cuspal dasa and Vimshothan dasa systems 
are running almost identically. Sun and Satum operates, 
according to both systems in June, 1979. The relevant period 
according to XII Cuspal dasa system {in June 78) in Saturn 
Dasa, Satum anthra Satum inter-period. 


Transits:- Dasanatha, Sun will be transiting in the star Moon 
who is a powerful significator and is also ruling planet, in the 
XI bhava from lagna and anthara lord Satum, tranists in 9th 
bhava.

Rahu 27-5-79 15-6-79 
Jupiter 15-679 o-f-79 


Rahu is in the star of Sun. So Rahu is still stronger than 
oun. Thus Rahu is the strongest significator of the 27 house. 
So | concluded that the querent’s marriage should take place 
only in the Rahu shookshma period. The marriage taking place 
in the Dasa and Bhukti of Jupiter and Saturn anthra needs to 
explanation. 


The lord of the Dasa, Bhukt etc, are conneted with the 
houses 5, 8,12. Jupiter himself is lord of 5 and 8 and significator 
of 12 being in the star of Satum in 12. Satum is lord of 6 also 
which Is the 12n house for the life partner indicating bed comforts 
for her. Saturn is in the star of Venus, lord of 3 and Chief 
govemor of marriage. Saturn is aspecting Mars lord of 9. So 
Satum is an agent of houses 3 and 9 (Negotiation and approval 
of both sides). Satum Anthra is apt to bring about the event. 
Thus | predicted that the querent’s marriage should take place 
in Jupiter dasa and Bhukti, Saturn Anthra and Rahu shookshma 
between 27-59-1979 and 15-6-1979. 


Regarding the bride, whether the querent will many his 
niece or not canbe decided at once. The sub-lord of the cusp 
is Ketu. It represents Jupiter by sign and star. Jupiter ts lord of 
5 and has no relation with the 3" house. So it is clear that the 
querent has no chance to marry his niece. Uranus is in the 
Star and sub of Jupiter. Uranus is for suddenness. 


Seeing the bride, negotiation, fixation and celebration of 
mamiage all were over, all-of a sudden within a fortnight which 
generally take some months in our community. The mariage 
actually took place at 12-35 a.m. on Wednesday 13-6-79/ 
Thursday 14-6-79 with some other girl. At that time Sun was 
in Venus sign, Taurus, Mars star and Saturn sub. Moon was in 
saturn sign Capricorn, in her own star Sravanam and Rahu 
sub. Dasa and Bhukti Lord Jupiter was in the star of the 


KRISHNAMURT! PADHDHATI 187 


Anthra Lord Saturn and in the sub of Sookshma Lord Rahu. 
Anthra Lord Saturn was in the star and sub of Venus, the 
Chief planet for marriage and significator of 11th house. The 
sookshma lord Rahu was in the star of Venus and in its own 
sub. Venus was in its own sign Taurus in Sun star and in its 
own sub. Marriage was celebrated in Meena Lagnam ruled by 
Jupiter. Thus transit agrees in full. After marriage was over 
when | went to my native again he congratulated me for my 
accurate prediction

oun is in the star Moon, who ts the lagna lord, so Sun also 
becomes a significator. Day Lord, Saturn is in the star of Sun. 
Thus Sun becomes an important significator. Mars is conjoined 
with Sun and Venus, both significators, and Mars is in the star 
of Sun and sub of Jupiter who is the Moon sign lord. Thus also 
sun becomes a signiticator. So Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Moon, 
Venus, Sun and Mars become ruling planets. Kethu represents 
Saturn being all alone in Makara and Rahu represents Moon 
being the only planet placed in Kataka. 


The flight to a distant place, in absolutely new environment 
we have to consider the 3m house (twelfth or negation to the 
4"". Oth (long journey), 7th (change in general}, 12m (new 
environment) and the 11* (successful mission}.

Mars is conjoined with sun and is also in the starof Sun. So 
Mars also becomes a signiticator. 


Let us first check up ifthe 11sub lord, Mercury, promises 
fulfillment of desire. Mercury owns houses 3 and 12 and is 
placed in 11. It is in the star of Rahu in 12. Rahu represents 
Moon who is in 9. Rahu is in the star of Saturn, owner of the 
7h and in the sub of Moon in 9. Thus Mercury ts wonderfully 
connected with all the required houses, i.e. 3, 12, 11, 7and 1. 
20 successful flight is assured. Let us now finalise the 
significators. 


192 


Kethu : Kethu is in the star of Moon in 9 and sub of Mars in 
10. Mars is in the star of Sun who ts again in the star of Moon. 
Moon is thé ascendant lord and is the star of houses 3, 7 and 
17. Rahu, the representative of Moon, is the star lord of 12° 
cusp and sub lord of Ah and 3a cusps. Kethu's sub lord Mars 
has gone to the sub of Jupiter who owns the 9" house and is 
associated with Saturn, owner of the 7h house. Kethu as 
representative of Satum also signifies the 7" house. Thus Kethu 
strongly signifies houses 3, 7, 9, 11, 12 and also the ascendant. 


Sun : Sun is the star of Moon. Moon's importance has 
been discussed above. Its sub lord is Jupiter, owner of the 9m 
house, and is conjoined with Saturn, lord of the 7*. Thus, Sun 
becomes a very strong significator. 


Mercury : Owns houses 3 and 12 and Is posited in the 11* 
in the star and sub of Rahu is 12. Rahu not only represents 
Moon but is also in the star of Saturn, owner of 7 and sub of 
Moon in 9. The cuspal significance of Moon and Rahu have 
already been discussed earlier. Thus Mercury is also a very 
strong signficator of all ihe required houses. 


Noon : It is placed in 9 and Is in the star of Mercury, owner 
of 3 and 12, in 9, Moon is in the sub of Saturn, ford of 7. Its 
cuspal significance has already been discussed. Moon also is a 
strong significator. 


Jupiter : Owns 9, Itis in the star of Sun. It is associated 
with Saturn, owner of the 7m house. Its sub lord, Mercury, |s a 
very strong significator of all the required houses. Its star 
lord, Sun, also Is a very strong significator. Thus Jupiter too is 
a good significator of the required houses. 


Mars : Qwns 10 and 5 and Is placed in 9. It is in the star of 
Sun and sub of Jupiter. Both the star lord and sub lord of Mars 
are good significators. 


Rahu : Rahu represents Moon, is in the star of Saturn, lord 
of 7 and 8 and Is placed in 2. Saturn is retrograde also. It is in 
the sub of Moon in 9. Not very strong. 


KRISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI 193 


Saturn : Owner of 7 and 8. It is in the star of Sun in 10 
and sub of Venus in 11. Sun itself is very strong. It is also 
aspecting the 9m house and Moon and the 12* house and 
Mercury. It is quite strong to give results as it is conjoined with 
Jupiter who is the owner of 9m. 


Venus : Owns 11 and is placed in 11. It is in the star of 
Mars, ruler of 5 and 10 in 10, and sub of Saturn. Itis weak 
significator of 11 only. 


since the event is to fructify in a day, Moon has to be 
moved. Kethu's star is in aries ruled Dy Mars who 5s also 
significator. So the Moon can be in the Zodiacal segment 
governed by Mars - Ketu - Sun or Mercury and Jupiter. Mars, 
Kethu and Sun sub is from 3°0’00" to 3°40’0" Aries. At this 
position Moon will be on Saturday itself. So, Sun sub cannot 
give results. Mars - Kethu Mercury - Jupiter govern from 
2°46'55" to 13°202" of Aries sign. On Sunday at 5-30 a.m 
Moon's position is 10°45’ It will reach 12°46’55" around 8-44 
a.m. and shall leave 13°2'02" at9-08 a.m. So SLV 3 shoud be 
blasted between 8-44 a.m.and 9-08 a.m. To fix up the exact 
time the lagna has also to be moved, When it reaches the 
point of the zodiac governed by the significators of the required 
houses, that would be the exact moment of SLV-3's flight. 


At this moment, | had to leave the analysis due to certain 
extremely urgent problem requiring my immediate attention. 
On Monday 1-6-1981 it was quite known that the SLV3 was 
fired at 9-3-46 a.m. | was happy that it was fired within the 
span of time fixed by me but was sorry that | had not moved 
the lagna at the time of analysis to fix the exact time of blast. 
| therefore, fixed the position of lagna 1-6-1981. 


Lagna reaches 6°48'0" in Cancer governed by Moon, Saturn, 
Mercury, Jupiter exactly at 93 Hrs when the SLV 3 was fired. 
In fact, the amount of 46 seconds is negligible for such 
astrological calculations and must have been taken by the 
process of blast and flight. 


It will be observed that ruling planets had the final say in 
fixing the time of the blast. 


TIME OF RESTORATION 
OF ELETRICITY : RULING 
PLANETS REVEAL 


On 8-1-1981 at 6 p.m. | was engrossed in an important 
and urgent work when the electricity suddenly went off. | 
waited upto 6.25 p.m. for the restoration fo electricity but 
without any consequence. Because | was altending to an 
important matter | was rather perturbed and grew impatient, 
| immeeiately thought of finding out through Krishnamurti 
Padhdhat Horary method and with the aid of Ruling Planets 
whether the restoration of electricity was promised quickly and 
if so, when’? 


For the first part of the query | resorted to the Gulbarga 
Theory. As per ‘Gulbarga Theory’ ifthe sub lord of the Horary 
Number furnished happens to be either the Moon star lord or 
the lagna star-lord among the ruling planets also, then the 
query is to be answered in the affirmative; otherwise, not. 


On opening a book, from the right-hand side page, | obtained 
the No.245 (1-249). According to the Krishnamurti Padhdhat 
theory, this corresponds to the part co-ruled by Jupiter, Mercury 
and Moon as sign lord, star lord and sub lord respectively. The 
sub lord, the Moon, also happened to be the Moon star lord 
of the day and hence the requirement of the said theory ts 
fulfilled. Thus | concluded that the restoration of electricity 
was promised. 


The next part of the query is "when". For this | sought the 
aid of the Ruling planets. The ruling planets at the time of 
analysis were as follows : Day Lord - Jupiter (Thursday); 
Moon sign lord - Saturn (Captircorn); Moon star lord - Moon 


196 


(Sravanam); Lagna lord - Mercury (Gemini 27°50; Lagna 
Star lord - Jupiter. 


As | expected the restoration within a short time, | decided 
to move the lagna to fix the time. 


Jupiter is the lagna star lord and also appears twice and as 
such he ts a strong Ruling planet. Rahu is deposited in the star 
of Mercury another strong ruling planet and represents the 
latter and he is in Cancer sign and also aspected by Moon and 
thus representing moon also. Hence | decided that when the 
Langa would transit Jupiter's star (Punarvasu). Rahu sub (1°20 
to 3°20° Cancer) the electricity would be restored. At that 
time, Moon (another strong Ruling planet who is in its own star 
in Capricorn (Makara) and in conjunction with Kethu who is 
also in the Moon's star and being in Capricorn representing 
saturn also, would be aspecting Cancer (Kataka). Thus | fixed 
the time of restoration between 6.39 and 6.47 p.m. As fixed, 
the electricity was restored at 6.40 p.m. 


K. P. SYSTEM - WONDER 
OF RULING PLANETS 


Jothida Marthanda Sir. K.S. Krishnamurti, our revered Guruji, 
has been one in a million, who gave out his discoveries to the 
ardent public, without expecting any return. He encouraged 
students to do independent research, in all his lectures. | am 
one of the multitudes who got inspiration from him to do 
research in ruling plants and their applications. His ruling planets 
method has been found unfailingly ever to be of immeasurable 
value. Sir KS.K. was the only man who had contributed his 
time and energy to the development of Astrology in this century. 
One example of this unique, shor and simple, method is 
sufficient to provie how divinity guides an anxious mind thro 
the Great KP's Ruling planets. 


On 9-2-81, af about 11-30 a.m. my friends were discussing 
the disasterous performance of our Cricketers in Australia. All 
of us (needless to say all Indians} were anxious at the way 
our champions were losing their games and names this season. 
One of the friends wanted me to predict the out-come of the 
Test Match being played at Melbourne now. But, it was office 
time and | did not have the refernce books with me, per nor 
was there (me enough to work out the Sub Lord of stars for 
the question number, without books. So | prayed to Lord Shri 
Uchchista Maha Ganapathi and our Guruji, fora moment, and 
asked my friend to give me a number between 1 and 2/7, a 
very very short method which | have found effective in such 
exigencies. He instantly gave me the No, 13 Star for the No.13 
is ‘Hastha’ (th el3th star} and the ascendant was 10 degree 
of Kanya. On 9-2-81, Moon the above Ascendant star lord 
was in the star Revathi and this star lord Mercury was in 
Kumba, in 6m house from Kanya. Further Moon is lord of 1 1* 
to Kanya the Ascendant: As such, | boldly predicted that 


India will win, to everybody's disbelief, because at 11-30 
a.m. on that day, India’s position was pitiably low, against a 
massive 1st innings score of 419 by ihe Aussies. Miraculously, 
on 11-2-81 at 8.31 am., | was overjoyed to hear on the Radio 
that India has won the match. The ruling planets arnply 
confirmed ithe time of victory hs can be seen below. The RP.

‘TRUNK-CALL’ 


A) A Trunkcalf was booked by rne to Kancheepuram at 8- 
15 p.m. IST. here at Bangalore on 18-4-1978. Along with 
me to speak on the phone with her husbank was my elder 
sister. To know whether the call would matenalize or not, sooner 
or later, | resorted to the world known KP. Method. 


|. Forthe matenalisation of trunkcall houses 3,9 and 11 are 
examined. Consider the sub-lord of the 11th cusp and find out 
if the lord of the constellation in which the sub-lord is positioned 
is direct or retrograde. Ifthe lord of the star is retrograde, no 
purpose will be served by that call. If the lord of the constellation 
in which the sub lord of the 3rd cusp Is deposited is retrograde, 
then the call will not materialize. Next, if the lord of the 
constellation of the 9th cusp sublord is retrograde, the called 
party cannot be contacted. But if they are in direct motion, 
the call would materialize at the ruled conjointly by the 
significators of 3,9 and 11. 


Il. Before starting, | invite the attention of the readers to 
page 104 of Horary Astrology - KP. reader VI. where in it has 
Clearly been stated by Our Guruji that if the sublord of the 3rd 
cusp situated in the star of a retrograde planet, the telephone 
office will say that line in out of order. Ifthe 3rd cusp sub-lord 
is himself retrograde, {with its star lord direct) the call will 
materialize later. 


Ifthe starlord of the sublord of the 9th cusp is retrograde 
the called party will be absent. But if the sublord himself is 
retrograde, he will be asked to keep the call pending and later 
given connection. Ifihe sublord of th 11th cusp is in the star, 
the lord of which its retrograde then in spite of the connection 
being given, neigther party will be able to hear.each-other 
properly. But ifthe sublord is himself retrograde, the talk will 
be had after cornplaining to the Telephone Office.

KRISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI 201 


lV. For the realisation of a desire, the sub-lord of the 11th 
cusp should not be retrograde. And for the materialization of 
a trunkcall the sublord of the 11th cusp must not only be 
direct but also the starlord of this sublord must be direct; for, if 
the starlord were to be retrograde, no purpose will be served 
by the call. Secondly the 3rd cusp is seen after which the Sth 
cusp shouls be examined. Ifthe 3rd cusp promises the calle, 
then proceed to examin the 9th cusp for it the former does 
not promise the calle, there is no point in serultinzing the later. 
The 3rd cusp is said to promise the call, if the lord of the star 
in which the sublord is situated is direct. 


Analysis: 

| first took the 11th cusp and examined it. It is in Mercury 
sign (VIRGO), Sun star and Jupiter Sub. The sublord Jupiter is 
inthe star of Rahu- a node. And Nodes firstly represent the 
planet with which they are conjoined then the planet they are 
aspected by, then the lord of the sign in which they are, and 
they lord of the constellation in which they are positioned. 
Here Rahu vry strongly represents Mercury because it is in 
the house (Virgo) owned by Mercury and also aspected by it. 


So, Jupiter the sub-lord of the 17th Cusp is in the star of 
Rahu which strongly represents Mercury. Mercury is Retrograde. 
Hence no purpose will be served call. 


| begarvto scrutinize the 3rd Cusp which is in Jupiter sign 
(Satittarius), Sun Star, Mars Sub. As alreaddy stressed before, 
the 3rd cusp is the one of the prime importance for the 
fructification of the trunkcall. Here Mars the Sub lord of the 
3rd Cusp is positioned in the star of retrograde Saturn. Hence 
| expected the line to be out of order. 


Having analysed and failed all this, | turned to my sister 
and said that we will not be able to talk as the line is out of 
order and said her to cancel the call. She just ignored it and 
waited for the call. | just Kept mum, and too, waited. In 


202 RULING PLANT 


another couuple of minutes, the Telephone Department 
informed us that we cannot speak as the line is out of order. 
My sister smiled at me and cancelled the call. 


On coming out of the Telephone Department, she said, 
"Man, Youre great. You predicted so precisely". To this | just 
said , "No, I’ am not great. lis may Guruji who is great for 
having profounded this infaliable science of Astrology." | only 
followed the principles laid down by him. 


COLLEGE ADMISSION 
AND KP. 


It was a sunny day on the 24th July 1979. | had just then 
had my lunch with my friend in Indian from Zambia. He had 
comeback after holidays only the day before and wanted to 
Know from me when he would get registered for the courses 
and start attending classes. He was worried because he was 
already a week late. | told him not to worry because KP. can 
show the way. He also informed me that the clerk had asked 
him to core the next day and he gave a number 114 between 
1 and 249. It was taken up for judgement as soon as we 
reached our room.

The lord is Venus. Saturn and Rahu are in Venus's star. 


Eleventh house: Mercury and Jupiter are in the XI house, 
Cther than these two, Venus Is also in their Stars. The lord is 
Moon and no one is in her Star. The fourth house indicates 
educational activities and his success in getting admission Is 
denoted by the eleventh house. Hence the corresponding 
significators are selected. As the question is in regard with 
higher education. 9th is also selected.

then only whatever he desires will not be had". The sublord of 
Xl cusp here is Moon. He is lord of 11th and very close to xl 
cusp and is In the Star of Saturn who is in direct motion. 
Hence success is assured. 


According to the unfailing method founded bythe Gulbarga 
Astrological Research Centre, if the sublord of the number 
given happens to be either the starlord of the ascendant or 
the Moon, the answer is YES otherwise No. 


The ruling planets atthe moment were Rahu, Venus, Saturn, 
Moon and Mars. 


Hence the sublord of the number, Hahu is the star lord of 
ascendant. The answer is YES. He will definitely get admission. 


Moon reveals the mind. Moon is in Satum’s star who is a 
strong siqnificator of Sin house and ts in the sub of Venus a 
strong significator of IV, IX, XIth houses. Further he is a 
significator of Xl house also. So, Moon clerarly reveals the 
mind. 


JUDGEMENT 


Thesignificatorsare: Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Saturn, Rahu, 
Mercury, Moon. Jupiter is in the sub of Sun a non significator. 
so he is deleted. 


The common ones are Rahu, Venus, Mars, Moon and 
Saturn. 


As it was matter to be judged in a few days, | took the 
motion of Moon, a strong signification. The same could happen 
on a Monday, Tuesday, Friday or Saturday. But Saturday is a 
holiday and hence Saturday is deleted. Venus is very strong. 
So, | took Friday, the 27th July and on the day, Moon is in 
Venus Star. So | decided that he would get registered on 
Friday. Pooram star begins at 8-19 a.m. when Venus was in 
Venus sub, the ascendants possible are Leo, Virgo which are 
not ruled by strong significators. On further calculations | found 
out that at 11-55 a.m. Moon ts in Venus star Venus sub and 


206 


Saturn sub sub and the Lagna rising as the moment in Madras 
was 7°-59’ in Libra ruled by Venus-Rahu-Rahu as sign, Star 
and sub-lord respectively. | proceeded with calculations to find 
out if any other time is also possible. At 2-20 p.m the ascendant 
is co-ruled by Mars-Saturn-Venus as sign, Star and sublords 
and Moon is in Sun-Venus-Moon-Moon (sub-sub}. The time 
between 2-25 p.m and 2-40 pm was also feasible for this 
because it is jointly ruled Oy the significators. 


So, | told him, in view of the three possible times that 1} 
He will pay the fees at 11-55 a.m. and get himself admitted. 
2) At 2-20 p.m he will go to the office to meet the concerned 
person regarding registration and 3) Before 2-40 p.m he will 
get the registration card. | also told him that he will start 
attending classes from Monday onwards. 


As predicted, he paid the fees at 11-55 a.m. only even 
though he went to pay at 10.30 a.m. itself. He met the 
concerned person at 2-20 and got his registration card at 2-30 
p.m. 


We have to thank and pray Lord Uchistamaha Ganapathy 
to initiate our late Guruji, K.S.Krisnhnamurti for having pro- 
pounded a new theory in predictive astrology, with his new 
ideas of ruling planets and subs, This KP. method gives the 
astrologers more confidence in giving predictions. This is a 
first step towards removing the ignomy on astrology, mainly 
because of its turning out false predictions and will surely help 
astrology in regaining it lost glory and such effects are seen 
now-a-days, because of the increasing popularity of KP 


RETURN OF ABSCONDED

MIRACLE OF STELLAR 
ASTROLOGY 


Now-a-days, there is hot stream channel is flowing among 
the youths, if they pass through any critical phase of life or 
get dis-appointment relating to any quarter of the life such as 
failure in examinations, love affairs or otherwise, they used to 
abscond without notice to their beloved family members. 


Being practitioners of Astrology, we have observed several 
cases relating to the issue during previous months. At this 
critical moment, surviving family members used to search the 
camp of Astrologers. 


Here in the article we are reproducing few remarkable 
illustrations relating to such matter, in which we find the reliance 
and exactness of stellar astrology and its approach. We hope, 
that the readers of our beloved magazine, may find their 
selves benefitted. 


First, we are reproducing here a case relating to a young 
boy, who is student of Intermediate classes and his father is a 
head master in a reputed primary school. 


On 3-1-1979, he visited and expressed griefly that his IV 
issue (living 3ra child) is not traceable since last night. He has 
visited to purchase some books at neighbouring plance 
Aminabad, but he has not turned back to his place till the 
moment.

In the chart, first we have considered whether the missing 
young boy is alive or dead. First, we have considered the 
Ascendant. Sub Lord Sun (itself Hyleg-the Life Giver} and Star 
Lord for 3r¢ cusp and significator for 3 and 8 cusps (denotes 
life span and longevity} Sun is in the star of Venus who is also 
significator for 3 and 8" cusps. Badhak lord Mars (the IX 
cusp, for fixed sign) is also signifying 3 and 8 cusps. Hence, 
we came to conclusion that he is Alive. 


At the time of judgement the MP. of Rahu, $.P.Moon and 
LP. of Sun is commencing since 3-1-1979 to 30-1-1979. On 3- 
1-1979 at the time of Judgement Moon was transiting in the 
range of Ascendant and Sun is Ascendant sub lord and the 
star lord for 3rq Cusp. Sun is in the star of Venus, and Venus Is 
VII and Al star lord. So we at once uttered within few hours 
you will came to know his where abouts. If, you will come to 
know about any information on the day, he will join the family 
on 4-1-1979 because as soon as Moon will transit in the star 
of Jupiter, who is signifying the 2,5 and 11 houses. Fortunately, 
with the blessings of Lord Ganapathy and Our Guruji, within a 
hour, querent (the father of missing person) received a 


210 RULING PLANT 


telephonic call from Agra, that his son has reached there and 
joined his family on 4-1-1979 as predicted. 


Now, we are reproducing the natal chart of the same person, 
who was again absconded Il time from his house without 
notice on 19-4-1979. Again, his father visited us on 21-4-1979 
and provided us his correct birth particulars. We casted and 
erected natal chart, which is also reproducing here for the

At the time of event the MP. and SP. of Rahu LP. of 
Moon SSSP of Satum was commencing from 184-1979 to 1- 
90-1979. Saturn is signifying land 12th cusps and also Sub lord 
for 1 and 12cusps. Saturn is in the star and sub of Mars, who 
is also signifying 1 and 12th cusps. So, we came to a conclusion, 
due to relation of 1 and 12“ cusps, with the planets, he has 
been absconded. 


Now, again we paid our attention to check the longevity. 
We find that the significators for J cusp (denotes longevity) 
are related with 8th cusp, there is no question of early death 
arises. Atter it, we think over the SSSP of Ketu in MP. and 
SP of Rahu, LP. of Moon which was 11-5-19/9to 15-5-1979 
because Ketu is itself signifying 2,7 and 11 cusps and is star 
lord of 2nd Cusp. Ketu is signitying Jupiter by sign who is also 
significator for 2,5,8,10 and 11 cusps. 


As well as on 12-5-/9, the transit of Sun ts in its own star 
in the sub of the Moon, Moon is 2na cusp sublord and XI cusp 
star lord. At the time of birth Sun is in the sub of Ketu and 
Moon is in the sub of Jupiter who is signifying 2,5 and 11 
cusps. 


312 RULING PLANT 


Fortunately with the blessing of GOD, he turned back to 
his home on 12-5-1979 at late hours. 


Now, we are reproduang an illustration, about a young girl, 
she was absconded from her home without uttering a single 
word to her family members. This event was so enlarged, in 
Lucknow city, that the questions relating to this issue was also 
raised before legislative assembly of UP. 


The absconded girl is fifth younger to the querent. We 
asked him a number in between 1 to 249. He at once, uttered 
a number 33 at 7hr 45m on 2-6-1979 at Lucknow. We 
considered Xl house as Ascendant for her (Grd house for 1 st 
youngster, V for 2nd , Ill for III,1Xfor NM and so on...) the 
horary. Chart which was obtained by us, is producing here as 
under-Taking XIth house ofthe Number as lagna of the girl.

In the case, atthe time ofjudgement the MP. and SP. of 
Venus and LP. Rahu ahd shookshma period of Jupiter was 
operating upto 5-6-79. It is known that Jupiter and Venus are 
inimical to each other. Jupiter is signifying 1 and 12cusps and 
the sub lord for 2nd 8th. So, we determined in out mind that 
she will not be turned in the LP. of Jupiter ie. upto 23-6-1979. 
We observed that the 3rd sub lord Saturn is signifying 3 and 
11th cusp and Saturn is in the star of Venus who is also 
siqnificator for 3 and 8th cusps so we observed due to the 
reason there is no dangerto her span ofthe life. 


Now, we boldly predicted that she will come back in the 
shookshma of Saturn Le. in between 5-6-1979 to 3-7-1979, 
because Saturn is signifying 2 and 11 th cusp and in the sub 
and star of Venus, who Is also signifying 2,3 and 8 cusps and 


214 RULING PLANT 


Venus is strong Ruling Planet at the time of judgement as 
Moon's star and sub lord. Now, we have considered the transit 
of Sun, we find the transit of the Sun is overthe exact position 
of IV cusp is going to take place on 25/26-6-1979, just after 
the day of the New Moon. With the blessings of GOD, based 
on the above astrological facts, we predicted that she will turn 
to her home on 26-6-1979. Surprisingly, on 25-6-1979 at 7h 
30m the querent received a message by phone from Kanpur, 
about her arrival to one of her close relative's place. On 26-6- 
1979 they bring her at home. It certainly reflects, the 
miraculous exactness of KP. system. 


Now, we are producing one more illustration relating to a 
young boy who was absconded with a young unmarried girl on 
19-3-1979. 


The horary chart, which is obtained forthe purpose on 22- 
3-1979 at 8h 45m. p.m. I1S.T. at Lucknow, based on eastern 
horizon is reproducing here, about his return.

In the chart we have observed the sub lord of V and Xl 
cusp Is Venus, Ruling Planet as Moon star lord we confirmed, 
that they are enjoying Venusian pursuits. Now, question which 
came before us, when they will turn back. 


We assumed the sub lord of the IV cusp Rahu ts significator 
for 4 and 11 th cups also, so they will assure turn up. 


At the time of judgement the LP. of Sun is operating for 
one day i.e. upto 23-3-1979. Although Sun was signifying 4 
and 11" cusps but posited in the sub of Ketu, who Is signifying 
3.6 and 9" cusps. So, we rejected the LP. of Sun, that there 
is no possibility for their retum in the LP. of Sun. 


216 RULING PLANT 


Now, we considered the LP. of Moon, which ts more stronger 
in comparison to Sun, because IV sub lord Rahu (House 
denotes domestic pursuits) and Moon both are in the star of 
Venus, Venus is also Xl cusp sub and star lord and Rahu is 
itself significator for 4 and 11‘ cusp. 


So, we think over the transit of Moon, in near future, on 4/ 
5-4-1979 we find the transit of Moon is in Sign Gemini, lord 
Mercury, in the star of Rahu (significator for 4 and 11 cusps). 
So, on the basis we gave a marginal prediction, that he will 
turn accompanied with the girl by 1st week of April 1979. 


With the blessing of Lord Ganapathy, he turned up on 4-4- 
79 at early hours with his lover(by whom he was duly married 
during the period). 


After it, we paid our attention why he turned upon the 
morning hours of on 4-4-79, we came to conclusion, that at 
that time moon is in the star of Rahu and in the sub of Venus 
(another combined significator for 4 and 11"cusp.) 


These causes of events reflects about the miracle of steller 
astrologer which was enlightened by our late Guruji with the 
blessings of Lord Uchista Mahaganpathay. 


APPEAL SUCCESSFUL 
OR NOT 


A querist, who had lost the case at lower court and filed the 
suit in high court with hope of success against the decision of 
bwer court, wanted to know astrologically whether he will win 
in High Court or not and his desire of winning the case in high 
court will be fulfilled or not. He gave number 108 between 1 to 
249 for that. 


Horary chart for Number 108 will be as under:-

RULING PLANT 


Qur Rev.Guruji has given guidance for knowing whether 
one will be successful for winning in appeal or noton page 168 

Horary Astrology. Under title “Appeal Successful or not" he 
Su¥s that ifthe sub lord of the third cusp is deposited in the 
constellation ofthe planet which is significator of 6th and 11th 
house then one will have success. But ifthe sub lord of the 
third cusp is deposited the constellation of a planet who Is 
significator of 5m and 12n house one cannot have success. 


So for this we will have to find out significators of 6th and 
11th house and also of 5th and 12th houses. 


For Sixth house-Sixth house is occupied by Ketu. Jupiter is 
in Ketu's star. Owner is Saturn and nobody ts in Saturn star. 
Hence Jupiter, Ketu Saturn are the significator of 6th house. 


Eleventh house is owned by Moon. Nobody is in Moon's 
star. Hence Moon is the only significator of Eleventh house. 
Jupiter is the occupant of XIth house. Jupiter is conjoining with 
Rahu and aspecting Kethu. There is no planet in the stars of 
Jupiter in the chart. 


5" house is vacant owned by Saturn. Nobody is in Saturn's 
star. Hence star is the only significator of 5m house. 


12m house is owned by Sun. Planets Sun, Mercury and 
Venus are in Sun's star. Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and 
Rahu are the occupants of the 12" house Sun, Mercury, Venus 
are in Sun's star, Moon and Mars are in Jupiter's star Ketu is in 
Rahu's star. Nobody Is in star's Mercury and Saturn. 


KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 219

Mercury Simha sun Sun Rahu 
Jupiter Simha sun Kethu Sun 
Venus Kanni Mercury Sun Saturn 
Saturn Simha Sun Venus Mercury 
Rahu Simha oun Venus Venus 
Kethu Kumbha Saturn Rahu Mercury 


Hence all the nine planets are the significators of the 12m 
house. 


3m cusp isco ruled by Mars, Jupiter and Rahu as sign lord, 
star lord and sub'lord. Sub lord Rahu is deposited in star, lord 
of which is Venus. Venus is notthe significator of 6m and 11". 
But Venus is very strong significator of 12m house. So it is 
very clear that querist will not be successful in winning the 
appeal in High Court. 


lf we scrutinize 11th cusp for the possibilities regarding 
fulfillment of desire. We can find 11"cusp is co ruled by Moon 
as sign lord and star lord ship and sub lord ship is owned by 
Saturn fortunately no planet is retrograde. Saturn is deposited 
in star of Venus occupant of first house which promises the 
fulfillment of desire. Saturn is significator of 6M house also. 


So what should be our conclusion? 


As this is great cause for confusion and controversy thinking 
of Shri.M.N.Sinha was tried which gave correct picture as under. 


As per his theory sub lord is Rahu. Rahu is in star and sub 
of Venus who is the significator of 6,8 and 10 house and not in 
9 and 12m house success in appeal is promising . Moreover 
sub lord of 11t cusp is Saturn who ts in star of Venus and sub 
of Mercury which are significator of 6,8 and 1Othis also indicates 
for fulfillment of desire. 


220 RULING PLANT 


For fructification auspiciousness of the periods is also 
esseniial. 


At the time of judgement Rahu dasa Moon Bhukthi operates 
upto 19-1-1980 Dasanatha is Rahu. Rahu signify for 12,1,2 
and 9. But Rahu is conjoined with iagna. Rahu node is in 
conjunct with Jupiter, Sun, Mercury and Saturn, lord of Sixth 
house, keeps the 6lh house in its sway. So we can treat Rahu 
as neutral being neither adverse nor favorable. 


Bhukthinatha is Moon . Moon also signify 12,11 and posited 
in Ath. Further Moon is tenated in her own sub and thus as 
lord of XI, signifies fulfillment of desire. 


Anthra lord is Kethu upto 22-9-1980 and it is star of Rahu 
and sub Mercury, Kethu is in 6" bhava and Mercury is lord of 
1 and 10 in 12. 10th stands for name and fame. 


Hence | boldly told the frustrated mind of querist that he 
wilt De definitely successful, winning his appeal in high court. 


ON ATTAINING PUBERTY 


Puberly means sexual maturity. Dunng theirteens, people 
attain this sexual maturity invariably. 


In the case of girls, they attain puberty mostly as they 
attain the age of thirteen even. So, in the case ofa girl, if 
there is a delay in attaining puberty even atthe age of 18, the 
parents naturally get perturbed and they are liable to mun to a 
Doctor or Astrologer for consultation. 


In similar manner, one consultant from Adyar, approached 
me on the evening of 10-4-80 with a query under: 


“When is my eldest daughter, born in January 1962, likely 
to attain puberty." 


No. 152 was given by the father for analysis.

For puberty, | consider the 5m house. Here the No. 152 
was given by the father of the girl and so all matters are 
discussed here undertaking the 5m Cusp as Lagna ofthe Girl: 
and the Krishnamurti Padhdhati Students are required to 
reconstruct the chart with Vth cusp as Lagna and so on. 


Coming to the matter, for PUBERTY | consider the 5m 
house and its Sub lord, together with the 8'" house. Why? 


5m tells, apart from other matters, the mental sphere of 
the native. Mental pleasure, society and social inclination. Status 
is society. More connected to physical pleasures. Love affairs. 
Licentiousness, Legitimate and Illegitimate attraction. Social 
intercourse between sexes priorto wedlock. Attraction between 
the opposite sex, sexual expression and the outlook towards 
the same. Getting the understanding of sexual pleasures and 
that portion of life. 


scorpio (the 8m house in the natural Zodiac), tells about 
one’s secret parts and sex organs; and also regarding the 
function ofthese organs and these working condition, thereof. 


In Natal or Horary charts, the 8m bhava and its cusp portray 
the real positions of these sexual organs and all matters 
connected to the same, together with sexual portion of life. 


In the case of puberty, the 5m cusp sub lord should be the 
significator of 5m or 8 or both; and Mars also should be 
connected to 5mor 8" in any manner, since Mars represents 
blood in the body. 


Here the sub lord of the 5m is Mercury. Mercury is in thel2th 
in the star of Jupiter IN 5m and so the sub lord of the 5m, 
signifies the 5m only, and this combination itself promises the 
matter; and this tells she will certainly attain puberty and it is 
not at all negated. 


224 RULING PLANT 


Further the sub lord Mercury is in the sub of Mars in 5m and 
owns 2nd house and this fortifies the matter. 


Then | turned to the sub lord of the 8m cusp. It is Saturn. 
It is a delaying planet, and its character is only to delay but 
not to deny, if other significations are fruitful. Further Saturn 
has a dual role for fructifying the matter as it owns 11 cusp. 


As we all know, here that is delay as the girl in question has 
now attained her 19m year of age, on date. 


The same Saturn is in the star of Sun a depositer of Lagna, 
promises the fructification of the matter under analysis; and 
this Saturn is in the sub of Moon, the owner of the Sth cusp. 


This also promises the fructification of the matter queried. 


When is the fructification? 


For this we have to consider the conjoined period of the 
significators of 2,5, and 11,together with Mars, which should 
have some connections in some manner. 


end house:- getting status in the family members as an 
Adult. 


5m house:- getting mental status and understanding sexual 
expression and full matters connected to sexual organs and 
its functions. 


11im Nouse:- Desire fulfillment. 


Existing period is Moon, upto 30-11-1980. Moon is in its 
own star in 11* and owns the 5m cusp is in the sub of Venus 
signifying 11thand 8th also. Moon is a ruling planet. 


Bhukti of Venus upto 30-5-80. Venus is in the star of Moon 
in 11th , owning 5* cusp, and Venus is in the sub of sub of 
Rahu in the 5m in the nearer proximify to Mars who owns the 
2nd cusp. (Mars 2°-36’ Leo and Rahu 3°-5’ Leo}. Venus is a 
Ruling Planet being the sub lord of Moon and Lagna. 


KRISHNAMURTI_ PADHDHATI 225 

The matter shall fructify in the anthra of Kethu which rules 
from 25-4-1980 to 30-5-1980. Kethu is in the 11°"in the star 
of Mars depositer of 5m owning 2nq cusp, and is in the sub of 
Venus signifying 11’ and 8" . Kethu is taken as Ruling Planet, 
as it deputises Satum being in Aquarius. Satum is ruling planet. 


The consultant was intimated that the matter shall fructify 
before 30-5-80 and sent away.

Analysis 


For marriage we have to judge the houses 2,7 and 11.2™ 
house tells aboutthe “Kutumbasthna”. and family life. 7m tells 
about the opposite sex, partner Le. wife or husband. The 11th 
tells about the permanent tie (Friendliness} over each other. 
The 7m cusp sub lord is the deciding factor as to how one Is 
destined to have the mariage in his life or not. The sub lord 
ofthe 7m cusp must also signify either of these houses, 2,7 or 
11.Then only the marriage is promised. The planet "Venus" 
should also be looked into as this planet is a chief governor 
(KARAKA Planet) for the marriage. 


The 5m house tells about one's success or failure in “Love 
Affairs". The native's love affairs, the degree of success of 
failure in love affairs, legitimate or illegitimate attractions etc. 
comes under the purview of this 5m cusp. It may be said to 
represent the seat of the physical magnetic attraction between 
the opposite sexes. As "Venus" is also a Karaka planet for 
marriage and love affairs, shows whether one will be faithful in 
love and allow the partner to enjoy life or one will be 
troublesome. 


According to our Guruji, if the sub lord of the 7m cusp is 
connected to houses 5 or 9, then it indicates "Love -marriage”. 


Ifthe sublord of the 5m cusp is deposited in the constellation 
of a planet who is a significator of 7 and 11,the materialization 
of Love affairs is promised. But of the sub lord of the 5m cusp 
happens to be in the constellation, the lord in which ts the 
significator of the houses 6 or 12 then It will not end in marriage. 


230 AULING PLANT 


If it is in the constellation of a planet signifying 6, the other 
party falls out. But ifthe sublord of the 5m cusp ts in the 
constellation of a planet signifying the tan house, then the 
consultant himself will drop the idea. Hence for materialization 
ofthe love affairs into marriage, we have to judge the houses, 
2,2,/ and 11. 


In the chart under discussion the sub lord of the 7m 
(marriage) cusp Is "Rahu". Rahu, Node in Simha in association 
with Saturn in the star of Venus and Moon sub. XI house falls 
In Simha and Saturn is placed in Xl as lord of 4 and 5. Venus 
associating with Sun, Mercury and Jupiter are placed in Kataka, 
IX house. Hence marriage is promised. VII house sub lord 
Rahu is the strong significator of V and also Venus indicates 
about love affairs and significance of Xl show the success of 
love affairs. 


Marriage When? 


The love marriage will be celebrated during the conjoined 
periods of the houses 2,5,7 and 11. 


2nd house:- No Planet in this house. Mars is the lord of this 
house. No planet in Mars's stars. But Jupiter in Mars's sub. 


5 house :- Ketu is in conjunction with V cusp house Kumbha. 
No planets in his stars. Satum is the lord ofthis house. Sun, 
Venus and Mercury are in Saturn's stars. Rahu Node is also 
associated with Saturn in Simha. 


7m house:- No planet is there. Mars is lord of this Nouse, 
No planet in his stars. But Jupiter is in his sub. 


11th house:- Saturn is posited in this house. Sun, Mercury, 
Venus are in his stars. Sun is the Lord of this house. No 
planets in his stars. Ketu (as nodes) and Rahu also represents 
this house and in conjunction with Xl cusp of the house in 
Simha. 


Hence the total significators of the houses 2,5,7 and 11 
are Sun, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and 
Ketu. As many as all the planets except Moon has come as 


KRISHNAMURT) PADHDHATI 231 


the significators of houses, 2,5,7 and 11,we may select the 
fruitful siqnificators by using the "Ruling Planets" method a 
speciality of our beloved “Guruji" 


The Ruling planets are Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury. 
But Ketu a node is transiting in the sign "Aquarius", ruled by 
Saturn. Hence, we maytake Rahu instead of Salum as the 
nodes are very powerful in giving the results they have 
conjoined. Hence the common significators of houses 2,5,7 
and 11 are:- 


Jupiter, Mercury and Rahu. 


At the time of judgement, the major dasa of Jupiter and 
Bhukthi of Jupiter, wasrunning. The Mercury anthra operates 
from 11-10-79to 30-1-80. As Mercury is a strong significator 
and a Ruling Planet, | decided that the marriage must be 
celebrated before the Mercury anthra. | pitched upon the 
Rahu Sookshma, the remaining Ruling Planet and also a strong 
significator of houses 5 and 11.The Rahu Sookshma operates 
from 16-12-79 to 30-12-1979. So I informed the querent that 
he will be getting married during the last week of "December 
1979", especially on 28-12-79 or 29-12-79 and also it will be a 
love marriage. 


2/-12-79:- The star is Revathi ruled by Mercury, who is in 
Retrograde and hence this is good. 


23-12-79:- Aswini star day, ruled by Ketu is very good for 
marriage. 


29-12-79:-The star day is “Barani“ ruled by Venus, is also 
very good day for celebrating the marriage. 


30-12-79:- The star is Krithika ruled by Sun is not good as 
sun is not Ruling Planet. 


Hence, I came to a conclusion that the querent will be 
celebrating his “Love-marriage” either on 28-12-79 or on 29- 
12-79 positively. But, 29-12-79 is most possible and favourable 
dasa as the "Moon"will be transiting in the 7m house, which 
brings out the marriage to the querent. 


ede RULING PLANT 


Description of the Partner:- The 7” house tells about the 
life of partner. The sub lord ofthe 7m cusp is Rahu. Rahu ts in 
Simha. It indicates the quality of persons such as, very tall, 
fair complexion, well proportioned Oody, always active, 
mischieveaus, clever, broad face etc. (viz page 88 of 
Krishnamurti Padhdhati Reader IV, marriage, Married life and 
Children.) 


Is she employed:- The 10 house indicates one's profession. 
The 10 cusp from 7m is 4th house. Its sub lord is Saturn, 
saturn is the lord of the 10m house (from 7m). Saturn is the 
star of Venus in 6m service (from 7th}. Hence | added that his 
life partner will be an employed (in service) one. 


Result 


In his reply letter dated 19-11-1979 by the querent the 
following words are there in his Setter, which is as follows:- 


"By this opportunity, | may inform you that your prediction 
about my "Love-marriage” has come absolutely correct. | 
suddenly met one “Burmesi” girl, employed, fair, broad face, 
well-build body, and we settled to marry during the last of 
December 1979 by Registration. We have already served 
notices to the marriage officer on 3-11-79 itself. 


But | have asked him to write the exact date and time of 
the marriage in response to the above letter. 


In his reply letter dated 19-12-79, the querent has stated 
that, | have settled the marriage by Registration on 29-12-79 
and | thank you for your “Un-canny” prediction regarding my 
“Love-marriage”. 


The above prediction once again confirms the soundness 
and exactness of Krishnamurti Padhdhati system which alone 
can pinpoint exact periods and to the correct date and that 
our prayers go once again in praise of the greatest Astrologer 
and our beloved guruji fate Shri. K.S.Krishnamurti who brought 
forth this advanced science (system) for knowing in advance 
in any type of future event with exact precision. But who 


does not know this system and those who does not want to 
understand this system may call this as Instant Astrology. Let 
them continue the same and we do not care for such of 
those phrases and our main object is to improve this system 
further more and bring a glorious name to our beloved GurujI 
and this advanced stellar and Krishnamurti Padhdhati System 
and also useful human kind of Modem days. 


| may request the critics to please master this Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati System and then forward their criticisma as it is 
often told by elders that it is an healthy one. Only when the 
critic masters that particular subject. 


"One can take the horse to the booi, but not hundred 
make it drink" as goes the saying and so I once again call 
those critics to learn Krishnamurti Padhdhati system and | am 
sure if once they learn this system they will at once stop the 
criticism. 


SUCCESS IN 
EXAMINATION 


D.S.N. Murty, a student of our school failed in the High 
School Certificate examination conducted by the Board of 
secondary Examination, Orissa in April 1979. He paid the 
examination fees for September examination and was getting 
ready for it. His father Sri.0.B.Rao approached me to know 
Astrologically in advance the prospect of his son's success in 
the ensuing examination. The examination was to commence 
on and from 11-9-1979te 18-9-1979. Sri D.BRao gave No.228 
for Horary Analysis saying that this son is the first born. 


| attempted to work out the Horary chart at 7-30 p.m. on 
Thursday 23-8-1979 but | had to stop the work within a few 
minutes due to the arrival of a consultant. | could not spare 
time for this work that night. | took up the work next day at 8- 
20 A.M. After a thorough scrutiny of the chart I told the 
querent that his son would pass in the examination with minimum 
marks. The boy passed in the said examination with an 
aggregate of 293 marks while the minimum aggregate for a 
pass is 264 marks out of 800 marks. 


The details are given for the benefit of the readers, horary 
No.228, Judged at 8-20 A.M.(IST) on Friday on 20*-11° North 
Latitude and 85°-40° East Longitude. Astrology & Arthrishta 
magazine Ephemeris for August 1979, Rapheal's Tables of 
Houses and Krishnamurti Padhdhati Ayanamsa 23°-28" are 
used to case the chart. 


The number 228 given by the father indicates 29°-26-40" 
in Aquarius. This is the Ascendant for father. Since the querents' 
son is frist born, 5m cusp from the father's Ascendant becomes 
the Ascendant forthe boy. Sun's Ascendant is 26°-30° in Gemini. 
This chart is drawn with reference to the Son's Ascendant.

Analysis: 


Moon as well as the sub lord of the Ascendant as per the 
Horary Number disclose the nature of the query. The querent 
is the father. The sub lord for the number 228 given by the 
father is Moon itself. Moon ts closely conjunct with Saturn, lord 
of 8 and 9 forthe boy. Moon is the star of Venus, lord of 4 
and 11 forthe boy. Moon is in the sub of Saturn again. 4m 
house indicated education. 9" house indicates higher education 
and research. 11'house indicates fulfillment of desire. Thus it 
Is clear that the query is about the son's education and his 
success in It. 


In the present case, the boy is appearing for the 
Marticulation examination only. Hence the house 4 and 11 are 
enough for consideration and these two houses should be 
related to each other. Also Dasa, Bhukti etc. during the penod 
of examination should be favourable for a success. 


sun, the sub lord ofthe 4m cusp is in close conjunction with 
Venus, lord of 4 and 11 in 2. Sun Js in the star of Ketu 
representing Saturn, lord of 9 in 2 and sub of Rahu in 2. 
Mercury, the sub lord ofthe 11"cusp is deposited its own star 
in 1 and sub of Venus lord of 4 and 11.and also sub lord of 
the 6* cusp in 2. Thusthe sub lords of 4 and 11 are favourable 
to the boy to get through the examination. Moreover Jupiter 
who is the general significator for education, ts lord of 6 in 2 in 
the star of Mercury lord of 1 and sub lord of 11th cusp in 1 and 
In the sub of Saturn lord of 9 in 2. As such we have to infer 
that the boy will pass with a fairly good number of Marks in a 
better rank. But there are defects here. Generally speaking, 
both Jupiter and Mercury are the planets go give education to 
anybody. Unfortunately both of them are aspecting the evil 
8m house. Jupiter owns the 7m house also in addition to 6m . 


238 RULING PLANT 


Similarly Mercury owns 12m house also in addition to the 
Ascendant. Mercury rules the sub of the cusps 5 and 12 
besides its lord ship over star of the 2@na cusp and sub of the 
11th cusp. Mercury is in its own star. Jupiter is in the star of 
Mercury. Jupiter is in the sub of Saturn who tules the evil 8m 
house as well as the unfavourable 5m cuspal star, Saturn is 
aspecting 4,9 and 11. Eventhough Saturn is lor of the 
favourable 9" house, it is the lord of 8° also. On account of 
these defects or evils the boy should as a matter of fact be 
destined to fail in the examination. But there are certain vita! 
factors to contribute to the success of the boy. Mercury as 
the sub lord ofthe 11™cusp, is the deciding planet whether 
the boy will be crowned with success or not. Mercury is in the 
sub of Venus, the greatest benefic being lord of 4 and 11 and 
also the sub lord of the 6m cusp which is an essential house for 
winning over the opponents. Jupiter as lord of 6 is in the star 
of such a Mercury. Jupiter is in the sub of Satum who is in the 
star of benefic Venus. Thus they have to offer the boy success 
only. Moreover the lords of 4,9,11 and 6 are in the favourable 
2™ house. Yet on account of the evil elements inherited by 
Jupiter and Mercury, they will not allow the boy to secure a 
good number of Marks and beiter rank. This sort of observation 
from the chart made me to inform the querent that his son 
would surely get through the examination but with minimum 
marks only. 


Before coming to such a conclusion we have to check up 
the validity of Dasa, Bhukti, Anthra and Sookshma running 
during the days of examination to give the same verdict. 
According to the Horary chart the boy was to mn the Dasa of 
Venus, Bhukti and Anthra of Satun and Sookshma of Moon 
from 3-9-1979 to 20-9-1979 Dasa lord Venus is lord of 4 and 
11 in 2 in the star of Ketu and sub of Rahu. These two Nodes 
are in the sub of Venus. Also they represent Venus, Sun, 
Saturn and Moon all in 2. Bhukti and Anthra lord Saturn is in 
the star of Venus and sub of Jupiter lord of 6 and star lord of 
the cusps 1 and 9 in 2 Sookshma lord Moon is in the star of 
Venus and sub of Saturn. Even though Ketu, the star lord of 


KRISHNAMURTL PADHUOHATI 239 


Venus, is the star lord of favourable cusps 6 and 10 and sub 
lord of Ascendant, it is also the sub lord of 7™ cusp and it is 8" 
house. Rahu is the sub lord of the 8th cusp besides. Thus the 
lords of Dasa, Bhukti etc. are no doubt favourable to the boy, 
but not wholly. 


The significators of the houses 4,11 and also of 6 (winning) 
are as follows. All the houses 4,6,11 are vacant. Venus owns 4 
and 11. Moon, Rahu and Saturn are in the star of Venus. 
Jupiter rules the 6" house. No planet is in any of the stars of 
Jupiter. Thus the significators on the whole are Moon, Saturn, 
Rahu, Jupiter and Venus. The lords of Dasa, Bhukti, Anthra 
and Seokshma during the period of examination belong to this 
group. The Ruling planets atthe time of Analysis are as follows. 
Venus is lord of Day and Moon star. Sun is the Moon sign lord. 
Mercury Is the lagna lord. Moon isthe Lagna. Star lord. Saturn 
is the sub lord of lagna and Moon. Even the Sookshma Lord 
Moon is found to be the lagna star lord among the ruling planets. 
Thus all the indications of the planetary set up reveal success 
but to a limited extent. Also as perthe Gulbarga system if the 
sub lord ofthe Horary Number is the star lord of Moon or lagna 
then success is indicated. Here Moon, the sub lord for the 
number 228, is the star lord of lagna. This also confirms success 
to the boy thereby fulfillment of desire for father. 


The examination results will be announced on Saturday 27- 
10-1979. By that time the boy was running the Horary Dasas 
of Venus Bhukti and Anthra of Saturn and Sookshma of Rahu 
upto 28-10-1979. Since Rahu represents Venus, Saturn, Moon 
and Sun and since Hahu is in the star and sub of Venus, lord 
of 4,11 and sub lord of 6 cusp, it fulfilled the ambition ofthe 
boy. As Satum is aspecting both 4 and 11 the result was aptly 
released on Saturday. On account of Saturn's aspect on 4,11 
and Saturn being a delaying planet the result was delayed up 
to the end of Rahu Sookshma. 


The transit on the day of announcement of result was as 
following:- The first luminary Sun was in Libra ruled by the 
Dasa lord Venus, in the star of Rahu, a representative of the 


240 


lords of Dasa, Bhukti, Anthra and Sookshma forthe period of 
examinations and significator of 4 and 11 also the Sookshma 
lord at the time of announcement of results. Sun was in the 
sub of Jupiter lord of 6. 


The second luminary Moon who was also the Sookshma 
lord for the period of examination was in Ohanus ruled by 
Jupiter, lord of 6, in the star of the Dasa Lond Venus. Dasa 
lord Venus was in its own sign Libra in Jupiter star and Ketu 
sub. Bhukti and Antra !orcf Saturn was in Leo, Sun star and 
Rahu sub. Sookshma lord Rahu atthe time of announcement 
of result was in Leo, Ketu star, Mercury sub, Jupiter, lord of 6 
and a general significator of education was in Leo, Ketu star, 
Mercury sub., Mercury, the sub lord ofthe 11cusp and also 
another significator of the education was in Scorpio, Jupiter 
star, Rahu sub before noon and in the star and sub of Saturn 
afternoon. 


Now some doubts arise here 1} On ‘theday of 
announcement of result Mercury, the sub lord nofthe 11th 
cusp and gernral significator of education was in Scorpio ruled 
by Mars who is neither a significator of 4 or 6 or 11 nor a ruling 
plantet at the time of Analysis of the query. 2} Jupiter is 
significator of 6M house but not a ruling planet. 3} Mercury 
and Sun are ruling planets but not significators. 4) Ketu is 
neither a ruling planet nor a significator. 


Clarification of doubts: A general rule in this connection is 
that the transit of planets on the day of event may be in the 
sign or star of sub of either particular significators or general 
siqnificators or ruling planets. This rule clarifies the 2nd and 3rd 
doubts. The 4th doubt is simple. Here ketu is in the sign of 
Saturn and is also aspected by Venus, Moon and Saturn who 
are significators as well as Ruling Planets. So Ketu becomes a 
significator and ruled planet. Lastly regarding the first doubt is 
about Mars. At the time of Analysis of the querry Mars was in 
the star of Rahu and sub of Venus. Venus is a significator as 
well as ruling planet. Rahu is a significator and by association 
with the ruling planets namely Venus, Saturn, Sun and Moon 


KAISHNAMURTI PADHDHAT 241 


becomes a ruling planet also. Hence Mars being deposited in 
the star and sub of significators and ruling planets can be 
treated as a ruling planet and a significator also. Thus the 
transit agrees in full. 


Even though transit takes place in the above manner the 
event has to take place during the conjoined period of the 
planets who are common significators and ruling planets. Here 
the event is the announcement of result. 


Dasa, Bhukti and Anthra are ruled by the same planets 
Venus and Saturn for the period of examination and the time 
of result. Both Venus and Saturn are significators and ruling 
planets also. Period of examination falls in Moon Sookshma 
and announcement of result falls in Rahu Sookshma. Rahu is 
also a significator as well as ruling planet. 


In the first instance, | thought that the result should be 
announced on Friday 6-10-1979 when Moon transits Ketu star 
in Dhanus since Ketu is in the sub of Venus. But immediately | 
changed in my mind due to the aspect of Saturn on 4 and 11 
and Saturn's conjunction with Moon. So the result must be 
delayed till Saturday 27-10-1979 that day Moon transits Venus 
star in Dhanus. Venus being in the star and sub of Nodes 
must be stronger than them. My thought became correct 


| conclude this article with Pranams to Lord Uchishta Maha 
Ganapahty and our late Guruji. 


YOUNG BROTHER'S 
ADMISSION 


A Krishnamurti padhdhati admirer called on me on the night 
of 2nd May79. He wanted to know about the admission of his 
younger brother in an Engineering College. He had in his mind 
an Engineering College and had already approached the 
Chairman of the Governing Council of that college, and was 
said to meet him again after the announcement of the results, 
in the month of July. As it was quite late in night, | could not 
take up the matter immediately. He gave me a number: (240) 
and | told him to meet me after a couple of days. 


The judgement on the said matter was done at 8-O6 a.m. 
3-5-1979, Thursday. The Horary Chart for the given number 
and the time of judgement is given below.

B) The lagna for the querist falls in Jupiter sign, Saturn star, 
Jupiter sub for the given number 240. Since the question 
relates about his younger brother, the 3rd cusp therefrom has 
to be judged, because the 3rd denotes younger brother. The 
question may be for the querist himself or for himself, all 
calculation will have to be made from the lagna, according to 
the number given by him. If it is for his younger brother or 
sister, we must take the third cusp from that lagna as the 
ascendant for that younger brother or sister. If it is for his 
younger brother or sister, we must take the third cusp from 
that lagna as the ascendant for that younger brother or sister. 
lf it is for the mother, take the 4th cusp, for son or daughter 
(child, in general) take the 5th house, for wife or partner in 
business, take the 7m house. For father take the 9th and for 
elder brother orsister take the 11th , For a friend take the 
11th. Thus one is tojudge and find outthe analysis according 
to which relative and friend the query is meant for. 


In the present case, since the question is about his younger 
brother, take the 3rd cusp from his lagna. We find that Pisces 
is his lagna. So the ascendant for his younger brother will be 
Taurus. Hence all calculation must be made from Taurus. The 
number in brackets denotes the cusp with respect to the 
younger brother.

Il. Moon, indicating the mind, reveals the nature of the 
query, what the querist has in /his her mind, and also shows 
if Success is promised or can be achieved. 


Moon is lord of 5 in 4 Le. lord of 3 in 2 for the younger 
brother, in conjunction with Jupiter lord of 8 and 11,also in 2. 
It is in the constellatinof Saturn and sub of Mercury. Satum is 
in the 4m cusp and is lord of 9. Mercury is in the 11 th cusp. 
Moon thus, very clearly indicates that the question pertains to 
the younger brother's admission into an Engineering College. 
Venus, the lord of lagna, in the 11* cusp promises Success. 


IV. A) Wilt He Get Admission? 


Venus, lord of lagna, is in 11. The sub lord of the 11™cusp, 
Jupiter is direct. Sub lord of the 4th is Saturn. Satum ts lord of 4 
in 9 in the constellation of Venus, an occupant of 11. Hence 
we can be sure that he will get admission. 


B) Another feature worth noting is the sub-lord of the 9lh 
cusp. The 9m stands for higher education and the sub lord Is 
Venus. Venus it is seen, is in a dual sign and conjoined with 
Mercury a dual planet, also in the same dual sign. Venus is in 
11.Hence it is clear that success is promised only after repeated 
attempts. So | clearly told him that even though admission is 
promised, it will not be got in the college where they are at 
present trying a seat and further added thatthe seat can be 
got only in another college. Plurality is indicated due to Venus 
association with a dual sign and dual planet and the eleventh 
house. 


Readers will note that in my article on page 3 of the 
February79 Issue, also the sub lord ofthe 9m cusp Is Mercury, 
a dual planet, but is not connected with the 11th cusp, i.e. the 
subd lord of the 9m cusp, though being a dual planet, has no 
connection with the 11"cusp. Thus the querist got admitted 
in the same college where he preferred a seat, with out any 
plurality, as such. Inthe same breath, | kindly invite the readers’ 
attention to page 304-306 of Krishnamurti Padhdhati Reader 
Vl. Therein, it was stated that "as the sub lord (of the 3rd 
cusp} is Mercury, you will go to one place first; not finding it 


246 AULING PLANT 
good, you will further more". This Mercury is in the star of Sun 
positioned in the 11“ cusp, thereby, having connection with 
the 11" cusp, | personally feel that he had this in his mind, 
while he made that prediction. What | want to make clear to 
the readers by relating all this, is that plurality can be predicted 
only if the sub lord of the relevant cusp has any connection 
with the eleventh cusp. If it does not have any connection, 
then plurality cannot and must not be predicted. 
V) Singificators:- 

The significators of 4 and 11 are: 
Fourth House: 


Occupants are Satum and Rahu. Jupiter and Moon are in 
Satum's star. No planet in the stars of Rahu. 
Lord is Sun. 


No planet in its star or sub. 


There fore the significators of the fourth house are Sun, 
Moon, Jupiter, Saturn and Hahu. 


Eleventh House: 
Occupants are Mercury. 
Venus and Mars. 
Mercury is own star. Venus and Mars in star of Mercury. 
Sun, Satum and Rahu in star of Venus. 
Lord is Jupiter. 
Ketu is in star of Jupiter. 


Therefore the significators of the ninth cusp are Sun, Mars, 
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. 

Hence the significators are Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, 
Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. Since al! the nine planets 
occur as significators, it is best to eliminate a few by noting 
the Ruling Planets of ihe moment of judgement. 


KAISHNAMURTL PADHDHAT| eas 


The Day lord is - Jupiter (Thursday} 
Lagna lord - Venus (Taurus) 

Lagna star - Moon (Rohini) 

Moon lord - Moon (Cancer) 

Moon star - Saturn (Pushya) 


Mercury and Mars are conjoined with Venus, the lagna 
lord. Rahu conjoined with Saturn. Ketu in sign of Saturn. 


Thus the Ruling Planets are Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
saturn, Venus, Rahu and Ketu.Since the Ruling Planets are 
also many in number, the Bhukti and Antara lords will have to 
be chosen carefully. 


VI. Timing of Event: - 


According to the Horary Chart, the querist's younger brother 
is undergoing the period of Saturn Dasa, Mercury Bhukti, Jupiter 
Antara till 8-8-79. Jupiter is in the star of Retrograde Saturn. 
So it is dropped. Next is Saturn Antara starting from 8-8-79 to 
11-1-1980. As admissions in the Engineering College cannot 
be later than the 9m month ie. September, we can analyse 
the planets forthe months of August and September. Mercury 
is Retrograde til! 10*and turns direct on the 11* August 


Transit of the Dasa or the Bhukti lord ts taken, whichever is 
slower. Saturn is slowerthan Mercury. So take the transit of 
Saturn, the Dasa and Antara lord. Saturn ts in the star of 
Venus throughout the months of August and September. It ts 
in Jupiter sub from 11-8-79to 26-8-79. Jupiter being in star of 
retrograde Saturn, this period can be omitted. Then Saturn is 
in own sub from 26-8-79 to 12-9-79. Hence admission is definite 
during this period. 


Therefore I told him that his younger brother will get 
admitted only between 30-8-79 and 12-9-79 in a college other 
that where the seat was being sought. He was rather surpfised 
at the period | mentioned because according to him the 
admissions will be over by the end of August. Since I gave 
him a date until 12” September, he was doubtful if the prediction 
may come out correct or not. But |, on my part, was confident 


248 | 


that it will be only during the month of September, before the 
12m. With that he left. " 


VII. | accidently met him on the 6* of September and he 
told me that as predicted his younger brother got admitted 
(between 30/8 and 12/9) on 5-9-79 (Wednesday). He further 
added that the seat was got in another college and not in the 
college were he was trying for it. He praised and thanked me 
for the exact prediction and said that he would trouble me 
with many more questions in the future, from time to time!! 


With great respects to the Guruji, | conclude this article 


PURCHASE AND ARRIVAL 
OF COW -WHEN? 


My wife wanted to have Jersey or Holstein cow for domestic 
purpose. She had asked her father to find out good cow. 
After few days she received a telephone call that they are 
sending one cow immediately. She was very eager to know 
the type of cow and its arrival. She came to me and asked 
me to find out astrologically about this cow or may be she 
wanted to test my Krishnamurti Pahdhdati knowledge. 


After bowing my head to our revered Guruji | have started 
my works to calculate to know the results. 


She gave No.99 between 1 to 249 (Krishnamurti Padhdhati)

KRISHNAMURTI PADHOHATI 251 


d) Moon Sign Lord - Saturn 
e) Day Lord - Mars 
Moon (The revealer of mind) 


Moon is posited in 6 indicating pet animals and cattle. She is 
the occupant of moveable sign reveals moving and living animal. 
Moon is placed in Mars constellation and sub. Mars is in 11* 
house denoting realsisation of ambition and aspects 6* house 
and owns 4* house denoting cattle for domestic use. It is 
100% correct that her query was connecting with purchase of 
domestic animal. The Moon in the 6* house indicates milking 
animal and Moon, watery planet is in the star of Mars, in 
Kataka, watery sign of the zodiac. 


Confirmation through the 6th house: 


6m house is owned by Saturn, Moon star and Venus sub. 
Moon indicates milking animal and sub Venus indicates, Cow. 
Moon and Venus reveals that it will give plenty of milk Look! 
Howthe Almighty guide us. 


2s it Jersey or Holsein: 


Sub Lond of the Ascendant Saturn is posited in Ascendant 
with Sun. So | told her cow is in black colour with white patches 
and hence it must be Holsein. Lord of 10m house (i.e. 5" from 
6" house) is Venus. Venus is the signiticator of 10* (5* from 
6*} and 4* (11 *from 6* house}. This indicates good progeny. 
Lord of lagna Sun is in the sub of Jupiter, indicates the animal 
is pregnant. 


Astrological Analysis: 


The 6* house is connected with pet animals and catile. 
The 11* house shows acquisition and gains. The 7* house 
the person with whom the dealing in connection with the cow 
is made-the seller or the buyer. The 12* house being the 6* 
reckoned trom the ?7* orthe seller, describes his goods. The 
11* house which is negation from the 12*shows his disposal 
ofthe animal. The 12“house hasto do with expenditure in all 
manner of ways. It rules investment, spending, issue of cheque 
etc. The 8* house being the 2% from the 7* denotes financial 


gains to the seller. So consider houses 6,11,12 and 8. 


6* cusp: Occupant is Moon 
Sun is the Star of Moon. 
Owner is Saturn, 
Mars is in the Star of Saturn. 
Ketu represents for Saturn. 
Therefore significators are Sun, Moon, Mars and 
Saturn, Ketu, 


11* cusp: Occupant is Mars. 
Moon, Mercury and Venus are in Mars Star. 
Owner is Mercury. 
No Planet in its star. 
Therefore significators are Moon, Mars, Mercury and 
Venus. 


12"cusp: Occupants are Jupiter and Rahu. 
No Planet in Jupiter star, Ketu is in Rahu star. 
Owner is Moon. 
Sun is in the Moon star. 
Therefore significators are Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Rahu 
and Ketu. 


The 8* house stands as the 2nq counted from the 7m 
house. The 2nd shows financial gains. The 8* therefore, is the 
house of financial receipts to the seller, Jupiter is lord of 8 
posited in 12"house. No Planet in its star. This reveals selling 
of animal and gain of finance. 


Thus the significators are - Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, 
Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. 


When the significators are many in number, the Ruling Planets 
will help USto choose the fruitful one. The fruitful significators 
are Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. 


From the Horary Chart the querent is running Mars Dasa, 
Mars Bhukti, Kethu Anthra upto 4-10-1979, I told her she will 
receive the cow 2™ evening or 3rd morning as Mars Dasa, 
Mars Bhukti, Kethu Anthra ends on 3-10-1979. 


KAISHNAMUATI PADHDHATI 253 
Progeny When: 


Consider 2,5 and 11 houses from 6m house Le. 7,10 and 
A* house. 


* cusp: Significators are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and 
Ketu. 


10* cusp: Significators are Venus and Saturn, 
4" cusp: Significators are Moon, Mars, Mercury and Venus. 


Hence the significators are Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. 


Eliminating the weak significators, the remaining strong 
significators are Venus, Jupiter and Saturn. 


Sun transit in Venus sign Jupiter star and Saturn sub on 9- 
11-1979. 


Planetary sex of the sign, star, sub of 10” house (i.e. 5m 
from 6" house}. 


Cusp sign lord is Venus - Female 
Cusp star lord is Moon - Female 
Cusp sub lord is Sun - Male 


So I predicted that this cow will have Female calf in the 
second week of November mostly on 9-11-79. 


Lagna Lord Sun is in the constellation of Moon the occupant 
of the 6* house (which is the house of Vyaya to those with 
whom the transaction is done.} While purchasing the cow you 
get at cheap price. When you sell you make profit. 


Actually the cow arrived to our house on 2nd October’/9 
and | paid its cost on 3rd October’73 evening. The cow is 
Holstein black in colour with white patches. As predicted the 
calf was bom on 9 November?79 night. 


This example clearly proves the usefulness of Krishnamurti 
Padhdhati to pinpoint the events. Thanksto Guruji who invented 
this correct method. 


"WHETHER MY PRESENT 
POST WILL BE CONFIRMED? 
IF SO WHEN?" 


A Lecturer from Salem, called on me on 15-4-80 and 
requested me to predict his professional prospects. He asked 
me to say whether his present post of Lecture will be confirmed 
or not, as he is one of the junior most in the list. 


As per Our Guruji Krishnamurti Padhdhati | asked him to

Analysis: 


The query is about the profession. Hence we have to analyse 
the house 2,6,10 and 11.Ifthe sub lord of the 10* (profession) 


KAISHNAMURTL PADHDHATI 257 


cusp is well connected to houses 2,6,10 and 11,one will be 
employed. In the chart under discussion, the sub lord of the 
2nqd cusp is Mercury. Mercury lord of 2 and 3 in 11 with out any 
planets In his star. He is also in the constellation of Saturn lord 
of 10 and 11 is good. The sub lord of the 6* cusp (Service) is 
also Mercury. The sub lordof the 10m cusp is Rahu. Rahu is 
posited in Leo, in the 4" bhava, but Rahu ts in the star of 
Kethu in the 10* house is good. Saturn, Retrograde at the 
time of judgement is in Leo under the influence of Vth Bhava. 


Hence, | come to the conclusion that the Querent must be 
In service, even though there is some disturbances due to 
saturn occupancy of Vth and no indication for jobless is 
indicating in the chart, But, | found some adverse aspects 
also the placement of the sub lord of the 10*cusp Rahu is in 
4 is rather a bad position, to him, as the 4” house ts a opposition 
to 10° house {profession}. 


The dasa lord Kethu and Bhukthi lord Jupiter are also 
connected to houses 10 and 4 and I told him there is a kind of 
opposition is including and you will have to face tough fight 
also, against the management as the significator of 10 and 711 
are as well, connected to 4m (4* is opposition house to 10” 
house). 


At the time of judgement, the Querent was running Kethu 
dasa, Jupiter bhukthi up to 2-10-80. 


Venus anthra operates till 7-6-1980. 


Kethu the dasa lord is in 10 house. As Kethu a 
“Chayagraha” he represents Saturn and Kethu signifies 10 
and 11 and promises professional prospects. 


The Bhukthi lord is Jupiter. Jupiter is lord of 8 and 9 and 
occupied IVth bhava conjoining with Rahu and Mars in Leo. 
Further it is posited in tine star of Kethu and sub of Rahu. 


The anthra lord is Venus. Venus is lord of 1 and 6 inThula, 
Lagna bhava, in the starof Moon, occupant of 12*and Moon 
is lord of IV Venus is tenanted in the sub of Saturn. Retrograde, 


lord of 10 and 11 in 5* house. Hence | had come to the 
conclusion that he will face so many fights as earter said. But 
dasa lord Kethu, certainly denote success after a gallani fight 
with the management as Kethu is in the sub of Venus, lord of 
1 and 6 in lagna bhava. And hence | told he will be confirmed 
in his post. It is assured in the map of Heavens. 

So | informed the Querent that he will be in service and will 
be confirmed to the present post around 18-5-80. 


But the Querent has told me that he has already given 
ousting orders, terminating his temporary service. He also 
showed me the orders. | was rather shocked about this. But 
with the great help and guidance of Our beloved Guruji in my 
mind, | told him that you can make an appeal to the heads of 
department concerned and you will be successful in your 
attempt also. The Querent told me that he will definitely make 
an appeal to the concemed or file a writ petition against the 
management, as he was given notice and terminating for 
service Is unjustice. 


The Querent come to me in the 2nd week of May 1980 and 
told me that he has appealed to his department heads in the 
secretanat and the orders already issued for terminating his 
services was suspended. He has also told me that he was 
allowed to work on the last working day of the calender year 
Le. on 30-4-80 to get the vacation pay also. He thanked very 
much for my accurate and bold predictions even though he 
was In receipt of the ousting order well in advance. 


Such as accurate predictions can possible only thorugh this 
marvellous Krishnamurti Padndhati system only. 


FOREIGN ASSIGNMENT 


Some Organisations in India have branches and operations 
abroad. Postings an foreign countries fetch lotof money apart 
from a lot of fringe benefits and perquisites. One enjoys rare 
facilities which are a not available in India, or even ifthey are 
available they are expensive and prohibitive. Apart from 
monetary value, certain postings abroad command a high 
status nearly equal to Ambassadors, as mostly they represent 
India and Indian culture overseas. 


lf a choice were given to an officer, one of a posting abroad 
and the other a promotion with in India, naturally one would 
long for a foreign assignment. 


One Assistant Manager in an Organisation having a base in 
Maldives Islands approached me on 28-5-90, Monday with 
the question "My name is tipped for Maldives, but there is 
competition for the assignement, , Will | be posted?" He also 
enlightened me that being the senior most in the category of 
Officers, he was expecting the assignment,, but one another 
Officer elsewhere in Calcutta was trying hard for the same 
which could ofcourse be in his favour only ifthe established 
conventions for such postings would be bent in his favour. 
The querent gave me number 101 between 1 and 249. 


| took up the delineation the same day at Madras at 12-05 
pm IST. The cuspal and planetary positions were as follows:

For posting abroad | judged the X cusp Sub lord to see if it 
had any connection strongly suggesting the same. In other 
words X cusp Sub Lord should signify Ill, IX & XII which 
mean change of residence, long journey, and life abroad with 
total change in living circumstances, respectively. 


KAISHNAMURT) PADHDHATI 61 


Here the X cusp Sub Lord is Jupiter. Jupiter is in the X. This 
suggests that the Officer is well placed and commands a lot of 
influence, there being no planet in the stars of Jupiter. Jupiter 
is in the constellation of Rahu. Rahu is in V This is not desirable 
as V suggests, tension and loss, loss especially when you 
have a competitor. Jupiter is in the Sub of Moon in XI, which 
negates affairs of All. All is essential in this query. Moon is a 
feeble significator ofthe XII we have planets tenanting Moon's 
constellations. Furtherto deny the prestigious at lucrative foreign 
assignment the X cusp sub lord occupied the Sub of Moon 
which in turn signifies the V occupying a Saturn star. Saturn is 
retrograde. Thus the X cusp Sub Lon denies foreign posting. 


Let us now see the result of competion. For this we have 
to judge the VI. 


VI cusp Sub Lord is Rahu. To state with Rahu ts in V negating 
the affairs of the query in hand, Le. the VI. Rahu represents 
saturn as it is posted in Capricorn. Added to the negation it 
further worsens the situation being conjoined with Saturn in 
the V. Saturn is retrograde. To make it query clear that there 
is not going to be success the issue, Rahu occupies the Sub of 
saturn. To cap it all the Sub Lord Saturn occupied the 
constellation of Sun in the IA which certainly goes in favour of 
one's opponent competitor. 


| had no hesitation to tell the Officer that he would not be 
favoured with the foreign assignment now. 


Result: 


The officer has since been promoted and posted within 
India. Conventionally, Officer in the lower grade or in the 
querent's while grade only are posted abroad, especially for 
the Maldives Islands. 


CHANGE OF JOB - AS PER 
K.P. & RP 


My friend was working in a factory as an engineer who 
wished for change of job in a prosperous company. As he had 
applied for the same company he was very much anxious to 
know about the same. So, he asked me to give the prediction 
regarding the same, | had analysed the chart of his and said 
that there will be possibility of change of job after 19*Jan.89. 
as Jupiter dasa Venus Bhukti and Moon antara will run from 
19* Jan/89 as Moon is the significator of 4* & 10* in the 4* in 
the star of Mars the lord of 2na 7”. 


As Moon is indicating the 2xl 4* 7* and 10* house denotes 
acquisition ofjob but my friend's question was whether there 
was any change of job. So, | took him to Mr.Pundareesh who 
in fact is having ten years experience in K.P.System. We met 
Mr.Pundareesh and explained him regarding the change of 
job. So, he tooka number within 249. My friend gave 100 for. 
the same. Mr.Pundareesh told that he would write the answers 
in short period. 


At that time | was not having the experience of analyzing 
the chart as per Horary number but | took the work as a trial 
/ experiment.

considered. So, | fixed that he will get change of job in Moon 
dasa who is signifying the 12° , Rahu Bhukti who is signifying 
6* and Sun Antara who is signifying the 1258 &9 house. 


KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 265 


At the time of judgement Jupiter was in retrograde motion 
so, | consider his change of job will be after the expiry of 
retrograde motion of Jupiter who is in Sun star and signifying 
the 1,2,5,8 &9'" house. Moon dasa Rahu Bhukti and Sun 
Antara operated between 4-1-89 & 1-2-1989. 


So, | boldly predicted that he will get change of job between 
4-1-89 and 1-289 particularly soon after 19*Jan'89 on which 
Jupiter will take a direct motion. 


To my Surprise he joined the new company on 19” Jan'89. 


Mr.Pundareesh sentthe prediction through mail after some 
days with details of his analysis. He also predicted that My 
friend will get change of job after 6* Jan’89. 


His analysis made on the same question and Horary number 
100.

Analysis made by Mr.Pundareesh: 


Sub Lord ofthe 10*cusp is Rahu. Rahu is in own star and 
in the sub of Venus. 


Venus is the significator of 1,3,10,11 & 12. Rahu is the 
significator for 6,6,&4. 


None of these two planets Hahu & Venus is the significator 
of 5“ or 9* house which are the houses for the change of|ob 
should be considered. Hence, he may not get change of job 
at present. 


Considering the sub lord of the 11"cusp to know whether 
his ambition will be fulfilled or not. 11% cusp sub lord is Saturn 
who is significator of 4,6,7 &12. So it is against his desire. 
Hence, his ambition will not be materialized. 


Because Saturn is not signifying either 5* or 9* Hence, in 
this case better he forget the change ofjob. 


Considering the dasah, Bhukti. Now Moon dasa ts running. 
Moon is strong significator of 1 &12. Jupiter Bhukti is favourable. 
Because Jupiter signifies 9” & 5*. So, he will get opportunity 
of change of job from 6-1-1989. 


As per Mr Pundaraeesh also the change of job period 
starts from 6* Jan’89 and in my analysis also the change of 
job penod came between 4-1-89 & 1-289 |.e.; in both analysis 
from 4/6* Jan’98 onwards only change job was indicated. 


HORARY - ABROAD - 
WHEN? 


Mr.Suraj Phan Sharma, of Janata Transport, Lakhim Pur 
Khen called at me and enquired whether he will go abroad? If 
so when? 


The question was judged at 530 P.M. on 31-3-68 with the 
Number 96. 


The horoscope is as below:- 
oun 17-34 


fup. 21-28 
Rah 25-53 


Moon 15-39 
Mars 9-17 


Ven 26-20 

Iaer 25-26 

Asc. 16°40 
to 20° 


Jupiter 
3-13 


Balance of Venus = 16-6-9 


Analysis of the chart: 

Moon indicates the mind of the querist. Moon is posited in 
the constellation of Venus, who is lord of 9*. Ninth house 
represents long journeys, sea voyage, air travel etc. This 


connection of Moon with the 9* Bhava, justifies the querist 
mind. 

The houses to be judged are 3,9 and 12. 

Houses 3,9 and 12 are vacant. 


Mars rules Sd house. The constellations under the sway of 
Mars are Mrigasira, Chitra and Dhanishta. Only Kethu is in 
Dhanistha. So Kethu is significator. 


Venus rules 9*. Bharani, Poorva phalguni and Peorvashada 
are the three stars of Venus. Moon is posited in Bharani and 
the other stars of Venus remain unoccupied. 


12" house is ruled by Saturn. Pushyam, Anuradha and 
Uttraphadra are the triple stars of Saturn. No planet is posited 
in any of these stars. So Satum is strong. 


Thus Kethu, Moon and Saturn are strong significators. Mars 
and Venus come next. 


Will he go abroad? 


For this we should look to the 12*cusp. Gd cusp shows 
that one will be away from his permanent place of residence. 
9* cusp indicated duration of the long journey. 12° cusp shows 
arrival and life in foreign place. The 12*cusp falls in sign of 
Satum (Capricorn), star of Moon and subs of Saturn, Mercury 
and Kethu. Saturn and Mercury are not retrograde. Kethu 
though a natural retrograde is a strong significator for abroad. 
Kethu, being situated in the sign of Mercury, represents 
Mercury. Thus the 12* cusp is strongly connected with the 
planets, representing his journey abroad. So it is declared with 
confidence that the querist will definitely go abroad. 


But When? 


At the time of judgement balance of Venus Dasa is 16 
years 6 months and 9 days. Sun Bhukthi in Venus Dasa started 
on 10-2-1968 and will expire on 10-2-1969. Sun Is posited in 
the star of Mercury, lord of 8. Further Sun is not a significator, 
so upto 10-2-1969, the question of your going abroad does 
not arise. 


KRISHNAMURTL PADHDEATI 269 


From 10-2-1969, Bhukti of Moon starts. Moon is conjoined 
with 3°° house lord and aspects the 9th house. Moon also is a 
strong significator. So during the Bhukthi of Moon lasting for 
20 months you will definitely go abroad. 


In which Anthra? 


The sub of the 12* cusp is strongly connected with Satum 
and Kethu. Either it could be Satum Anthra Kethu shookshma 
or Kethu Anthra Saturn Shookshma. When he will go Satum 
Anthra Kethu shooksnma will be fromm 23-11-1969 to 29-11- 
1969 and Kethu Anthra, Satum Shookshma will be from 19-5- 

1970 to 25-35-1970, 


During the first period (23-11-1969 to 29-11-1969), the 
luminary Sun will be transitting in the sign Scorpio, ruled by 
Mars and constellation of Saturn. Mars and Saturn are 
significators. So this is the fruitful period. 


Again during the second alternative (19-5-70 to 25-5-70) 
the Sun will be passing in the sign Taurus, ruled by Venus and 
in the constellation of Moon. Both Venus and Moon are 
significators. This is also the period when he can go. 


Decision: 
Of the tow altemative periods which to choose? 


At the time of judgement Moon is situated in the sign Aries, 
ruled by Mars. Venus and Moon have nothing to do with the 
ruling planets at the time of judgement day Sunday, Moon 
sign Aries, star lord Kethu, lagna Virgo, though both of them 
are strong significators. So it is decided that when Sun will 
transit in the sign Scorpio (ruled by Mars, the ruling planet at 
the time of judgement), he will go abroad. This penod will be 
from 23-11 -1969 to 29-11 -1969. 


TRANSFER - WHEN? 


Shri Devi Ram Sharma; Nail Nazir; Process serving agency: 
Seraj-Tehsil; Dist.Kulu (H.P.) puta query on 21-7-68; Sunday, 
at 5-30 P.M.; IST at 31°36’ North and 77° East Longitude - 
Nature of the query - transfer'- It is unknown- When? 


Number mentioned by the querist whihin (249) - 77. 
Note: - 


Any figure within 108 would do , butto be more precise in 
the determination of the various cusps of 12 houses in the 
Horary Chart and in order to avoid various planet ruling the 
same cusp of the Rising sign as sub-lords figure within 249 
was preferred so that there was only one sub lord ruling the 
cusp of rising sign according tothe number given by the querist. 


Now, Horary chart was cast as per Advanced Stellar system 
advocated by our Hon’ble Guruji. Cusps of 12 houses were 
determined according to the principles of Krishnamurti Padhdhati 
given by the Editor elaborately in his world famous magazine 
"Astrology & Athrishta" August issue, 1968, at pages 37-39. 


Now figure 77 within 249 shows Rising sign = 19° Cancer 
20'to 21°33' 20". Other cusps were determined according to 
the principles using Raphael Tables of houses for the place 
of query and deducting Krishnamurti Ayanamsa = 23°19" chart 
Is given here: 


Planets Star Lord Sub Lord 


Sun Sani Sani 
Moon Moon Kethu 
Mars Guru Venus 
Mercury  Rahu Moon 
Jupiter Kethuq  Budha 
Venus Sani Rahu 


Saturn Kethu Venus 


Rahu Budha Venus 
Kethu Moon Kethu 


Moon Mer 18.10 
20.25 Mars 76.46 


Guru 12.43 


Neptune ee 5 


30 Kethu 19.58 


Moon Dasa Balance at Query 2 yrs. 2 mts. 7 days. 


Now, according to Krishnamurti Padhdhati, for transfer, 
houses 3,10,12 are to be considered. 


(} 37 house is occupied by Kethu. Moon and Kethu occupy 
the sub of Kethu. Hence Moon and Kethu are significators. 
Kethu by virtue of being occupant of Sra house has also become 
significators. Moreover, lord of cusp of 3” house is Mercury. 
Kethu is in Virgo sign ruled by Mercury and hence instead of 
Mercury we are to take Kethu. This shows that Kethu, by 
way of three qualifications has become a strong significator: 


(ii} Tenth house is vacant: 

(iii}12* house is occupied by three planets, viz, Sun, Venus, 
Mars. There is no planet either in the constellations of Sun 
and Mars or in their subs. Mars, Saturn, Rahu are in the sub 
of Venus. Hence Mars, Saturn and Rahu are the significators. 


KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 278 
Judgement: 


Now, the Ascendant falls in Cancer sign-a movable sign 
which is in conformity with the nature of the question 
(movement-change of place}. Also, lord of Rising sign is Moon, 
occupying 11* house showing that the querist will have a 
favourable reply from the Astrologer. 


Also, Moon, Kethu, Mars, Satum and Rahu are strong 
significators to cause transfer as shown above. Surprisingly 
enough, Moon occupies the sub of Kethu and in the star of 
Moon there is Kethu. Hence Moon and Kethu are inter-related 
and both of them have also become strong significators to 
cause transfer. 


At the moment of query the querist was under the main 
period of Moon for 2 yrs. 2 months, 7 days and the sub 
period of Kethu for 0 year 0 month 7 days only. Moon gives 
at once being fastest moving planet. Hence | declared that 
the querist "Will be transferred in Kethu’s sub period ie., 
within 7 days from 21-7-1968" and take charge in Venus sub. 


Actually, the querist received transfer orders on 22-7-1968 
(Monday ruled by Moon, Mrigasirisha star ruled by Mars); 
Moon was passing though Gemini ruled by Mercury (Kethu 
represented Mercury). He reported for duty on 30-7-1968 
(Tuesday ruled by Mars}; Hastha star ruled by Moon; Moon 
was passing through Virgo ruled by Mercury (Kethu represented 
Mercury). Kethu's sub period expired on 28-7-1968 wherefrom 
Venus's sub period ruled. Venus, being occupant of 12* house, 
gave the querist a new surrounding in its Bhukti (operated 
from 28-7-1968). 


All those confirmed the correctness of Knshnamurti Padhdhati 
word by word. 


Panic Mongers At all Ages 

Though intellectuals do not pleasure in creating panic among 
the people, yet they overestimate themselves and are sure 
that they will ever be correct; so they come forward and 


274 AULING PLANT 


announce such information which will threaten and cause even 
blood pressure or at least giddiness or uneasiness in many 
readers. 


There is instances wherein the medical experts whispered 
in the ears of the cbse relatives and friends of patients in 
critical situation that they could cable,tetephone, telegram etc., 
and invite all those interested in seeing the patients before 
cremation or in paying the last respects to them, whereas the 
patients surprisingly survivied. | heard one instance which others 
also may know. One expert physician was ill. The medical 
attendant on him informed the patient's children that in a few 
minutes he would breathe his last. Due to the patient's luck, 
he survived. A few months passed. The doctor who attended 
upon the patient, fell ill. He who got cured, attended on him. 
Both the patient and the doctor were sure of his survival due 
to favourable prognostication. But he passed away suddenly. 
This instance shows that there is a limitation to our intellect 
knowledge or wisdom. Something else, unknown and un seen 
by us operates. That is why it is said that “Man proposes,God 
disposes." A lady asks it is true in our case also; so the lady 
says “Lady proposes, God disposes." But | say "One proposes; 
Destiny disposes". According to me "Fate comes first; God 
next". 


Now on 29-8-1968 in the daily News papers we could see 
the following matenal published. 


Sun Explosion Forecast: 
Dundee: Scotland, August, 1928. 


some day the Sun is going to explode and when it does, 
the only way to avert the earth will be to move it out of the 
way. 


Astronomer and mathematician lan Roxburgh, who forecast 
the explosion at the British Association for the advancement 
of science here yesterday said before the final blast, the Sun 
would burn 10,000 times brighter than it did now and expand 
to 400 times its present size." 


KRISHNAMUATT PADHDHATI 275 


This astronomer is, indeed, dever. He has said "Some day 
the Sun is going to explode". This "Some day may be so 
many millions of years later’. At that time neither the 
astronomer, nor we will be living to witness and offer him 
"Nobel Prize" if his words come true. Again, is it possible to 
move the earth away from such a scorching Sun. All these 
Statements are like passing clouds. So none need entertain 
any fear. 


One can understand that in all ages, there were astronomers 
and mathematicians who announced their findings after their 
strenuous research and nothing had come true. If any one of 
them would have been proved to be true; the earth cannot 
exist now. We would not be living in this age. 


1) You may remember that an Italian astronomer predicted 
that the world would end, 4 years back. He went up the hill to 
take shelter. Nothing happened. 


2) A few quacks predicted that 8 planets configuration will 
do unpredictable damage in February, 1962: nothing happened. 


lf we refer "Popular Astronomy" we can find that a leamed 
Astyronomer who was the Director of an University said that 
one planet would emerge out from Sun. There must be an 
explosion. The heat would be tremendous. All living beings 
would be bumt to ash. We are to know, when his expectation 
would come to pass. 


There was a great astronomer in RAS He threatened 
saying that Sun will collide with one celestial body and the latter 
will be reduced to gaseous state and this will destroy the Earth. 


Another professor said that due to 6 planets configuration 
(according to them) the Solar system will be disturbed, when 
(December, 1919) all of us would be destroyed. 


Austria had produced a gem who created panic by saying 
that the world could not exist after 13-11-1899. Thus hundreds 
of instances given out by the astronomers can be reproduced. 
Mind you, none came to pass. But they alone passed away. 


Now, let us refer to what is said in Bhagavatham in the 
Chapter titled "Sruti". Then we come to the conclusion: 

1} Nothing can happen to the earth for millions of years to 
come. 


2) As ususal, God creates and destroys and we will be born 
and dead, again born and dead, till we unite with the creator. 


Therefore one need not pay heed to the statements of 
this type. Ever be bold: go-a-head-mind your business with 
peace and pleasure. What is going to happen must happen. 
None can change fate-none can dodge destiny. 


Thus mental solace and mental strength can be given only 
by astrologers. Astrology is also a psycho-theraphy. Astrology 
does not give incorrect information. It brings out truth. Truth 
is God. Hence astrology is divine science explaining the divine 
plan. 


Learn astrology. To know the truth #ead Krishnamurii 
Padhdhati wherein boldly truth is brought out and honestly the 
failures in traditional ones are mentioned and confessed. 


Good Luck to all of you.

Nature of Query 


Invariably Moon indicates the mind. This rule does not fail! 
In your case Moon ts in the constellation of Venus. 


Venus owns houses 4 and 17 and occupies 2 nd. You have 
asked the question about marriage. But Moon's position shows 
that you have something more {in your mind) to ask about 
A* house matters (Vehicle, furniture, land, flat, etc.) The 
houses 2 and 17 plus Venus (Chief govemor of marriage) 
denote marriage. But what about 4" house? 


Moon sign is afflicted by Saturn. When ever matefics (by 
nature or by owning 6 or 8 or 12) are associated with Moon at 
the time of query, the querist's mind will not be clear. Further if 
saturn is associated with Moon it denotes that the querist Is 
hiding something in his mind. (Saturn govems secrecy.) 


In the present case also Saturn and Moon are in the same 
sign and the querist is hiding something. He must be hiding 
something about 4" house matters as Venus, the lord ofthe 
constellation in which Moon is tenanted, is also the lord on 4" 
house. 4th house denotes land, flat, vehicle, furniture, etc. 


Therefore the complete question must be about marriage 
plus gain of some residential flat, vehicle, furniture, money 
(houses 2 and 11), etc. The native agreed this. 


KRISHNAMURTI PADHDHATI 279 
Is Marriage promised? 

The sub lord of the 7* cusp decides whether marriage is 
promised or not. If the sub lord is a significator then marriage 


is promised. Otherwise not. The same tule is to be extended 
to the sub-sub. 


In your case the 7* cusp is 16°40’ Capricorn, ie. Satum 
sign, Moon star Saturn sub and Venus sub sub. The sub lord 
of 7* cusp, Saturn is the owner of 7" house and also aspects 
7” house by its 10° aspect. But it is retrograde. Because 
saiurn owns 7” house. It is a significator of marriage. But as 
itis retrograde it delays, it negates something. The sub lord in 
your case does not give immediately the result. Let us go to 
the sub sub. It is owned by Venus. (For sub sub please refer 
to Astrology and Athrishta of October 1968.) It is the Chief 
Governor of marriage. Further Venus Is in tts own constellation 
and sub. Itoccupies 2nd Bhava and owns 11 *. As such itis a 
strong significator of marriage and therefore marriage is 
promised. 


Time of Marriage 


Fa this judge houses 2,7 and 11. (The calculations could 
not be worked out immediately after the query as | had no 
time. They are actually further worked out On 8-9-1968 at 9- 
00 P.M. 1.8.T,) 


Significators 

end Bhava is occupied by Jupiter and Venus. No Planet is in 
the constellation of Jupiter. Rahu occupies Jupiter's sign Pisces. 
Therefore whatever Jupiter has to give will be given more 
strongly by Rahu. Further Venus, Jupiter and Moon are one in 
the constellations of Venus. Therefore take Venus, Jupiter, 
Moon and Rahu. 


7* house is unoccupied. Saturn owns it. Mars is posited in 
the constellation of Saturn. Take Mars. 


No Planet occupies 11* Bhava. Venus owns it. Venus has 
already been covered above. 


Therefore Venus, Jupiter, Moon, Rahu and Mars are the 
signiticators of Marriage. As the significators are more in number 
let us find out the ruling planets at the moment of judgement, 
le. at 900 PM, LST. on 8-9-68. 


Ruling Planets 


Day is Sunday owned by Sun. Moon ts in Pisces owned by 
Jupiter. Rahu is tenated in the sign Pisces and therefore take 
Rahu in preference to Jupiter. Moon is transitting Uttarpadrapada 
constellation owned by Saturn. The lagna is Aries owned by 
Mars and Lagna's constellation is Bharani owned by Venus. 


The common planets of the significators and the ruling 
planets are Rahu, Venus and Mars (Rahu is stronger than 
Jupiter. ) 


Mars Is a planet in the constellation of Saturn, a retrograde 
planet. Planets in the constellation of retrograde planet appear 
to give results but ultimately fall through. Therefore Mars 
appears to give result but ultimately it will not give. Reject 
Mars. 


Therefore the planets which will actually bring about your 
marriage and Venus and Rahu only. 


In Venus Dasa, Rahu Bhukti has already started on 21 -1 - 
1967 In Rahu Bhukti, Venus Anthra operates between 24-12- 
1968 and 24-6-1969. You are ta marry sorme where in this 
period. 


Let us consider transit to pin-point the exact date. Venus 
transit Rahu star during the last week of December 1968 and 
first week of January 1969. Jupiter, during this period, transit 
Rahu and Jupiter subs. Further during this penod Sun transits 
Jupiter sign, Venus star, Rahu sub on 3-1-1969. Hence you will 
marry on 3-1-1969 positively. 


Will he get money, FlatCar, Furniture, etc.? 


Whenever the 4" cusp sub lord ts Venus it denotes either 
gain of furniture or ornaments or vehicle depending upon this 


KRISHNAMURIL PADHDHATI 201 


sign occupied a movable siqn or a common sign it denotes 
gain of vehicle. ff, on the other had, it occupies a fixed sign 
gain of furniture and ornaments is promised. Further if the 
sub lord of 4* cusp is Mars then it promises gain of house or 
flat or land. 


In your case the 4m cusp is in Libra 150 14'ie. it is in the 
constellation of Rahu and sub of Venus. Venus, in your chart, 
occupies Leo sign which is a fixed sign. Therefore you will not 
get vehicle but will surely get ornaments and furniture. Further 
as Venus is owner of 2d and 11%* houses and occupant of 2nd 
you will get money also . 


As the 4” cusp sub lord is not Mars gain of flat or house is 
denied. 


(Editor's Note:- ON 15-8-1968, Saturn was conjoined with 
Moon, ie lord of 1 and 7 in conjunction. | had, on many 
occasions, said that conjunction of Moon and Satum is called 
Punarphoe and attempts are to be made again. Here, even 
to predict he had to do it, on a later date. Invariably whenever 
Moon and Saturn conjoin one will negotiate and proceed with a 
party: Itwill fall through if Saturn is retrograde and the second 
attempt made atone will materialize.)

Kethu is in 11* house indicating elder brother. Moon in sub of

(Jupiter is lord of 7 in the constellation of lord of 2 counted 


from 11* house.) 


KRISHNAMUATI PADHDHATI 283 
Whether Marriage is promised or not? 


For marriage we have to consider houses second, seventh 
and 11*. So we have to consider 2nd, 7* and 11%* houses 
from 11* house, te. 12th, 5th, and 9th. 


To see whether one will marry or not is shown by the 7?’ 
cusp, sub-lord. So take 7“ cusp from 117% house, ie, 5’ 
CUSD. 


5* cusp falls in Pisces ruled by Jupiter. Constellation is ruled 
by retrograde Satum and sub is ruled by Rahu and Jupter. 
Rahu is in Jupiter's sign and as such very powerful. Rahu is 
directly on 5* cusp and hence mariage is promised. It will be 
under the influence of Rahu. As Saturn ® is also in 5* house it 
will delay the marriage. Let us find outthe planets in 12th, 5 
th and 9 th houses counting from Horary Lagna {and not 
from 11%,} 


House 12th is unoccupied. 
House 5 th is occupied by Rahu and Saturn ®. 
House 9th is occupied by Moon Mars. 


No Planet is in the constellation of Rahu and Satum ®. 
Kethu is in Hastha ruled by Moon and Mercury and Venus in 
Chitra ruled by Mars. Significators are Rahu, Saturn ®, Kethu, 
Mercury and Venus. 


Here Kethu is stronger than Mercury as it is in the sign of 
Virgo ruled by Mercury. 


Rahu, Saturn ® , Kethu and Venus are significators. Kethu 
Dasa, Satum Bhukti starts on 24* September, 1968. Select 
Ranhu Anthra as Rahu is in the cusp of 5° house. 


Rahu Anthra will rule in the period from 9* July to 9* 
september, 1969. Select Rahu Shookshma. Though Venus Is 
a significator tt aspects Rahu and Hahu is also the sub lord and 
sign lord (Jupiter) of 5" cusp. 


This périod will rule from 9* July to 18" July, 1969. When 
Sun transits in Mercury sign Gemini ruled by Mercury 
represented by Kethu (Dasa lord) and in the constellation of 
Jupiter (Rahu)} Anthra lord and sub of Satum the result will 
take place. 


When Sun, 9* and 10% July, 1969, will be in the sub of 
saturn, the mariage will take place. 


WHEN WILL MY FINANCIAL 
WORRY BE OVER AND 
WHAT FOLLOWS? 


"Sir, | would like to know when | can get over my financial 
trouble. | have enough of stocks on hand. My mills produce 
fast. Products do not move equally fast."

"Yes, yes."

"78 Gomes to my mind." 


"According to my method 78 means, Moon's sign Cancer, 
Mercury star Aslesha and sub Sun sub 21°33°20" Nirayana

sale of proceeds and to gain thereby ts indicated by the 
significators of the houses 3 and 11, as 4* house denotes 
possessions and 3” house indicates parting with possessions. 
11" house indicates profit. Only when there is a profit, beneficial 
aspect of 2ng house, bank position will improve. But ifthe 12% 
house significator operates, one loses not only what he 
possesses or produces at a cost and sells away at a lower 
price. 


Therefore first judge whether the significator of the 3rd 
house is connected with 11 or 12 or both. 3 and 11 means 
profit: 3 and 12, loss; 3, 11 and 12 means, the Gd cusp is in 
the sub of Mercury or lord ofthe cusp is in a dual sign. 


Sra house commences at 20°36" Virgo and extends up to 
22°36’. 20°36" Virgo menas, it is in Moon star Venus sub. 
Venus Is in the earthy fixed sign. Hence, either there can be 
only loss or only gain depending on the significators of 11 * 
house.

11™* house extends from 23°36 Taurus to 22°36' Gemini. 
Mercury and Sun are deposited in 11. Mercury star is not 
occupied by any. Kethu will act as its agent.

Rahu acts as agent of Jupiter. 


Hence Moon, Jupiter, Mercury, Kethu,. Rahu and Sun. 


He is entering into Moon dasa on 10-7-69. The following

1. Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti Rahu Anthra and Jupiter Anthra. 


2. Moon Dasa Moon Bhukti Mercury Anthra onwards the 
goods will be moving . During Mars sub-period of 7 months 
there will be stagnation. 


Only from February 71 , continuously there will be movement 
of goods. Money will be realized. 


As Rahu ts in 8, in Jupiter's star Rahu sub, all overdraft 
facilities will be cleared and one's own money will be accumulating 
in the bank from Moon Dasa Rahu Bhukti Guru Anthra Rahu 
shookshma, ie. May 1971. Thereafter, for nearly 30 months, 
speedy turnover larger profits and absolute satisfaction.

Luckily after these 19 months for years, the production the

FRIENDS ARRIVAL 


On 6* July, 1970. Late in the night, | was sitting with one of 
my friends discussing Krishnamurti Horary Astrology. At this 
juncture, | wanted to have a small talk with another friend of 
mine. So | sent words to him. In the meanwhile my friend, 
who was sitting with me was anxious to Know whether, he will 
come or not, and asked me to predict the time of arrival of 
the friend. 


Immediately, | asked him to quote a number within 249. 
He gave it as 50. 


Time of Judgement: 10-05 PM LST. 
Place of Judgement: Davangere. 


Number 50 means Gemini-Mercury sign: Arudra-Rahu star- 
Mercury sub 12°33’-20"to 14°26°-40", " 


Take the commencement of the Sub. This is in Nirayana 
position. Add Ayanamsa for this date which is 23°20". Then 
Sayana Ascendent wilt be 5°53’-20° Cancer. 


Latitude of place of judgement is 14°31’. Take Raphael's 
table of houses and refer for Latitude 15° which is nearer to 
14°31". Then note down the Sayana cusps of 2nd, 3rd, 10%, 
11* and 12* houses. Add 180° to each and calculate the 
other 6 cusps. 


Deduct Ayanamsa to convert to Nirayana position. Then 
enter in the figure. 


Calculate the position of Planets for 10-05 PM. LST. on 6- 
7-1970 by taking the position given for 5-380 PM. on 6-7-70

Nole the 11* cusp. Ifthe Sub-lord is either retrograde or 
deposited in the constellation of a planet in retrograde motion, 
the friend's arrival is not promised. In the present chart 11 * 
cusp falls in ARIES 90-26. Ruller of the sign is MARS. Lord of 
the constellation is Kethu and Sub-Lord is SATURN. SATURN, 
the Sub-Lord is posited in 11* ,who is neither retrograde not 
deposited in the constellation of a planet In retrograde motion. 


KRISHNAMUATI PADHUDHATI 291 


Besides this Lord of the Lagna and 11” Lord is in Lagna-bhava 
aspected by JUPITER, a natural benefic, so his coming is 
definite- very certain. 


Find out the significators of 1*and 11* Bhava as per 
Krishnamurti Padhdhati. 1*Cusp extends form GEMINI 120- 
33'-20" to CANCER70-40°.. MERCURY, SUN & MARS are the 
occupants. The planets in the constellation of Mercury are 
Moon & Venus. No planet is in Sun's constellation. Jupiter is in 
Mars constellation. So the siqnifictors are Moon, Venus, Jupiter, 
Sun, Mercury & Mars. Ruler of the 1st cusp is Mercury. The 
planet in Mercury constellation is discussed above. 


11* cusp extends from Aries 90-26' to Taurus 120-26’, 
Saturn is the occupant. No planet is in Saturn constellation. 
50 Saturn is a significator. Ruler ofthe 11 cusp is Mars. The 
planets in the constellation of Mars has already been discussed. 


The ruling planets @ the moment of judgement are: 


Day Lord : Moon 
Star Lord : Mercury 
Sign Lord : Moon 


Lagna Lord: Saturn 
Lagna Star Lord: Rahu 


For minor events which are to happen in few minutes or in 
few hours one has to note down the point in the Zodiac to rise 
in the east, when the strong significatos conjointly operate. 


The point in the Zodiac to rise in the east, at the time of 
friends’ arrival should be Saturn Sign-Rahu Star-Moon Sub i.e. 
180-6'40" to 190'13'-20" Aquarius. Out of this select Mercury 
Sub Sub ie. 180-4533" to 180-54'-59" Aquarius. The Sayana 
ascendant would be 120-05'-33"to 120'14'-59" Pisces. Refering 
to the Raphael's table of houses for 150 North Latitude note 
down the sidereal time and then convert to Indian Standard 
Time. The 1.8.T. will be 10-31 p.m. So I predicted that the 
friends’ arrival will be 10-31 p.m. 


As predicted the friend arrived sharp at 10-31 PM. 


MUHURTHAM WHEN? 


One of my office friends visited me today. He came with a 
girl's horoscope and wanted me to go through it for mariage 
porutham. It was not a surprise to me as | was aware that 
there were many marriage proposals to him. The chart was 
cast according to the Panchanga method. They had used the 
Ragunatha hyer Panchanga which do not always give the 
correct positions of the planets. | was reluctant to proceed 
any further on this fragile chart. He requested me to cast it 
correctly and to proceed further. | declined to do so due to 
lack of time and for several other reasons. Any how | checked 
ton horary too and requested him to continue with the proposal 
irespective of a very few defects. 


| encouraged with the same statement which | gave to him 
about an year ago that he would get married in Venus dasa 
Venus bukthi. The number given by him below 249 Is 89. The 
day and time of judgement are 630 PM. ©.S.T. on 10-7-1970,

Moon indicates the nature of the query: 

Moon lord of 12” is in 2nd. 12* house shows separation, 
moving into different environment and new faces etc. ad 
house denotes an addition to the family, finance, education 
etc. Moon is in the sign of Mercury, lord of ad and 11% in 11"; 
in the star and sub of Moon too, 11* house denotes gain or 
pleasure. Hence the nature of the query is clearly shown by 
Moon. 


Is Marriage promised? 

Look at the 7* cusp. Itis in Mars star Moon sub. If the sub 
lord of the 7* cusp Is a significator of marriage, then mamage 
is promised, otherwise not. Here, Moon is the significator of 
2 . Hence mamiage is promised. 


Analysis of the Chart: 
For marriage consider house 2,7 and 11. 


end house is occupied by Moon. Consider the planets in the 
sub of Moon. Venus and Moon are in the sub of Moon. Hence 
Venus and Moon are strong significators. 


7* house is occupied by Rahu. Select the planets in the sub 
of Rahu. Only Mars ts in the sub of Rahu. Hence Mars Is a 
strong significator. 


11™* house is occupied by Sun, Mercury and Mars. Select 
the planets in the sub of above planets. Satum and Mercury 
are in the sub of Sun. Sun and Kethu are in the sub of Mercury. 
No Planet is in the sub of Mars. Hence Saturn, Sun Mercury 
and Kethu are strong significators. 


Now the significators that give marriage are Venus, Moon, 
Mars, Saturn, Mercury, Sun and Kethu. 
How to select the fruitful ones from the above? 


Select the planets that are in the houses of marnage , i.e. 
2,7 and 11.Hence Moon, Sun, Mercury and Mars are fruitful 


KRISHNAMUAT! PADHDHATI 295 


significators to give marriage. Hence marriage will take place in 
Moon dasa Moon bukthi Sun anthra or Mercury anthra. 


"Will you please fix the correct anthra period?" my friend 
interrupted. 


"Yes. twill be done. | prefer Sun anthra period." 
"Wihy 2?" 


sun and Mercury are in the same sign ruled by Mercury 
and in the same star of Jupiter. But note the sub positions. 
They are different. According to their sub positions, Mercury 
becomes a strong signifiacator of lagna, ie. 12 to 2h; while 
sun is a strong significator of 2nd and 11*. Hence | prefer and 
select Sun as the anthra lord, So it will be between 5-2-1971 
and 20-2-1971.

295 RULING PLANT 
"Can you enlighten me about the partner?" 


The sub lord Moon ts in Mercury sign Moon star Moon sub. 
Hence she should have been born (a) on Wednesday or 
Monday (b) lagna would be governed by Moon or Mercury (c} 
birth star too will be governed by Moon or Mercury. Some of 
these will be definitely found in her chart. 


My friend was surprised to hear this as the horoscope of 
this girl showed that she was born on Wednesday and the 
lagna was Kanya. 


“You may or may not reject this girl but it is your fate that 
you have to get married to one of the girls who satisfies the 
above conditions. It is inevitable and you cannot dodge your 
fate. 


Here, four planets, namely Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury 
retrograde in this chart. 


Many had predicted that he would get married in Kethu 
dasa. Few had predicted that he would never get married for 
many reasons. Kethu dasa had passed and Venus dasa started 
but marriage did not manifest. 


Is marriage promised? 


Note the 7* cusp. Itis in Kethu star Sun sub. Sun is the 
lord of 7* besides being the strong significator of 2nd. Hence 
marriage is promised. 


Whenever Saturn aspects Venus or Moon, the mariage will 
be delayed or will take place late in life. Here Saturn aspects 
both Venus and Moon. Here the marriage ts delayed and not 
denied. 


Analysis of the birth chart: 
For marriage, consider the houses 2, 7, and 11. 
2nd house is occupied by Mars. Jupiter, Rahu and Sun are 


on Mars Star. Lord of 2° is Jupiter. Kethu is on Jupiter star. 
Hence Jupiter, Rahu, Sun, Mars and Kethu are significators. 


KAISHNAMURT) PADHDHAT| eos 


7" house is occupied by Rahu. Mercury ts on Rahu star. Its 
lord is Sun. Saturn is on Sun star. Hence Mercury, Rahu, Saturn 
and Sun are significators. 


11%* house is vacant. Its lord is Jupiter. It is discussed 
earlier. 


Now the significators are Jupiter, Rahu, Mercury, Mars, 
Kethu, Sun and Saturn. 


But Rahu governs Sun and Mars while Kethu governs Satum 
and Jupiter, 


Therefore the strong significators of mamiage are Hahu 
and Kethu besides Mercury. As Mercury is on the star of 
Rahu and aspected by Rahu, even though it retrogrades, it 
may be considered to produce weak results. 


"You too had come to dead-lock point as others. Kethu 
period had passed away and when Rahu comes | will not be 
alive", he interrupted. 


"Yes. You are also blindly following like the traditional 
astrologers. If the results do not manifest openly and easily, 
you condemn this system. When they cannot understand the 
principles and application, they condemn KP. What is the use 
of memorizing the slokas and Kavis? Merely you are cheating 
the public and finally yourself. Ifyou fail in an examination, do 
you condemn the examiner or the question papers? You should 
be condemned for your poor performance. What is the use 
of boasting that you are widely read and in possession of a 
vast library of books on Astrology, when your prediction is not 
worth even 10 Cents. Do notjudge other systems according 
to your inability. Try to understand KP. of course no sicka, 
combinations or yogas to memonse and cheat others; grasp 
the theories and principles correctly; digest it properly; do not 
throw out or vomit forthe simple reason that you are used to 
only traditional methods. Then only you will unders‘ and this 
noble Science and you will admit that KP. is too simple to 
practice for correct and thrilling predictions’. 


2968 HAULING PLANT 


Now we will come to the subject proper as to why | said 
that you will get maried in Venus dasa Venus bukthi. Note 
Mars a strong significator of marriage is retrograding in 2rd. 
But Venus and Mars are on the same star Mercury and Sub 
Venus. Hence Mars will give the same results as that of Venus 
and vice versa. Therefore Venus becomes or turns out to be 
a strong significator. No planet is in the star of Venus toa. 
Henoe Venus, Rahu, and Kethu during their conjoined period 
will give marriage. So you will get marmied in Venus dasa Venus 
Bhukthi Kethu anthra Le. between 5-1-1971 and 15-3-19771. 
The Sookshma period will be governed by Rahu and it will be 
between 4-2-1971 and 15-2-19771. 


Good Luck.

According to Prof. Krishnamurti, one will tap water from the 
well if the sublord of the 11 %* cusp or the lord of the star in 
which the sub-lord of the 11 * cusp is situated, is posited in a 
watery sign. If it is in a barren sign, one cannot tap water. 
Further ifthe sub-lord is posited in the constellation of Moon, 
Venus or Mercury one will tap water quickly. 


The position of the Moon and its connection with other 
planets will decide the time and the quantity of water available. 


Moon is posited in the constellation of Rahu and sub of 
Jupiter. Jupiter aspects Moon and Rahu acts as an agent of 
Saturn, as he is posited in Aquarius. Therefore continuous 
supply of water will be available, but the quantity will be 
insufficient. As Rahu and Saturn are connected with moon, 
the water will be polluted and blackish. 


The event is fortified by Moon, Rahu, Saturn, Jupiter and 
Venus. As the querist is now running Rahu dasa Saturn Bhukt 
Venus Anthra, and as quick result is denoted by the 
constellation lord Venus, the time ts fixed by the Sun's transit 
on the signifying combination of the event.

Hence the fructifying combination selected is Jupiter, Saturn 
and Venus. This position is between 338°6' to 340°20' in the 
Zodiac. Sun transit's this position on 23-3-70 


As regards the depth at which water would be available, 
the chief planets who assure supply of water are Moon, Juptier 
and Saturn, whose total number of dasa penod amounts to 
45 years. Taking a scale of 1 ft. depth per year, as said by 
Prof. K.S.K. in his lecture it was predicted that water would be 
available at a depth of about 45 feet from the Ground level. 


Hence it was declared that the querist will get continuous 
but insufficient quantify of polluted and a bit brackish water on 
23-3-70 Monday. 


To the profound surprise of us, we received a letter from 
the querist on 30-3-70, from Bangalore expressing his happiness 
as he was able to getthe water, a little brackish from th well at 
a depth of 45 feet exactly as predicted on the basis of Prof. 
Kishnamurti’s Method, which elaborates all the required guidance 
to predict correctluy. If bacteriological test is done, itwill show 
the growth of Lactose Fermenters. If Chemical test ts done, 
there will be such a total solid above 100 parts per million -the 
permissible limit, and the water will show high figure for hardness

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

Founder Knishnamurtt was in favour of using 


1. His own Aynamsa 


2. Raphael's Table of Houses 
3. A reliable Ephemeris giving the day to day positions of 
planets 


4. Besides that, log-table to calculate the position of planets 
given in "Advanced Ephemeris" by Sir Balasundaram has 


been used. 


The above book and Ayanamsa have been used in the 
calculations. It is my own experience that seventy five percent 
of my calculations have been proved absolutely correct and 
the rest twenty five percent have gone wrong due to 


1. Aynamsa other than Krishnamurti Padhdhati 


2. Different Ephemeris and tables of houses (except TOH 
and advanced Ephemens. 


304 
Disposition of the sub lords : 


Fa any question, we have to first scrutinize the sub lord of 
the required house cusp and its disposition. The sub lord of 
the required house cusp must signify the relevant houses, 
otherwise there iS no promise of fructification of the matter. 
Therefore the cusp sub lord should occupy. 


1. The constellation the lord of which occupies {first rate 
significator) or owns (second rate significator) the relevant 
house. 


2. The sub of a planet occupying or owning the relevant 
house. 


3. The cusp lord himself should occupy the required house 
or own it, or connected to it by association or aspect. 


Disposition of Dasalord, Bhukti lord and Anthra lord : 


1. The dasa lord may signify a number of houses by virtue 
of ruling a house or houses and occupying another and again 
by placement in the constellation of a planet owning certain 
other houses and occupying a house other than those 
considered so far. It may also represent some other house(s) 
by aspect and association with their lords. The lord of the sub 
occupied by the dasa lord should be a fruitful significator as 
said above, otherwise the dasa lord would be in effective. 
Similarly, the Bhukthi lord and anthra lord should be considered 
for their singificators. When the dasa lord/ Bhukthi lord /anthra 
lords co-opeate with each other, that is to say by signifying 
houses in common, then the event comes to pass when the 
Significators pass in the sensitive parts of the zodiac co-ruled 
by the significaotrs. In other words, we may say the transits 
should agrée in nature. The dasa lord, Bhukthi lord and anthra 
lord should transit such constellations and subs the lords of 
which should signify the matters under study.

Mercury dasa / Moon Bhukti / Mercury anthra is upto 17-7-81. 


4, Ruling Planets : 


a. Day Lord Venus 
b. Moon sign lord Jupiter 
c. Moon Star Lord Mercury (R) 
d. Moon sub lord Moon 


e. Ascendant sign Lord Moon 
f. Ascendant star Lord Mercury (R) 
g. Ascendant Sub lord Saturn 


The Moon reflects the Mind : 


Transfer which only involves a change of position at the 
same place comes under the houses 5, 6, and 10. If it also 
involves change of station, the 3m and 9” would also be 
influenced. 


The Moon is lord of 10° and occupies the cusp of the 6* 
house very strongly in Mercury's star, Moon's sub. Mercury 
rules 9 and le and occupies 8*. Moon receives the aspect of 
Jupiter, lord of 3 and 6 as well as of Saturn, lord of 5*. Moon 
thus signifies 10, 6, 3, .9 and 12 which, as we have seen, 
have reference to changes in service. The 9 being the 12* 
to the 10°, shows change in profession; the 5*, being the 12° 
to the 6*, change in job; the 3nd, being the 12* to the 4%, 
removal from present residence. The 12* also denotes 
residential changes (the langna describes also residence}. 


Will the querent's desire be fulfilled? For this, look to the 
11 *cusp which rules desire and its realisatin. If fails in Sun's 
sign, Venus star and Saturn sub. 


Sun is the 11* lerd in the constellation of Rahu in the 9” 
and sub of Saturn, lord of 4/ in 11;Venus occupies the 9% in 
the constellation of Jupiter, lord of 6 in 11 and the sub of 
Rahu in 9; Saturn rules 4/5 and is placed in 11% in the 
constellation of Sun, lord of 11 in 8* and sub of Venus in 9. 
The sign, star and sub lords are thus connected very strongly 


to the 9* and 11” besides other connected houses, so that 
the accomplishment of the querent's desire is beyond all doubt. 
However, as the sub lord of 11,Saturn, is in the starof Sun in 
8*, the transfer may not be the place desired though it will not 
be unsatisfactory. 


signification of sub-lords of respective cusps :; 


Star lord of 3, Venus strongly signifies the matters of 9%, 
11* Sd 6*. The sub lord of the Sd cusp is Rahu. Rahu occupies 
the sign of Moon, lord of 10 in 6*. Rahu itself is in 9. Besides 
Rahu occupies the star of Satum owning 5S and occupying 
11* and the sub of Venus, another occupant ofthe 9* house. 
So the 3r cusp sublord strengthens the indication of transfer 
and change of place. 


The star and sub lords of the 9* are Rahu and Moon. We 
have already found that both Moon and Rahu are strongly 
placed and denote transfer with change of place. 


The star and sublord of the 12* cusp are Moon and Sun. 
We have already seen Moon's significations. The Sun is lord of 
11 and is the star of Rahu a good significator of 9* (change in 
profession}, 6" and 10*. Rahu is also strongly placed by sub 
(ie. Saturn ruling the 5* and occupying the 11%}. 


The method of assessing the significators of a house as 
per Krishnamurti Padhdhati is very simple, namely. 


1. Planets posited in the constellation of occupants. 

2. Occupants 

3. Planets posited in the constellation of the cusp sign lord 
4. Cusp sign lord 


5. Planets associated with and aspected by the above 
significators, especially the star lords ofthe cusps. 


The dasa period in operation at the time of judgement was 
conjointly goverened by Mercury and Moon (as dasa and 
Bhukthi lords respectively). In ‘A’ dasa ‘B’ Bhukthi, the anthra 


308 RUUNG PUNT 


of ‘A’ is the strongest. Therefore in Mercury anthra the transfer 
should come off, and this was predicted to the querent. Mercury 
is lord of 9/12 placed in the 8* house. Moon is the only planet 
in Mercury's star. Moon as already pointed out, rules the 10* 
and occupies the 6" cusp. Also, Mercury receives the aspect 
of Saturn, lord of 4/5 in 11 in the constellation of Sun in the 
8*. Moon receives the aspects from both Satum and Jupiter, 
the 37% /6'lord. The 8* house connected of Moon and Mercury 
as well as Saturn which aspects the former two shows clearly 
that the transfer to the place desired will not be realized though 
the new place would not after all, be uncongenial. 


Moon and Mercury are among the fast moving planets, 
and as soon as Mercury becomes direct, the event should 
fructify. Actually, as predicted, the querent received orders of 
transfer to a place other than what he wanted during the 
anthra of Mercury in Moon Bhukthi in Mercury dasa. He 
submitted his joining report on 26-7-1981 and actually joined 
the next day 27-7-81, a Moon star day in Venus sign. 


The above instance proves the accuracy of the system of 
prediction outlined in Krishnamurti Padhdhati and all the credit 
goes to the late Prof. K. S. Krishnamurti, the greatest astrologer 
of our times. 


WILL MY LOVE AFFAIR 
MATERIALISE? 


A young handsome boy came to my residence and confided 
to me that he was in love with his elder brother's sister-in-law 
and wanted to mary her, but his parents were against this 
proposal. He was interested to know whether he would marry 
her or not. | asked for a number between 1 to 249 and he 
immediately mentioned no.20 


The query was taken up for astrological judgement on the 
24* March 1980 at 9.30 pm IST at Lucknow. The horary

Ill. Analysis 

In astrological parlance, romance, courtships, love affairs 


or extramarital relationships come under the domain of the Sih 
house. According to the Krishnamurti Padhdhati theory, the 
sub lord of the 5in cusp should be perused, and unless he is 
asignificator the houses 2nq, 7h and 11'™which are concerned 
with marriage, the matter will not, fructify. 


In the horary chart the sub lord of the 5 cusp is Budha. 
Budha is placed in the 11" bhava (fulfillment of desires}. Further, 
Budha is in the constellation of Rahu placed in the 4th bhava, 
but Rahu represents Sun by occupation. The Sun is the lord 
of 5 bhava placed in 11™ bhava, Sun is inthe constellation of 
Sani who is lord of 10th and 11°"bhavas placed in Sth. 


Further, the sub sub lord ofthe Sth cusp is Venus. Venus 
the lord of 2 and 7m placed in 12 (but a very nearto lagna). 
Venus is in its own constellation, Kethu sub sub and Sun sub 
sub. Kethu represents Sani. 


KRISHNAMUAT! PADHDHATI 311 


50 the sub lord and sub sub lord ofthe Sh cusp ie. Budha 
and Venus, represents houses 2, 5, 7 and 11.hence it clearly 
indicates thatthe boy's desire of marrying his will be fulfilled. 


To check up whether the girl is also willing to the boy's 
proposal or it is only a one sided affairs, one can scrutinize the 
following way. The 7" house of the boy's horary chart 
wilibecome the lagna of the girl and the Sth to the 7m bhava ie 
11™house sub lord will indicate the matter. Here the sub lord 
of the 11'house is Sani. Sani is the lord of 10m and 11th 
houses (4th and Sth house lord from the girl's lagna} placed in 
the 5m, 11™house from the girl's langa}. Hence it indicates 
that the girl is also in love with the boy and she ts willing to 
marry him. 


IV. When will the marriage be celebrated? 
For marriage, the houses 2, 7 and 11 are to be judged. 


IInd house : No planet is in the second bhava. Owner 
Venus. Venus Is in its own constellation. The bhava is aspected 
by Sani Sun is in Sani constellation. Hence Venus, Sun and sani 
are the significators of this house. 


Vilth house : No planet in the 7m bhava. Owner Venus. 
Venus is aspecting 7m house. Venus Is alone in its own 
constellation. Hence Venus becomes a very powerful significator 
of the 7m house. 


XIth house : Budha and sun are the occupants of the 117” 
house. No planet is in Budha constellation. Sani ts in Sun 
constellation. Owner of 11™house is Sani. Alone Sun is in Sani 
constellation. 11™house is aspected by Mars, Rahu, Jupiter 
and Sani. Kethu is in Mars constellation. Budha ts in Rahu 
constellation. Moon ts in Jupiter constellation and Sun ts in Sani 
constellation. Hence Sun, Moon, Mars, Budha, Jupiter, Rahu, 
Sani and Kethu are the significators of 11* house. 


To find out the strongest significators amongst them, the 
help of the Ruling planets at the moment of judgement is to 
be taken. 


31D RULUNG PLANT 
V. Ruling planets at thetime ofjudgement : 


1. Lagna Lord Venus 
2. Lagna const Lord Jupiter 
3, Lagna sub lord Sani 

4. Moon rasi lord Budha 
5. Moon const. Lord Jupiter 
6. Rasi sub lord Budcha 
7. Day lord Moan 


Hence, the common and powerful significators for his 
marriage are Jupiter, Budna, Venus, Moon and sani. The 
marriage has to take place in the conjoint period of the above 
significators in Vimshottari dasa. 


As perthe horary chart, the boy will undergo the following 
periods; 


Major Sub Subsub Ram To 
dasa dasa dasa 


1 Jup. Budha  Budha 243-80 16-480 


2.Jup. Budha = Kethu 164-80 36-80 
3. Jup. Budha Venus 3680 19-1060 
4.Jup. Budha = Sun 19-1060 31-11-80 


As Venus is the strongest significtor and also it is the Karaka 
for marriage, | selected Jupiter-Bud ha-Ven us period. | told 
the boy that he will get married between 3-6-1980 and 19-10- 
1980 and to the same girl. The boy was very much interested 
ta know the exact date of the event. 


| therefore calculate the sookshma periods in the anthra 
period of Venus in Mercury bhkuthi, Jupiter dasa, as follows : 


J. Jupiter-Budha-Venus-Venus 3-6-8060 to 24-6-80 
2, Jupiter-Budha-Venus-Sun 24-6-80 to 1-730 
3. Jupiter-Budha-Venus-Moon 1-730 to 12-7-80 
4. Jupiter-Budha - Venus-Mars' 12-7-80 ta 20-7-80 


Ard so on.... 


| was noticed that between 1-7-1980 and 12-7-1980 all 
powerful significators for his mamage were operating. 


To pinpoint the date of the event the help of transits must 
be taken. Any matter can fructify only when Moon and Sun 
and the significators transit favourable sign, star and sub. 


On the 7* July 1980, Venus the sub sub anthra lord 
becomes direct in motion, so the matter can fructify between 
7* July and 12* July 1980. 


Seeing the Sun and Moon's transits, | found that on the 9m 
July 1980 (Wednesday}. 


1. Sun istransiting in Budha sign, Jupiter constellation. 
2. Moon is transiting in Venus sign, Moon constellation 
3. Budha is transiting in own sign, Jupiter constellation 
4. Jupiter is transiting in Sun sign, Venus constellation 
5. Venus is transiting in own sign, Moon constellation 
6. Day lord Budha. 


As all the transits were agreeing forthe 9* July 1980, I told 
the boy that hewould surely get married on the 9" July 1980. 


In the last week of June 1980 the boy again came to my 
house and with a very smilng face conveyed the news that 
his parents have at least agreed and the date of his marriage 
had been fixed with the same girl and that it would be performed 
on the 9* July 1980 exactly as predicted by me 3 '/zmonths 
In advance. He also invited me to attend his marriage and 
bless them both. 


ouch a correct prediction can only be given by following the 
stellar technique enunciated by our lale revered Gurujee 3.K 
Krishnamurti. | always bow my head in deep reverence him 
as has bequeathed to us al! a veritable treasure in the form of 
Krishnamurti Padhdhati Readers which give us astrological 
knowledge in a simple, convincing and clear-cut style. 


A TESTIMONIAL WITH KP. 
THEORY-WIFE'S ARRIVAL. 


My wife went to take part in Ceremonial marriage of her 
elder brother to be held on 16-1-71. While, on the day of 
departure she informed my mother that she would be back to 
Calcutta on or before 23-1-78. On 23-1-78 till late hours she 
had not returned home and my mother got anxiety and forced 
me to find out as per astrological tictum to find out the time of 
her return so has to avoid her worring mind. To the respect of 
my mother and with an anxiety over the matter | took Horary 
Tables of Houses and opened it at once. On the Tightened 
page | found to 219. So taking number 219 | have taken the 
judgement of the chart 10.00 p.m: IST on 23-1-78 Monday 
at Calcutta for preparing the chart | have used KP. Horary 
Tables of Houses and Advanced Emphemeris.

Analysis : In a horary horoscope Moon called Mathi, indicates 
about querents nature of the query. Here Moon ts posited in 
her own sign Kataka in the star of Guru and in the sub of rahu 
and furthermore. Moon ts in conjunction with Mars retrograde. 
No 219 falls in the sign of Kumbha ruled by Sani in Rahu star 
and sub of Sun. Moon lord of 6, under the influence of V 
bhava Jupiter lord of 2 & 11, is occupying Mithuna under 
corridors of IV bhava. Lord of 2 indicates family and finance, 
I¥ house indicates domestic happiness and relative whereas 
11" house stands for fulfillment of desire. Sub lord Rahu is in 
Kanni in the star Moon and in ,the sub of Saturn. Rahu is 
posited in 7* bhava and ?" house indicates about wife, and 
2nd house regarded as family members include wife also. Hence 
ihe query clearly indicates the nature of the question ruling 
over the mind. 


As above said 7* house indicates wife. 4ih from 7* house 
indicates residence 11™house from 7* indicates her return to 
home. Hence 19 house (it is the 4th house from 7th) and 5m 


KAISHNAMUATI PADHDHAT 31? 


house (it is the 11 house from 7h} must be considered for the 
time of her returning house. Saturn is in Simha in the star of 
Ketu and sub of Mars lord of 4 & 9 in 11™to the 7* house. 
Hence due to some unexpected reasons because of her 
elder brothers her delay in returning home is caused. 10” 
house falls in Vrichika Rasi and no planets are in that zone. Sih 
house falls in Mercury sign Mithuna and Moon and Mars are 
the occupants of 5th bhava. Now, we have to see whether 
any planets posited in the star of Moon. Mars or Mercury. 
Venus posited in the star and sub of Moon, conjoining rapt 
with Sun in Makara. Furthermore Moon and Mars are aspecting 
Venus and Sun in Makara. Jupiter is in the stars of Mars. Rahu 
is in the star of Moon and representing for Mercury whereas 
Ketu will be representing for Jupiter. Satum is in the star of 
Ketu and sub of Mars. 


At the time of judgement at 10.00 p.m, IST at Calcutta 
ruling lagna falls in the star of Moon in Kanniya Rasi ruled by 
Budha. Luminary Moon is transiting in here own sign and in 
the star of Jupiter. Day is Monday ruled by Moon. 


On account of Saturn conjunction with the 7* house and 
also aspecting the horary lagna | decided that my wife will 
return when Moon crass over the longitude of Saturn in Simha 
and | told my mother that she will be returning home only on 
27-1-78 when Moon transits in the starof Venus in Simha Rasi 
Venus is the significator of 11* house to the 7* also Mars is 
aspecting Venus. Accordingly my wife came on 27-1 -78 monring 
when Kumbha lagna Jupiter star rises in East at Calcutta at 
840 a.m. My mother got excitement when my wife came on 
27-1-78 morning. For this clearance of worries in the all this 
saluttion must go to our Guruji who has propounded and 
discovered these wonderful theory by the Lord uchista 
Mahaganapathy.
