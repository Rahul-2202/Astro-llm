Preface 


Determination of longevity or Ayu Nirnay, is an extremely difficult, yet an important task 
for an Astrologer. All proficient Astrologers are of the opinion that a horoscope should 
be analysed only after ascertaining the longevity of the Jatak. 


There are many different methods of carrying out the Ayu Nirnay, but no one method 
can be called perfect. For this reason, it is better to check the Jatak's longevity by a 
number of different methods. 


Intuition plays an important role in Astrology, and even more so in the case of longevity 
determination. The Astrologer can develop his intuition through worship and sadhana. 


Above all, it must be remembered that birth and death cannot be controlled by any human 
being. The only way to improve our future is by improving our karmas. The essence of 
all the ‘Dharma Granthas' comes out in the form of only two words PAPA and PUNYA. 
Our entire existence revolves around these two words. So, only our present 
Karmas (the krlyaman karmas) are of prime importance. With this background | 
propose to introduce the subject. 


Before starting this book | pay respects to my Jyotish Guru ‘Shri K.N. Rao' and seek 
the blessings of my Divine Guru ‘lord Dakshina Moorti’.

An Astrologer can only give an Indication of what promise the future holds. Only Brahma, 
the creator, can say with certainty what will definitely happen. 


This shloka applies most appropriately to Longevity determination. 


Matters like longevity cannot be decided by us mortals. They are in the hands of the supreme 
power and an Astrologer who wishes indulge in longevity determination, needs help of this 
super power to make the correct judgement. 


Ayu Nimay is a very serious and a deep subject (qa efkfasa) and it involves much 
more than just the mathematical calculation. Even after checking longevity by many methods, 
the Astrologer is almost forbidden to disclose the person's death to him. At the most he can 
give a very subtle hint. 


There are about 32 methods of calculation of longevity, but there is no one method which 
gives perfect result. After calculating it by a number of methods, if similar Ayu is found, then 
it can be relied upon, to a certain extent. 


There are many stories in our religion like those of Savitri and Satyavan and Markandeya 
Rishi, in which people whose life span has come to an end, have been granted more life by 
God himself. This shows that the length of life can be increased by Gods blessings. Length 
of life can also be increased or decreased by the persons own karmas in this life.

An Analysis of Longevity 


Gl TORR] ae den sae, at anh, ay ead sem a7 Pree wei ere 8, 
BAH) aaa Ay Sri S| 
In short, people who lead a good regulated life from childhood, who follow good moral 


conduct, who eat less, and who respect god and the learned men, live up to their 
mathematically estimated life span or even longer. 


The people who do just the opposite have an untimely end. This shows that a person can 
reduce his life-span by his own kukarmas. (a4) 


Till a child is of twelve years of age his ayu nirnay should not be done. The first four years of 
his life and governed by the poorva karmas of his mother, the next four years are governed 
by the karmas of his father and the next four years are governed by his own karmas. Till 
twelve years, even prediction of his horoscope should not be done, because whatever the 
horoscope shows, can get altered because of these super imposing factors. For this reason 
till that age, every child should be protected through propitiation of planets, medical 
help and proper care. Only after he has crossed this age, his Ayu Nirnay should be, 
done. 


For calculation of longevity accurate birth data is required, which is: 


1. Correct Date of birth (D.O.B) 
2. Correct Time of birth (T.O.B) 
3. Correct Place of birth (P.O.B) 
4. Correct horoscope cast on the basis of Chitrapakshiya Ayanamsa. 


Correct Time of Birth 


There are some controversies regarding the T.O.B. which should be taken as the correct 
T.O.B.? 


1. Appearance of the head or any body part? 
2. When the child is placed on the table (4314) ? 
3. The cutting or severance of the umbilical cord (Aer) ? 
4. The first cry? 
* Normally cutting of the umbilical cord or the first cry can be accepted as the T.O.B. 
Even the T.O.B. given by the hospital can be depended upon. 


In the end | would like to say that prediction of a horoscope should be done only after 
assessment of the life span. All the Yogas and the beautiful promises contained in the 
horoscope will materialise only if the horoscope promises enough longevity. 


| 2 An Analysis of Longevity 


The Astrologer who desires to gain proficiency in Ayurdaya must sincerely worship his 
chosen deity and perform his sadhana. He must have the genuine desire to help others, 
and he should carry out Ayu Nirnay with a calm and peaceful mind.

All living beings take a new birth to enjoy or suffer the result the karmas of their past lives. 
Depending on their past karmas their longevity is - LONG-MEDIUM-SHORT. 


Yogas in the horoscope, show the person's 'Poorva karma and these 'Yogas' connect the . 
person with his 'karma phalas'. 
There are basically two kinds of longevity.

Approximate Determination of the Ayu Khanda 


I. The position of the planets in the horoscope gives some idea about the ayu khanda of 
the person. 


Poorna Ayu 


1. If the following houses and planets are strong and well placed and are well aspected, it 
is an indication of poorna Ayu. 


Lagna and lagna lord. 

Moon and moon sign lord. 

Eighth house and eighth house lord. 
Third house and third house lord. 
Ayushkarak Saturn. 


If benefics are placed in kendras and trikonas. 

And malefics are placed in upachayas. 

And eighth and twelfth houses are vacant and are free from malefic influence. 
And lagna lord is stronger than eighth lord. 


Then it is also an indication of pooma ayu. 


Alpa Ayu 


a. 


b. 


If the 5 factors mentioned in (1) are devoid of strength and are ill placed, it shows 
ALPAAyu. 

If benefics are placed in Trik bhava and malefics are in the kendras and Trikonas, 
and lagnesh is weaker than the eighth lord, then ALPA ayu is possible. This will be 
even more so, if moon is also afflicted in the trik bhavas. 


When all the Malefics including eighth lord and excluding lagna lord are in: 
Apoklim - it shows Poorna Ayu. 

Panphar - itshows Madhya Ayu. 

Kendras - it shows Alpa Ayu. 


When all the Benefics including lagna lord are in : 
Kendras - it shows Poorna Ayu. 

Panphar - it shows Madhya Ayu. 

Apoklim - it shows Alpa Ayu.

Accordingly as Lords of Lagna and eighth therefrom, and lords of Chandra and eighth there- 
from, are mutually inimical, neutral orfriendly, the length of life will be Alpa-Madhya or Poorna.

If lord of the Chandra navamsa is inimical, neutral or friendly to the Lord of the 64th navamsa

lagna should be similarly reckoned.

3. Marakesh 


The word Maraka is a dreadful word. The word itself generates fear and gloom. But what is 
a maraka? Itis important to understand its meaning. The maraka is supposed to give Mrityu. 
Now what is Mrityu? Shri Krishna has described eight types of 'Mrityu’. 


The Eight types of Mrityu : 

1. eq (fae aerer) | Always caught up in quarrels and anguish. 

omar wget Sferr wart | Always remaining surrounded by enemies. 
Wal Gat BIRT Yea | Always remaining miserable and troubled. 

aX Waa et oe afsara ert! Always getting insulted everywhere. 
rR wie Bisa wel (Pac daferaiat yesrt |) 

Terrible misery and sorrow. 

6. a aaa srarfia earl Great dishonour in assembly. 

7. SIT Wet WaT! Forever ailing. 

8. we a oe fyHer | Loss of life ultimately. 


a Ff oO DN 


The Maraka can give any one of these eight types of mrityu. So, if Dasha of the maraka 
planet comes, then it does not always mean that actual death will take place, it means that 
one of these eight type of Mrityu or Mrityu tulya kashta may take place. Ultimately actual 
death will have to be faced, but every time the period of a maraka comes one should not 
expect death. 


Death will take place only once, when, according to assessment of longevity, the person 
has reached the end of his life, and the number of his breaths (247) given to himby the lor 
have ended. 


Who is the Maraka 

Maraka is the killer. At the end of a man's life he kills, But of during the rest of his life time, the 
maraka creates sickness, disease, accidents, hindrances, obstructions, and other problems 
- (The eight types of mrityu). 

The most powerful marak bhava is the second bhava of the horoscope. After that comes 
the seventh bhava . Next is the twelfth house. After that comes the eighth house, then the 
third house and the tenth house. Their lords, and the planets associated with them qualify 
as the marakas, and marakas are different planets for different lagnas according to their 


an Analysis or Longevity 4 


lordship. 


The eighth house is the Ayu Sthan. The seventh house is twelfth (Vyaya) of the eight, i.e. 
expenditure of Ayu. Eighth house from the eighth- the third house is also Ayu Sthan. The 
second house is also the twelfth from the third house- Vyaya of Ayu. So second house also 
becomes a Maraka Sthan. This is the reason for the second and the seventh houses 
becoming maraka sthan. Of the two, the second house is the stronger maraka sthan. 


The Maraka 

: The Strongest maraka is the Second house lord. 

The Seventh house lord. ; 

The planets which are associated with the Second house, or Second lord. 

The planets which are associated with the seventh house, or Seventh lord. 

The twelfth house lord. 

The planets associated with the twelfth house, or twelfth lord. 

The eighth-house lord and the planets associated with the eighth house or eighth lord*! 
The third house lord and the planets associated with the third house or third lord. 


© MWNOaAhON = 


The tenth lord (eighth from third house according to some people.) 

. Saturn is the ‘Ayushkarak- the ultimate killer or 'Yama’. He is the unconditional maraka. 
If he is involved with the other marakas, he will supercede all the others and take over 
as the Maraka himself. Because he is the unconditional maraka, he can act anytime, 
anyhow and anywhere.

o 


Some other Marakas 


1. Chidra Grahas (ft We) 

Jatak Parijat describes chidra grahas as the planets who are vulnerable. Whichever of 
these planets is strongest, can cause death in his dasha. 
The seven chidra grahas are: 

The lord of the eighth house. 

Planets placed in the eighth house. 

Planets aspecting the eighth house. 

The lord of khara Dreshkone (the 22th Dreshkone) 
The planet in conjunction with the eighth lord. 

The lord of the 64th Navamsa from Moon. 

The Atishatru (Bitter enemy) of the eighth lord. 


e©moaagogp 


Jatak Parijat has given a lot of importance to eighth house. The 22nd Dreshkone falls in the 
eighth house from lagna. The 64th navamsa falls in the 8th house from Moon. And all the 


| 8 | An Analysis of Longevit 


other chidra grahas are connected to the eighth house. So, the eighth house becomes a 
very important house for longevity. 


2. Planets in Mrityu Bhaga 

In every rashi, there is a fixed degree for each planet, and each lagna, which is his mrityu 
bhaga. Ifthe planet is placed in his mrityu bhaga, then he becomes adverse. If a maraka is 
placed in mrityu bhaga then he becomes even stronger as a maraka. 


3. Sun and moon as marakas ° 

Sun and moon, because they are luminaries, are not considered, to be among the marakas. 
But in practice is found that they can also act as marakas, especially if they are associated 
with other marakas or maraka houses. 


4. Lagna Lord who is also the eighth lord 

For Aries and Libra Lagnas - Mars and Venus are lagna lord and eighth lords. They normally 
- do not become markas. But if they are associated with other marakas - they can also 
become marakas. 


So, we see that almost all the planets in the horoscope can becomes marakas. The planet 
which becomes more prominent among them, will probably be the actual maraka.

All these planets get marakatva of varying degrees depending on their lordship.

can also act as marakas.

4. Balarishta 


Balarishta means some serious harm caused to a child up to twelve years of age. This 
harm can present itself from of a serious illness, loss of a parent, death of the child or some 
other calamity affecting the child adversely. We have already seen why prediction of a small 
child's horoscope should not be done. The main emphasis should be on looking for any 
Balarishta combinations which may be present, so that some Astrological remedy may be 
prescribed to ward off the evil and to protect the child. 


The principles for determination of Balarishta: 


1. The Condition of Moon 

Moon is most important in childhood. Moon also represents the mother. So affliction to 
moon causes arishta to the child or his mother. 

2. Lagna and Lagna Lord 

The importance of lagna is undisputed. If lagna and lagna lord are strong they can with 
stand affliction, but if they are weak they succumb to it. 

3. Eighth house and eighth lord 

Eighth house is the house of ayu or death; so it should be protected by the aspect of 
benefics. Effect of malefics on the eighth house reduces longevity, but Saturn placed in 8th 
house promotes longevity, provided he is not retrograde. 

4. The Kendras 

Direct Benefics in kendras protect the child while malefics cause harm. Retrograde benefics 
cannot protect the child, while retrograde malefics are even worse. 

5. Dasha and Gochar 

Adverse dasha and gochar are also responsible for arishta. 


Most of the classical combinations for arishta are based on these five principles. There are 
a lot of combinations for arishta given in the classics, | will be giving the important ones 
here. 


Classical Combinations for Balarishta : 


1. If moon is placed in the sixth eighth or twelfth house from lagna and is aspected by 
malefics it causes arishta. 


2. If malefics are placed with moon or are in kendra from moon, it is harmful for the child. 


3. Ifmoon is in lagna in Papa kartari (aTaePcie) unaspected by benefics while malefics are 


An Analysis of Longevity il 


10. 


in the seventh and eighth house. The child dies with the mother. This is a very powerful 
and dreadful combination and strong remedial measures should be under taken 
immediately. 


If birth Lagna falls in - 

Nigala Drekkna (1 °-10° Capricorn) or 
Pakshi Drekkna (11 °-20° Gemini) or 
Sarpa Drekkna (21 °-30° Capricorn) and 


if it is associated with malefics without any association of benefics, there will be 
Balarishta. 


According to Brihat Jatak : 
* Sarpa Dreshkones are- 
2nd and 3rd of Cancer, 
1st and 2nd of Scorpio and 3rd of Pisces. 
* Pakshi Dreshkones are - 
2nd of Gemini, 1stof Leo, 
2nd of Libra and 1st of Aquarius. 
Vajra Mushti Yoga- 


If Cancer or Scorpio rashi is in lagna and all the malefics are placed in the eastern half 
(10th house to 4th house) and all the benefics are in the western half (fourth to 10th 
house) the child is bereft of longevity. 


lf retrograde Saturn is placed in the eighth house, in the rashi of Mars and is aspected 
by a strong Mars, it gives two years longevity to the child. 


If birth is at solar or lunar eclipse when Sun and Moon are close to Rahu or Ketu and 
Saturn and Mars aspect the Lagna, the child dies in 15 days. 


If Saturn Mars and Sun placed in 6th or 8th house, it leads to death within one month, 
even if Yama himself tries to protect the child. (Not to be taken literally). Itcan also 
mean serious illness. 

If birth is at sunrise or sunset (Twilight) in Moon's hora, or in Gandanta (Junction points 
of Pisces -Aries. Cancer-Leo, and Scorpio and Sagittarius), with Moon and malefics 
placed in kendras, it results in death of the child. 


If birth is during an eclipse, moon is associated with malefics in lagna, and Mars is in 
eighth house, the child dies with his mother because of a weapon (operation?) 


Arishta to the mother 


1. 


12 


Moon aspected by three malefics indicate death of the mother, but if benefics also 
aspect moon, they give protection. 


An Analysis of Longevity 


2. If Malefics are in 5th or 9th house from a weak moon, the mother dies within six months 
of the child's birth. 


3. Saturn in 10th house, Moon in the 6th house and Mars in the 7th house results in the 
death. of mother and child. 
Arishta to Father 


1. IfSun in Papakartari, or is in association with malefics, and malefics are placed in the 
seventh from Sun, it leads to the death of father. 


2. Sun in Navamsa of Mars aspected by Saturn - the father dies before the birth of the 
child, or renounces his family (leaves his family). 


3. Saturn in lagna, Mars in Seventh house and Moon in Sixth house - death of father. 
The classics use very strong language. In reality it may not turn out to be as bad. Death can 
also mean ill health or separation from parents. 

Important 


When Arishta is seen, cancellation for Arishta - Arishta bhanga must be looked for. If 
Arishta bhanga is present then the arishta may get reduced or averted. 


The Vargas 


If Arishta is seen in the child's horoscope, One must examine the Navamsa, Drekkna, 
Dwadasamsa and Trimsamsa. If there is improvement in the vargas then it reduces 
the danger, but if Arishta is seen repeated in the vargas then there is serious cause for 
worry and immediately remedies like - Vrata, Dan- Japa or havan must be advised. 


When will Arishta take Place? 


Arishta will take place when the lagna, lagna lord or Moon get weekened according to 
dasha-antardasha and gochar. And the arishta will normally enter through the doors of 
sixth eighth or twelfth bhavas, in the dashas of their lords. 
«* Ifthe lagna or moon do not get weakened in dasha and gochar, then Arishta may not 
take place at all. Eg. Disease will attack a person at the time when his health is already 
weak. Rest of the time the person remains healthy. 


Will the Arishta Take Place at all ? 
* To decide this, both Arishta and Arishta bhanga have to be weighed. 
If the Situation improves in Navamsa then the arishta may not take place. 


If Arishta bhanga is stronger and Jatak's dasha sequence is favourable, then arishta 
may not take place at all. 

If Arishta is too strong and Arishtabhanga is weak, and dasha sequence and gochar 
are unfavourable then arishta cannot be avoided. In such a case the Astrologer should 
prepare the person to face the eventually.

1. Ina balarishta case moon becomes the most important factor. In this case moon is 
badly afflicted in the eighth house. This is a classical combination for balarishta. 
Moon is the twelfth lord himself. 
He is in Sarpa dreshkone. 
He is in Kemadrum yoga. 
He is aspected by Saturn, Mars, Ketu, Sun and Mercury in D-1.

MDL- Mercury is the lord of 2nd and eleventh house, so for Leo lagna, he has 
marakatva. In addition to this he is placed in the maraka bhava - the second house. 
ADL- Venus is the 3rd and 10th lord in D-1 and the 2nd and 7th lord in D-9. In D-1 
he is placed in the eighth house from Moon, and in Navamsa, he is placed in the 
2nd house from Moon. !nthis way, the ADL also has marakatva. 


14 An Analysis of Longevity 


PDL is Rahu, who is placed in the rashi of Venus. So he tends to behave like 
Venus. Rahu-Venus dasha is also a tricky dasha, which is capable of causing 
such harm. In addition to this Rahu and Venus are in 6/8 axis (Shadashtak) from 
each other. So the pratyantar dasha is also dangerous. 


SDL- Sookshmadasha lord is the afflicted (Wifsa) moon himself. 
In this way we find that both the promise and dasha are quite adverse. 
However there is some saving element in the horoscope. 


Yogakarak Mars is in lagna in Pushkar Amsa (the life giving degree) in D-1. In D-9 
he becomes the Lagna lord who is aspecting the lagna. 


Moon and the eighth house are aspected by an exalted Jupiter in D-1. ln D-9 Jupiter 
is aspecting the lagna. 


Moon is strong in pakshabala. 


Inspite of this the child could not be saved. Even the saving element had its own 
weaknesses. 


Jupiter is the eighth lord and the 22nd Dreshkone lord in papakartari. 
Mars is the 64th navamsa lord. 


This is the Astrological reasoning for the unfortunate happening. Above this the child's poorva 
karmas are in action.

ETATET 


Mahabharat says, only the grahas and nakshatras alone do not produce auspicious and 

inauspicious results. All that is the result of the karmas done by oneself. They say it is the 

doing of the planets. When it is time for some good results to happen and when the time for 
bad ones is all that the planets indicate.

5. Arishtabhanga 


(Cancellation of Arishta) 


Arishta is serious harm caused to a child or an older Jatak. 


Arishta bhanga is cancellation of Arishta. It gives protection and results in comparative 
improvement. 


The association of strong benefics protects the child. 
1. 


Predominance of benefic influence on Lagna, Lagna lord, Moon or Moon's dispositor, 
or on Kendras cancels Balarishta. 


Ifa strong dignified (in uchha or svarashi etc.) Jupiter in Cancer, Sagittarius or Pisces 
rashis is placed in Lagna it gives strong protection against evils. In such a position he 
is supposed to overcome one Lakh doshas. In a similar condition, Venus overcomes 
ten thousand doshas and Mercury in similar situation cancels one thousand doshas. 


Strong lagna lord in kendras, protects and supports the child, it promotes longevity. 
Strong lagna lord in kendras aspected by benefics, unaspected by malefics destroys 
affliction and promotes longevity. 

If moon is placed in sixth eighth or twelfth house, under the aspect of malefics and if 
the birth is at night time in shukla paksha (From sunset to sunrise) or in day time (sun 
rise to sunset) in Krishna Paksha, then instead of killing, this Moon protects the child 
like Ma Bhagwati. (A very strong combination) 

Rahu in third sixth and eleventh house aspected by a benefic removes affliction 
instantaneously. If Aries, Taurus or Cancer are in Lagna, with Rahu placed in it, then 
also, any affliction gets neutralised. 

If Sun is placed in the twelfth house for Libra lagna it gives an ayu of 100 years ( avery 
strong combination) 100 years means a long life- poornayu. 


If moon is in sixth or eighth house, but he is in Dreshkona of benefics- then It cancels 
Arishta. 


Full moon aspected by all planets cancels aristha. 


. Benefics in sixth seventh and eighth house from lagna or Moon, unassociated with 


malefics provide strong protection against Arishta. (Chandra or Lagna Adhiyoga). 


. Jupiter and Venus in kendras destroy evils. 
. If lagna is strong and the benefics are also strong while the malefics are weak, the 


child is protected from danger. 


. [ffull moon is aspected by Venus, who is in a friendly navamsa, it destroys evil. 


14. Strong good Rajayogas in the horoscope also promote longevity. 


16 


An Analysis of Longevity 


Moon and the lagna lord are the main factors to be considered. When they come under 
strong malefic influence, Arishta is produced. If they also receive benefic influence in the 
form of aspect or placement of benefics, then Arishta is reduced or wiped out completely. 


It must be ‘remembered, that when a benefic aspect has to protect, then that aspect must 
come from a good house. If a benefic is placed in the eighth house and is aspecting from 
there, then the aspect will not provide enough protection. 


If Arishta bhanga exists, it does not mean that arishta will not come at all. It means that 
arishta will come but the child will be protected. If the affliction is too much and the cancellation 
is not very strong then the child may die. But if the affliction is medium and protection is 
strong then all will be well. 


Remedial measures and prayers do wonders and may save the child when the Arishta 
bhanga fails.

6. Gandanta Birth 


The junction points of Pisces- Aries, Cancer-Leo, and Scorpio - Sagittarius, rashis are 
called Gandanita. If a child's natal moon is in Gandanta, then it is adverse either for himself 
or for his family members. 


Six nakshatras fall under this category, and they are called the ‘Ganda Moola' nakshatras or 
simply the ‘Moola’ nakshatras. 


These six nakshatras are: 


1. Revati 

2.Ashwini 

3.Ashlesha 

4. Magha 

5. Jyeshta 

6. Moola 

Ifa child's Moon is placed in 'Gandanta’, then 27 days after birth, when Moon re-enters that 
nakshatra, 'Moola Shanti’ must be performed according to the proper SHASTRIYA method, 


mentioned in 'Brihat Parashar Hora Shastra’. This helps in neutralising the dosha and 
promotes good health and longevity. 


To be more specific, the four ghatis of the junction point ( sandhi) of the nakshatras Revati 
- Ashwini, Ashlesha- Magha and Jyeshtha- Moola, denoted by the last two ghatis of the first 
and the first two ghatis of the second nakshatra are Nakshatra Gandanta. 

* — Revati-last 2 ghatis & Ashwini-First 2 ghatis is Gandanta 

* — Ashlesha - Last 2 ghatis & Magha - First 2 ghatis is Gandanta 

* — Jyeshtha - Last 2 ghatis & Moola - First 2 ghatis is Gandanta. 


The most crucial part is the actual Ganda the last and the first degrees of these junction 
points. It is also known as the Lagna Gandanta (1 ghati) 


Results of a Birth in Gandanta 


Ifa child is born in Gandanta, then normally it is adverse (bad) for himself or for his immediate 
family. 
* Results of Moon in Ashwini 

- Inthe 1 st Pada - Harmful for father. 

- Inthe 2nd Pada - good for comforts and happiness. 

- Inthe 3rd Pada - High position. 


18 An Analysis of Longevity 


Inthe 4th pada - Honoured by the government. 
Apart from the first pada the remaining padas are alright: 


Results of Moon in Ashlesha 


The first pada - If shanti is done, all will be well. 
The second pada - Bad for wealth. 

The third pada - Bad for mother. 

The fourth pada- Bad for father. 


* Results of Moon in Magha 


The first pada - Bad for mother 

The second pada - Bad for father 

The third pada - good. 

The fourth pada- Good for money and education. 


Results of Moon in Jyeshta 


The first pada - Bad for elder brother 

The second pada - Bad for younger brother 
The third pada - Bad for mother. 

The fourth pada- Bad for himself. 


Another View 
Divide the 13°20' of Jyeshta into 10 parts. Ifthe birth is in : 


1st part - bad for maternal grand mother (Some authors claim that the first part is 
bad for maternal grand father and second part is bad for maternal grand mother). 


2nd part - bad for maternal grand father. 
3rd part - for maternal uncle 

4th part - for mother 

5th part - for himself. 

6th part - for the family. 

7th part - Relations of the parents. 

8th part - elder brother. 

9th part -father in-law. 

10th part- everyone. 


Remark 


Jyeshtha is one of the worst Gandanta. 


An Analysis of Longevity 19 


Results of Moon in Moola 
The First pada - Affects the fife of father 
The Second pada - Bad for mother. 
The third pada - Loss of property. 


The fourth pada- Good. The child will have health wealth, happiness, power of 
speech, favour from government, but he will have a tendency to be a source of 
distress to his family. If Shanti is done it will ensure good results. 


Abhuktamoola 


The last one ghati of Jyeshta and the first one ghati of Moola is especially dangerous it is 
called Abhuktamoola. The shastras suggest that the father should keep away from the child 
for 8 years. If itis not possible, then atleast for six months, and he should see the child only 
after proper shanti has been done. Abhukhamoola is very dangerous for the father. | have 
myself seen this in many cases. 


Results of Moon in Revati - 
The first 3 padas of revati are free from affliction the last pada is bad for the child. 


Apart from Nakshatra Gandanta, there is also Rashi and Tithi Gandanta. The Rashi Gandanta 
affects the child's family, and Tithi Gandanta affects the parents of the child. 


When a child is born, the first thing an Astrologer should look for is, whether it is a Gandanta 
birth! Ifit is so, then he should immediately prescribe Moola shanti, according to the Janma 
nakshatra. For the shanties one can refer to Brihat Parashar Hora Shastra of Parashar - 
Rishi.

7. Ayu Nirnay 


(The determination of Longevity) 


There are about 32 methods of calculation of longevity according to Parashar rishi. 


Grahabala and Bhavabala decide which method is to be used for a particular horoscope. 
(Rahu and ketu are not considered). 


Different methods of Calculating Ayu 


Amsa - Ayu (i311) method is used when lagna is strong. 

Pind - Ayu (fastg) Is used when Sun is strong. 

Nisarga - Ayu (Prag) is used when moon is strong. 

Bhinnashtak varga Ayu (farerat sy) Mars is strong . 

Rashmi - Ayurdaya (#f84 OTgfcr) is used when Mercury is strong. 
Nakshatra Ayu (487 311) is used when Jupiter is strong. 

Kalachakra (@Tetash) +Ayurdayais used when Venus is strong. 
Sarvashtakvarga Ayu (eatsea at ay) will be used when Saturn is strong. 


Jaimini Ayurdaya is the most common method of finding out the Ayu Khanda. 


Some other approximate methods of Determining longevity 


1. 


Varayu (41814) 


Mansagari gives rough Ayu according to the weekday of birth. However it is not found to 
be very accurate. 


Rashyayu (@1arq) 


Mansagari also gives rough ayu according to the Janma Rashi - this method is also 
approximate. 
Kendrayu (@=aTq) 


The numbers of the rashis in kendras are added and multiplied by 3. Then whichever 
kendra has Mars Saturn or Rahu, the number of that rashi are reduced from the product. 
The resultant gives the Ayu. 


Purushakar ({@ST#IX) Graha Chakra 


After making the shape of a man, the nakshatra in which sun is placed, is written in the 
head. The other nakshatras are placed according to the chakra. The body part in which 
Janma nakshatra falls, gives the ayu. 


An Analysis of Longevity 21 


5. Ayu According to Grahaspashtas 


Longitudes of Sun, Moon Jupiter and Satur are added and the resultant longitude is 
noted. When Saturn transits (in gochar) that longitude then death is possible, provided 
the person has reached the age according to his longevity determination and provided 
the appropriate dasha is in operation.

Q.2. Can we depend on only one method for carrying out Ayu Nirnay? 


22 An Analysis of Longevity 


8. Jaimini Ayurdaya | 


This is the most popular method of longevity assessment. It helps us to work out the 
Ayukhanda of the person up to 80 % accuracy. 


The life-span of the person is considered to be of 100 years. If hundred years are divided 
into three sections, each section becomes of 33 years. 


Alpa-Ayu - 0 to 33 years 
Madhya-Ayu - 33 to 66 years 
Poorna-Ayu - 66 to 100 years 


To decide the Ayu khanda of the person, three sets of factors are considered. 


First Set 
Lagnesh (Lagna Lord) 
Ashtamesh (Eighth house Lord) 


Second Set 
Lagna 
Moon 
Third Set 
Lagna 
Hora Lagna 
See in which types of Rashis these are placed - Char - Sthir or Dwiswabhava. 
Char Rashis - Aries- Cancer- Libra- Capricorn. 
Sthir Rashis - Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius. 
Dwiswabhava Rashis - Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces. 
Alpa-Ayu 
If all the three sets are completely in Sthir Rashis then Alpa-Ayu is indicated. 
Or 
+ If one part of each set is in Char Rashi and the other is in Dwiswabhava rashi then 
also it shows Alpa-Ayu. 
Madhya Ayu 
If all the three sets are fully in Dwiswabhava Rashis, then Madhya - Ayu is indicated. 


Or 
If one part of each set is in Char and the other is in Sthir Rashi, then also it shows 
madhaya ayu.

3. 


At least 2 sets must show the same Ayu to be accepted . 


If all the 3 sets show different ayus then, whatever the last set (Lagna and Hora lagna) 
shows is the final. 


If Moon is in lagna or in the seventh house accept the ayu indicated by lagna and 
Moon set. 


Some astrologers are of the opinion that Moon and Ayushkarak Saturn should be 
considered instead of Moon and Lagna. 


The ayu will depend on Haran and Bharan Sanskar, which has to be carried out on the 
ayu which has been determined by this method. 


Kakshya HRAS (Reduction) 


1.

5. 


If Saturn is Lagna lord or eighth lord and he is neither exalted nor in his own house and 
is not aspected by benefics then there is reduction of 1 kakshya. 


If eighth lord from Lagna or from Seventh house becomes atmakarak or conjoins with 
A.K. then there is reduction of one kakshya. 


When lagna or seventh house are in Papa kartari (hemmed between two malefics) or 
if malefics are in trines (1-5-9) from them, there is loss of 1 kakshya. 


IfA.K. is malefic, and is debilitated or conjoined with malefics, there is loss of 1 kakshya. 


When the A.K. or Seventh therefrom has malefics or if either of them are in Papakartari 
or if malefics are in trines from either of them, then there is loss of a kakshya.

Step- Il 
The hours become the completed rashis. 


The minutes divided by 2 give the degrees. 
Eg- Ifthe difference between sunrise and Time of Birth is 10 hrs. 20 mins. 


Then completed signs are 10s - Capricorn. 
20/2 = 10 are the degrees. 
= Aquarius 10° or 10510° 
Step Ill 
If the Ascendant is odd (Visham), then add the Signs and degrees to the Longitude 


of Sun. 
If the Ascendant is even (Sama), then add the signs and degrees to the Longitude of 


the Ascendant (Lagna). 
The Resultant is Parashar Hora Lagna.

9. Pindayu 
"Grahadatta Ayurdaya" (Parashar) 


Pindayu is one of the best methods of determining the Longevity. If Sun is the strongest 
among the planets and the Lagna, Pindayu method is used. Strength of the planets and 
Lagna is normally seen from Grahabala and Bhavabala. If one has to judge quickly then 
‘Digbala' can be seen. Sun becomes digbali in the tenth house. 


Seven planets from Sun to Saturn give their fixed years of longevity if they are at their deep 
exaltation (482) degrees and they give half this ayu at their deep debilitation (4@4-+1z) 
degrees. If they are placed in between the two, then the ayu can be worked out according 
to ratio proportion. 


Planet Deep Exhaltation Deep Debilitation 
Sun 10°-Aries 10°-Libra 

Moon 3° - Taurus 3° - Scorpio 

Mars 28° - Capricorn 28°- Cancer 
Mercury 15°-Virgo 15° - Pisces 
Jupiter 5° - Cancer 5° - Capricorn 
Venus 27° - Pisces 27°-Virgo 

Saturn 20° - Libra 20° - Aries 


If the planet is at Deep Exhaltation degree he gives: 


Fixed Ayu (Full Term of the planet) 


Sun - 19 Yrs 

Moon - 25 Yrs. 
Mars : 15 Yrs. 
Mercury - 12Yrs. 
Jupiter - 15Yrs. 
Venus : 21 Yrs. 
Saturn * 20 Yrs. 


Total 127 Yrs. 
Opinion of Different Acharyas 


1. Yavanacharya, Maya, Parashar and Manitha agree with this view. 
2. Jeevasharma (Jeevayu) advocates 120 years as Poornayu, and gives equal distribution

The Procedure 
1. Convert the Nirayana Longitudes of the planets into degrees. 
The full longitude of the planet should be converted, including Rashi- Degree-Minutes. 


Eg.- Ifa planet is at 5° in Capricorn, then converted into degrees, it would be - 9$5°- 00! 
= 9x30+5=275° 


2. Deduct the longitude of the deepest exaltation points of these planets from their 
converted degrees. This will give us their Arc of longevity. 31g al aq 
3. Ifthe result is less than 180° (6 Rashis) then deduct this figure from 360°. 
If the result is more than 180° (6 Rashis), then take it as it is. 


=. 14.28 yrs. foreach planet 


4. Calculate the years given by each planet. 
Formula :- 


Full Term of the Planet X Arc of Longevity 
360° 


= Ratio Proportion. 
(The years contributed by the planet) 
5. Add the years contributed by each planet. 
6. Carry out the Haran Sanskar. 
i. Chakrapath Haran ii. Astangat Haran iii. Shatru kshetra Haran 
7. Addthe ayu. 
8. Carry out krurodaya Haran, (If a malefic planet is placed lagna) 


9. Calculate LagnaAyu. 
10. Add the Lagna Ayu to the previously Calculated Ayu to get the Final Pindayu in savan 
yrs. (360 days) 


11. Convert savan years into solar years (865 days).

‘The Ayu obtained will have to be subjected to four types of corrections (Harans). 


An Analysis of Longevity : — ——| 33 | 


Corrections : Reduction or haran in ayu is due to : 
1. Chakra path Haran. 2. Astangat Haran. 


3. Shatrukshektra Haran 4. Krurodaya Haran. 
1. Chakra path Haran (amu2T €xuT) 
This reduction is done because of the placement of planets between seventh and twelfth 
house. 
Maximum Haran is because of placement in the twelfth house. 


Houses Malefic Planet Benefic Planet 
12th Loses Fully Loses half 

11th Half 1/4 

10th 18 146 

9th 1/4 1/8 

8th 15 1/10 

7th 1HN5 1H2 


If both Benefic and Malefic planets are placed in these houses then 
1. Mercury and Moon are not considered malefic. 

2. Sun Mars and Saturn are malefics. 

3. Rahu and Ketu are not taken into account. 


If More than one planet are placed together in these houses then the strongest out of 
them will lose, the rest will not lose. 


2. Astangat Haran (CTA Sx7T) 
A combust planet loses half of his ayu obtained after chakra path haran. 


Planet Degree of Combustion 
Moon 12° ahead or behind Sun 
Mars 17°ahead or behind Sun 
Mercury (Direct) 14°ahead or behind Sun 
Retrograde 12°ahead or behind Sun 
Jupiter 11 °aheador behind Sun 
Venus (Direct) 10°ahead or behind Sun 
Retrograde 8°ahead or behind Sun 

Saturn 15°ahead or behind Sun 


Saturn and Venus are exenipted from Astangat Haran. 


3. Shatru Kshetra Haran (31a eeT)

tion is done. Parashari naisargik Maitri is considered maitri is seen from the planet's own 
side. This Haran does not apply to: 


1. Retrograde planets. 2. Mars in Capricorn: 


There is some controversy among Astrologers regarding Mars. 


4. Krurodaya Haran (tea BxT) 
When one or more than one Krura grahas - namely Saturn Mars or Sun are placed in 
lagna, then Krurodaya Haran is carried out. 


i. Convert the lagna degrees (minus the Rashi) into minutes. 

ii, Multiply these minutes with the age provided by all planets, after shatru kshetra haran. 
iii. Divide the figure, thus obtained, by 21,600 (360° converted into minutes). 

lv. Reduce the quotient from the age provided by all the planets. 


¢ If abenefic aspects the lagna, deduct 1 the quotient. 
¢ Ifa benefic planet is also placed in the lagna then:- 
- Ifthe benefic is closer to the lagna degree - No Haran is carried out. 
- Ifthe malefic is closen to the lagna degree, then deduct 1/2 the quotient.

* Krurodaya Haran for Saturn - 
Saturn is placed in Lagna and therefore will undergo Krurodaya Haran. 
a. Convert lagna degree, minus the signs into minutes:

b. Since Saturn is aspected by a benefic moon he will lose 1/2 these years i.e. 
2.8965 in krurodaya haran. 


To the Ayu obtained after Haran, Lagna ayu will have to be added. 


Lagna Ayu 


1. Note the longitude of Lagna in signs, degrees and minutes. Ignore the signs 
and convert the degrees into minutes. 


2. Lagna gives a term of life in years equal to the navamsas passed in lagna. 


. Because 1 Navamsa is 3°20' (200’), divide the minutes of lagna by 200 to get 
the years and months provided by Lagna. 


Lagna is 3° 27° 56' 
Ignore 3s, and convert 27°56' into minutes = 1676'

Amsayu is another very important method for calculation of longevity. It is followed when 
lagna is very strong. 


The Procedure 


1. 
2. 
3. 


A. 
5. 


Convert the full Nirayana longitude of the planets and lagna into minutes. 

Divide each of them by 200. (1 navamsa) 

Ifthe quotient is more than 12, then subtract multiples of 12 from it. The remainder is 
the age provided by the planets and lagna. If quotient is 12 then take it as 12. 

Carry out Bharan Sanskar (Addition) 


Carry out the Haran Sanskar (reductions) like in Pindayu except Krurodaya Haran, 
which will not be applied. 


Bharan Sanskar (Axor deer) 


If the planet is exalted or retrograde, multiply the age provided by the planet by 3. 


If the planet is vargottam, in own rashi, or in own navamsa or in own drekkna, double 
the age. i.e. multiply by 2. 


Ifa planet is exalted and vargottam then double the years only once. 
If the planet is retrograde and vargottam, then multiply by 3 only once.

Example 

- Indira Gandhi's Sun was in Anuradha Nakshatra. 

- HerJanma Nakshatra was uttar Ashadha. 

- Uttar Ashadha falls in the mouth. According to this method her Ayu should have been 


80 yrs. 
Graha Spashta Method 


Add the longitudes of Sun, Moon, Jupiter and Saturn. This will give a certain longitude. 
When Saturn transits this longitude, the persons life will come to an end. 


Caution 

Transit comes only at the final Stage. Before applying transit one should assess: 
1. The Ayu khanda in which the persons life falls. 

2. The dasha Antardasha 


Normally this transit of Saturn can come only three times in a persons life because 
Saturn completes one round of Rashi Chakra in 30 years. 


Ifthe person's life falls in Alpa-ayu khanda and the Dasha Antardasha is also 
unfavourable, then Saturn is transit will end his life in the first round itself. 


If his life falls in Madhya ayu khanda then this will happen in Saturn's second round and if 
longevity is poorna-ayu, then in the third round, or even in the fourth round if the person is 
very long lived.

50 An Analysis of Longevity 


13. Ayu Nirnay- 
Conclusion 


After applying all these different methods of longevity determination, it appears that Jaimini 
Ayurdaya, Pindayu and Amsayu methods give more accurate results. In Indira Gandhi's 
horoscope, Amsayu method has given the most accurate result and Jaimini method has 
also been quite accurate where Ayu khanda is concerned. 


Indira Gandhi's Longevity According to Different Methods 


1. Jaimini Ayurdaya - Madhya -Ayu. 

2. Pindayu - 79yrs ,O months , 16 days. 
3. Amsayu - 67 yrs, 9 months. 

4. Nisargayu - Not Applicable. 

Other Methods 

1. Varayu - 84 years 

2. Rashyayu - 81 years. 

3. Rashi Dhruvanka method - 85 years. 

4. Kendrayu (A) - 62 years (B) 55 yrs , 2 months, 12 days. 
5. Purushakar Graha - 80yrs. Chakra 

6. Graha Spashta Method - Does not show correct result. 


None of the other methods are accurate. Her actual age at the time of her assassination 
was almost 67 years. 


An Analysis or Longevity 31 


14. The Manner of Death 


Many Astrological classics accept that the manner of death can be known from eighth 
house and the planet placed in the eighth house. 


qe afeftrerarqarataa: 
Reiger aenat draffadsffee: | 


WARATZAAM GRAA PART CAL CPARATCA, 
qarafiat aifey weeaearest fate i141! . 


—Safforereara 
ae If no planet is placed in the eighth house and no planet aspect it, then the death will 
be due to the nature of the eighth lord. If eighth lord is: 

BL (Tridosha) (ata—ftra-ap) 

Sun Bile 

Moon Wind and Phlegm 

Mars Bile 

Mercury Bile wind phlegm 

Jupiter Phlegm 

Venus Wind and Phlegm 

Saturn Wind 


Vata - wind, pitta- heat and bile, kaff-phlegm are the Tridoshas of Ayurveda. 
Death will be caused because of inflamation of the concerned Tridosha’'. 


If planets occupy or aspect the eighth house. The strongest of them will cause 
disease according to what he represents. 


Sun - Represents fire, therefore-Fever. 

Moon - Represents water, therefore watery diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, 
blood impurities, drowning etc. 

Mars  - Causes accidents, injury due to weapons, epidemics like Cholera plague 


etc. 
Mercury - Causes fever of brain, or small pox. 


52 An Analysis of Longevity 


Jupiter - By an ailment not accurately ascertained. 
Venus - Causes death due to thirst by excessive drinks. 
Saturn - Causes death due to starvation or excessive eating. 


If two or more planets occupy the eighth house, then there may be two or more diseases. 


If Rashi in eighth house is char the death may take place far from home. If it is sthira the 
death may take place at home. If it is Dwiswabhava- then the death may take place near his 
home. (Hospital?) 


In Indira Gandhi's case there is a sthira rashi in the eighth house and she died at home. 
However this cannot be taken as a thumb rule. 


There are a lot of different combinations for death in different conditions given in various 
Classics , but the guidance given above is sufficient. The list of diseases represented by the 
planets can be expanded according to the significations of the planets and according to the 
nature of the rashis in which they are placed. This needs to be researched. 


Death can also be due to other reasons apart from diseases. These can be accidents, 
injuries, assassinations, suicide or even samadhi. These can also be understood by the 
significations of the planets and the rashis connected with the eighth house and according 
to the dasha operating at the time of death. 


An Analysis of Longevity 53 


15. Timing of Death 1 


Timing of death is a very tricky business. Even after an Astrologer has timed the death of a 
person, he is forbidden to disclose it to the person concerned. At the most he can give a 
vary subtle hint, but at the same time he should prescribe some remedial measures for 
relief. 


Timing of death can be done in two different ways. 
1. Dashayu 


This is assessed according to the Maraka dasha Antar or Pratyantar dasha , after judging 
longevity by different methods. 


2. Gochar 


Gochar of certain planets can be death inflicting provided the dasha is also giving a similar 
indication. It must be remembered that gochar is the final clinching factor and gochar is 
subservient to dasha. It cannot act independently. 


Dashayu - The Maraka Dasha 


Any planet can acquire propensity for inflicting death or death like misery, if he is the lord of 
any of the houses which can cause death, or if he is associated with any maraka planet. 
Dasha of such a planet becomes the Dasha of the Marakesh. 


The maraka planets have already been mentioned earlier, they are being mentioned again 
for convenience. 


Maraka Planets 

Second house lord. 

Seventh house lord. 

Planets associated with Second house 
Planets associated with Seventh house. 
Twelfth house lord. 

Planets associated with twelfth house. 
Eighth house and planets associated with it. 
Third house and planets associated with it. 
Saturn the unconditional maraka. 


The Maraka Dasha 
Which dasha can be the marakesh dasha ? 


O©ONOARWNY = 


I. The Ayu khanda of the Jatak should be decided to see whether it falls under Alpa Ayu 
group, Madhya Ayu group or Poorna ayu group. For determination of Ayu khanda Jaimini 


54 An Analysis of Longevity 


Ayurdaya, using Jaimini Hora Lagna can be safely relied upon. 


ll. After determining the Ayu khanda, see the dasha order: 


Tara: 

Janma Nakshatra - Janma 
Second from Janma Nak. - Sampat 
Third from Janma Nak. -  Vipat 
Fourth from Janma Nak. - Keshema 
Fifth from Janma Nak. -  Pratyari 
Sixth from Janma Nak. - Sadhak 
Seventh from Janma Nak. - Vadh 
Eighth from Janma Nak. - Mitra 
Ninth from Janma Nak. -  Atimitra 


The dashas of the lords of the third fifth and Seventh nakshatras i.e. vipat , pratyari and 
vadha taras are adverse. Another way of seeing this is : Note the dasha at birth. The adverse 
dashas will be 

+ Third dasha from birth dasha. 

* Fifth dasha from birth dasha. 

* Seventh dasha from birth dasha. 


If any of these dashas are falling within the Ayu khanda of the Jatak, then itcan become the 
dasha of Marakesh. 


lil. Ifdasha of any of the MARAKAS is falling within the ayu determined earlier, then that 
dasha can become the maraka dasha. 


¢ {fSunor moon are lords of maraka houses and are associated with others marakas, 
then their dashas can also become marakesh dasha. 


* — If Benefics like Jupiter Venus or Mercury or full Moon are kendra lords, then they can 
become marakas. 


- Jupiter with kendra adhipati dosha becomes a strong maraka. 
- Venus can also become a maraka of a lesser degree than Jupiter. 
Mercury becomes a maraka of a lesser degree than Venus. 


- Full Moon as a kendra lord becomes a maraka of even lesser degree than 
Mercury. 


* Saturn who is the unconditional maraka can give death in his dasha, if his dasha is 
falling at the appropriate time. 


In this manner depending on the Ayu Khanda and the Dasha Sequence, it is possible to 
pinpoint which dasha (Dasha-Antardasha or pratyantar dasha) is the probable maraka dasha. 


When we are dealing with a topic like death then it is better to not depend on only one 


An Analysis or Longevity 95 


dasha. Confirmation should be made by yogini dasha, char dasha, sthir dasha, kalachakra 
dasha or some condititonal dasha which is applicable to the horoscope. 


After pinpointing the probable dasha, gochar should be applied to fix the probable time of 
death. 


The Fatal Transit - Gochar 


Gochar shows the final fructification of the promise in the horoscope. In our context it will 
show when actual death or death like misery (4] Jed He) will take place. 


When planets transit (pass through) certain rashis which are considered adverse, when 
seen in relation to Moon, death can take place. 


Caution: Rules of Gochar should not be applied independently, because they can 
mislead the person. They should be applied only after: 

1. Determination of Ayu khanda 

2. Determination of Ayu by Pindayu, Amsayu, Nisargayu etc. 

3. Determination of the maraka dasha. 

When Saturn, Mars, Jupiter or Sun transit the Natal (Janma Rashi) Moon or eighth 
or twelfth houses from it, Ill health, trouble or death can take place. 

Saturn's Transit 


1. If Saturn transits the Janma Chandra or the eighth or twelfth rashi from it, Ill health or 
death can take place. Atthe same time if Mars or Jupiter are also transiting these places, 
then the trouble can increase. 


Saturn is the unconditional killer or Yama himself, his role normally comes into play 
somehow or the other, at the time of death. 


2. If Saturn transits over the below mentioned points or trines (1st,5th, 9th) from them, it 
can Create trouble or death. 

Natal Saturn 
Natal Moon. 
Moon's Dispositor (Rashilord) 
Twenty second dreshkona lord. 
Sixty fourth Navamsalord. 
Lagna lord. 
Eighth lord. 
Gulika. 
Sixth or eighth place from Sun. 


3. IfSaturn transits over certain crucial degrees it can produce similiar results. 


56 An Analysis of Longevity 


i. By adding together the longitudes of sixth, eighth and twelfth house lords, a 
certain longitude will be got. If it becomes more than twelve Rashis, then deduct 
twelve or multiples of twelve from it to get the resultant rashi. Saturns transit 

_ over this longitude is adverse. 

ii. By adding together the longitudes of lagna lord, Saturn and gulika, a certain 

longitude will be got. Saturn's transit over this longitude is adverse. 


4. The Ashtakvarga Method : Multiply the shodhya pinda of Saturn, with the number of 
benefic bindus in 7th or 8th rashi from Saturn, in Saturn's Ashtakvarga, before trikona 
and ekadhipati Shodan, and divide the product by 27. The remainder obtained thus, 
counted from Ashwini, will indicate a certain Nakshatra. 


When Saturn transits over that nakshatra or trines from it (1-10-19), it can give death 


i.e. Shodhya Pinda Saturn X Benefic Bindus in 7th or 8th rashi from Saturn, 
in Saturn's A.Varga before Reductions 


- Remainder is counted from Ashwini. 


Jupiter's Transit 
1. When Jupiter transits any of the following, death or serious trouble is possible. 
The eighth house lord. 
the moon sign. 
iii. Lagna. 
iv. Twenty second dreshkone lord. 
v. Sixty fourth Navamsa lord. 
vi. Rahu 


2. Ashtakvarga Method 


Multiply the shodhya Pinda of Saturn by the benefic bindus in the rashi occupied by 
Jupiter in Saturn's Ashtakvarga before reductions. Divide the product by 12. The 
remainder counted from Aries gives a rashi, Jupiters transit over this rashi or its trines 
can prove fatal. 


Shodhya Pinda Saturn x Bindus in the Rashi occupied by Jupiter in Saturn A.V. 
Before Reduction 


12. 
Remainder is counted from Aries. 


Sun's Transit 


1. When Sun transit over Janma rashi or the Seventh, eighth or twelfth from it, and if there 
are all other indications of death, then it can show the month of death. 


An Analysis or Longevity a 


2. Under similar circumstances, sun's transit in the sign of the eighth lord can indicate 
death. 
Moon Transit 


1. Moon's Transit over natal Moon can show timing of death within 3-4 days. It will be 
illustrated in Indira Gandhi's horoscope. At the time of her death- Transit moon had just 
passed over her natal moon. 

2. Moon's transit over natal sun can give death. 


3. Moon's transit over eighth lord can also indicate death. 


Transit of Planets over Certain Nakshatras from Janma Nakshatra 
¢ When Sun transit over 26 and 27th Nakshatra from Janma Nakshatra. 
When Mars transits over 1 st and 2nd Nakshatra from Janma Nakshatra. 


When Saturn, Rahu or Ketu transit over 22nd, 23rd and 26th or 27th Nakshatra from 
Janma Nakshatra. 


in all these transits, if other indications of death are also present, then death or 'Mrityu Tulya 
Kashta', may take place. 


Transit by Ashtakvarga 


Ashtakvarga is an excellent system of analysing transit. In Ashtakvarga it is possible to 
analyse the transit of a planet through every 3°45’ (Kakshya) of a rashi and it brings great 
accuracy in prediction Prastharak of the transiting planet should be seen. If the planet is 
transiting through a kakshya which has a benefic Bindu, then the result will be good otherwise 
not. Where the maraka is concerned, if he transits through a sensitive binduless kakshya 
near about the time of death, he can cause death.

Longevity Assessment 

As per Amsayu method Indira Gandhi's ayu works out to be 67 yrs. 9 months. 
Dasha at Death 

Dasha at her death was Saturn- Rahu- Rahu 


Saturn (Mahadasha Nath) 
Is her seventh and eighth lord(Maraka) placed in lagna . 
He aspects the Moon, who is her lagna lord. 
* From Moon, he is the second lord placed in Seventh house (Again a Maraka!) 


Rahu (Antardasha and Pratyantardasha Nath) 


Rahu is placed in the sixth house from lagna (house of injury) and in twelfth house from 
moon. 


Rahu is accompanied by Venus who is a kendra lord and eleventh lord and is thus a 
malefic for cancer lagna. 


Rahu has a natural tendency to behave like Saturn. Saturn is the maraka in this case 
and Rahu is behaving like him. 


Rahu's dispositor is Jupiter who is also the sixth lord (of injuries). 
Inthis manner the MDL, ADL and PDL have Marakatva (Killing propensity). 
Transit at death 


Saturn 


- Satum was transiting in Libra in Vishakha nakshatra, which is the 23rd nakshatra 
(Vainashika) from her Janma nakshatra 


- He was closely aspecting the lagna and the natal 8L (Saturn). 


- He was very close to the 22nd Dreshkone which falls in Libra and becomes a sensitive 
point. 


- He had closely aspected the 22nd Dreshkone lord and 64th navamsa lord Venus. 
- Hewas transiting in a binduless Kakshya in his own Prastharak. 
- He was aspecting the sixth house of injuries. 
- He was under no benefic influence. 
Rahu 
Rahu had passed over natal Jupiter 
Ketu 
Ketu had just passed over natal Sun, who is the second lord. 


An__ Analysis of Longevity }———.§ ————_________________ 59 


Jupiter 
Jupiter had just passed over natal Rahu. 
Moon 


Moon had just passed over natal moon. (It is often noticed that at the time of death the 
transiting moon is very close to natal moon.) 


Mars 

+ Mars was transiting through the 6th house of injuries. 
* He had passed over natal Rahu. 

* He was transiting in 12th house from Moon. 


* He was closely aspected by 8th Lord Saturn. Together, both Saturn and Mars were 
influencing the 6th house and the Lagna. 


Conclusion 


The entire Dasha and Transit is showing the gravity of the situation and there is no saving 
element anywhere in the form of any benefic association. (Position - Aspect - Conjunction) 


Indira Gandhi was brutally shot dead by her Sikh body guards on the moming of 31.10.1984, 
and she could not be saved. Her age at the time of assassination was almost 67 years. 


EXERCISE 


Q.1... How can death or death like misery be timed according to Dasha? 
Q.2. Gochar of which planets can be used for pinpointing a difficult period? 
Q.3. Howis Saturn and Jupiter's Gochar used to identify a period of difficulty? 


60 An Analysis of Longevity 


16. Conclusion 


It must have already become clear that Ayu Nirnay is a very deep and serious subject. As far 
as possible, under normal circumstances the Astrologer should avoid calculating the Ayu 
up to months and days, because no method of calculation is perfect. Broadly speaking, the 
Ayu khanda should be judged, the horoscope should be seen over all, and the dasha 
sequence should be noted. 


Normally, if Benefics are placed in kendras and Trikonas, malefics are placed in third sixth 
and eleventh houses, Eighth and Twelfth house are vacant; Lagna lord is stronger than 
eighth lord and dasha sequence is favourable, It shows a good longevity. 


Where a small child's horoscope is concerned- Itis most important to see : 


1. Condition of the Moon. 
2. Balarishta combinations. 
3. Arishta Bhanga. 


It is not wise to calculate his Ayu up to the age of twelve years. 


| have made an attempt to write about this extremely deep and tricky subject. | have described 
a number of well known methods of longevity determination. The results got from any of 
these methods cannot be guaranteed, so as far as possible one should avoid calculating 
ones, own or one's family members' longevity. 


Above all, it must be remembered that length of life can be extended by good karmas 
and reduced by bad Karmas. 


EXERCISE 


Q.1. What precautions should be taken while judging longevity? 
Q.2. What are the general indications for a long life? 


Q.3. How should a child's horoscope be seen?

Five parts of the Appendix 

(a) Determination of Ayu khanda 
(b) Jeeva ayu 

(c.) Naisargik Parashari maitri 
(d) Balarishta 

(e) Some different opinions 


(a) Determination of Ayu khanda (More information) 


|. Alpa Ayu 
Alpa ayu is indicated when the following factors are weak or afflicted. 
Lagna/lagna lord. 
Moon/Moon's rashi lord. 
Fifth house / fifth lord. 
Ninth house / ninth lord 
Tenth house / tenth lord. 


Alpa ayu combinations 
1. Brihat Parashar Hora shastra 
a. Third lord and Mars or eighth lord and Saturn are conjoined with malefics or are aspectec 


by them or are combust. 


b. Lagna lord is placed in the eighth house conjoined with malefics and unassociated witt 
benefics. 


Lagna lord is weak and the kendras are occupied by malefics, unaspected by benefics 
Second and twelfth houses are occupied by malefics, unassociated with benefics. 
Lagna lord and eighth lord both are combust or debilitated. 

. Prashna Marga 


yb oao 


Lagna and Moon are weak. 
They are conjoined or aspected by malefics. 
Lagna lord and Moon sign lord are combust. 

e¢ They are placed in sixth eighth or twelfth houses. 


62 An Analysis of Longevity 


Birth is during an eclipse. 
Moon or Sun is surrounded by a halo at the time of birth. 


Birth takes place during an earth quake or at the time of some other natural calamity or 
some bad omen. 


Birth takes place in rashi sandhi or in mrityubhag (lagna is in mrityubhag). 

Moon is in Mrityubhag. 

Moon is placed in the 8th house from lagna and is aspected by malefics. 

Benefics are placed in 6th or 8th houses and are aspected by retrograde malefics. 
Malefics are in Kendras and trikonas or in the 8th house. 


If most of these combinations are present, then they indicate short life. 


Il. Madhya Ayu 

Madhya ayu is indicated when the following factors are weak or afflicted. 

- Fifth house / fifth lord. 

* Eighth house / eighth lord. 

* Twelfth house / twelfth lord. 

Brihat Parashar Hora Shastra 

If lagna lord and eighth lord are both debilitated or combust then alpa ayu is indicated, but if 


they are conjoined or aspected by benefics and malefics both, then madhya ayu is indi- 
cated. 


Ifa medium situation is seen after considering all the angles, then it can be considered 
madhya ayu. 


Along with Jaimini ayurdaya if yogayu is also considered, then a correct judgement can be 
reached. 


Ill. Poorna Ayu (Deerdhayu) 

Deerdha ayu is indicated when 

* Lagna and lagna lord are strong. 

* Moon and moon sign lord are strong. 
+ — Fifth house and fifth lord are strong. 
Ninth house and Ninth lord are strong. 


oh 


. Brihat Parashar Hora Shastra 


a. Malefics are in 3, 6, 11th houses, benefics are in kendras and trikonas and lagna lord is 
strong. 


b. Benefics are placed in kendras and lagna lord is also placed with benefics or is aspected 
by Jupiter. 


AnAnalysis of Longevity 63 


c. Lagna lord is in kendra and is conjoined with benefics or is aspected by them. 

d. Eighth lord or Saturn is placed with an exalted or swarashi planet. 

e. Benefics are in 6, 7, 8th house and malefics are in 3, 11th house. 

f. Malefics are in 6th, 12th house, lagna lord is in kendra and eighth lord is a friend of Sun. 

g. Lagna is dwiswabhava and lagna lord is in own rashi or exalted or placed in kendra or 
trikona. 

h. Lagna is dwiswabhava and two malefics are in kendras from a strong lagna lord. 

i. Lagna lord is strong and three planets are placed in the eighth house in own sign, 
friend's sign or exaltation sign. 

Eg. 


2. Prashna Marga 


Lagna and Moon are strong. 

Lagna is occupied by benefics and Moon is placed with benefics. 

Both are aspected by benefics. 

Benefics are placed in kendras, trikonas and second and eighth from lagna and Moon 
A dignified Jupiter is placed in lagna. 


64 An Analysis of Longevity 


* Malefics are placed in 3, 6, 11 from lagna and from Moon. 

* Jupiter and Moon are either placed together or are aspecting each other. 
+ —Lagna lord is placed in kendra. 

* Lord of Moon sign is strong. 

*  Lagna lord is placed in the 11 th from lagna. 


If most of these combinations are present then deerdha ayu is indicated. 
If there is a mixture of good and bad yogas, then prediction should be given after judging the 
intensity and strength of the yogas. 


3. Generally, speaking, if lagna lord, eighth lord and tenth lord - all are placed in kendras and 
trikonas it shows deerdha ayu. 


(b) Jeeva Ayu 
Jeeva ayu method was created by a Bengali astrologer - Acharya Jeeva Sharma. This 
method is applied when lagna, Sun and Moon all are weak. 


Jeeva ayu is exactly like Pinda ayu. The only difference is that Jeeva Sharma considers the 
full life span to be of 120 years and 5 days. He divides it equally among all the 7 planets and 
each planet at its highest exaltation degree provides. 


120yrs 5days = 17yrs-1 mon-22 days =8 ghatis and 34 palas 
7 

Rest of the method is the same as Pinda ayu. Four reductions (harans) are carried out 
namely - 
* Chakrapath haran 
+ Astangat haran 
* Shatru kshetra haran 
* Krurodaya haran 


Lagna ayu is also calculated like Pindayu. 


(c) Naisargik Parashari Maitri (For Shatrukshetra haran) 


It must be remembered that maitri is one sided. It is not necessary that the other planet 
reciprocates in the same manner. 


Eg. Moon considers Saturn to be neutral but Saturn considers Moon to be his enemy. If 
Moon is placed in Saturn's rashi there will be no Shatru kshetra haran. If Saturn is placed in 
Moon's rashi, haran will be applied.
