Preface 



Dasa gives a system whereby we see the results which impact the 
native in a time period. Each Dasha is controlled by one planet. It is the 
disposition and relationship of this planet, that the promised events are 
reflected. The results which a planet promises in its Dasa has to be studied 
by a careful analysis of the planet. 

The Vimshottari Dasha is a 120 year cycle of planetary position based 
on the position of Moon in one of the lunar mansions called Nakshatras. 
We have started the book explaining various Dasas. The first basic principles 
have been explained at length. 

In the next part we go in details, discussing the strength of the planet 
depending upon position of planets, lordship and various rules that modify 
the strength. 

Each Dasa and its predictive aspect are explained in details. It takes 
into consideration the sign in which the planet is posited. It also explains 
the effect of directional strength, state of the planet and the divisional 
strength. This will enable the reader to make an overall assessment of the 
planet whose Dasa is being analyzed for a native. 

The next part dwells with the rules that have to be followed while 
taking the impact of Sub Period in the major period (Dasa) of the planet. 
We have in details discussed factors that strengthen or weaken the result 
which is promised. Further the impact of other vectors, like the transit and 
strength have been explained. 

The predictive aspect for Major and Sub Period of all planets have 
been dwelled in length. The results in general for all Dasas have been 
explained not only for Antardasha (Sub Period) but also for Pratyantar (Sub 
- Sub Period), Sookshma (Sub Sub Sub Period) and Prana Dasa (Sub Sub 
Sub Sub Period). 

To conclude an important chapter has been put which talks of the 
Avashtas (State) of Planets and their effects. This will be of great help in 
doing predictions. 



This book which is the sixth book in the encyclopedia will be useful for 
those doing predictions as well as for the research students. A lot of research 
and also we have tried to cover all aspects that are required to understand 
the Dasa System.

Introduction 



Astrology is the branch of knowledge of certain mysteriously secret 
relationship between the Celestial bodies and terrestrial life. 

Observations prove that trends in human experiences correspond to 
movement of the Planets in the Solar system. It is a matter of common 
experience that the ailments of a rheumatic or asthmatic patient are usually 
aggravated on llÂ°tiay of the bright or dark Moon fortnight and the new 
and full Moon days. Physicians all overthe world as well as layman have 
noticed the changes of developments of labour pain on these days. 

Natal astrology is the study of these relationships in regard to human 
life; it classifies and correlates causes and effects, thus explains the natural 
laws that connect stellar dynamic causations with the Native's behaviour or 
the mundane events. 

Life is short, Any branch of knowledge is vast, so is astrology- applied 
astronomy. Judgement on a Nativity is difficult, and therefore it is necessary, 
that a person interested in astrology should diligently read the writings of 
others, who have treated rationally this science, or Art of predictions and 
make it his business to find out the true natural causes of things by 
experience, to know the certain positions and procession of the planets 
and constellations, etc., but above all be sincere lover of truth. 

There is in life of every man an instant which decides his entire future. 
Almost always it is chance which has taken the person like the wind does to 
a leaf, throwing him into a new and unknown situation, where once he has 
entered in is obliged to obey a superior force. The person does becomes 
the slave of circumstances, however still free to play things according to 
his free will, but with in the limits of strengths and weakness of the planetary 
configuration his birth. Well, the Dasa systems are one such method to 
give us timely pre-warning for pre-arming,to bring emotional, psychological 
and attitudinal balances in his life. 

A Vedic or Hindu Dasa system is one of the unique methodologies 
developed by the ancient Seers. The various Dasa studies indicate certain 
predispositions or tendencies in human life, which some times, are so clear 
that they become virtual certainties. Experience is the great test, and had 
not the experience proved to the truth of the deductions of various Dasas 
methods.

Vimsottari Dasa corresponds to the complete circle of 360 deg, which 
is three times the span of maximum life- one hundred and twenty years. 
The Zodiacal circle when divided into twenty-seven constellation each of 
13 deg 20 min, and the life span of one hundred and twenty years when 
divided by nine, gives thirteen years and four months, thus there is a 
proportion of one deg for each year of life. Further to simplify matters, 
observe the starry sign where Sun, Jupiter, Saturn and Rahu with mean 
motion (speed) joins, upon any birth chart, and we have the clue to NAADI 
predictions. 

The Principles of predictions are three- Logic, Sense, and Experience, 
but the main principles of operations are four -The Planets, the Constellations 
and the positions of all these in respect of one another, and the Native's 
backdrop. An astrologer should be thoroughly acquainted with the complete 
commixtures and distinct virtues or powers of all the Planets and the Stars, 
and the influences of these on a Nativity, then only it will be possible to 
declare what will happen by or from such motions of the-Heavenly bodies, 
and by consequence can correctly foretell future events imprinted on the 
mortals. 

While judging the effects due to the planets in the horoscope and their 
successive combinations in the period, sub-period and sub-sub-period after 
birth, the general significations of the planets must be taken into account. 

In general, it is necessary to take into consideration, when judging the 
effects of a planet, (1) its natural ruler-ship in the order of the signs; (2) 
the house (Bhava) occupied by it; (3) the house, or houses, over which it 
rules in the horoscope. 

The judgment concerning any planet is derived from a consideration 
of its ruler-ship in the signs and the Bhava (houses) occupied by those 
signs, in addition to the place of the planet itself, its general nature, and its 
sympathies and antipathies in the natural world and in humans. 

For this reason, the Moon is strong in the second and fourth 
houses; the Sun in the fifth and first; Mars in the first and eighth; Saturn in 
the tenth and seventh, etc., irrespective of the signs in which they are 
found; for they have affinity with these several houses by their affinities in 
the Kalapursha (world-soul), the horoscope of which is of Mesh Lagna 
(Aries for rising sign), during the whole of Kali Yuga (the present age), i.e., 
the Dark, or Iron Age. 

During the PERDDS of a planet- As the general effects of the horoscope 
is derived from the configurations and conditions of all the planets, taken 
as natural significators for the whole life, so, in judging of the effects of any 
period of the life, attention must be paid to the condition (by position and 



Introduction xv 



configuration) of the planet ruling that period as determined by the Dasa 
calculation, i.e., the dividing of time (the life-period) into its periodical sub 
divisions i.e. periods, sub-periods, and sub-sub-periods. 

Its basis is the Moon longitude at birth. According to the condition of 
the planets ruling the required period, the life and fortunes of the native 
be affected. 



During the SUBPERDD of a planet- The effects are considered in 
relation to the general effects due to the planets governing the period in 
which they fall, and they are subsidiary to the effects promised by the 
period planet (Lord). Then, if the period-Lord shows good effects, it does 
so from its position and aspects at birth, and an evil sub-period-Lord cannot 
counteract its effect wholly, but some good will remain behind. The result 
is similar when, mutatis mutandis, the Period planet is evil and the Sub- 
Period-Lord good. But when both agree in nature and point to the same 
end, then the effects are forcible and decided, either for good or evil, as 
the case may be. 

During the Sub-sub-PERIODS- The effects are taken as subsidiary to 
the sub-periods of Planets. 

(The longest of these periods- Venus is over a period of 6 months 20 
days, viz., the sub-sub-period, of the Sub-Period, in the Major Period (Maha 
Dasa); the shortest sub-sub-period is that of the Sun in its own sub-period 
and Major period; it lasts only 5 days 9 hours 36 minutes (Say 5 days and 
10 hours). Sub-sub-sub-Periods and sub-sub-sub-sub-periods are even of 
much shorter durations and should be used only when birth time is accurate, 
and required to time an event especially important or fatality or for 
rectification of birth time with respect to known events.) 

The condition of the sub-sub-Period-Lord must be taken into account, 
and its relations to the sub-period-Lord properly estimated. Its effects may 
then be accurately known. 

A few straightforward rules are necessary in order to bring the above 
observations into systematic form. 

The Generalised RULES TO JLDGE THE PLANETARY PERIODS in brief 
areasfollows:- 

1 . Consider the positions and affections of the period planet properly, for 
even a good planet will not bear good fruit during its period, if it be ill 
affected by sign or position, or afflicted by the majority of malefic 
planets, or in divisional charts l|ke Navamsa. 

2. The sub-period planet must be considered in the same way as the 
period planet, but in addition thereto its relations with the period planet 



xvi Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa S ffl &r 

must be taken carefully into account; for though the planets ha$i & 
natural enmity and friendship existing between them, and due to tttHf 
respective natures, yet when the sub-period planet is in good aspect/ 
relationship to the period planet it will produce good, even though 
these planets be natural enemies. Similarly, friendly and benefic planets 
will not produce good fruits, if weak or afflicted, or themselves afflicting 
(by position) the period planet to which they are related. 

3. The effects of the ruling or karaka planets are intensified at such time 
as the Sun or major planets may be transiting through the signs occupied 
by them orthe signs over which they rule. 

4. The sub-sub-period planets are considered in the same manner, in 
regard to the sub-period planets to which they are related, as these 
latter are to the period planets. It thus happens that even when the 
period is a good one, as shown by the position and affections of the 
period planet, yet there are sub-periods, and again sub-sub-periods, 
when evils may naturally arise. 

5. The general effects of the planets thus related must be taken into 
account, and their natural relations, as well as their temporary relations 
in the horoscope, must be well considered. Thus, Saturn and Sun, 
although natural enemies by sign and exaltation, may be respectively 
in Libra and Leo, in which case they are in temporary good relations, 
occupying the third and eleventh signs respectively from one another. 
Judgment is made accordingly, but it is to be understood that a 
temporary friendship will not entirely overcome a radical and 
constitutional enmity. 

6. The effects will further have relation to the nature of the 
house corresponding to the sign occupied by the sub-period planet, in 
the period under consideration. Thus if the period be that of Sun, and 
the sub-period be that of Venus, and Venus be in the sign Aquarius, 
the effects will fall out in relation to the eleventh house affairs; if 
Venus be in Libra, then seventh house affairs will be affected. 

7. The sign, counted from the Ascendant, will give a further element of 
interpretation. Thus if, in the sub-period of any planet, that planet 
occupies Leo, and Scorpio and is in ascendant, the effects will fall on 
the tenth house affairs. 

8. The number of the signs counted from the period to the sub-period 
planet will give the house corresponding thereto, over which the effects 
will hold sway. Thus:- Sun in Virgp and Venus as sub-period planet in 
Scorpio will show the third house affairs to be affected. 



introduction ' xvii 



10. The houses in the horoscope ruled by the planet whose period, sub- 
period, or inter-period is considered must also be regarded as affecting. 

1 1 . Rahu and Ketu (Dragon's Head and Tail) have no houses, but transmit 
the influence of the signs they are in, and of the planets to which they 
are conjoined. The Dragon's Head has affinity with the sign Scorpio, 
and the Dragon's Tail with the sign Taurus. 

12. Ifthe inter-periods of the different sub-periods be taken into account, 
the above" effects" will apply equally well to those also, by counting 
the sub-period planet as a period planet, and the inter-period planet 
as a sub-period planet. In this way the prognostics serve for every 
period of life, from the greatest to the least, allowance being made for 
the relations of the significators in the minor periods. In all cases the 
effects due to the Lord of period are of prior importance, the sub- 
periods-lord and sub-sub-periods-lord following in subsidiary order. 

13. During the period and sub-period of a very well disposed planet, nearly 
all type of benefic result are likely. Similarly, when the sub-period planet 
under consideration is ill disposed in all respects then the native faces 
all sort of problems during that period e.g. when Mars is debilitated 
and badly aspected, then the spouse may suffer or the native may 
have a car accident or loss of property. 

14. During the sub-period of two planets having an exchange of their 
signs in Birth chart, especial results are possible e.g. when Sun is in 
Capricorn and Saturn is in Leo, then during each others period or sub- 
period excellent effects are experienced pertaining to the houses and 
planets thus related. 

15. In the major period, it is the sub-period planet which will be more 
effective to give results e.g. when Moon and Mars are in conjunction, 
then in the Moon-Mars period accident, injury, violence and such 
happening are more likely. But during Mars-Moon period more beneficial 
effects will be experienced according to the Mars lordship of houses. 
As Mars work as an motivator for the Moon (mind) thought and actions. 

Travelling Direction 

In judging of the direction in which a person will travel, when such is 
shown in the horoscope, or again in the Period., Sub-Period, and sub-sub-*' 
Period, effects, the following rule is usually taken:- 

The first house, with its complements twelfth and second, governs the 
South. 



xviii Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Sy stems 

The tenth, with ninth and eleventh, governs the East 

The seventh, with fifth and eighth, governs the West; and 

The fourth, with third and fifth, governs the North 

Therefore, Mars rules the East; the Moon rules the North; Venus governs 
the West; and Saturn the South. 

Judgment is chiefly to be made from the houses, and next, but 
subserviently, from the signs occupied by the planets. 

In the forthcoming chapters we are attempting to give a clear and 
concise presentation of the essential facts of Dasa systems, and intricacies 
of Vimsottari Dasa, as preached by the ancient Seers and from our own 
experience. 



Chapter 01 

Various Dasas of Planets 



Now let us discuss, the unique feature of Vedic Astrology i.e. the Dasa 
System of planets and its utility in predictions. A good grasp of Vedic Astrology 
is essential to make full use of the effects of a Dasa while making predictive 
analysis. There are different kinds of Dasas pertaining to the various Planets. 
Dasas are planetary periods and sub-periods that rule very precisely defined 
periods of one's life in respective Dasas. 

The Dasas are of various kinds. Amongst them Vimsottari is the most 
appropriate for the general population. 

But the other Dasas, followed in special cases, are Astottari, Shodsottari, 
Dwadasottari, Panchottari, Shatabdika, Chaturashiti-sama 7 Dwisaptati-sama, 
Shashtihayani, and Shattrishant-sama Dasa. 

Our ancients have described these different kinds of Dasas, based on 
Nakshatras. Some MahariShis have made a mention of Kala and Chakra 
Dasa, but they have recognized the Kalachakra Dasa, as supreme. 

The other kinds of Dasas, propagated by the Sages, are Char, Sthir, 
Kendra, Karaka, and Brahmagraha. Apart from these the other Dasas 
are Manduook, Shoola, Yogardha, Driga, Trikona, and Rashi. 

Some different form of Dasas is also prevalent such as Panchswara, 
Yogini, Pinda, Naisargie, Ashtavarga, Sandhya, Pachaka, and Tara Dasa 
etc. 

But all these Dasas are not in common usage. 

Vimsottari Dasa 

The Vimsottari Dasa is considered to be the most appropriate and the 
best of ail Dasas. 

In Kali Yuga the natural lifespan of a human being is generally taken, 
as 120 years, and while calculating the Life span the months are taken of 
30 days and the year consists of 12 months. 

The year of 360 days adopted in Vimsottari Dasa of Hindu Astrology is 
not considered correct and now a day's astrologer recommends the use of 
English Calendar year of 365 days. This theory is against the spirit, practice 
and rationale of Vedic Astrology. 



Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systei 

Since the Astrology was prevalent in India much earlier then the birth 
of the Gregorian English Calendar which is only 2012 years old now. 
According to Mahabharata, in Virat Parva, Chapter, when Arjuna revealed 
his identity after the completion of 18 year's exile, Duryodhana raised a 
technical objection that he had not completed full 13 years, basing his 
calculation on the Solar year of 365 1/4 days. But Bheeshma over ruled the 
objection, saying that Arjuna has completed full 13 years as per lunar year 
of 360 days. It clearly shows that Hindu Shastras recognised only Savana 
year of 360 days for civil and legal purpose. Further, the zodiac is divided 
into 360 degrees as per Savana year of 360 days. By Savana day is 
meant, the period from one rising of the Sun to the next rising. It 
is sixty ghatis or 24 hrs. And 360 such day make one Savana year. 
Savana time / year is the standard time according to which 
astrological calculations are made in Vedic Astrology. 

All those who are using the Lahiri Ephemeris, probably have not been 
observant to take the notice of the "N.B.: The months of Dasas shown in 
this Ephemeris are of 30 days each and the year is of 360 days", given at 
the end of Vimsottari Dasa tables. 

If the results of Dasa, Sub-periods differ among astrologers, it is due 
to various values of Ayanamsa, adopted by astrologers according to their 
pet theories. The Chitra-Paksha Ayanamsa gives very good results, when 
the Moon value is taken with parallax, since the Moon is the nearest to 
Earth and most fast moving too. 

The old Panchang's, some of them were calculated with Moon parallax 
taken in to account. The value of Moon with parallax vary due to speed of 
Moon, which changes from 1 1 deg 30 min to 15 deg 30 min / the parallax 
value is 53.32 min for the least speed and 61.91 min for the maximum 
value, for the middle speed of Moon 1 3 deg 30 min the parallax value will 
be 57.77 min. 

(It is a common knowledge, that to take an aim, to shot with any 
weapon, we have to close one eye; the similar theory is to be applied for 
Moon value also since Moon is closer to Earth, not for distant Planets.) 

The Vimsottari Dasa has two versions:- 

Ifthe native was born in Sukla Paksha (bright half) with the ascendant 
in the Hora of Sun or in Krishna Paksha (dark half) with the ascendant in 
the Hora of Moon, Dasa should start from Ardfa Nakshatra. 



Chapter 1 : Various Dasas of Planets 

In the vice versa case, the Dasa should start from Krittika (as is being 
done presently) i.e. if the native was born in Krishna Paksha (bright half) 
with the ascendant in the Hora of Sun or in Sukla Paksha (dark half) with 
the ascendant in the Hora of Moon, Dasa should start from Krittika Nakshatra. 

Nowadays the main reason for predictions not coming true is that the 
Vimsottari Dasa is calculated frorft Krittika only. 

The Dasa-Phala-Darpan written by Sri Nivas Sharma/ (Pathak) son of 
Mahadeva Pathak of Jatak Tatva has mentioned all these variations in his 
book. Some other books also mention these points. 

Now the important subject of "Dasa" (periods) and Sub-periods of 
planets and the influence of planets on the native of the horoscope, is dealt 
here. 

According to the theory of the great sages, the maximum period in 
stellar measure, or Nakshatra Duration, up to which a man could live is 120 
years, provided the planets are favourably situated. This maximum period 
when converted to solar measure or "souramana" works out to 118 years, 
2 months and 29 days. The number of years in stellar measure that each of 
the planets Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu and 
Venus would bestow on man is 6, 10, 7, 18, 16, 19, 17, and 20 years 
respectively. 

In the Vimsottari Dasa-Starting from Krittika Nakshatra, the Lords of 
Dasas are Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu and Venus 
in that order. 

The process of finding out the period of the planet within which a 
person was born is easy. Thus, when the Nakshatras from Krittika to the 
Birth Nakshatra are divided by nine, the remainder will signify the Lord of 
the commencing Dasa. Counting of stars is in groups of nine. In each 
group, the 1 st and the succeeding stars are governed by Sun, Moon, Mars, 
Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu and Venus respectively- 

The period in current, at the time of birth, will be of the planet that 
governs the constellation that will be ruling at the time of birth. The remaining 
Dasas will be of the Planets in the order given above. 

Similar process is to be followed, when the Dasa is commencing from 
Ardra nakshatra. 

Thus for persons born in the following constellations, Dasa period 
begins with, is that of the planet noted against them. 

The following tables will illustrate the both versions of Vimsottari Dasa.

Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

Having ascertained the period of the particular planet that is in current 
at the time of birth, the next step will be to find out, what portion of that 
period remained afterbirth. 

To find out the remainder of the Dasa, operating at the time of birth, 
first find out the expired portion of the Dasa of the concerned Planet. 
This is done, as follows:-. 

Multiply the Dasa period of the Planet concerned by the period of the 
stay of Moon in Birth Nakshatra, that has expired and divide that amount 
by the total period of the stay of Moon in that Nakshatra. The figure 
are in years, months etc. so arrived at will be the expired period of the 
Dasa. When this figure is deducted from the total period of the Dasa, 
we will get the balance of Dasa at the time of birth. 

The balance of Dasa at birth can be directly known from the table 
named as Balance of Vimsottari Dasa by Longitude of Moon (sidereal in 
any Ephemeris (INDIAN) or Panchanga or book on Vimsottari Dasa having 
such tables. 

THE SUB-PERIODS CALCULATION - KRITTIKADI 

The sub-periods are obtained by multiplying together the years due to 
the planet ruling the period and sub-period; then, leaving off the last figure 
in the product, multiply it by 3, and call the result days, the first figure in 
the product being so many months. 

Thus, to find the sub-period due to the Moon in its own period:- 

The period of the Moon is ten years :- 

10 x 10 = 100= 10 months. 

There is a zero for the last figure of the product, and therefore the 
sub-period has no odd days. Take another example:- 

Find the sub-period due to Mars in the period "of the Sun, the Sun's 
period being six years, and that of Mars seven years. 

7 x 6 = 42 = 4 months 6 days. These are called sub-periods. 

(Last fig:- 2 multiplied by 3= 6 days) 

They are further divided into Sub-sub-period periods. The rule for 
determining their duration is asfollows:- 

1 . Divide the months of the sub-period by 4; this will give so many days, 
hours, etc. 

2. Divide the days of the sub-period by 5; this will give so 
many hours, minutes, etc. 



Chapter 01: Various Dasas of Planets 

3. The days, hours, and minutes thus produced must be multiplied by 
the total period (Dasa) of the planet, whose Sub-sub-period period is 
required. 

Example.-Required the Sub-sub-period of Jupiter in the sub-period of 
Saturn, during the major period (Dasa) of Ketu. 

Ketu Period = 7 years 

Ketu-Saturn Sub-period = 13 months 9 days 

Jupiter Sub-sub-period = required 

By Rule one, 13/4 = 3 days 6 hours 

By Rule two. 9/5 = 1 hour 48 minutes 

Total = 3 days 7 hours 48 minutes 

Apply Rule three:-This period, is multiplied by 16, the total period 
of Jupiter whose Sub-sub-period, is required = 1 month 25 days 9 hours 48 
minutes, which is Jupiter Sub-sub-period in the sub-period of Saturn during 
the major period of Ketu or as one would say: 

In Ketu Dasa during Saturn sub-period: 

The Jupiter sub-sub-period is 1 month 25 days 9 hours and 48 min. as 
per English calendar of 365 'A days. 

3 days x 1 6 = 48days = one month 1 8 days 

18daysx24 = 432hrs 

7 hrs x 16 = 112 hrs 

48 min x 16 =768 min divide by 60 = 12.8 hrs =12 hrs 48 min 

Now add total hrs (432+112+12.8 = 556.8 hrs) 

556.8 hrs divide by 24 = 23 days 4 hrs 48 min 

Jupiter Sub-sub-period, in the sub-period of Saturn, during the period 
of Ketu is 1 month 23 days 4 hrs 48 min for the year is of 360 days as per 
Vedic system ) 

Astottari DASA 

The few sages have recommended the adoption of Astottari Dasa, 
when Rahu is not present in Ascendant, but in any other Kendra - (1 ,4,7,1 0), 
or Trikona - (5,9) to the Lord of the Ascendant. When Rahu is in other 
places in the birth Chart, this Astottari Dasa is not applicable to the Native. 

The Astottari Dasa has also two versions. When there in a planet 
placed in the ascendant, the Dasa is counted from Ardra nakshatra, but 
when there is NO planet in Ascendant, then the Dasa is counted from 
Krittika Nakshatra. 



Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology : Dasa Systems 

(Lahiri Indian Ephemeris also gives Balance of Astottari Dasa by 
longitude of Moon at birth, both from Krittika and Ardra Nakshatra.) 

Astottari Dasa by Ardra Nakshatra- 

Rdt four Nakshatras starling from Ardra commences the Dasa of Sun, 

For next three nakshatra after that i.e. Magha begins the Dasa of 
Moon, 

Rxir nakshatra after that i.e. from Hasta will give the Dasa of Mars, 

Three nakshatra after that i.e. from Anuradha, the Lord of Dasa will be 
Mercury, 

Four nakshatra wherefrom i.e. from Purvasadha will have Saturn as 
the Dasa Lord, 

Three nakshatra thereafter i.e. from Dhanistha, the Lord will be Jupiter, 

Flahu will be the Lord of the Dasa next four Nakshatras after that i.e. 
from U.Bhadrapada r and 

Then Venus will take over the lordship of the Dasa of next three 
Nakshatras from the last one mentioned above i.e. from Krittika. 

Astottari Dasa by Krittika Nakshatra- 

For four Nakshatras starting from Krittika commences the Dasa of 
Sun, 

For next three nakshatra after that begins the Dasa of Moon, 

Four nakshatra after that, will give the Dasa of Mars, 

Three nakshatra after that, the Lord of Dasa will be Mercury, 

Four nakshatra wherefrom will have Saturn as the Dasa Lord, 

Three nakshatra thereafter, the Lord will be Jupiter, 

Rahu will be the Lord of the Dasa for nextfour Nakshatras afterthat 
and 

Then Venus will take over the lordship of the Dasa of next three 
Nakshatras. 

The Lord of the Dasa at birth will be determined by counting in this 
order up to the Birth Nakshatra. 

The duration of Astottari Dasa for Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, 
Jupiter, Rahu and Venus Dasas are 6, 15, 8, 17, 10, 19, 12 and 21 
years in respective order.

Chapter 01: Various Dasas of Planets 11 

Note: That in this Dasa system only Eight Planets play the role of 
Dasa Lords, Ketu having been denied this privilege. 

Further the malefic planets are allotted four nakshatra and the benefic 
planets are allotted only three nakshatras. 

The Dasas of the various Planets have been specified above. In the 
case of malefic Planets the Dasa span of one Nakshatra is 1 A of the 
Dasa of the Planet It is l/3 rd in the case of benefic. Thus the expired 
portion of the Dasa is calculated, according to the method, followed 
for Vimsottari Dasa, by Multiplying the Bhayat, i.e. the expired period 
of the stay of Moon in the Birth Nakshatra, by the Dasa portion of the 
Birth Nakshatra and dividing it by Bhabhog, i.e. the total period of the 
stay of Moon in the Birth Nakshatra. Then the balance of Dasa at birth 
can also be ascertained. 

When Uttarasadha happens to be the Birth Nakshatra, the duration of 
its first three Padas is taken, as Bhabhog and the Dasa calculations 
should be done accordingly. 

The Dasa and calculations for Abhijit Nakshatra (19 Ghati). are done by 
taking the 4 th Pad (4 Ghati) of Uttarasadha plus the 15 th part of the 
beginning of Sravana, For Sravana the Bhabhog would be the total of 
its duration in Ghatis minus the 1 /1 5* part of the beginning of Sravana.

Shodsottari Dasa 

It will be advisable to adopt the Shodsottari, When the birth is in the 
day in Krishna Paksha (dark half of the month), or at night in Sukla Paksha 
(bright half). 

The Dasa may be adopted, when the Ascendant is in the Hora of Moon 
with birth in the Krishna Paksha, or, when Ascendant is in the Hora of 
Sun with birth in the Sukla Paksha 

Count the number of Nakshatras from Pusya to the Birth Nakshatra. 
Divide this number by 8. The remainder will indicate the Dasas of Sun, 
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Ketu, Moon, Mercury and Venus. The Dasas of 
the above Planets are of 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17and 18 years. Total

Kala Dasa 

Both day and night consist of 60 Ghatis i.e. 24 hours, morning and 
evening twilight is of 10 Ghatis i.e. two hours, each. 

5 Ghatis before the sight of the semi-disk of the setting Sun and 5 
Ghatis after that and 5 Ghatis before and after the rising of Sun, that 
is 10 Ghatis in the evening and 10 Ghatis in the morning, respectively. 
The total period of both these Sandhya (twilight) is said to be 20 
Ghatis. 

The 20 Ghatis of the night have been given the name Poorna and the 
20 Ghatis of the day have been given the name Mugdha. The Sandhya 
at the time of sunrise is called Khanda and the Sandhya at the time of 
sunset is said to be Sudha. Both of these Sandhya are of 10 Ghatis 
each. 

When the birth is in Poorna, or Mugdha, its past Ghatis should be 
multiplied by 2 and the product should be divided by 15. The figure so 
arrived at should be Converted into years, months etc. 

By multiplying it by the serial number 1,2,3, etc., of Sun and other 
Planets in their normal order, we will get the Kala Dasa of these Planets. 

When the birth is during Sandhya, then its past Ghatis should be 
multiplied by 4 and the product is divided by 15. 

The figure so arrived at is in terms of years, months etc. should be 
Multiplied by the serial number 1,2,3, etc., of Sun and the other Planets, 
to obtain the Kala Dasa of all-the nine Planets. 

Chakra 

The Chakra Dasa can be maximum of there types:- 

When the birth is at night, the Dasa will commence from Ascendant 
Rasi. 

When the birth is during the day, the Dasa will start from the Rasi, in 
which the Lord of Ascendant is placed. 

When the birth is during twilight of evening, the Dasa will begin from 
the Rasi of the second Bhava. 

The Dasa of each Rasi is 10 years respectively. Since, it is the Dasa 
system of the 12 Rasis in the Zodiac; it has been named, as Chakra 
Dasa. 

Another version:- 

In this Dasa, the planet placed in the ascendant has the first Dasa, 
thereafter Dasa off pilaim^te placed in 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th house respectively 
of 12 rasi will commence. 



Chapter 01: Various Dasas of Planets 29 

When more then one planet is placed in one house, the order of Dasa 
will be starting from the planet having highest degrees to the lowest, 
in the descending order. 

The duration of Dasa of planet, will be equal to the Rasi number placed 
in the concerned house. 

Monthly calculation will be in proportion of degrees of the planet in the 
respective Rasi years. 30 degree is equal to duration of Dasa years of 
a planet. 

Kalachakra 

Now let us describe the Kalachakra Dasa. 

The basis for Kalachakra Dasa is the Nakshatra Pada or the quarter in 
which the Moon is placed. 

Normally the Kalachakra Dasa should be applied:- 

When Venus is strong, 

The lord of Navamsa, where the Moon is placed joins or aspect the 
Moon and, 

The lord of such a Navamsa is strongly placed. 

However Kalachakra Dasa can be applied with great advantage in most 
cases and now days there are many versions, which one to follow depends 
on your experience and choice. 

5," 21 , 7, 9, 10, 16 and 4 are the numbers representing the Kalachakra 
period in years respectively of the Seven planets counted from the Sun and 
are the chief source for ascertaining the benefic and malefic results. 

One of the peculiar features of this system is the importance 
given to Deha and Jiva. 

In the Savya order of Nakshatras, the first of the signs indicated by the 
formula signifies the Deha and the last (or 9 th ) signifies the Jiva. For 
Example:- 

Take Punarvasu (Savya group) first quarter- 
According to the formula, Aries, the first sign isthe Deha and Sagittarius 
the last sign isthe Jiva. In regard to Mrigasiras 2 (Apsavya) the Jiva is 
Gemini and the Deha is Taurus. 

When Deha is conjoined by malefic planets there will be much bodily 
affliction. When Jiva is afflicted, death or a calamity is shown. Affliction 
to Deha or Jiva by more than one malefic planet signifies calamitous 
happenings. Death can take place in the Dasa of the Rasi corresponding 
to the afflicted Deha or Jiva. 



30 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

When benefic occupy Jiva and Deha signs auspicious results may 
happen. Serious disease or even ultimate death is likely when two or 
three malefic afflict Deha or Jiva. 

According to Classics, when the Sun, Rahu, Mars or Saturn joins either 
Deha or Jiva, death is certain to occur in the Dasa of the sign of Deha or 
Jiva. 

It is necessary that in the interpretation of the affliction to Jiva or 
Deha, mind should be intelligently applied, so that a deterministic approach 
is not taken and a literal interpretation is avoided, only inference to be 
drawn. 

Astrology being a science of tendencies - the interpretation cautions 
us, that the person's health may be severely affected so that appropriate 
remedial measures could be resorted to. 

Any malefic in Deha Rasi signify disease, 

while Jiva afflicted likewise indicates extreme fear and apprehension. 

If two malefic afflict- mental suffering, 

If three malefic- accidents; and four malefic denote certain death. 

If Deha and Jiva are both occupied by a malefic, fear from the rulers, 
trouble from thieves should be anticipated. 

If Sun is the afflicting planet, likelihood of out-break or fear of fire; 

if waning Moon is the afflicting planet, fear of drowning or accidents 
involving water, 

Mars causes injury from weapons or dangerous instruments; 

Mercury causes inflammation ofVata in body; 

Jupiter causes trouble in the stomach; 

Venus indicates fire accident; 

Saturn afflicting Jiva-health problem involving the spleen (gulma 
diseases); 

Rahu or Ketu indicates fear of being poisoned or being bitten by 
venomous insects, or atmospheric pollution, etc. 

If Deha and Jiva signs are occupied by Mercury, Jupiter or Venus, one 
can experience comforts in life, good fortune and redemption from sorrow. 

If both benefic and malefic influence Deha and Jiva, mixed results will 
follow. 

In Kala chakra Dasa- By drawing vertical and horizontal lines, prepare 
2 Charts, Savya and Apsavya, of 12 Compartments each. From the second 



Chapter 01: Various Dasas of Planets 31 

Compartment in each Chart fix the Rasis-Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, 
Leo, Virgo, Tula, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces. Then 
Nakshatras may be incorporated in the manner, indicated hereafter. These 
Charts, indicative of the 12 Rasis, are called Kala Chakra. 

Write Asvini, Bharani and Krittika in the Savya Chakra and Rohini, 
Mrigasiras, Ardra in the Apsavya. Then incorporate the three following 
Nakshatras, Punarvasu, Pusya and Aslesa in the Savya and Magha, 
P.Phalguni and Uttaraphalguni in the Apsavya. 

Then incorporatethethreefollowing-Hast, Citraand Svati in the Savya 
and -Visakha, Anuradha and Jyestha in the Apsavya. Then incorporate- 
Mula, Purvasadha and Uttarasadha in the Savya and 

Sravana, Dhanistha and Satabhisaj in the Apsavya. Finally incorporate 
the last three Nakshatras-Purba bhadrapada, Uttar bhadrapada and 
Revati in the Savya Chakra. 

Now there will be 15 Nakshatras in the Savya and 12 Nakshatras in the 
Apsavya, (because for the 1 2 Rasis there are 12 Padasof3 Nakshatras,- 
the Navamsas). The Padas of Asvini, Punarvasu, Hast, Mula, Purba 
bhadrapada, Krittika, Aslesa, Svati, Uttarasadha and Revati of the Savya 
should be reckoned in the same manner, as the Padas of Asvini. 

Now let us know, how the Deha and Jiva should be reckoned 
in the Padas (quarters) of the Nakshatras. 

All those who are born in the 1 st Pada of Asvini, Aries is indicative of

the fourth, to Cancer-Moon; the fifth, to Leo-Sun; 

the sixth, to Virgo-Mercury; the seventh, to Libra-Venus; 

the eighth, to Scorpio-Mars; and 

the ninth, to Sagittarius-Jupiter.

9) Aries-Mars, 

The description of the Deha and Jiva of the Padas of the Apsavya 
Nakshatras and the Dasa Lords is the same. 

The Dasa spans of the Dasa Lords, is described earlier. How the 
commencement of the Dasa, it's expired and the remaining periods at 
the birth are to be calculated as follows. 

The span of life of a person is determined from the Padas (Amsa) of 
the Nakshatra at the time of birth, or the time of query and the years 
allotted to the 9 Signs, commencing from it (the Pad of the Nakshatra). 

Some sages are of the view, that the person will enjoy full span of life 
(Poorna Ayu), When his birth is at the commencement of the Padas, 
will have middle span of life (Madhya Ayu), When the birth is in the 
middle of the Padas and short span of life (Alp Ayu), or will face death- 
like sufferings, When the birth is at the end Qf the Padas of the 
,_ Nakshatra. 

The Sub-period or Sub-period of any of the Planets constituting 
a Mahadasa is obtained in the manner as stated below. 

Ascertain the relevant mnemonicaHy syllable (out of the 9 syllables) 
composing a formulae whose Sub-period is wanted and find outthe owner 
of the sign indicated by that syllable. Multiply the number of years assigned 
to this Planet by the numbers of years fixed forthe planet whose Mahadasa 
is under consideration and divide the product by the total number of years 
constituting the entire Ayu (age) of the formula orChakra. The quotient in 
years etc, will represent the sub-period required. 

The total number of years denoted by the sum of the nine mnemonlcally 
syllables of any formula represents the number in years of Parma Ayu for 
that formula. Accordingly, the Parma Ayu in years for the Amsa of the 12 



Chapter 01: Various Dasas of Planets 35 

signs (12 Rasi amsa) counted from Aries in an Apsavya Chakra will be 100, 
85, 83 and 86 repeated thrice while those for the Amsa of the 12 signs 
(Rasi amsa) counted from Scorpio in a Savya Chakra will be same but in 
the reverse order, i.e., 86, 83, 85 and 100 repeated thrice. 

Whatever effects in respect to the several Major periods are stated, 
the same should be applied 

i) Asvini, Bharani, Krittika - the three constellations have 12 quarters 
(Pada). 

a) Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer - the four navamsa constitute the 
four quarters of Asvini. 

b) Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio - the four Navamsa are in Bharani. 

c) Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces fall in Krittika, this way 
divide the three constellations into these 12 navamsa. 

ii) From Rohini the three constellations are Rohini, Mrigasiras, Ardra - 
these three have 12 navamsa. 

Counting them in the reverse order from Scorpio - i.e. Scorpio, Libra, 
Virgo, Leo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aries, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, 
Sagittarius divide them in 12 navamsa. Rohini first quarter will be Scorpio, 
second quarter will be Libra and so on. In this order Ardra fourth quarter 
will be Sagittarius Navamsa. 

In the manner mentioned above in (i) the order of counting is kept for 
the constellations of Punarvasu, Pusya, Aslesa and the order in (ii) should 
be adhered for Magha, Purba Phalguni, Uttaraphalguni, again the order of 
(i) is followed for Hasta, Chitra, Svati and (ii) is followed for Visakha, 
Anuradha, Jyestha; the same order used in (i) is kept for Mula, Purvasadha, 
Uttarasadha and the order used in (ii) is followed for Sravana, Dhanistha 
and Satabhisaj and the same order used in (i) above be kept for Purba 
bhadrapada, Uttar bhadrapada and Revati. 

The years of a sign is the same as the years of its lord. 

Sun has 5 years (the sign of Sun is Leo - therefore the period of Leo is 
of 5 years. 

Moon has 21 years (Cancer is ruled by Moon and so the period of 
Cancer will be of 21 years). 

The Years of other planets, which are also of their signs, are given 
below:- 



36 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

Mars-Aries-Scorpio 7 years for each 

Mercury-Gemini-Virgo 9 years for each 

Jupiter-Sagittarius-Pisces 10 years for each 

Venus-Taurus-Libra 16 years for each 

Saturn-Capricorn-Aquarius 4 years for each 

The rule is to predict the effect of the periods of signs in Kalachakra 
Dasa is according to the (i) sign and (ii) its lord. Therefore in Kalachakra 
Dasa it is not said that the Dasa is of Mars or Aries but that the Dasa 
(period) is of Aries-Mars. In the same manner of Scorpio-Mars. 

The influence and effect of Mars will be the same in both its signs of 
Aries and Scorpio but suppose Mars is in Aries and Jupiter etc. benefic 
planets are also placed in Aries; and in Scorpio, Saturn, Rahu etc. malefic 
planets are in position then the period of Aries-Mars will be good. But 
Scorpio-Mars will show ill effects. 

Now let us know how the calculations are made, according to the 
proportion of the Padas of a Nakshatra. The number of Asvini etc., 
whichever may be the past Nakshatras, should be divided by 3. 
Thereafter the remainder should be multiplied by 4. To the figure so 
made available, the Pad of the present Nakshatra should be added. 
The product will be the Navamsa sign from Aries onwards. 

The number of years (PoornaAyu) are, as under. Forthe Amsa in Aries 
100 years, in Taurus 85 years, in Gemini 83 years, in Cancer 86 years. 
The number of years will be the same for Signs, situated the 5 th and 
9 th to them. 

Multiply the past Ghatis, Pata etc. of the Pad of the Nakshatra, in 
which a person is born, by the existing Dasa years and divide it by 15. 
The result will indicate the expired period of the Dasa in years, months 
etc. By deducting it from the total number of years allotted, we get the 
balance of Dasa at birth. The Dasa should be taken, as commencing 
from that Sign. 

Multiply the past Ghatis, Pala etc. of the present Pad of the Nakshatra 
by the number of years and divide the product by the fourth part of 
Bhabhog, The years etc. so obtained may then be deducted from the 
total Dasa period. The result will be the balance of Dasa at birth in 
years, months etc. 

The past Kala (minutes) of the Navamsa, in which Moon may be placed, 
should be multiplied by the years, allotted to the Dasa and the product 
should be divided by 200. The resulting years etc., will be the expired 
portion of the Dasa. By deducting them from the total number of years 
the balance of the Dasa at birth is obtained. 



Chapter 01: Various Dasas of Planets 37 

In the Savya Chakra the first Amsa is called Deha and the last Jiva. 
The reverse is the pattern in the Apsavya Chakra. Therefore the 
calculations should be based on the Deha etc., in the Savya Chakra, 
and the basis is Jiva etc., in Apsavya chart. 

Movement of Signs in the Kala Chakra 

There are three kinds of movements of the Signs in the Kala Chakra, 
namely Mandooki, Markati and Simhavlokan. The movement of one Sign 
by jumping over one Sign is known, as Mandooki Movement. Backward 
movement to the previous Sign is called Markati Movement. The movement 
of a Sign to the 5* and 9 th Rasi is said to be Simhavlokan. 

Movement from Virgo to Cancer and from Leo to Gemini is Mandooki 
Movement. Movement from Leo to Cancer is Markati Movement. 
Movement from Pisces to Scorpio and from Sagittarius to Aries is called 
Simhavlokan Movement. 

Effects of Dasas of Signs, as a Result of these Movements 

The effects of the Dasa of the Rasis with Mandooki Movement in the 
Savya Chakra are distress to friends, relations, parents and elders and 
there is likely to be cause of trouble from poison, weapons, thieves 
and enemies. 

In the Mandooki Dasa of the Movement of a Rasi from Leo to Gemini 
there is the likelihood of the death of the mother, or self, trouble from 
Government and possibility of brain fever. 

The effects of the Dasa of Rasi with Markati Movement in the Savya 
Chakra are loss of wealth, agricultural products and animals, death of 
father, or an elderly close relation and feeling of lethargy. 

The effects of the Dasa of the Signs with Simhavlokan Movement in 
the Savya Chakra are possibility of injury from animals, loss of harmony 
with friends, distress to near relations, drowning in a well, fall from 
animals, and possibility of harm from poison, weapons and diseases 
and destruction of residential house or dwelling. 

In the Dasa of the Signs with the Mandooki Movement in the Apsavya 
Chakra the effects will be distress to wife and conditions, loss of children, 
possibility of feverish conditions and loss of service. 

In the Dasa of the Signs with the Markati Movement there may be 
danger from watery places, loss of position, distress to father, 
punishment from authority or Government and wandering in the forests; 

In the Dasa of the Signs with the Simhavlokan movement there may 
be loss of status destruction of the dwelling and death of father or 
close relation etc.

When the Sign is occupied by a malefic planet, adverse conditions 
may be expected in the Dasa of the Sign. 

Favourable effects will be felt in its Dasa, when the Sign is occupied 
with a benefic. 



In the Kala Chakra Dasa favourable and unfavourable effects 

may be predicted, after taking into account the directions of the Signs and 
Planets. 

When the movement is from Virgo to Cancer, good results are realized 
in places located in the East and at that time journeys to the places in 
the North prove fruitful. Unfavourable effects will be felt in places 
located in the West and the South. It will be advisable not to undertake 
journeys in those directions in the Dasa of these Signs. 

When the movement is from Leo to Gemini, no journey should be 
undertaken to places, located in the East. However, the journeys to 
the South-West will prove fruitful in the Dasa of those Signs. 

When the movement is from Cancer to Leo, journeys during that period 
to the South will prove unfavourable and result in loss and the native 
has to return from the South to the West. 

When the movement is from Pisces to Scorpio there will distress, when 
the native goes to the North. 

When the movement is from Sagittarius to Capricorn, The same would 
happen, i.e., there will distress, 

Whe'n the movement is from Sagittarius to Aries, there may be ill 
health, imprisonment, or death, 

When the movement is from Sagittarius to Scorpio, there may be gains, 
comforts and property and marriage, 



Chapter 01 : Various Dasas of Planets

Favourable and unfavourable effects due to placeent of planets 
in Deha & Jiva signs. 

When the Deha signs or Jiva Signs are occupied with Sun, Mars, Saturn, 
or Rahu, the native may die. 

When the Deha and Jiva Signs are occupied with two, or all of them, 
worse results may be expected, 

When there is a malefic in Deha Sign, the native suffers ill health; a 
malefic in a Jiva Sign will make the native very timid. 

When the Deha and/or Jiva Rasi are occupied with two malefic, there 
will be distress, and diseases. 

When there are three malefic in the Deha and/or Jiva Rasi, it will cause 
premature death. 



44 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

Four malefic in the Deha and Jiva Sign will cause definite death. 

When both the Deha and Jiva Rasis are occupied by malefic, there will 
be fear from king and thieves and death of the native. 

When Sun is in the Deha signs or Jiva Sign, there will be danger from 
fire. 

Moon in the Deha signs or Jiva signs will cause danger from water, 

Mars in the Deha signs or Jiva signs fear from weapons, 

Mercury in the Deha signs or Jiva signs fear from windy troubles,

and will have good health. 

Mixed results may be expected, when the Deha Rasis and Jiva Rasis 
are occupied by both benefic and malefic. 

In the Dasa of the Signs, owned by malefic, the body and soul will be 
in distress. The effects will be favourable in the Dasa of the Signs, 
owned by benefic. 

When a malefic Sign is occupied by a benefic Planet, or, When a benefic 
Sign is occupied by a malefic Planet, the effects will be of a mixed 
nature. 

Effects of Kala Chakra Dasa of the Rasis in Ascendant and other 
Bhavas.

Char Dasa 

Char Dasa relates to twelve houses and correspondingly it pertains to 
the sign of the twelve houses. 

In the Char Dasa system, the number of signs from the sign of the 
house, up to the lord of the sign will denote the number of years of the 
Dasa of the said sign. These signs put together in succession from 
Aries constitute one quarter (Pada). In order to ascertain the period of 
Char Dasa, the counting of the signs of odd quarters (1 ,3) , be done in 
forward order, while for signs of even quarters (2, 4), it should be in 
reverse order. 

Sign are odd and even sign. But here the division in different. 
The new division is as follows: 

The zodiac is divided in four parts of 90Â° each i.e. 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd and 4 th 
part thus in the 1 st part will the three signs starting from Aries sign. 

In the 2 nd part will be three signs starting from Cancer sign. 

In the 3 rd part will be three signs starting from Libra sign. 

In the 4 th part will be three signs starting from Capricorn sign. 

Now 1 st & 3 rd part signs are odd group of signs. 2 nd & 4 th part signs are 
even group signs. 

Now let us see the working out of the Dasa years of Scorpio 
and Aquarius. 

When both the Lords of the two Signs- Scorpio and Aquarius, are 
placed in their own Signs, their Dasa will be of 1 2 years, otherwise the 
Dasa will be of the number of years, indicated by the number, counted 
from that Sign to the Sign, occupied by its Lord. 

When one Planet be in his own Sign and the other in any other Sign, 
the Dasa will be of the number of years counted, from the above first 
Sign to the other. When the both Lords are in different Signs, the 
forward or reverse, counting should be in respect of the planet, which 
is stronger, up to the Sign. 

The Sign, which has a Planet, placed in it, is considered more powerful, 
than the Sign without a Planet in it. When both signs are with Planets 
in them, the one with more Planets would be considered more powerful. 
When both Signs are occupied by an equal number of Planets, the 
strength of the Sign itself should betaken into account. 

The principle for considering the strength of the Sign is that the Fixed 
Sign is considered stronger, tnan the Movable sign and the Dual Sign is 
considered more powerful than the Fixed Sign. When there is equality 



ChapterOI: Various Dasas of Planets 47 

in the strength of the Signs, then to determine the number of years of 
Dasa counting should be done up to the Sign with bigger number. 

When one Sign is occupied by a Planet in exaltation, the counting 
should be done up to that Sign only. In addition, one should be added 
in the number of years in the case of a Sign, with an exalted Planet, 
and one should be deducted from the number of years in the case of 
a Sign with a Planet in debilitation. The prediction should be made 
after calculating the Dasas in this manner. 

When the Sign in Ninth house, Bhava is in an odd Pada, the counting 
should be from the Sign in the Ascendant onwards. The counting would 
be in the reverse order, When the Pada is even. The Dasas of Sign 
have to be fixed, keeping this in view. 

Sthir Dasa 

Now let us describe the Sthir Dasa. 

In this Dasa system 7, Sand 9 years are the Dasa spans of the Movable, 
Fixed and Dual Signs. 

In this system the Dasa of the 12 Signs begins from the sign where 
Brahma Planet is placed. The Dasas are counted onwards from the 
odd Signs and in the reverse order from the even Signs. 

Let us know, how the Brahma Planet is picked out in a chart. 

From amongst the Lords of sixth, Eighth and twelfth house, the Planet 
who possesses the greatest strength, and is placed in Ascendant, or in 
Seventh house with strength, or the one, placed in an odd Sign within 
sixth Bhava from the Bhava concerned, is called the Brahma Planet. 

The Lord of Eighth house in Eighth house is also accepted, as Brahma 
Planet. 

When Saturn, or Rahu/Ketu can not obtain Brahmatva (qualifications 
of Brahma Planet). When they do qualify for Brahma Planet, then the 
planet placed in sixth sign from them orthe sign lord of that sixth sign 
will be Brahma Planet. 

When a number of Planets obtain Brahmatva, the one with the largest 
number of degrees would become Brahma Planet. 

When there is parity in the degrees of such Planets, the most powerful 
amongst them would become Brahma Planet. 

Yogardha Dasa 

The spans of Dasas of the Signs in the Yogardha Dasa system are half 
of the total of the spans of Char and Sthir Dasas. 



48 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

The Dasa will commence from the Sign of Ascendant, or Seventh house, 
whichever is stronger. 

The order of the Dasas of the 12 Rasis will be counted onwards, When 
the opening Dasa Sign is an odd one. When it be an even Sign, the 
Dasas will be in reverse order. 

Kendradi Dasa 

In this system there are Dasas of Fixed Signs in the Kendra etc. from 
Ascendant, or from Seventh house, whichever is stronger. 

When Ascendant or Seventh house with strength is placed in an odd 
Sign, in the Kendra etc., Dasa are counted in the onward order. When 
it be in an even Sign, the counting will be in the backward, or reverse 
order. 

In these also the Dasas would be in the order of comparative strength 
of the Signs. 

The order of Dasas of signs would be the same, as reckoned from the 
ATMA Karaka. 

The duration of Dasas of signs would be the same, as they are in the 
Char Dasa. 

In calculating the years of Dasas for Planets, counting is done from 
the Planet to his own Sign. The years of Dasas would be the number, 
arrived at by counting up to the Sign of the Planet, which is stronger, 
or more in number. 

When a Planet is owning two Signs, the Dasa years will be equal to the 
number, which is greater, when counted from the Rasi, occupied by 
him. 

Notes- Under this system Dasas are of two kinds, namely Ascendant 
Kendradi and ATMA Karaka Kendradi. There is also Kendradi Sign Dasa, or 
Kendradi Planet Dasa in both the Dasa systems, mentioned above. 

Karaka Dasa 

The system, under which the first Dasa is of the ATMA Karaka and the 
subsequent Dasas are of the remaining seven Karakas in their order is 
known, as Karaka Dasa. 

In this system the Dasa years are equal to the number of Signs, counted 
from Ascendant up to the respective Karaka. 

The Karaka are -ATMA, Amatya, Bhratri, Math, Pitri, Putra, Gnati, Dara 
karaka. 



ChapterOi: Various Dasas of Planets 49 

Manduka Dasa 

Under the Manduka Dasa system the Dasa commences from Ascendant, 
or Seventh house, whichever is stronger for a Male native, but for female 
native always count from seventh house. 

When the Sign of commencement is an odd Sign, the Dasas of 3 
Movable, 3 Fixed and 3 Dual Signs will be counted in the onwards 
order. They will be in the reverse order in the case of an even Sign. 

Here Dasa of Rasis which are in the angles are adopted. 

In this system the Dasa years will be the same, as in Sthir Dasa. The 
Dasa years are 7, 8, 9 years according to moveable, fixed or common 
sign respectively. 

In this system every Dasa is of the next 3 rd Sign (i.e., jumping over 
two signs) 

Another version :- 

The first Dasa should be of sign in ascendant, or second, orthird sign, 
which ever is stronger. 

Shoola Dasa 

Some sages have designed the Shoola Dasa for ascertaining the timing 
of death. 

In this system the Dasa commences from Second house, or Eighth 
house, with-respect-to Ascendant, whichever is stronger? 

When the leading Sign is an odd one, the order of the Dasa Signs will 
be onwards. It will be backwards in the case of an even sign. 

The Dasa years in this system are, as adopted for the Sthir Dasa. The 
Dasa years are 7, 8, 9 years according to moveable, fixed or common 
sign respectively. 

There is a possibility that death occurs in the Dasa of the Maraka Sign, 
which has greater strength. 

Trikona (Trine) Dasa 

In this system the first Dasa commences from the strongest amongst 
the Signs in Trine to the Ascendant (First house, Fifth house and Ninth 
house). 

This system is similar to the Char Dasa. 

Here also the Dasas of the Signs adopted, will be in the forward order 
in the case of odd Signs, and in the reverse order in the case of even 
Signs. The Dasa years will be similar to that of Char Dasa. It has been 



50 Encyclopedia of Vedlc Astrology: Dasa Systems 

named Trikona because of the commencement of the Dasa is from the 
Signs in Konas. 

Driga (Aspect) Dasa 

In this system the order of the Dasas is, as follows:- 

From the Ascendant - the Sign, occupying Ninth house, the Signs, 
receiving a Aspect from the Sign in Ninth house, 

The Sign in Tenth, the Rasis, receiving a Aspect from the Sign in Tenth, 

Lastly the Sign in Eleventh house and the Signs, receiving a Aspect 
from the Sign in Eleventh house. 

In this system the sequence of Dasa is decided based on Rasi Aspects, 
hence, it has been named, as Driga (Aspect) Dasa 

Three different processes are adopted for the Movable, Fixed and Dual 
Signs starting from Ninth house, Tenth and Eleventh house. 

According to them, Sign, which receives an Aspect from the Movable 
Sign, is counted backwards and the Sign, receiving a Aspect from the 
Fixed Sign, is counted onwards. In the case of the Dual Sign, When it 
is odd, the counting is onwards and the order is backwards in case of 
an even Sign, forthe Signs, receiving a Aspect. 

Ascendantadi Rasi Dasa 

Every Nakshatra in this system has Dasas of all the 12 Signs, including 
Ascendant. 

Consequently the Bhayat at birth may be multiplied by 12 and then 
the product should be divided by Bhabhog. The resultant Sign, degree 
etc. so available, be added to the longitude of Ascendant. When the 
sum of the signs is more then 12 signs, subtract 12 signs and balance 
sign is taken. 

The Sign, available by above calculation, will startthe Dasas of the 12 
Signs. (When that Sign is odd, the counting will be onwards. It will be 
in the reverse order, when the Sign is even) 

For finding the balance of Dasa at birth, multiply the expired degree 
etc., by the Dasa years of the first Dasa Rasi and divide it by 30. 

The years etc. so arrived at may be de ducted from the Dasa years. 

The result will indicate the balance of Dasa at birth in years, months 
etc. 



Chapter 01: Various Dasas of Planets 51 



Panchswara Dasa 

Beginning from Akaradhi five Swaras (a, i, u, e, o), write underneath 
them the Varnas in six rows. 

Leave out the letters ia, a and ea, because they are not used in names. 
When they are found in any name, ga may be substituted for ia, jafor 
a and da for ea for working out the Dasas and making predictions. 

In this manner the Swaras, under which the first Varnas of the name 
ofthe native is found, will determine the order ofthe Dasas of the five 
Swaras. 

The Dasas are of 12 years for all the five Swaras. In the Dasa of every 
Swaras there will be Sub-period Dasas of all the five Swaras in the 
same order. 

Yog in i Dasa 

Now us discuss the Yogini Dasa. 

There are eight Yogini Dasa, namely Mangla, Pingala, Dhanya, Bhramari, 
Bhadrika, Ulka, Siddha and Sankata. 

The planets- Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Venus and 
Rahu are the respective lords of these. 

Add three to the Birth Nakshatra and divide it by eight. The remainder 
will indicate the Yogini Dasa of Mars, etc., in the serial order. The 
Dasas are in the order of 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 years span. 

The balance of Dasa at birth should be worked out from the Bhayat 
and Bhabhog method. 

THE EFFECTS OF YOGINI DASA 

During the Mangla Dasa ofthe Moon, there will be calm of mind, all 
round success in business, enjoying good food, getting wife, children, 
ornaments, clothes, gems, cattle wealth and land and extending honour 
to Brahmins. 

Before declaring anything, examine the strength ofthe Moon in a 
nativity. In the first ten days ofthe lunar month, the Moon possesses 
moderate strength, during the next ten days he is of utmost strength 
and therefore is considered most auspicious. During the last ten days 
his strength is on the wane and the effect also begins to decline. 

When in a nativity the Sun occupies a bad position, during his Pingala 
Dasa, he will cause quarrel, sudden displeasure ofthe Sovereign, 
discomfort and disease amongst relatives fruitless wandering, painful 



52 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

mental anguish, and danger from fire to hidden wealth, grain, sons 
and wife. 

When in a nativity the Sun occupied a good position, during his Pingala 
Dasa, he will cause acquisition of wealth through unkind acts, journeys, 
authority and disputes; wandering through forests and mountains; 
great reputation, promotion of business, severity in devotion to duty 
and happiness. 

When Jupiter, Dhanya Dasa is operating, there will be observation of 
some religious ceremonies, acquisition of children, recognition from 
the ruler and applauses from great men. The native will get elephants, 
horses and vehicles; meeting his wife, children and friends and have 
the pleasure of fulfilling his desires. 

Mars, during his Bhramari Dasa in a nativity, will cause the person 
concerned get wealth through fire, the king, disputes and the like. 
Money will flow in through administering medicines, falsehood, cheating 
and several other misdeeds. He will constantly suffer from bilious 
complaints, blood poisoning and fever; adultery with low women; 
quarrelling with his own wife, children, relations and elders including 
the preceptor, and thus be miserable; and he will be busy promoting 
others fortune. 

During the Bhadrika Dasa of Mercury, there will be meeting of friends, 
personal comforts, reputation praise from the learned, favour from 
elders, cleverness in speech, service to others, and happiness to wife, 
children, friends etc., acquisition of fame. 

During the Ulka, Dasa of Saturn, the wife and children of the native 
suffer from gout, rheumatism or such windy ailments; he suffers loss 
in agriculture, by loose tongue, adultery with wicked women, desertion 
of servants, living in foreign land; and sudden loss of relatives, lands, 
happiness and wealth. 

During the Siddha Dasa of Venus, the native will get material and 
facility for his sport and pleasure, good vehicles, cows, gems, 
ornaments, treasure. He will have the opportunity to enjoy the company 
of young ladies, intellectual pursuits and voyage etc. He will perform 
benevolent deeds and receive great honour from the state. 

During the Sankata Dasa of Rahu the native should expect trouble 
from the ruler, thieves, poison, fire and weapons, children falling sick, 
loss of tranquillity of mind; loss of relatives, slighted by low people, 
scandal due to a breach of decorum, termination from an office, insulted 
and kicked, and failure of business enterprise. 



Chapter 1 : Various Dasas of Planets 53 

Should Rahu be conjoined with a benefic and be posited in an auspicious 
house his Sankata Dasa will prove not only auspicious but raise the 
native to affluence like that of a king. All his desires will be fulfilled and 
he will enjoy happiness in his house. There will be steady accumulation 
of wealth and he will become quite celebrated. 

Pinda, Amsa and Naisargika or Ashtakavarga Dasas. 

The Pinda, Amsa and Naisargika Dasa will be corresponding to Pinda- 
ayu, Amsa-ayu and Naisargika-ayu (Full span 120 years). 

The order of Dasas will be, as follows. 

The first will be of Ascendant, Sun, or Moon, whoever is stronger. 

The subsequent Dasas will be of Planets in Kendra (1 ,4,7,10) to them, 
then of Planets in Panaphara (2,5,8,1 1) Bhavas and lastly in Apoklima 
(3,6,9,12) Bhavas. 

The Dasas and Sub-period of Ascendant and the seven Planets will 
also be in the same order. 

The effects of these Dasas will be in accordance with Ashtakavarga 
strength. 

These Dasas are also called Ashtakavarga Dasas. 

Planetary Divisions and Sub-divisions of Life Known as 
Periods and Sub-periods and their Effects 

Naisargika Dasa 

The Naisargika (natural) Periods in the case of all beings are those of 
the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, the Sun and Saturn in the order 
stated, and their periods are respectively 1,2,9, 20, 18, 20 and 50 years. 

If the Naisargika Period and the ordinary planetary Period sub-period 
happen to run together, such period will be a prosperous one. 

According to Yavaneswara, after the closing period, (Le. after 120 
years) is the Naisargika Lagna Period prevails. This is objected to by some. 
But does somebody lives beyond 120 years in the present days. 

Initially determine, whichever of the following three is powerful, the 
Rising Sign, the Sun and the Moon, his period comes first. Then followthe 
periods of the planets occupying the Kendra houses, from such powerful 
rising sign or the Sun or the Moon. Then come the periods of the planets 
occupying, the Panaphara houses from the same; and lastly come the 
periods of planets occupying the Apoklima houses. 



54 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

If there are no planets in kendras from above Period lords, those in 
cadent house will have their Period and in case there are no planets even in 
cadent houses from a particular Period, lord the planets in succeedant 
house will have their Period. 

If more than one planet is situated in a sign, the planet who has 
contributed the greatest number of years to life and is strong, will have the 
Period first. But if the planets be of equal power, the Period of the planet 
whose period is the longest comes first; and if the planets be of equal 
power, and period, then, the period of the planet, which rises first comes 
first. 

(In other words, the eight periods divide into three distinct groups. 
Those of the planets occupying the 4 Movable signs form one group; those 
of the planets Occupying the 4 Fixed signs form another group and those 
of the planets occupying the 4 Common signs form a third group. Now, if 
the Lagna, the Sun or the Moon whichever is more powerful than the other 
two, occupy a Movable sign, the Movable group comes first, the Fixed 
group comes next and Common group comes last. If it occupies a fixed 
sign, the Fixed group comes first, the Common group comes nextand the 
Movable group comes last. And if it occupies a Common sign, the Common 
group comes first, the Movable group comes next and the Fixed group 
comes, last. The group that comes first is always headed by the powerful 
Lagna, the Sun or the Moon.) 

Calulations of Sub-Periods etc. 

The period of the Sub-period (sub-division of planetary period) of the 
planet occupying the same house as the lord of the Period, is one-half of 
the Sub-period period of such lord. 

The Sub-period periods of the planets occupying the 5 th and the 9 th 
houses from the lord of the Period, are, each one-third; 

Those of the planets occupying the 7 th house Jrom the lord are, each 
one-seventh; and 

Those of the planets, occupying the 4 th and the 8 th houses from the 
lord, are, each one-fourth of the Sub-period period of the lord. 

The Sub-period periods of the Lagna-Period shall be determined in the 
same way. 

The fractions should all be made to have a common denominator with 
different numerators. The Period should be divided by the sum of the 
numerators and the quotient, when multiplied by the several numerators 
will give the periods of the several Sub-periods, 



ChapterOi: Various Dasas of Planets 55 

(Suppose a planet has six years as the period of its Period (main) and 
there is a planet located with it in the same sign, but not in the stipulated 
houses, their respective portions will be denoted by the fractions 1/1 and 
1/2. Each multiplied by 2, the denominator gives 2 and 1. Hence the main 
Period lord will have 2/3* and the sub-period lord l/3 rd ofthe whole period 
of the Period lord. 

ii) If there is a planet in the 5 th or 9 th from the Period lord and there are 
no planets in the other stipulated houses, the fractions showing the 
respective shares of Period lord and the other planet would be 1/1 and 
M3 multiplied by denominator 3, the proportion will be 3 and 1 i.e. 3/ 
4 th and 1/4* of the total period of the main Period lord. 

iii) If there is planet in the 4 th or 8 th from the Period lord and none in the 
other stipulated houses, the proportion will be indicated by fractions 
1/1 and 1/4 which means 4 to 1 , i.e. 4/5* and 1/5* respectively of the 
total period of the Period lord. 

iv) If there is a planet located in 7 th from the Period lord and none in the 
other stipulated houses, the proportion as between main and sub period 
lord will be 1/1 and 1/7 i.e. 7 to 1 or 7/8* and 1/8* respectively. 

v) If there is a planet with the Period lord and also in 5 th or 9 th from it but 
none in 4 th , 8 th or 7 th from it, the proportion would be 1/1 , l/2and 1/ 
3 which gives 6, 3 and 2 out of 11, hence the Period of the three 
planets, i.e. the main Period, lord, one with Period lord and one in the 
trine to Period lord would be 6/1 1 *, B/ll^and 2/1 1 th respectively of 
the total period of the Period lord. 

vi) If a planet is with the Period lord and one in 4 th or 8 th from it, but none 
in trine from it then the proportion would be indicated by fractions 1/ 
1, 1/2 and 1/4 i.e. 4, 2 and 1 or 4/7*, 2/7* and 1/7* respectively of 
the total period of Period lord. 

vii) If a planet is with the Period lord and also one in 7*from it, but none 
in other stipulated house, the proportion would be denoted by 1/1, 1/ 
2, 1/7 i.e. 14, 7 and 2 or 14/23*, 7/23 rd and 2/23* of the total period 
of the main Period lord. 

viii) If there are planets in trines from the Period lord and in none of the 
other stipulated houses, the proportion would be 1/1, 1/3 and 1/3, i.e. 
3, 1, 1 or 3/5*, 1/5* and 1/5* respectively for main Period lord etc. 

ix) If a planet is in one of the trines from the Period lord and also one in 
4* or 8* from it, and none in the other stipulated houses, the proportion 
would be denoted by the fraction 1/1, 1/3, 1/4, or 12, 4and3 i.e. 12/ 
19* 4/19* and 3/19* of the total period of the main Period lord. 



56 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

x) If a planet is in trine from the Period lord and also one in T from it, 
but none in the other stipulated houses, the proportion would be 
denoted by the fractions l/l,l/3and 1/7 i.e. 21 , 7 and 3 or21/31 , 7/ 
31 and 3/31 of the whole period of the Period lord. 

xi) If planets are in 4* and 8* from the Period lord, but none in other

1/1 , l/4and 1/4 i.e. 4, 1 and 1 or4/6*, 1/6* and 1/6* respectively for 
the main Period lord and the other planets. 

xii) If a planet is located in 4*, 8* and 7* from the Period lord, but not in 
the remaining stipulated houses, the proportion of sub-periods would 
be indicated by fractions 1/1, 1/4 and 1/7, i.e. 28, 7 and 4 i.e. 28/39, 
7/39 and 4/39 respectively for the Period lord and the other planets. 

xiii)'lf a planet is with the main Period lord and also one in each of the 
trines, the proportion of the sub-periods would be denoted by the 
fractions 1/1, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/3 i.e. 6, 3, 2 and 2, or 6/13, 3/13, 2/13 
and 1/13 respectively for the Period lord and others. In this manner 
the sub-periods of the main Period lord and the sub-periods lord should 
be worked out for remaining positions of planets in relation to the 
Period lord.) 

The Period of the most powerful planet occupying at the time of birth 
the exaltation degree of its exaltation sign, is known as Sampoorna. The 
Period of a weak planet occupying the depression degree of its depression 
sign is known as Rikta. The Period of a planet occupying an inimical Navamsa 
and also the debilitation degree of its depression sign is known as Anishta. 

The Period of a planet which quitting the exaltation degree moves 
towards the depression sign is known as Avarohini- Such Period periods 
produce evil.; while so moving, if the planet occupy a friendly or an exaltation 
Navamsa, his Period is known as Madhyama* Again, the Period of a planet 
which quitting the depression degree moves towards its exaltation sign is 
known as Arohini- Such Period periods produce prosperity.; while so moving, 
if the planet occupy an inimical or a depression Navamsa, his Period is 
known asAdhama. 

(Arohini Periods and Madhyama Periods produce prosperity and 
Avarohini Periods and Adhama Periods produce evil. A planet which occupies 
a neutral sign or Navamsa produce neither good nor evil.) 

7. The Period of a planet, which occupies a depression or an inimical 
Navamsa, when in a good position-. (that is, when the planet occupies

is known as Misraphala. Similarly, the Period of a planet which occupies 
an inimical or depression sign and is in his own Navamsa, in a friendly

Navamsa or a Moolatrikona or exaltation Navamsa, or if he occupies a 
Vargottam place is also known as Misraphala. 

The several names of the Periods indicate by their meaning, the nature 
of the planetary periods. 

(E.g. The name Sampoorna indicates vast prosperity. Poorna indicates 
prosperity. Adhama indicates misery or destruction and very little prosperity. 
Rikta indicates misery and poverty. And Misraphala indicates a mixture of 
both good and evil.) 

According as the rising Drekkana is the first, second orthird, the Lagna 
Period is known as Adhama, Madhyama or Uttama if the rising sign be a 
common sign ; Uttama, Madhyama or Adhama, if the rising sign be a movable 
sign; and Adhama, Uttama or Madhyama, if the rising sign be a fixed sign. 

(In other words, if the rising sign be one of the common signs, Gemini, 
Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces, the Lagna Period is known as Adhama if the 
rising Drekkana be the 1 st , Madhyama if it be the 2 nd , and Uttama or Pujita 
if it be the 3 rd . Again, if the rising sign be one of the movable signs, Aries, 
Cancer, Libra and Capricorn, the Lagna Period is known as Uttama if the 
rising Drekkana be the 1 st , Madhyama if it be the 2 nd , and Adhama 
if it be the 3 rd . Lastly, if the rising sign be one of the fixed signs, Taurus, 
Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius, the Lagna Period is known as Adhama or Asubha 
if the rising Drekkana be the 1 Bt , Uttama or Ishta if it be the 2 nd , and 
Madhyama orSama if it be the 3 rd . These names indicate, as already stated, 
the nature of the Period.) 

(E.g., Adhama indicates misery, Madhyama a mixture of both good 
and evil, and Uttama indicates prosperity.) 

If the lord of the Period or one of his friendly planets occupy the 
Lagna, or if the Lagna belong to the Varga '(division) of the lord of the 
Period, or if a benefic planet occupy the Lagna, or if the lord of the Period 
occupy the 3 rd , 6 th , 1G*orthe IThouse from the Lagna, such. Period will 
be a prosperous one. 

Again, when the Moon occupies a sign friendly to the lord of the Period 
or the exaltation sign of the lord of the Period and sub-period or the 3 rd , 
6 th , 10 th , 11^,5*. 9* orthe 7* house from the sign occupied by the lord of 
the Period, she will bring on prosperity; otherwise, she will produce misery. 

If, at the time of commencement of the Period of a planet, the Moon 
occupy sign Cancer, the native will become rich, will live in comfort and will 
be respected; if, at the time, the Moon occupy sign Aries or sign Scorpio, 
his wife will become unchaste; if the Moon occupy either sign Gemini or 
sign Virgo, the person will become learned, get friends and become rich; if 
the Moon occupy sign Leo; the person will work in forests, on roads and

near houses; if the Moon occupy sign Taurus or sign Libra, he will eat 
sumptuous meals; if she occupy sign Capricorn or sign Aquarius, he will 
get a bad woman; and if the Moon occupy sign Sagittarius or sign Pisces, 
the person will become rich, happy and respected. 

In the Period of the Sun, a person will acquire wealth by dealing in 
perfumes or nails, tusks of elephants and the like animals, in tiger skin and 
the like, in gold, by acts of cruelty, by means of roads, by the king and by 
battle. He will become cruel, courageous, persevering, renowned and 
valorous, will get into trouble through his wife, son, money, enemy, weapons, 
fire or the king; and he will become liberal in gifts and addicted to sinful 
deeds, he will quarrel with his servants and will become afflicted with pain 
in his chest and belly and the like diseases. 

In the Period of the Moon, the person will derive benefits from dealing 
in or by means of the mantras, the Brahmins, the productions of sugar- 
cane, milk, ghee, and the like, cloth, flower, play, Sesamum seeds and 
food; he will be of patient nature, he will respect virtuous Brahmins and 
the God Almighty; he will get daughters and will acquire an increase of 
wisdom, wealth and renown. 

The person will indulge in sleep and idleness, will lose his wisdom, 
wealth and renown and will quarrel with powerful men and with kinsmen. 

In the Period of Mars, the person will acquire wealth, by fighting with 
his enemies, through his brother, the king, lands, woollen goods and goats. 

He will hate his sons, friend's wife, and brothers and will dislike learned 
men and men of importance; he will suffer from diseases caused by or 
connected with thirst, blood, fever, bile, loss of limbs or sexual intercourse 
with other women. He will associate with men doing wicked deeds; be will 
become vicious, harsh in speech and cruel. 

In the Period of Mercury, the person will acquire wealth by doing acts

In the Period of Jupiter, the person will acquire wealth by acts of 
worship, by his learning, valour, ingenuity, bright personal appearance

Chapter 1 : Various Dasas of Planets 59 

Vedas. He will have an increase of gold etc., horses, Birth of male children, 
elephants and cloths, and will acquire the friendship of good kings. 

He will learn things requiring much ingenuity will sufferfrom foot during 
journey and pain in the ear and will quarrel with wicked men. 

In the Period of Venus, the person will enjoy sweet music, various 
pleasures, perfumes, sumptuous meals, alcohol, fine cloths, women, and

every substance provoking sexual passion, will become learned in the Yoga 
and Shastras, will obtain the object of his desire, will acquire friends, will 
become skilled in trade and in agriculture and will get hidden treasures and

He will quarrel with crowds of people, with the king, hunters and wicked

In the Period of Saturn, the person will get asses, camels, load 
carriages, birds, buffaloes and old women, will rule over hamlets, villages

He will suffer difficulties from phlegmatic and windy complaints; from 
jealousy, anger, distraction of mind, and dirty habits. He will be idle, suffer 
from grief and be much troubled. His servants, sons, daughters and wife 
will exercise authority over him and his organs will become defective. 

If the Period be a benefic one, the good effects will come to pass; if it 
be a malefic one, the bad effects will come to pass. If it be of a mixed 
nature, both effects will come to pass. The effects forthe Lagna Period are 
the same as the effects for the Period of the lord of the rising sign. 

In the benefic Dasa periods of the planets, a person will acquire the 
several metals assigned to the planets, and in the malefic Dasa periods of 
the planets, he will lose them. Again, in the Period of a planet, a person's 
occupation will be that mentioned forthe planet. The effects described for 
the 12 houses from the ascendant, forthe 12 signs from Aries, for planetary 
aspects, and for all yogas, excepting Nabhasa yogas, (The effects of the 
Nabbasa yogas will be felt throughout life) will occur in the Period of the 
planet which is most powerful among the yoga planets. 

In the Period of a particular planet, the person's complexion will be 
that due to the elementary principles presided over by the planet and the 
complexion will be accompanied by certain other qualities due to the 
elementary principles of earth, water, fire, air and akas and discernible by 
their respective organs of sense, viz., the nose, the tongue, the eyes/the 
body and the ears. 



60 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

In Brihat Samhita it is stated in detail regarding the complexion due to 
elements of each of the seven planets: 

The complexion discernible in-shining teeth, skin, nails and hairs of 
the body and of the head will be attended with prosperity; it is caused by 
the element of earth; it makes the person happy, rich and virtuous." 

"The complexion which is glossy, white, clear, green and agreeable to 
look at is caused by the element of water; it will make all creatures possessing 
it happy and successful in all their attempts and will produce wealth, comfort, 
luxury and prosperity," 

"The complexion which is fearful, unbearable, of the colour of the 
lotus, gold or fire, and indicating strength, power and valour, is caused by 
element of fire, and it brings success to a person and enables him to gain 
his desired object." 

"The complexion, which is dirty, not glossy black, has bad smell. It is 
caused by the element of air; it will cause to the person death or 
imprisonment, disease, ruin and loss of wealth." 

"The complexion which is of the colour of crystal, noble, clear and 
indicating wealth and generosity, is caused by the element of ether; it 
gives a person all that he desires." 

Now, suppose the Period to be that of Mars; his element is fire; the 
complexion caused by the elementary principle of fire described above will 
be the complexion of a person in the Period of Mars and so for the other 
planets. 

Again, the property of earth is smell, discernible by the nose; that of 
water is taste discernible by the tongue; that of fire or light is shape or 
appearance discernible by the eyes; that of air is touch discernible by the 
body; and that of akas is sound discernible by the ears. 

Suppose the Period to be that of Venus; his element is water; the 
quality belonging to water is taste discernible by the tongue. Therefore, in 
the Period of Venus, the person will eat juicy meals according to his desire, 

In the Period of Jupiter (akas-sound), the person's speech will be Sweet 
and agreeable to the ear; 

In the period of Mercury (earth-smell), the person's body will be with 
an agreeable odour; 

In that of Mars (fire-shape), he will be of an agreeable appearance; 
and 



ChapterOf: Various Dasas of Planets 61 

Inthat of Saturn (air-touch), he will be of soft body. 

From a careful observation of these qualities and also the effects of 
the Period and Sub-period, the particular Period of a person may also be 
determined. 

In the benefic Period of a planet, the good effects are caused 
immediately by the Divine Soul living within the body and assuming for the 
time being a benefic nature. When a person is found to enjoy the good 
effects described for a planetary Period, it may be concluded that such 
Period IS going on atthe time. As regards the effects described for planets 
which might be powerless, these are experienced by a person either in his 
dream or in mental imagination only. 

If the effects of a planet be found to be benefic, under one type of 
yoga and malefic in respect to the same point under another yoga, (if 
under one yoga, a planet is declared to .bring wealth and under another to 
destroy it.) Neither of the effects will occur; if two or more yogas give a 
character, one a different character to one and the same planet, the former 
will lake effect. But if, to two distinct planets, conflicting effects have been 
assigned, both will come to pass in their respective Period periods. 

Sandhya Dasa 

Sandhya is the Dawdasamsa Ayu of the Full Ayu (maximum possible 
life-span i.e. 120 years) of various signs (Rasi), not of planets. 

In Sandhya Dasa the Dasa of all the Signs from Ascendant onwards is 
of 1/12* years of Full Ayu. 

The first Dasa of ten years will be of the planet in the ascendant, than 
next Dasa will be of the planet in second house and so on. 

Pachaka Dasa of Sandhya Dasa 

Multiply the Dasa years of Sandhya Dasa by six and dividing the product 
by 31 .the resultant years, months etc., so arrived, at may be put in 1 st 
column of a Table i.e. Lagna. 

Thereafter, half of these years, months etc. may be written in the next 
three columns (i.e. 2 n ", 3 rd & 4* houses). The remaining eight 
compartments, (i.e. 5* house onwards) be filled in by one third value, 
of the resultant years, months of 1 st co!oumn (Lagna) etc. 

- . In this manner Pachaka Dasa in Sandhya Dasa of every Bhava can be 
worked out and predictions may be made from it.

Tara Dasa 

Tara Dasa is similar to Vimsottari Dasa. 

In this Dasa Janma, Sampatetc. in respective order total 9 Taras replace 
the planets Sun, Moon, Mars etc., placed in Angles or centre. 

The effects of Tara Dasa will be according to similar to their names. 

This Dasa is applied in those cases only, where there are Planets placed 
in Kendra in a birth chart. When there is more number of Planets, the 
first Dasa will belong to the strongest amongst them.

CONSIDERATIONS IN JUDGING PLANETARY PERIODS 

The Mahadasa or Major Periods originate two types of Effects- firstly 
of general nature and second is of pronounced nature which corresponds 
to the natural characteristics and acquired position (in the horoscope) by 
the planets. 

In judging the effects due to the planets in a chart, and their successive 
combinations in their periods, sub-periods, and inter-periods, one has not 
only to consider the dignities and debilities of planets for deducing favourable 
or unfavourable results, but has also to consider the age, position, and sex 
of the native, for the significations of planets are expressed according to 
the age and the status of an individual and living environs. 

Planets are said to be in dignity, when they are in exaltation and 
Mooltrikona (Joy of Western Astrologers), in their own signs, having a 
mutual reception in their own signs, in a friendly sign, in conjunction with 
or aspected by a benefic, in conjunction with the ruler of the Ascendant, 
the ninth or tenth house or with the period planet, in friendly temporal 
relations, in angles, trines, or the eleventh house from the rising sign or 
significator. 

Malefic are dignified by their location in the third, sixth, or eleventh 
house. 

Planets are said to be in debility, when they are in their fall, in an 
unfriendly sign, in conjunction with or aspected by a malefic, as lords of 
the third, sixth, eighth, and eleventh houses either from the rising sign or 
significator, or aspected by the rulers of evil houses. 

Benefic as rulers of angles are said to be in debility. 

The Effects of the Periods of the planets are ascertained on the basis 
ofthe strength ofthe planets. 



64 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

Timing of Giving Effects 

The planet in the first Drekkana, gives Effects in the beginning of the 

Period, 

In the second Drekkana, in the middle of the Period and 

In the third Drekkana, in the concluding part of the Period. 

The Effects of the retrograde planets be considered in the reverse 
order. 

Thus - the consequential effects of planets that of natural 
characteristic and placement in the horoscope, be felt in the three 
different segments of the Dasa. 

If the planets are posited between 00 and 100, the effects be considered 
in the first segment (part) of the Dasa (l/B^Dasa) and, 

Between 10 deg and 20 deg, in the second (middle) segment and 
between 20Â° and 30Â° in the third (last) segment of the Dasa. 

However, if the planet is in retrogression, including the Dasa of Rahu 
and Ketu, the results of the first segment of the Dasa will be felt and 
the result of planet in the first Drekkana will be considered. 

Generalized rules 

Planets in conjunction with the Sun are called Kopistta. They signify â¢ 
sinful conduct, disgraceful life, and loss of wife, brother, and wealth, trouble 
from children, eye trouble and danger from fire, the king, and thieves. 

It must not, however, be supposed that the planets in the periods 
ruled by them would produce uniform good or bad results for there are 
within that period sub-periods of planets which may be productive of good 
or bad results, according to their position in the chart, as well as according 
to their position from the period planet taken as the rising planet. The 
same reasoning prevails in judging the effects of inter-period planets under 
a sub-period. 

As a general rule, the good and evil effects of the significations of the 
various houses in the chart depend on the nature of the planets occupying 
them. The significations of houses occupied by benefic are increased, while, 
when occupied by malefic they are destroyed or nullified. 

The planets aspecting their own houses increase the signification of 
those houses, as well as the planets who have mutual reception in their 
houses. 

The principal sources of happiness or misery to an individual 
would be generally from want of money, increase of enemies, death and 
danger to wife, children, friends and relations, and troubles from loss of 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 65 

lands, conveyances, bad food, neglect of his own community, hatred of 
rulers, litigation, brothers, cousins, venereal complaints, bad company, 
thieves and fires unsuccessful cultivation, expulsion from ones own country 
and house, foreign residence and public disgrace, and bodily weakness, 
sickness, and loathsomeness. 

Evil planets, or good planets in evil Amsa or Vargas, produce physical 
and mental trouble. Benefic produce good, planets in exaltation, in their 
own houses, Moolatrikona, and beneficial conjunctions and aspects, produce 
good results. 

It is not possible to spell out exhaustively the effects of Major periods 
and Sub-periods of planets in as much as that their operation differs in 
nature in individual horoscopes. But a general reference data can be 
prepared and we shall study a few of the important effects of various Major 
periods and Sub-periods given in ancient books. 

Rules for Delineation of Major periods:- 

The learned after computing the Dasas have arrived at after 
observations over a period of time their good or bad effects in the lives of 
the natives, similarly, longevity can also be predicted. These are summerized 
below: 

1. The Sub-period of the Lord of the 9* in the Dasa of the Lord of the 5* 
is most auspicious. 

2. The Dasa of the Lord of the 9* associated with that of the 5* grants 
progeny and" Raja (authority); similarly the Dasa of the Lord of the 4* 
conjoined with that of the 10* is auspicious in the same way. 

3. The Dasa of the planet associated with the Lord of the 5* or 9* is also 
auspicious. 

4. The Dasa of the planet conjoined with a malefic is bad; if the same is 
conjoined with a benefic, it is good and promotes wealth. 

5. The Sages say that the Dasa of the Lord of the Lagna (Ascendant) 
associated with that of the 5* or 9 th gives Raja (power to rule). 

6. The Dasa of the Lords of the 5* and the 9* or those of the 10* and 
the 5* when they conjoin or that of the 4* and the 9* when they 
conjoin confers power and prosperity. 

7. The Dasa of the Lord of the 10* occupying the 9* house confers fame, 
prosperity and happiness; the result is the same in the Dasa of this 
Lord of the 10* associated with that of the 4*. 

8. The Dasas of the Lords of the 6* and that of the 7 th become auspicious 
ifthey occupy the 10* house or associate with its Lord.. 



66 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

9. If the same planet owns the 2 nd and the 7* houses (Maraka houses) 
and occupies the 4* house or is associated with its Lord then the Dasa 
of that planet will also be auspicious. 

Note: In Aries Ascendant Chart Venus owns the 2 nd and 7* and in the 
case of Libra Ascendant, Mars owns these houses. 

10. If the Lord of the 6 th , 8* or the 12* associates with that of the 5* their 
Dasa has also been said to be auspicious by the learned. 

11. If the Lord ofthe 4* is in the 10* and that of the 10* is in the 4* then 
their Dasas are said to be auspicious by the learned. 

12. Lords ofthe 4 th , 10*, 5* and the 9* wherever are together in anyone 
house, and the planet associating with them, his Dasa is also said to 
he auspicious. 

13. If the Lords ofthe 5* and the 10* occupy the 4 th , their Dasas are said 
to be auspicious conferring power and authority. 

14. The Dasas ofthe planets, which are associated with or aspected by 
the Lords ofthe 5* and the 10* confer power and authority, 

15. The Dasas ofthe Lord ofthe 5* occupying the 10* or that ofthe 10* 
in his own house (10 th ) confer wealth and power. 

The Dasa of a planet, (who is ruling at a given time), treat this house 
occupied by that planet as the Lagna, further, find out the house counted 
from this Lagna, that the Sub-period Lord is occupying. Also assess the 
strength of these two planets obtained through their association with or 
aspect by other planets. If these two planets are not mutually be in 6/ 8* 
house or aspect, the resulting effect will be happy. Otherwise evil effect will 
emanate according to the strength ofthe planet. 

The Dasa-periods and the sub-periods of the planets owning Kendra's 
and trines will prove auspicious, while those ofthe planets owning the 2 



nd 



,rd 



3 and the 1 1 * houses will be of moderate effects. The Dasas, etc., of 
planets owning the 6 th , the 8 th and the 1 2* Bhavas will always prove adverse 
to the native. These results should be declared in the respective Dasas and 
Sub-periods of planets after an examination ofthe lord ofthe Dasa and the 
Bhava occupied by him. 

Should the Sub-period Lord occupy the 12 th , 6* or the 8* place from 
that of the lord ofthe Dasa, he then becomes hostile to the Dasa-lord. The 
planet in the 1 1 th , the 2 nd , 3 rd , 4*, 5 th , 9* or the 10* house from the Dasa- 
Lord is said to be greatly beneficial to the native. The planet occupying the 
7* place from the Dasa Lord and the one associating with him are also 
found to be favourable. 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 67 

When the Dasa Lord is inauspicious and the Sub-period Lord is 
auspicious and is not associated with the same, the result will be adverse. 
When the Sub-period Lord is a benefic and is associated with the Dasa 
Lord, the result will be mixed. The Sub-period Lord, even if the Sub-period 
Lord be a Yogkaraka planet will become more hostile and distressing, should 
he not be associating with the Dasa Lord. When the Dasa Lord is powerful 
enough to cause both Yoga and death, he will give the effects of the Yoga 
first in his own Sub-period. 

When the entire period over which the aforesaid Yogkaraka rules be 
completely auspicious and the Sub-periods of the various malefic planets 
be accordingly favourable, the Yogkaraka planet puts off the causing of 
death to the person concerned. Such a Dasa Lord will never give mixed 
results; when he does so, the Dasa will only prove entirely fruitless. This is 
what the wise say. 

Jupiter and Venus in their mutual Dasa and Sub-periods bestow 
upon the native kingship or the position of a minister, much wealth and 
happiness through wife and children. The man concerned will devote his 
energies in the performance of sacrifices, birth of children, marriage 
celebrations and other similar auspicious functions provided these two 
planets are strong and occupy good houses and are also associated with 
and aspected by auspicious planets. 

The same above two planets when occupy Bhavas which are quincunx 
(150Â°) i.e. 6 & 8 to each other or are mutually placed in the 2 nd and the 
12 1h ; or if they two be aspected by or associated with the lords of these 
houses; or if they themselves be the owners of these houses and be at the 
same time aspected by or in association with malefic, and are weak in 
Bhava position, etc., they will, during their Dasa period cause separation 
from wife and sons, displeasure of a highly learned persons, trouble th rough 
intrigues with females, royal displeasure and fear of epileptic attacks. 

When Venus and Saturn occupy their exaltation, own-house or 
Vargottam amsa and are strong and equally powerful to cause Yoga, they 
will, in their mutual Dasas and Sub-periods make the man concerned a 
beggar seeking alms and a powerless being, even though he be born a 
king or a multimillionaire. If however, one of the two is strong and the 
other weak, the stronger one will cause the Yoga. 

When both of them be weak and be so mutually placed that one 
occupies the 12 th , the 8* or the 6* from the other or happens to own such 
places; or be associated with the lords of these houses, they tend to be 
auspicious and grant wealth and happiness to the man concerned. When 
one of them is the lord of an auspicious Bhava and the other of an 



68 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

unfavourable one, even then, both of them will produce good results. Should 
they both be malefic they will prove extremely favourable to the native. 

When Saturn and the Sun occupy their own or exalted Rasisorbe in 
the corresponding Navamsa or Kendra or Trine positions or be owners of 
these houses, they will bestow upon the native royal favour, wealth and 
the like in the Sun's Sub-period of Saturn's Dasa; and happiness, wealth 
and victory in Saturn's Sub-period of the Sun's Dasa. Should these two 
planets be (both) malefic they become productive of distress for the native. 

When Mars and Jupiter are, in the same manner, strong and occupy 
favourable Bhavas and possess the aspect or company of a strong benefic 
planet, they cause Rajyogatothe man concerned, they become instrumental 
in bringing joy, all kinds of enjoyments and pleasure, sons living long life, 
marriage and other pleasant ceremonies. If otherwise, they will exhibit 
contrary results. 

Jupiter and Mercury, When similarly strong, will enable the native 
for good actions, grant great learning, he will be clever in trading and 
possessed of Wife, children and happiness. Venus and Mercury, Jupiter and 
the Moon, the Moon and Venus, Jupiter and the Sun, the Sun and Mars, 
the Sun and Mercury, each of these pairs will promote effects akin to those 
indicated for Jupiter and Mercury. 

Necessary consideration should also be given to the effects which may 
arise due to the transit of the planets during their course through the 
several houses counted from the Moon sign at Birth, (Radix Moon) and the 
combined effects alone should be pronounced. 

RESULTS OF MAJOR PERIODS ACCORDING TO SRI 
RAMANUJACHARYA 

The person becomes unfortunate during Saturn's Major Period Venus 
Sub-period or Venus Major Period Saturn's Sub-period 

For persons born in Sagittarius and Pisces Ascendants, Venus and 
Saturn give rise to Yoga in the Major Periods of Saturn and Venus 
respectively. 

Death may be caused by the lords of the 6 th , 8* and the 12* houses in 
the course of the Major Period of the 8* lord who occupies the 6 th , the 
8* orthe 12*. 

If the lords of the 10* and the 3 rd are in conjunction with, or aspect 
each other, the native will be deprived of fortune in the Major Period of 
the 10* lord and he will enjoy fortunate results in the Major Period of 
the 3 rd lord.

prove highly prosperous while Jupiter's Major Period will be ordinary. 

Notes- These interesting combinations enable us to predict the 
relatively good and bad nature of the results of Major Periods of different 
planets in conjunction or mutual aspect. These combinations can be 
summarised as follows:-

It will be seen from the above that Jupiter will produce only ordinary 
results in any of his combinations with Mars, the Moon and Saturn. 

This is however a general principle and it stands to be modified if 
Jupiter becomes a Yogkaraka or has some special distinction by way of 



exaltation or situation in the Ascendant, or the 10* or 2 
9* house.

The above tabulation will also enable us to anticipate that in the course 
of the Major Period of the planets which are supposed to give ordinary 
results, beneficial results will happen within the sub-periods of those whose 
major periods are supposed to prove highly fortunate. Thus if you take 
Jupiter and Saturn, then Saturn's Sub-period in Jupiter's Major Period will 
be highly fortunate. 

The combinations of the Moon and Mars, Jupiter and Mars, and Jupiter 
and the Moon go under the special distinction of Chandramangalayoga, 
Gurumangalayoga and Gajakesariyoga respectively and out of the two 
planets causing each Yoga; one becomes capable of producing much more 
favourable results than the other. 

It will be seen that only "ordinary results" will happen in the Major 
Period of the other planet and not unfortunate results. 

Rahu will confer Raja Yoga and much fame in his Major Period if he 
joins a quadrant or a trine. 

If Jupiter, Mercury and Venus join together or are in mutual aspect, 
the native becomes very wealthy, famous and fortunate. 

The native will earn much wealth in Venus Major Period if Venus is in 
conjunction with or aspected by Mercury or Jupiter. 

The native becomes bereft of wealth in the Major Period of Jupiter and 
mixed results will be produced in the Major Period of Mercury. 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 71 

â¢ Notes- Rahu when occupying a Kendra (quadrant) orTrikona (trine) 
is supposed to give rise to Raja Yoga in his Major Period. 

If Jupiter, Mercury and Venus are in mutual conjunction, or aspect, 
one becomes fortunate and wealthy. 

All these three planets are benefic (Mercury becomes benefic here as 
he will be with the other two benefic) but only one of the three in 
combination can really enable the native to acquire wealth in his Major 
Period. 

If Venus is in conjunction with or aspected by Mercury or Jupiter, 
then:- 

a) Venus confers wealth in his Major Period. 

b) Jupiter causes loss of wealth in his Major Period and 

c) Mercury produces mixed results in his Major Period. 

Each of these three planets to produce the results ascribed above, 
they must conjoin together or aspect each other. 

If Venus and Jupiter make up the combination the latter gives evil 
results and if Venus and Mercury cause the combination, the latter 
produces mixed results. 

If the Sun and other planets combine together, the Sun confers fame 
and wealth in his Major Period while the other planets give ordinary 
results. 

Of the several planets who are in conjunction with or aspected by 
Rahu, the strongest one gives the results indicated by it. 

When Rahu, the Sun and Saturn are in the 3 rd , Rahu gives rise to 
courage and fortune in his Major Period. 

Learned says that during the Major Period of Rahu one becomes timid 
if Mercury is in the 3 rd house. 

Notes- If planets are in conjunction with the Sun, they become 
astangata or combust. Combustion occurs when the planets are very near 
the Sun. Otherwise it cannot be called combustion. 

If the Sun and other planets join together the Sun confers fame and 
fortune in his Major Period while ordinary results will be given by the 
other planets. 

For example Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are in conjunction with Rahu. 
Of these three let us assume that Jupiter is the most powerful and he 
owns the 5* house and occupies the 9* house. Then Jupiter alone will 
be able to produce in his Major Period results of his indication, viz.,

children and fortune. The indications of the other two planets become 
more or less defunct. 

Sri Mahadeva Pathak in JATAKATATVA has given these rules 
for interpretation of PERIOD of planets in simple and lucid language 

1. A planet gives the result due to its position in a House, 
Sign, Aspect, conjunction, means of living ascribed to it, etc. during its 
Period and Sub-period. 

2. If the planet is very powerful or is in his highest exaltation degrees, 
during its Period, shall give health, wealth, etc. It is called SampOOrna, 

3. If the planet is weaker in his fall, during its Period, it is called Rikta or 
empty and would give loss of wealth, etc. 

4. If a planet is some what powerful and exalted, during his Period, he 
would be effective and may bring some wealth. 

5. If a planet is in his extreme fall, or debilitated in Navamsa or inimical 
Navamsa; his Period is called Anishta and would cause loss of wealth, 
and health etc. 

6. If a planet is proceeding towards his fall, his Period is called Avarohi or 
descending and gives troubles and difficulties. If this planet during the 
said passage is occupying a friendly, exalted or own Navamsa shall be 
fruitful and the period would be middling, neither very good nor very 
bad. 

7. The Period would be AAROHA, if the planet is proceeding in the direction 
of his exaltation. The results would be auspicious; This same would be 
Adhama or worst if during his passage he occupies a debilitated or 
inimical Navamsa, He would cause very little good. 

8. During the Period of a planet occupying his exaltation sign, Own house 
or a friend's house, but in his debilitated or inimical Navamsa, the 1 st 
half of the native's life shall be good and the latter would be mixed 

9. During the Period of a planet occupying his friend's house, exaltation 
house, Own house, MoOltrikona, a Vargottam Navamsa or own Varga, 
the results shall be favourable and encouraging. 

10. During the Period of a planet that is set, posited in an inimical or 
debilitated Navamsa, the native would pass through many troubles 
and untoward happenings. 

1 1 . During the Avarohi and Adhama Period of a planet, the native would 
pass through great difficulties. 

12. When the Period of a planet is AAROHA and Madhya, the native would 
experience many auspicious results. 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 73 

13. In the case of the Period of a planet that is associated with or aspected 
by a benefic, that has got more rays and is occupying a Kendra or a 
Trine house, the native would find, it most auspicious and if the planet 
be occupying otherwise it shall be most troublesome. 

14. The nature of the Ascendant Period shall correspond with the Decanate 
occupied by the Ascendant. 

In the case of movable sign it is Uttama, Madyama and Adhama 
according as the Ascending Decanate is 1 st , 2 nd or 3 rd one. In the case 
of a dual sign, this order is reversed. In a fixed sign it shall be bad, 
good or mixed, if the Ascending Decanate be the 1 st , 2 nd or 3 rd 
respectively. 

15. If the Period belongs to a retrograde planet, the native would suffer 
fall in position, loss of honour and happiness, etc. 

16. If a planet is occupying a house other than the three Dusthana (6, 8, 
12), the desires and aspirations of the native shall be fulfilled, 

17. If the lord of the Period is inimical to that of the Ascendant, there is 
possibility the native becoming irrational and dangerfromthe sovereign. 

18. The Period of a planet if associated with Rahu, shall give untoward 
effects. 

19. If the lord of the Ascendant is in the 8* house, the native shall face 
much trouble and many hardships during his period. 

20. During the Period and Sub-Period of a malefic planet, the native shall 
undergo loss through enemies and meet great danger. 

21. The Period of a very friendly planet where Ishta prevails shall be best; 
that of a very inimical planet shall prove unfavourable; that of a neutral 
one shall be ordinary. 

22. The Period of the Lord of the Ascendant shall bring power and wealth 
to the native. 

23. The Period of the lord of the 2 nd house shall give trouble but wealth

to each other, the native shall pass through great danger and anxiety. 

36. During the Period of the ATMA karaka, the native may suffer the loss

37. During the Period of a malefic and the Sub-Period of a benefic, the 
native would pass through some trouble at first and then followed by 
good fortune. 

38. During the Period of a benefic and in the Sub-Period of a benefic, the 
native shall enjoy great happiness. 

39. During the Period of a benefic and in the Sub-Period of a malefic, the 
native shall find the 1 st half of his life full of happiness, and the lastfull 
of fear. 

40. During the beginning of a new Period or Sub-Period, the position and 
strength of the various planets and that of the Ascendant at that time 
should be correctly assessed. 

41 . If in this nativity (referred to above) the lord of Period be a benefic or 
occupy an Upachaya position (3 rd , 1 1 MO* and 6 th ) with respect to 
the Ascendant, his Period would be the best. 

42. If the Ascendant is in a friendly Varga of the Period Lord or in the 
Varga of a benefic, the Period shall prove auspicious. 

43. With the beginning of a Period or Sub-Period if the Moon enters her 
own house, the native would get honour, wealth and happiness; if she 
enters Leo. The native would be above want; if she passes through a 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 75 

house of MarSj the native would frequently quarrel and be in debt; if 
through a house of Mercury, the gain shall be of learning and wealth; 
if through a house of Jupiter, the native shall experience happiness 
through agriculture, recognition and wealth; if through a house of 
Venus, the native gets a good wife, honour, fame and wealth. Transit 
of Moon through a house of Saturn would engage the native in the 
service of others. 

44. If Moon at the time of beginning of a Period is powerful and is posited 
in other than the 6*, 8* or 12* house, the period will come out to be 
the best. 

45. If Moon is in the exaltation sign of the Period Lord, friendly sign or her 
own sign and occupy an Upachya, Trine or the 7* place from the Sign 
occupied by the Period Lord, he would give good results and in any 
other position it would be otherwise. 

46. Mark the Sign occupied by Moon atthe time of entry of a Period and 
the particular house signified by this Sign in the nativity. The Moon's 
presence in it, whether good or bad, shall be with reference to that 
house only. 

47. In the course of the Period of a malefic associated with an inimical 
planet and in a malefic planet's Sub Period, the native would certainly 
pass through some calamity. 

48. Atthe beginning of the Period of a malefic planet, if there is a planet 
possessing greatest strength in every way and is in benefic Varga, 
aspected by benefic or by a friend, the Calamity will not befall but shall 
be warded off. 

49. Counted from the Moon or the Ascendant, if at the beginning of a 
Period, the Period Lord occupy during his transit an Upachaya house, 
a friendly house, his exaltation or his Mooltrikona sign, he would produce 
in full the effects obtained from the benefic dots and would show only 
in a small degree the evil effects resulting from the malefic dots (under 
Ashtakavarga System) otherwise, the evil effects due to malefic dots 
would be fully revealed, while those due to the benefic dots, only in a 
small degree. Even here prediction could be made proportionately. 



Assessment of strength of Planets- 

A) The planets that are strong and benefic according to all the following 
eight beneficfactors will yield good and beneficial results in their Periods. 

The Eight Benefic Factors are:- 

a) The planet that is a Natural Benefic (Naisargika-Suban) 



76 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

b) The lord of the Nakshatra which happens to be a propitious 
Nakshatra as reckoned from the Birth Nakshatra (i.e. Subha 
Nakshatrathipathi). 

c) The planet that happens to be the lord of the sign occupied by a 
benefic bhava according to placement ,(i.e. the Subha Athipathiya 
Planet). 

d) The planet that is posited in a benefic rasi. 

e) The planet that is strong in Varga Athipathiyam (i.e. the planet 
that has several Vargas or that is in the same rasi in the several 
Varga charts of the Divisional charts). 

f) The planet that is in its Aarohana-Gathi (i.e. the planet that is 
moving from its Parama-Debilitation point to its Parama-Ucha Point 
(i.e. the planet whose Ucha Bala is on the increase) 

g) The planet that is in Vakra (i.e. the planetthat is in its retrogression 
or backward motion). 

h) The planetthat is in its Parama-ucha Position i.e. the planetthat 
is in its exaltation point in its exaltation rasi. 

B) The planets that are malefic according to all the following eight malefic 
factors will yield bad and unpropitious results in their Periods: 

The Eight Malefic Factors are: 

a) The planet that is a Natural Malefic (Naisargika Asabhan). 

b) The lord of the Nakshatra which happens to be an unpropitious 
Nakshatra as reckoned from the birth Nakshatra (i.e. Asubha 
Nakshatrathipathi). 

c) The lords of the signs in which the sixth, the eighth and the twelfth 
bhavas are posited (i.e. the lords of the signs which include or 
comprise the sixth, eighth and the twelfth bhavas). 

d) The planet that are in their inimical signs, or in their Debilitation 
(i.e. Debilitation) signs. 

e) The planets that are in their Asthamanam (i.e. heliacal setting or 
immersion or combustion or cazini). 

f) The malefic planetthat is in Kendra's (i.e. square or cardinal bhavas 
from the Lagna Bhava) and in Trines (i.e. in 5/9 orTrikona bhavas 
from the Lagna Bhava). 

g) The planet that has Athicharam (i.e. the planet that is moving 
with a speed which is much greater than its normal or average 
speed). 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 77 

h) The planet that is in its Parama-Debilitation position (i.e. the planet 
that is in its debilitation point in its debilitation rasi). 

The planet which happens to be a malefic according to these 
Eight Malefic Factors renders malefic the lord of the Nakshatra 
in which it is at birth-time and the lords of the rasi, occupied 
by it in the Rasi and Navamsa charts. 

The planet which happens to be benefic according to the 
Eight Benefic Factors renders benefic the lord of the Nakshatra 
in which it is at birth time and the lords of the rasi occupied 
by it in the Birth and Navamsa charts. 

The Eight Kinds of Benefic referred to above when they are 
strong and the lords of the Navamsas and the Nakshatras in 
which they are at the time of birth when they are also strong 
will yield very good results during their Periods or Major 
periods. 

The Eight Kinds of Malefic referred to above when they are 
strong and the lords of the Navamsas and the Nakshatras in 
which they are atthe time of birth, when they are also strong, 
produce misery, sorrow, and all kinds of sufferings and worry 
during their Periods or Major Periods. 

The Periods (Major periods) and their Sub-Period or sub-period 
Period (sub-periods) have to be first of all determined and 
then only, the events in them should be predicted in the order 
of Periods, sub-periods and sub-sub-periods etc. 

How to Determining Life Events of a Native. 

The lord of the Period, 

The planets in combination with him, 

The planets those were aspected by him, 

The lord of the Rasi occupied by the Period Lord in the Rasi Chart, 

The lord of the Rasi occupied by the Period Lord in the Navamsa Chart, 

The lord of the Trimsamsa of the Period Lord, 

The lord ofthe ninth bhava, 

The planets that are in Trines from the Lagna, 

All these above items of planets will yield yoga (or good or bad results} 
in their sub-periods. 

Rahu and Ketu will yield the results of these the planets in whose Rasi 
they are. 



78 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

The strength (i.e. Shada Bala strengths), of these planets must first be 
ascertained. 

If the lord of the sub-period is posited in his own rasi, in his friendly 
rasi, in his exaltation rasi, and in a Trine rasi (i.e. 5 or 9) he will yield 
results which are pertaining to or appropriate to his own bhava, to the 
bhava in which he is situated and also to the rasi occupied by him in 
Transit (i.e. Star course). If he is a malefic, he will yield malefic and 
unfavourable results; if he is of a Mixed nature (i.e. a combination of 
benefic and malefic natures), he will yield results of a mixed nature 
(i.e*of a mixture of propitious and unpropitious results). 

But a Period Lord, will not in his own Sub-Period, yield results in harmony 
with, or appropriate to his nature, but he will yield results which, are in 
consonance with, or which are a continuation of, the results of the 
previous Sub-Period. If, however, he yields his own appropriate results 
in his own sub-Period on the contrary, he will not yield his own 
appropriate results in the other sub-Period of his Period, through the 
other Sub-Period Lords. 

This will happen only when the Period Lord only is very powerful, 
while the other Sub-Period Lords are powerless. 

When the Period Lord is benefic, if the Sub-Period Lord is malefic, the 
Sub-Period Lord will not produce his appropriate effects in his SUb- 
Period, but on the other hand. He will keep quiet. If the Period Lord is 
in the midst of malefic, the Period Lord, in some cases will yield 
unfavourable results to some degree. If, in the same way, a malefic 
Period Lord is in the midst of benefic, he (the malefic Period Lord) will 
yield favourable results to some degree. 

If the Period Lord is a Maraka (i.e. a death-inflicting or Mrithyu Planet 
or death-causing planet) and at the same time is a benefic, the Sub- 
Period Lord who happens to be lord of the eighth bhava from the Birth 
Lagna, will be invested with the authority to inflict death. If the lord of 
the eighth bhava is also a Maraka or an Mrithyu Planet there will be no 
actual death in that Period. If the Period Lord, though he is a benefic, 
is in the midst of malefic, he will be indifferent and will not produce 
favourable results. If the Period Lord, though he is a malefic, is in the 
midst, of benefic, he will not produce unfavourable results on a large 
scale. All, that has been said here about the Period Lord, is equally 
applicable to Sub-Period Lord, 

Note: Innumerable and diverse are the results, since equally 
innumerable are the qualities or the characteristics of planets.

sub-period of the planets occupying the 12 th or aspected by 
its Lord. 

17) If Mercury and Venus conjoin in the 5* house, they become most fatal 
in each other's Main Ruling Period and Sub During the Period of Mercury 
and Sub of Venus or Vice-Versa, Do take into account their ownership 
of the house. 

18) If Mars has evil Lordship and is posited in the 5 th , it will cause death in 
its own Ruling Period. Evil Lordship stands for owning the 6*, 8* or 
12 th , Krooradhi-patya. 

19) Even when Saturn owns favourable houses, it becomes a powerful 
Maraka by association of other Maraka. 

20) Learned Astrologers believe that the Period of the Lord of the 8* who 
is posited in the Lagna proves fatal. 

21) When the Sons (two or three) of a native pass through Rahu Period 
simultaneously he (native) will die during this period. 

These Yogas will show different effects in the lives of the natives 
according as their span of life is short, medium or full. In case of the 1 st it 
may prove fatal; in that of second the native may pass through serious 
illness, enmity and loss of wealth and when in case of the third (full span of 
life) they may cause some Arisht only. 

Jataka Chandrika has made these principles very clear in the following 
few sentences: 

1 . Lord of the 2 nd or the 7* is a Maraka; 

2. Malefic occupying these two houses; 

3. Malefic associating with their Lords; 

4. Benefic associating with their Lords; 

5. Lords of the 7 ,h and the 8 ,h ; 

6. Lord of the 3 rd or the 8 th conjoined with that of the 2 nd or the 7 th ; 

7. Saturn in association with a Maraka; 

8. Lord of the 6* or the 8* whether or not associated with a Maraka; 

9. The least powerful planet in the chart.

Highlights of the Periods of the Lords of Different 
Houses 

Let us now consider the effects of the periods of the lords of various 
houses in the horoscope. 

â¢ In a birth chart when, the Ascendant possesses maximum strength, 
the native during the Dasa of its lord, rises to a status of eminence in the 
world and is happily placed in life. He is physically strong and possesses a 1 
charming personality. His prosperity grows with the growing in age like 
that of the waxing Moon. 

If the lord of the Ascendant is badly situated the native will, during the 
Dasa of that planet be imprisoned. He will lead a life incognito, suffer from 
fear, disease and mental anxiety, participate in funeral rites, suffer loss of 
status and other misfortunes. 

1 s lord. During the Major period of the lord of Lagna who is strong 
and well placed, the person will rise to eminence, will be happy, be physically 
strong, and his popularity and influence will increase. 

If First lord is weak, badly placed and afflicted, the person will suffer

Lord of Ascendant Period effects (from classics) 

(The Events during the Period of the Lord of the First Bhava), 

1) Ifthe lord of the Birth Lagna (i.e. the Birth Ascendant Lord or simply 
Lord of Ascendant) has the eight kinds of strength referred to as eight 
benefic factors earlier, will, during his Period, produce enduring 
authoritative powers, grace and fortune, reputation, health, wealth, 
happiness, authority and influence to the Native; and the Native will 
also be honoured and revered by his relatives and members of his 
family. The Native will have all these good effects, increasing slowly 
just like waxing Moon. 

2) Ifthe Lord of Ascendant, devoid of strength, is posited in an inimical 
rasi or in his debilitation rasi, or is in heliacal setting, the Native will 
during his Period, be an unknown or insignificant person and poor 
servant or labourer: he will be wicked, powerless, vicious, and worried 
in his mind with many cares and anxieties. If this planet is in the 
twelfth Amsa from the Lagnamsa (i.e. in the twelfth rasi in the Navamsa 
chart from the Lagna in the Navamsa chart), the native will be always 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 83 

moving from place to place. During the sub-period of this planet the 
Native will be dirty, indecent, unhappy, penurious and beggar. 

3) If the Lord of Ascendant is posited in the second bhava in conjunction 
with the lord of the second bhava, the Native will, during the Period of 
the Lord of Ascendant, acquire much, wealth, will have rich and delicious 
food and drink served to him in gold and silver plates and cups. If the 
planet that is in combination with the Lord of Ascendant, is Jupiter, 
gold vessels are indicated, if it is Venus, silver vessel is indicated; and 
if it is any other planet, the vessel will be made of a metal that is ruled 
over by the planet. The Native's family and wealth will prosper. He will 
be successful in everything. His words will be valued everywhere. 
He will witness dramas, cinemas and pleasing and captivating shows. 
Even if the Lord of Ascendant is in conjunction with the lord of second 
house, if Lord of Ascendant is situated in the sixth, eighth and twelfth 
rasi from the DHanamsa, (i.e. the lord of second house Amsa), that is 
if the Lord of Ascendant is in the Navamsa chart in the sixth, eighth or 
twelfth rasi from the rasi in the Navamsa chart itself occupied by the 

Dhanathipathi, (the lord of second house) all the effects referred to 
above will be reversed during the Period of the Lord of Ascendant; the 
Native will then have a very little gain; he will sometimes lose the 
chance of having gain and he will have happiness sometimes and 
unhappiness at other times or both mixed up together. 

Note- While giving hereafter the Phafa or effects of the Period of the 
lord of a particular bhava or house occupying any other bhava, the 
author always takes the lord of the other bhava to be in his bhava 
itself along with the lord of that particular bhava. 

For instance, when he speaks of the lord of the first bhava being in the 
second bhava, he takes that the lord of the second bhava is in the 
second bhava itself in combination with the lord of the first bhava 
whose Period effects are under consideration. He does not give the 
effects of the Period of the lord of a particular bhava posited in another 
bhava without the combination of the lord of that another bhava or 
with the aspect of the lord of that another bhava. 

4) If the Lord of Ascendant, possessed of strength is posited in the third- 
bhava in conjunction with the lord of the third bhava, the Native will

wealth through his brother, will be strong minded and resolute, will 
read Puranas and other religious works, will derive pleasure from musical 
performances, comic scenes and humorous and witty speeches and 
reports and will have ear ornaments in the Period of Lord of Ascendant.

misunderstandings with his brothers in this Period; or all these events 
and good effects may deteriorate or decrease to some extent.

dignified person or boss to some degree or on some occasions, will 
have misunderstanding with his father and sons, will have some 
interruption or respite in his religious worship, and will have Government

the lord of the sixth bhava in the Navamsa chart, the Native's enemy 
will score a victory over the Native, and the results described above 
will not at all happen actually but there will be only a mere talk or 
likelihood of the occurrence of the above mentioned good results. 

11) If the Lord of Ascendant is posited in the seventh bhava in conjunction 
with the lord of the seventh bhava, the Native will have journey, 
pilgrimage and celebrations or occurrence of auspicious events during

pleasures of garland of fine flowers, sandal paste, perfumes etc. He 
will tourto a very distant place if the seventh bhava is in a movable 
rasi, in his own country if it is a fixed rasi, and will reside in a foreign 
land if it is in a dual rasi. If the Lord of Ascendant is devoid of power, 
the Native will be simply wandering without any benefits whatsoever.

run into debt over head and ears and will attempt to begin to do mean 
things or to pursue undignified person and unworthy occupations during 
the Period of the Lord of Ascendant. 



86 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

14) lf T however, (in the above mentioned yoga), the Lord of Ascendant is 
situated in the Navamsa chart in the sixth, eighth, or twelfth rasi from 
the rasi occupied by the lord of the eighth bhava in the Navamsa 
chart, the effects described above will be of a moderate degree and 
the Native will have no attacks of serious disease; if the loiflofthe 
eighth bhava is powerless, the Native will not contract debt or disease, 
will do sinful or wicked deeds covertly and will discharge his debts or 
will be relieved of debts. These favourable events should be predicted 
taking also into account the nature of the Nakshatras. 

15) If the Lord of Ascendant, is posited in the ninth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the ninth-bhava, the Native's patrimony will prosper, 
he will flourish in virtuous ways, will be devoted to father and deities, 
will serve his father well, will become famous through the acquisition 
of large wealth and will do charity in laudable ways. 

16) If, however, (in the above mentioned yoga) the Lord of Ascendant is 
situated in the Navamsa chart in the sixth, eighth or twelfth rasi from 
the rasi occupied by the lord of the ninth bhava in the Navamsa chart, 
the Native will have no ancestral property, there will be no cordiality or 
harmony between the Native and his father; they will be diametrically 
opposed to each other, the Native will have no liking for virtuous ways 
and deeds and will be associated with sceptics or combatants. During 
the Period of Lord of Ascendant, his patrimony will dwindle away. If 
the same Lord of Ascendant is however, in his exaltation degree in his 
exaltation rasi in conjunction with the lord of the ninth-bhava, the 
Native will acquire enormous wealth, will spend much money on 
charitable deeds and will certainly build or renovate Siva or Vaishnava 
temples etc. 

17) If the Lord of Ascendant is posited in the tenth bhava in conjunction 
with the lord of the tenth bhava, the Native, during his (Lord of 
Ascendant's) Period, will acquire name and fame, will be much interested

a kingdom, will attain a good status, will successfully carry out his 
orders, will be atheist, will be religious and orthodoxy, will be powerful 
and capable in administrative affairs of the Government and will rise in 
the ladder of official position. 

18) If, however, the Lord of Ascendant is posited in the Navamsa chart in 
the sixth, eighth or twelfth rasi from the rasi occupied by the lord of 
the tenth bhava in the Navamsa chart, the Native will acquire ill 
reputation, notoriety, disgrace and a name for incapacity in his official 
functions; his orders will be disobeyed or countermanded and he will 
not be interested in his daily deeds or duties or ablutions. During the 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 87 

Period of the Lord of Ascendant, the Native will secretly commit sinful 
deeds. 

19) If the Lord of Ascendant is posited in the eleventh bhava in combination 
with the lord of the eleventh bhava, the Native will have profit in trade, 
will acquire the wealth from his elder brother and will get profits in 
several ways and means, which have to be ascertained from the nature 
of the planets causing this yoga. 

If, however, the Lord of Ascendant is posited in the Navamsa chart in 
the sixth, eighth or twelfth rasi from the rasi occupied by the lord of 
the eleventh bhava in the Navamsa chart, the Native will have gains 
on a very small scale, will have a small degree of pleasure and happiness, 
and will have misunderstandings with his elder brother; if the Lord of 
Ascendant and the lord of the eleventh bhava are enemies of each 
other, the Native will daily have interruptions to his gain and profits. 

20) If the Lord of Ascendant is situated in the twelfth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the twelfth bhava, the Native will be afflicted by poverty, 
will be poor, will spend away his patrimony, will reside in foreign lands, 
and will live there a miserable, unhappy and travelling life, engaged in 
fruitless undertakings. He will however have some favourable effects 
and results, if the Lord of Ascendant is in his own rasi in the twelfth 
bhava. 

21) Thus, one should predict the effects of the combination of the Lord of 
Ascendant with the lords of the twelve (i.e. properly speaking the 
eleven bhavas except the Lagna bhava). The astrologer should include 
also the effects of the signs in which he is in the Rasi chart and Amsa 
chart and also of the Trimsarnsa in which he is placed. He should also 
include the effects of the several planets that are with or that aspect 
the Lord of Ascendant, He should also take into account the strength 
of the planets. He should also consider the benefic or the malefic 
nature of the several bhavas in which the Lord of Ascendant is and 
also of the lords of the several bhavas in which the Lord of Ascendant 
is. 

22) The effects or results must be determined with reference to the following 
eight factors viz, 

the Nature of the rasi, 

the nature of the Lagna bhava, 

the nature of the karaka or karaka planet, 

the nature of the planet, 

the nature of the planets in association with the planet, 



88 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

the nature of the planets that aspect the planet, 

Parivarthanai (i.e. Mutual exchange or reception between two 
planets) and 

yoga (or combination or configuration) of planets causing Raja 
yoga. 

Note: 

a) By "rasi" here, Author probably means the rasi in which the Lord of 
Ascendant is, not Moon sign. 

b) By the "Karaka planet" means the Karaka planet for the bhava in which 
the lord of Ascendant here (or in general the lord of the bhava under 
consideration) is. 

c) By "the nature of the planet" means the planet, here Lord of Ascendant 
(or in general, the lord of the bhava) whose Period effects are under 
consideration.

During the progress of the Dasa of the lord of the 2 nd house success or 
acquisition to family, birth of noble daughters, good meals, and income 
through giving lectures, eloquence in speech and the approbation of the 
audience in the assembly thereof may be predicted. 

Should the lord of the 2 nd house be in a similar position, the native, 
during the Dasa of the said planet, will behave foolishly in an assembly, nor 
be true to his word or his family, will receive bad news, write unpleasant 
letters, suffer from eye sore, indulge in foul speech, spend wastefully and 
incur the wrath of the government. 

2 nd lord. During the Major period of the lord of 2 nd who is strong and 
well placed, there will be general prosperity in the family, enjoyment of 
good food, increased income and accumulation of wealth, eloquence of 
speech and respect for one's words, approbation by the public, good 
connections and helps from opposite sex, etc.

there will be financial loss, loss of property, quarrels in the family, heavy 
expenditure and fall in income. The native will behave stupidly, and is foul 
tongued and speak falsehoods. He will suffer from eye disease and wrath 
of superiors and elders.

Native will acquire reputation as a rich man. If Lord of Ascendant is 
weak, the Native will conceal or save his wealth, but will not enjoy itor 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 89 

spend it. This will happen during this period (i.e., the period of the lord 
of the second bhava), If the Lord of Ascendant is strong, the Native 
will enjoy some comforts from his wealth, but he will mostly preserve 
his wealth very carefully, his words will be always effective and will be 
respected; he will thrive in his education, and his family will grow in 
number and in prosperity. 

If the Lord of 2 nd house is in the sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa (i.e. in 
other words if the rasi in which the Lord of 2 nd house is in the Navamsa 
Chart is the sixth, eighth, or twelfth rasi from the rasi in which he is in 
the Rasi Chart) the Native will either earn merely a name as a rich man 
(without actual riches) or will lose his wealth (if he acquires wealth 
actually); the Native will have danger of Mrithyu or death and his Wife 
and his wife's relatives will suffer from diseases and misfortune. 

2) When the lord of the second bhava is in the third bhava, in conjunction 
with the lord of the third bhava, the wealth already saved by the 
Native, will grow in amount and value, and his brother will get wealth 
and the administration of his family will be undertaken and managed 
by his brother. The Native will get some profits in some places through 
his knowledge of musical art. If the lord of the second bhava is weak, 
the Native will have a very little gain. If the lord of the second bhava is 
in the eighth house etc, (i.e., 6 , 8* & 1 2*), amsa (i.e., 6 th , 8* & 1 2 th 
Rasis in the Navamsa Chart from the rasi occupied by the lord of the 
third bhava in the Navamsa Chart), the native's the death will be in 
bad conditions.

with the lord of the fourth bhava, the Native will acquire money through 
lands, education and conveyances; he will inherit the property of his 
maternal grand-father, and will also obtain treasure-trove in some 
places. If the lord of the second bhava is in Navamsa Chart in the 
sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa (i.e., Rasis) from the lord or the fourth 
bhava in the Navamsa Chart, the above mentioned good effects will 
not happen; if the lord of the fourth bhava is weak, the Native will 
have a little profit. 

4) If the lord of the second bhava is in the fifth bhava in combination with 
the lord of the fifth bhava, the Native will get wealth in this Period 
through a dignified person or a king or a deity or a religious institution 
or son or father. If the lord of the second-bhava is in the Navamsa 
Chart in the sixth, eighth or twelfth amsa (i.e. rasi from the occupied 
by the lord of the fifth bhava in the Navamsa Chart, these effects will 
not be realised. If the lord of the second or the fifth bhava is weak, the 
Native will have a very little gain in the Period. 



90 Encyclopedia of Vedlc Astrology: Dasa Systems 

If Venus is in association with Rahu or Saturn or Mars, the Native will 
obtain wealth in the period through a dignified person with whom his 
wife will have copulation. If the lord of the Lagna or Lagna Navamsa is 
in association with the lord of the second bhava, the Native will get 
wealth through the ways and means controlled bythislordof Lagna or 
Lagna Navamsa. 

5) If the lord of the second bhava is posited in the sixth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the sixth bhava and if the lord of the 
second bhava is strong the Native's maternal uncle will be famous, 
wealthy and influential. The Native's enemy may be said to be a rich 
person. If the Native has a normal yoga for general acquisition of 
wealth (i.e. as seen from the yoga of the other planets) he will get 
wealth. He will get wealth through medical practice or theft, or litigation. 
If the lord of the sixth bhava is weak, the Native will have a very little 
profit. If the lord of the second bhava is in the Navamsa Chart in the 
twelfth etc. in amsa (i.e. 6*, 8* & 12* rasi from the rasi occupied by 
the lord of the sixth bhava in the Navamsa Chart), there will not be 
even, this very little profit. 

6) If the lord of the second bhava is posited in the seventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the seventh bhava, the Native's father-in- 
law will acquire wealth, or the Native will himself acquire wealth through 
his father-in-law. The Native will live in aforeign place with his family, 
will get wealth in aforeign place, and will have death during the period 
favourable for death (i.e. in other words, will have death during the 
period of the lord of the second bhava, if his longevity as determined 
from other considerations bearing on the length of life falls within the 
period of the lord of the second-bhava. 

If the lord of the seventh bhava is weak or if the lord of the second 
bhava is in Navamsa Chart in the sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa (i.e. 
Rasis from the Amsa i.e. rasi occupied by the lord of the seventh 
bhava in the Navamsa Chart, the effects mentioned above will not be 
produced. If there is no yoga, as mentioned above, there will not be 
any acquisition of wealth etc., as stated above in the Period. 

7) If the lord of the second bhava is posited in the eighth bhava, in 
conjunction with the lord of the eighth bhava, the Native indebtedness 
will grow in magnitude or his wife will die or his wife will commit 
crimes or misdeeds, he will be unhappy mentally, and he will always 
have loss and expenditure. If the lord of the second bhava is in the 
Navamsa Chart in the sixth, eighth or twelfth rasi from the rasi occupied 
by the lord of the eighth bhava in the Navamsa Chart, the above 
mentioned effects will not happen and the result will be of a contrary 
nature, If the lord of the eighth bhava is weak, the Native will lead a 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 91 

useless life in a foreign place and will eat food served in funeral 
ceremonies. 

8) If the lord of the second bhava is posited in the ninth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the ninth bhava, the Native may acquire 
very large wealth, his father will be very fortunate and the Native will 
get wealth on the score of charity. If the lord of the ninth bhava is 
weak, the profits will be very little. 

If the lord of the second bhava is in Navamsa Chart in the twelfth 
amsaetc. (i.e. 6 th , 8* or 12 th ) amsa i.e. Rasisfrom the rasi occupied by 
the lord of the ninth bhava in the Navamsa Chart, there will not be 
even these small profits (i.e. the good effects described above). 

9) If the lord of the second bhava is posited in the tenth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the tenth bhava, and if the birth-Lagna is 
associated with Raja-yoga, the Native will acquire wealth through king 
or Government, will get money levied as reward, will have king's favour 
and silk apparels etc. and will earn money from trade. If the lord of the 
second bhava is weak, there will be a little gain, or there will be an 
acquisition of wealth from charity or gifts in some places. If the lord of 
the tenth bhava is weak, the Native will earn money through immoral 
and mean deeds or occupation. If the lord of the second bhava is in 
the Navamsa Chart in the sixth, eighth or twelfth amsa (i.e. rasi from 
the amsa i.e., rasi occupied by the lord of the tenth bhava in the 
Navamsa Chart), these results will not happen; but the Native will 
make attempts to get an occupation in mean or low surroundings. 

10) If the lord of the second bhava is posited in the eleventh bhava in 
combination with the Lord of 1 1 * house (i.e. the lord of the eleventh 
bhava), the Native will get the wealth of his elder brother and will have 
profits in his avocations. He will have, during the period of the lord of 
the second bhava, profits which will be determined by the nature of 
the bhava-lordship owned by the planets which are in combination 
with the Lord of 2 nd house or by the nature of the planets, which own 
the rasi in which the Lord of 2 n house is in the Navamsa Chart. If the 
lord of the second bhava is in the Navamsa Chart in the sixth, eighth 
or twelfth amsa (i.e. rasi from the amsa i.e. rasi occupied by the Lord 
of 1 1 * house in the Navamsa Chart, there will be no good effects 
described above. If the lord of the eleventh bhava is weak, here will be 
a very little gain). 

11) If the lord of the second bhava is posited in the twelfth bhava in 
combination with the Lord of 12* house (i.e. the lord of the twelfth 
bhava), the Native will incur expenditure in ways which will be 
determined by the nature of the bhava lordship owned by the planets 



92 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

which are associated with them (i.e. with the Lord of 2 nd house and 
Lord of 12* house). If there is no association of other planets with 
them, the ways and means of expenditure must be determined from 
the nature of Lord of 12* house only. If the lords of the twelfth and 
second bhavas are weak, the expenditure will be on a small scale. If 
the lord of the second bhava is in the Navamsa Chart in the 6*, 8*, or 
twelfth amsa-rasi from the amsa-rasi occupied by the lord of the twelfth 
bhava (i.e., with reference to the positions of these two planets in the 
Amsa Chart), there will be no actual expenditure, but there will be 
only a threat of expenditure, there will be trouble or disease in the 
family or to the wife or there will be mental worry or derangement or 
aberration of mind to the Native. 

12) If the lord of the second bhava is posited in the first bhava in combination

Native's words will be respected and valued; the Native will expend 
money in good and virtuous ways; he will feed many people in charity 
and will acquire a name and fame as a rich philanthropist. If the Lord 
of 2 nd house is weak, the Native will earn only a small amount of 
money. Ifthe Lord of 2 nd house is in the Navamsa Chart in the sixth, 
eighth or twelfth amsa-rasi from the Amsa of the lord of the first 
bhava in Navamsa Chart the Native will be miserly, foolhardy and 
turbulent. 

13) The lord of the second bhava will, during his period, cause effects, 
which will be in harmony with the nature of things controlled by, or 
significations attributed to or characteristics ascribed to- 

1 ) the planets which are in conjunction with the Lord of 2 nd house or 
which aspect the Lord of 2 nd house, 

2) the lord of the rasi or of amsa or of the Trimsamsa of the Lord of 

2 nd house, and 

3) the bhava owned by the planet which aspects, Or is with, the Lord 
of 2 nd house. 

Dasa of lord of the 3 rd house

expect help and cooperation from brothers, hearing of agreeable news, 
chance to show his valour, leadership in army and attainment of honour. 
He will receive support from the public and his noble qualities will be 
appreciated. 

When the lord of the 3 rd house occupies an evil house the native 
expects the demise of his brother during the Dasa of the planet. He will be 
widely condemned for all his enterprises and there will be trouble through

ill or die. He will lose courage, take to evil counsels, have trouble from 
servants, associate with low class and wicked people, suffer through the 
machinations of enemies, be humiliated and suffer discomfort and loss of 
position.

acquire wealth and vehicles (i.e. conveyances), will become capable in 
the administration of the affairs of his village and will derive benefits 
from education and from his lands. If the lord of the fourth bhava is 
weak, the mother of the Native will sometimes have sickness and 
distress; the Native will have damage caused to his crops and fields; 
and he will have interruptions in his education. If the lord of the third 
bhava is weak, the Native will have some set-back through the lord of 
third bhava, he will have partition disturbing the crops and fields and 
he will construct a new house. He will experience a fall from his vehicles 
in the period and sub-period of the planet that is weak. If the lord of 
the third bhava is in the Navamsa-Chart in the sixth, eighth or twelfth 
amsa-rasi from the amsa of the lord of the fourth bhava in the Navamsa- 
Chart, the Native will have no vehicle-yoga (i.e. he will have no vehicles); 
there will be disputes about the use of vehicles and ceremonies and 
the Native will mostly have no comforts or happiness. 

2) If the lord of the third bhava, possessed of strength, is in the fifth 
bhava in combination with the lord of the fifth bhava, the Native will 
either become a dignified person or a great man or will become one, 
who has been patronised by some one, or his brotherwill be patronised 
by some great man. The native may sometimes acquire wealth or 
have fortune through the grace of a deity. If the lord of the third bhava 
is very weak, the Native will have the occupation of a cook and he will 
sometimes earn money through music. If the lord of the third bhava is 
(moderately) weak, the Native will have a little gain. If the lord of the 
third bhava is very strong, the Native will get wealth through a king 



94 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

(or a Government). If the lord of the third bhava is, in the Navamsa- 
Chart, in the sixth, eighth or twelfth amsa-rasi from the amsa of the 
lord of the fifth bhava in the Navamsa-Chart, the Native will have 
unhappiness and disappointments on account of his undertakings 
becoming futile; if however, the lord of the third bhava is in Trikona or 
Kendre-amsa in the Navamsa-Chart, the Native will have acquisition of 
wealth and comforts. The effects should be determined with reference 
to the significations of the planets and bhavas associated with the 
third bhava, fifth bhava and their lords. 

3) If the lord of the third bhava is posited in the sixth bhava in conjunction 
with the lord of the sixth bhava, the Native's brother will become his 
enemy during the period of the lord of the third bhava or the Native's 
brother will become sickly or will suffer from enlargement of spleen 
(Gulma Roham). If the lord of the third bhava is there in association 
with a benefic yoga (i.e. having the aspect or combination of a benefic 
planet), the Native will have employment in a military department or 
will have an appointment carrying an official seal and will get wealth 
through his maternal uncle. His maternal uncle will be happy during 
the period of the lord of the third bhava. If the lord of the third bhava 
is situated in the Navamsa-Chart in the sixth, eighth or twelfth amsa- 
rasi from the amsa of the lord of the sixth bhava in the Navamsa- 
Chart, the Native will have neither enemies nor friends, and he will not 
enjoy the results mentioned above. 

If the lord of the third bhava is weak, the Native's disease will certainly 
increase in its intensity. If there is an association of the lords of the 
eighth and twelfth bhava with the lord of the third bhava (in the sixth 
bhava in conjunction with the lord of the sixth bhava), the period of 
the lord of the third bhava will produce yoga (i.e. good fortune) and 
the Native during this period, will have the good fortune of being in 
possession of wealth, vehicle and wearing apparels. If the lord of the 
third bhava is in combination with only the lord of the sixth bhava, the 
Native will suffer from ear-disease, he will have ear-trouble or ear 
operation according to the nature of the planet. All these and similar 
effects with other combinations, must be added as effects, to the 
results .tobe produced during the period of the lord of third bhava. 

4) If the lord of the third bhava is situated in the seventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the seventh-bhava, the Native's brother 
will go to a far-off land during the period of the lord the third bhava. If 
the lord of the seventh bhava is associated with a benefic planet the 
Native's brother will be happy on account of his residence in a foreign 
land. If the lord of the seventh bhava is weak in a movable rasi, the 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 95 

Native's brother will have either unhappiness or death in foreign land. 
The Native will, at that time, enjoy happiness through his father-in- 
law, orwill have his wife-side people prosperous or will have a second 
wife. 

If the lord of the third bhava is associated with more planets, the 
astrologer must include also the effects ascribed to these planets. If 
the lord of the third bhava is in the Navamsa Chart, in the sixth, eighth 
or twelfth amsa-rasi from the amsa-rasi of the lord of the seventh 
bhava in the Navamsa-Chart, death or foreign travel etc. will not happen 
in the period of the lord of the seventh bhava; also but, if he is in the 
Trikona or Kendra amsa or in the gains (11* house) amsa in the 
Navamsa-Chart the Native will have the results described above. If the 
lord of the third bhava is weak and if the lord of the seventh bhava 
also is weak, the Native's brother will be begging in the foreign lands 
ruled over by the planets, will be always disposed to wandering, and 
will be always inclined to lead a bad life. If the seventh bhava is in a 
watery rasi, the Native will have pilgrimages etc. 

5) If the lord of the third bhava is posited in the eighth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the eighth bhava, the Native's brother will have ear- 
disease or his ear will undergo an operation, and the Native's brother 
will suffer disgrace through his enemy. These effects can also be read 
as happening to the Native also. If the lord of the third bhava happens 
to be the lord of the eight bhava also, the same effects can be predicted, 
and the Native will have to face the death or enmity of his brother and 
he will also lead a bad life. If there is an association of the lord of the 
sixth or twelfth bhava, the Native will acquire wealth. If the lord of the 
third bhava is aspected by, or is in combination with benefic or is in the 
eighth etc. amsa; the above mentioned results will happen; if he is 
however in Trikona or Kendra amsa, contrary effects will be produced. 

6) If the lord of the third bhava is posited in the ninth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the ninth bhava, the Native's brother will become 
wealthy during that period (i.e. the period of the lord of the third 
bhava); the Native's father's wealth (i.e. patrimony) will grow in 
magnitude and the Native's charity will be augmented. If the lord of 
the ninth bhava is weak, the Native will have misunderstandings with 
his father. If the lord of the third bhava is, in the Navamsa-Chart, in 
the sixth, eighth ortwelfth amsa-rasi from the amsa rasi or the lord of 
the ninth bhava in the Navamsa-Chart, results contrary to the results 
mentioned above should be predicted. If the lord of the third bhava is 
weak, the Native will have a little wealth; if the lord of the third bhava 
is associated with a benefic, that period (i.e. the Period of the lord of 



96 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

the third bhava) will increase his wealth. If, however, the lord of the 
third bhava is associated with a malefic, the Native's wealth will decrease 
and the Native's father will suffer from sickness. 

7) If the lord of the third bhava is situated in the tenth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the tenth bhava, the daily ablutionary rites will be 
interrupted, and there will sometimes be impediments to Yagna or 
sacrificial rites. If the lord of the third bhava is associated with a malefic, 
the Native will acquire notoriety or ill-reputation, his brother will follow 
a mean and undignified person occupation and will do despicable and 
repulsive deeds, If the lord of the third bhava is associated with a 
benefic, his brother will be engaged in Government duties. 

8) If the lord of the third bhava is posited, in the eleventh bhava 
(presumably in combination with the lord of the eleventh bhava), the 
Native's elder and younger brothers will certainly be very fortunate 
and prosperous during that Period (i.e. the Period of the lord of the 
third bhava). The elder brother will have a very good yoga or a very 
good fortune even from his early age. There will be much gain in 
business or trade which will go on flourishing very well. The nature of 
the goods or commodities concerned in the said business or trade 
should be determined with reference to the nature of the planets and 
the rasi concerned. If the lord of the third bhava is weak, there will be 
a little gain and the yoga will be of a moderate nature. If the lord of 
the third bhava is in the sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa (in the Navamsa 
Chart), the Native's younger brother will be poor; while his elder brother 
will be happy. If the lord of the third bhava is situated in a female rasi 
in combination with female planets, these results must be predicted 
for the Native's sisters. 

9) If the lord of the third bhava is posited in the twelfth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the twelfth bhava and is also weak, the 
Native's after-born (i.e. younger brothers and sisters) will die in that 
Period (i.e. the Period of the lord of the third bhava. There will be the 
fear of enemies. There will be ear-disease; Ear-ornaments will be sold 
away. The Native will be in a vacillating or wavering mood. These 
results should be predicted in the Period and sub-periods. If the rasi 
concerned (i.e. the rasi in which the twelfth bhava with the two lords 
is) is a movable rasi, the Native's brother will be in a foreign land; if 
that rasi is a fixed rasi, he will be in a contiguous place. These all to be 
predicted, if there is an association of other planets effects, attributable 
to those planets. 

10) If the lord of the third bhava is posited in the Lagna-bhava in 
combination with the lord of the first bhava and is also strong, the 
Native will have increasing yoga (i.e. will be prospering), will be happy 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 97 

through his musical attainments will be victorious over enemies, will 
be bold and will have ear rings and ear-ornaments set with precious 
gems. If the lord of the Lagna-bhava is posited in a female rasi in 
conjunction with female planets and is also weak, the Native will be or 
will play the role of a Dev-Dasi or dancing girl and will earn money 
through this profession; if the Lord of Ascendant is in association with 
bad or malefic planets, even this profession will be conducted in a 
despicable manner. If the lord of the third bhava is in the Navamsa- 
Chart, in the sixth, eighth, or twelfth amsa-rasi from the amsa-rasi of 
the Lagnathipathi in the Navamsa-Chart, the Native will be engaged in 
fruitless or unprofitable undertakings requiring much labour but yielding 
a very small profit. 

11) If the lord of the third bhava is posited in the second bhava in 
combination with the lord of the second bhava, the Native's brother 
will die and the Native's mother will fall ill. If the lord of the third bhava 
is in his own house with strength (Perhaps when Saturn is having the 
adjacent Rasis) it may happen that the Native will have to shoulder 
the burden of maintaining that (i.e. brother's) family; there will be 
acquisition of wealth to his brother in that Period (i.e. the Period of the 
lord of the third bhava); if however the lord of the third bhava is weak 
contrary results should be predicted; if however the lord of the third 
bhava is situated in the sixth, eighth or twelfth amsa, these Contrary 
results will not occur, < 

12) When a particular bhava is under scrutiny, the Position and association 
of the lords of the other bhavas, must also be added to the effects of 
the other bhavas and of their lords and must take into account, also 
the effects of the planets which are aspecting or are in combination 
with, the such planets.- 

1) the planets that are situated in the sixth, eighth and twelfth Rasis 
from that bhava, 

2) the planets that are in the sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa from 
that bhava or from the lord of that bhava, 

3) the planets that are in the Drekkana or Trimsamsa of the lords of 
the sixth, eighth or twelfth Rasis from that bhava or from the lord 
of that bhava-all these will produce bad or inauspicious results in 
their Periods and sub-periods on account of their aspect or 
combination. 

4) If these planets are situated in Trikona or Kendras from that bhava 
or the lord of that bhava, they will produce good or auspicious 
results. 



98 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

Thus, we must ascertain the effects of a Period and include them in 
the sub-periods of the Period. 

Dasa of the lord of the 4 th house 

Helping relations, promotion of agriculture, company of females, 
acquisition of vehicles, land, new home, wealth, higher status may all be 
expected by the native during the progress of the Dasa of the lord of the 
4* house. 

When the lord of the 4* house is badly posited, he will, during his 
Dasa, cause distress to the mother (of the native), sickness to his close 
friends, danger to his lands and property, loss of cattle etc., and danger 
from water. 

4 th lord. When the period of the lord of 4* who is strong and well 
placed progresses, there will be help from relatives and friends, association 
with famous and learned men, income from agricultural operations, purchase 
of landed property, house, vehicles, etc. The native will have a higher 
status in society and if in service, will get a promotion. There will be perfect 
harmony in domestic affairs, mother's health and affairs will be moving 
smoothly, educational pursuits will be accomplished and will have enjoyments 
in short journey and pleasure trips realised. 

If the 4* lord is weak, badly placed and afflicted, during its periods, 
mother will fall ill. There will be domestic quarrels and unhappiness, loss of 
ancestral property, danger of accidents from vehicles and cattle, removal 
from the house, wickedness and loss of friends, association with wicked 
people and loss thereby, quarrels and misunderstandings with relatives, 
etc. There will be scandals and false accusations against the person. 

The Period of the Lord of the Fourth Bhava (from classics) 

1) If the lord of the fourth bhava is situated in Kendra or Trine or in his 
Own house with strength, the Native will have education, gain and 
happiness through lands etc;, agriculture will be profitable to him; he 
will construct a new house, sink a new well, will plant fruit-bearing 
trees etc, will have vehicles or conveyances and happiness through 
mother and will be initiated into learning. If the karaka planet of these 
several kinds of results or significations is also strong, the Native will 
have the scope of attaining the signification on a commendable scale. 

If however, the lord of the fourth bhava is weak, contrary results must 
be predicted and the Native's endeavours in these directions will be 
unproductive of favourable results; if the lord of the fourth bhava has 
sovereignty over unpropitious bhava also, every result will be of a 
mixed nature. The effects or signification of the planets that are the 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 99 

lords of the benefic amsa or benefic Trimsamsa in which the lord of 
the fourth bhava is situated, should be taken into account and added 
as results are bound to happen in that Period (i.e. the Period of the 
lord of the fourth bhava) or in his sub-period. 

2) If the lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the fifth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the fifth bhava, or if these planets are in mutual reception 
(i.e. occupy each other's Rasis), the Native will achieve good reputation 
in Government; will acquire wealth through education and lands in his 
father's birth-place; his house will abound in grains and cows; and he 
will, above all, have the friendship of a dignified person or lord. If the 
lord of the fifth bhava is strong, the Native will have children in his 
days of fortune, his children will prosper and he will command much 
happiness and comfort through his father; if, however, the lord of the 
fifth bhava is weak, the Native will be poor, but happy in his father's 
house. If the lord of the fourth bhava is very strong and if the karaka 
planet also is strong, the Native will certainly have a vehicle 
(conveyance) which is bedecked or embedded with golden materials 
and which is a presentation to him by the Government. The nature of 
the vehicle must be described with reference to the character of the 
planet or the rasi producing this vehicle-yoga. If the rasi or planet is in 
movable, the vehicle will be a very costly one, if it is fixed, the vehicle 
will be a palanquin and if it is dual, the vehicle will be of other kinds. If 
the lord of the fourth bhava is, in the Navamsa- Chart, in the sixth, 
eighth or twelfth amsa-rasi from the lord of the fifth bhava in the 
Navamsa Chart, there will be a set-back to the combination and the 
vehicle will be one that has been purchased; if the Lord of Ascendant 
is weak and is posited in a bad bhava, the Native will be in exile as the 
result of king's wrath, or will have the presentation of a damaged or 
used transport etc. in a king's court or council. If both the lords of the 
fourth and fifth bhavas are weak, the Native will get no fortune on 
account of his enemies even though he has approached the authority, 
will have no vehicles, will derive no benefits through his witchcraft and 
he will be unprofitably engaged in sorcery. These results must be 
predicted during the Period of the lord of the fourth bhava. 

3) If the lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the sixth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the sixth bhava and if the karaka-planet also is strong, 
the Native will, during the Period of the lord of the fourth bhava, have 
an increased yield from his lands; his mother will be happy; he will 
also be happy; his assets will prosper; he will thrive well in his education; 
his vehicles also will thrive well and his maternal uncle will have much 
happiness. If these planets are weak, the results will be contrary to 
the results mentioned above, the Native will have a fall from a vehicle, 



100 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Svstei 

his mother will become unhealthy, his property etc, will have to be 
sold away and their will be litigation about lands and interruption in 
education etc. If they are in the Navamsa-Chart in the sixth, eighth 
and twelfth amsa from each other, these bad effects will be on a small 
scale. 

4) If the lord of the fourth bhava is situated in the seventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the seventh bhava, the Native, during 
that Period (i.e., the Period of the lord of the fourth bhava) will have 
happiness and comfort in some places in a foreign land, the distances 
of which must be determined as above (i.e. with reference to the 
movable or fixed or dual nature of the Rasis); these will happen only if 
the karaka-planets are powerful, otherwise death may happen (to the 
Native); there will be no death, if they are in the eighth etc. amsa (i.e. 
the sixth, eighth or twelfth amsa) from each other in the Navamsa- 
Chart. 

5) If the lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the eighth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the eighth bhava, the Native will experience 
loss of or damage to" lands, vehicles, assets etc; his mother will have 
sickness; he will have interruptions in education and his house etc will 
be subject to encumbrances. If these planets are in the eighth etc. 
amsa (i.e. in the sixth, eighth or twelfth amsa) from each other in the 
Navamsa Chart these bad effects (i.e. Dosha or evil effects) will certainly 
be on a small scale. If they are in the same amsa or in their own amsa, 
then the strength of their amsa, and their associations with planets 
should be determined and good or bad effects should be predicted 
accordingly, whether the benefic or malefic planets are more powerful. 

6) If the lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the ninth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the ninth bhava and if the karaka-planets 
also are strong and when the time for realisation approaches,(i.e. in 
transit)- 

1) if Venus is very strong, the Native will enjoy comforts of vehicles 
or conveyances, 

2) if Mars is very strong, the Native will have profits through lands 
etc, 

3) if Mercury is very strong, the Native will have happiness and 
comforts from education, 

4) and if the Moon is very powerful, the Native will get his mother's 
property and wealth; 

thus the results must be divined in every way. If these planets (i.e. the 
lords of the fourth and the ninth) are strong in their Trikona or Kendra 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 101 

amsa in. the Navamsa Chart, the results must be predicted on a greater 
scale. If they are in the eighth etc. (i.e. the sixth, eighth or the twelfth) 
amsa from each other in Navamsa Chart or if they are weak, the 
results will be on a very small scale. 

7) If the lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the tenth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the tenth bhava and in association with 
benefic planets, the Native will become a king or an emperor or a 
minister, or an important person or one who is honoured and respected 
by the authority. If the karaka-planets are strong, the Native will have 
prospering vehicles or conveyances or wealth. The results will occur in 
that Period and bhuktis (i.e. in the Period of the lord of the fourth 
bhava and his and their sub-period). If the strength of the planet (i.e. 
of the lord of the fourth bhava) is a little less, the effects also will be a 
little less. Yagna, ceremonials or rites etc. should be predicted with 
reference to Jupiter. In some places, the Native may have some 
promotions in employment or some profits in his business or trade. If 
the lord of the fourth bhava has also the lordship over the eleventh 
bhava (i.e., as in the cases of Venus for Cancer Lagna or Mars in the 
case of Capricorn Lagna) there will be an acquisition of wealth through 
trade. If the planet is weak the results (i.e. good results) will be on a 
very little scale. Ifthe planet is situated in the eighth etc. amsa (i.e. 
the lord of the fourth bhava) is in the Navamsa Chart in the sixth, 
eighth or twelfth rasi from the amsa-rasi of the lord of the tenth bhava 
in the Navamsa Chart, there will not be even this result on a very little 
scale. 

8) It the lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the eleventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the eleventh bhava, the Native will get 
profits easily and comfortably. If there is an association of benefic (i.e. 
with the lord of the fourth bhava, the profits will be on a larger scale. 
The Native will always have gains through things or persons of the 
colour of the planets concerned. Ifthe planets are weak, the Native 
will have a little gain. Ifthe planets (i.e., the lords of the fourth and 
eleventh bhavas) are in the eighth etc., amsa (i.e. in the sixth, eighth 
and twelfth Rasis from each other in the Navamsa Chart) and are also 
in combination with or are aspected by malefic, the results (i.e. good 
results) will not occur. During that Period (i.e., the Period of the lord of 
the fourth bhava), the Native's elder brother will have happiness and 
comforts and if there is a yoga for realisation, the Native will acquire 
wealth etc. through his elder brother. 

9) Ifthe lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the twelfth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the twelfth bhava, and if the karaka- 
planets are weak, that Period (i.e. the Period of the lord of the fourth 



102 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

bhava) will do harm to the mother of the Native, to his assets and 
fields, to his education by causing interruptions and will cause 
unhappiness and mental worry to himself and diseases to his animals 
or damage to vehicles etc. If the lord of the fourth bhava is in the 
eighth etc., amsa (i.e., in the sixth, eighth and twelfth Rasis in the 
Navamsa Chart from the amsa-rasi of the lord of the twelfth bhava in 
the Navamsa Chart), the Native will have a little happiness and comfort; 
if he is in his exaltation or own house, the Native will have happiness 
and comfort; if he is in combination with malefic, the results will be 
bad and if he is in combination with benefic, the result will be good 
and the Native will have sickness sometimes in the Period or sub- 
periods of malefic. 

10) If the lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the Lagna-bhava in 
combination with Lord of Ascendant or with the Lagna-Amsa Lord and 
if the Lagna Rasi-Lord is friendly to him (i.e. the lord of the fourth 
bhava), if the benefic Bhava lords are friendly to him (i.e., the lord of 
the fourth bhava) and if the karaka-planets are strong, the Native will 
have vehicles or conveyances etc. 

If the Sun is situated in his exaltation or rasi-amsa,the Native will 
have much knowledge of his own self or Soul (i.e., ATMA Gnanam} 
and his father will be happy, healthy and physically strong. 

If the Moon is situated likewise (i.e. in his exaltation or rasi-amsa), 
the Native will enjoy the pleasures of good meals etc. 

If Mars is situated likewise, the Native will acquire lands, house, 
gardens or monuments and will achieve success in literary 
controversies or discussion or dissertations. 

If Mercury is situated likewise, the Native will have high education 
and attainments and his maternal uncle will be happy and 
prosperous. 

If Jupiter is likewise situated, the Native will be pure in heart and 
mind will be honest. 

If Venus is situated likewise, the Native will have vehicles or 
conveyances, comfort and happiness, will get ornaments and silk 
apparels etc. and will have a delicious food with good fruits. 

If Saturn is situated likewise, the Native will be cunning and will 
be addicted to double-dealing etc. 

If all the planets are strong, the above-mentioned results would 
happen, if they are weak, these results also will happen on a 
small scale. 



Chapter 02: Virnsottari Dasa System of Predictions 103 

If the planets are in the eighth etc., amsa from each other in the 
Navamsa Chart the results will be on a small scale. If the planets 
are powerless, the results will be very little. Everything must be 
predicted with wisdom. 

11) If the lord of the fourth bhava is situated in the second bhava in 
combination with the lord of the second bhava and is also situated in 
his exaltation or friendly etc. amsa, the Native will have the above 
mentioned happiness and good results in that Period (i.e. the Period of 
the lord of the fourth bhava), his family will be happy, he will have 
happiness through his wife, he will always be cheerful and comfortable 
and his words will be valued and respected certainly in that Period. If 
there is an association of malefic, these results will be less; if the 
planet (i.e., the lord of the fourth bhava) is weak, the results will be 
the same (i.e. will be less). 

1 2) If the lord of the fourth bhava is posited in the third bhava in combination 
with the lord of the third bhava and if the karaka-planets are strong, 

" the Native will have a very little result everywhere; if the lord of the 
fourth bhava is weak the Native will certainly have loss of his lands 
etc. If the lord of the fourth bhava is in his exaltation or in AAROHA or 
in his own house or is associated with benefic or is in the same amsa, 
the results pertaining to education, Vehicles (conveyances), lands etc. 
and the results mentioned above will occur on a small scale. 

13) If the planet (i.e. the lord of the fourth bhava) is in the twelfth bhava 
from a particular bhava, the Native will have good and bad results (in 
respect of that particular bhava). If he is in the sixth, eighth, and 
twelfth amsa, the Native will have unpropitious results and will have 
also profits. When the planet has strength derived from the eight factors 
(mentioned previously), the results will be auspicious and when the 
strength derived from these eight factors is less, the results also will 
be less favourable. 

Thus, the results of the Period should first be determined and then 
results of the several sub-period should be predicted with reference to 
the 'nature and significations of the planets that are in combination 
with or that aspect the lord of the fourth bhava. 

Dasa of the lord of the 5 th house, 

During the ripening of the Dasa of the lord of the 5* house, the native 
will be blessed with the birth of a son, pleasure in the company of relations 
or the post of an adviser or minister of the ruler. He himself will enjoy all 
kinds of delicacies and feed others in plenty. His meritorious acts will earn 
him approbation of the noble and virtuous people. 



104 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

Should the lord of the 5* house be weak, the native will lose a son 
during his Dasa. He will suffer from mental aberration, deception, tiresome 
journeys and roaming about, ailments of the stomach, wrath of the ruler 
and physical weakness. 

5 th lord. During the period of the lord of 5* who is strong and well 
placed, there will be birth of children and merriment in the family. The 
native will be famous, may get appointed as a counsellor or adviser to the 
State or become a minister. He will do virtuous deeds, become popular and 
be happy. 

If the lord of 5* is weak, badly placed or afflicted, there will be 
wickedness or death of children, aberration of mind through deception, 
scandals, wanderings, diseases of the stomach, etc. He will do wicked acts 
and will despise elders, superiors, learned men and preceptors. He will 
behave unwisely, lose reputation and become materialistic. 

The Period of the Lord of the Fifth Bhava (from classics) 

1) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in his own house or in his own 
Navamsa or in his own exaltation rasi with strength, the Native will be 
blessed with many children during his Period, If there is an association 
of benefic planets with him, the Native will be a dignified person or will 
have many children. If the fifth bhava-lord is in the Navamsa Chart, in 
the eighth rasi or amsa from the Lagna-Navamsa or from the Lagna- 
Navamsa Lord, in the Navamsa-Chart the Native's children will become 
his enemies during its Period. During the period when the Native is 
bound to have good results, he will have happiness and favourable 
results through his children. 

2) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the sixth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the sixth bhava, the Native's maternal uncle will have 
very good yoga (i.e. will be very prosperous), during that period (i.e. 
the period of the lord of the fifth bhava) the native will be famous and 
influential with the Government, will have happiness through the king 
and his minister; if, however, the lord of the fifth bhava is in the 
Navamsa-Chart in the eighth etc (i.e. 6 th , 8* or the 12 th ) amsa rasi 
from the lord of the sixth bhava in the Navamsa-Chart, the benefic 
yoga will be destroyed and bad effects and king's disfavour and 
displeasure etc., will be the result. If the lord of the fifth bhava is weak 
the results will be a little favourable, and if he is powerful, the results 
will be favourable as set forth above. 

3) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the seventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the seventh bhava and an benefic, the 
Native's son will go to a foreign land during the period of the fifth 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 105 

bhava-Lord and the Native will acquire wealth through this son; and 
during this period, the father-in-law of the Native will attain dignity 
and power, a marriage will take place in the Native's family, the Native's 
son will pass through a beneficial ceremony. The Native will attend a 
feast to Brahmans etc. will have divine grace and will attend pleasant 
and happy functions and recreations. If the lord of the fifth bhava is 
weak and is in the same amsa or rasi in the Navamsa Chart, there will 
be danger or sickness to his children. If the lord of the fifth bhava is, in 
the Navamsa-Chart, in the eighth etc. amsa (i.e. sixth, eighth or twelfth) 
amsa-rasi from the lord of the seventh bhava in the Navamsa-Chart 
this result will not happen. 

4) If the lord of the fifth bhava is in the eighth bhava in combination with 
the lord of the eighth bhava, the Native's children will have danger to 
their lives. The Native will beget children that will die soon, will incur 
the displeasure of dignified person or the enmity of his father or his 
guardian-deity or his mantras will become spoiled or ineffective. If the 
lord of the fifth bhava is weak and is associated with malefic, these 
effects will not happen. If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the 
twelfth, eighth or sixth amsa or rasi in the Navamsa-Chart in conjunction 
with benefic, the unpropitious effects will be minimised. 

5) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the ninth bhava in combination 
with the ninth bhava-lord and if the lord of the first bhava is weak, the 
Native will derive happiness and comfort in his youth through his father 
and his father's wealth will increase. During the period of the lord of 
the fifth bhava, the Native will achieve the position and dignity of a 
dignified person and his father will certainly have the favour of his king 
and his minister and the public or the Native will earn wealth through 
the help of a entrepreneur and will finally acquire and enjoy very much 
wealth through his son. If the lord of the firth bhava is posited in the 
eighth etc. amsa (i.e. sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa-Rasis in the 
Navamsa Charts), the Native will have these results in a small scale 
but, if the lord of the fifth bhava is powerless, these good results will 
not occur. If the lord of the fifth bhava is strong, the Native will 
sometimes acquire a fortune through divine help (As the 5 th house 
indicates God's grace). 

If the lord of the fifth bhava is Mars or is situated in Mar's rasi, the 
Native will have fortunate results or wealth through his village deity, 

If the lord of the fifth bhava is the Sun or is situated in the Sun's rasi, 
the Native will be employed in a temple as a clerk, 

If the lord of the fifth bhava is the Moon or is in the Moon's rasi, the 
Native will be a treasurer, financial consultant, 



106 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

If the lord of the fifth bhava is Mercury or is posited in Mercury's rasi, 
the Native will be an official in a court of law, 

If the lord of the fifth bhava is Jupiter or is situated in Jupiter's rasi, the 
Native will be the head of a charitable institution, 

If the lord of the fifth bhava is Venus or is in the rasi of Venus, the 
Native will have dancing girls in his hotels, and 

If the lord of the fifth bhava is Saturn or is in Saturn's rasi, the Native 
will be employed administrator as one who is charged with the duty or 
power of inflicting punishment. 

Thus, one should predict events with reference to the nature or 
characteristics of planets with the help of his intelligence and experience. 

If the planet in question is Jupiter, the Native will earn money through 
his employment and if this planet is Venus, the source of his income will be 
music or dance or art. Thus the source or income should be determined 
intelligently with reference to the qualities of the planets. 

6) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the tenth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the tenth bhava or is situated in the Lagna or is in 
conjunction with the lord of the Lagna or is in the Lagna-Navamsa in 
the Navamsa-Chart, the Native will surely acquire a high status during 
the period and sub-period of the lord of the fifth bhava and will ascend 
a good authoritative post; if the lord of the fifth bhava in such position 
is exalted and has a varga position, the Native or his son will have 
influence over many countries. If however, the Lord of Ascendant, in 
such a yoga is powerless, the native will have an ascetic yoga and will 
become the head of a mutt. 

If the Lord of Ascendant, in such a yoga, is posited in the eleventh 
bhava with his strength, the Native will become a rich boss through 
business. When, the lord of the second bhava is placed in his Parama- 
Ucha portion (i.e. exaltation point) in the 1 1 * house, the Native will 
have unlimited profit through trade or royal status. If the lord of the 
second bhava is in a watery rasi or in a movable rasi in such a yoga, 
the Native will amass immense wealth through sea-trade; 

If however, the lord of the fifth bhava is in the eighth etc. amsa (i.e. 
6 , 8 th , 12 amsa Rasi in Navamsa chart w.r.t. lord of tenth Bhava) 
and is also weak, the effects will be those attributed to weak planets 
and will be according to the nature of these weak planets as described 
already. 

In the planetary yogas for trade, the commodities of the trade will be 
in accordance with the nature of the planets, bhavas (i.e. the goods 
will be such as are ruled over by the bhava of the planets). If the 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 107 

planets have control over juicy substances, the articles of trade will be 
sugar etc; if the planets have control over perfumes, the articles will 
be musk, etc. Thus the articles of trade must be determined with 
reference to the nature of the planets and the articles that they rule 
over; in the case of a yoga for appointment or post, the nature of the 
appointment or post, should be predicted with reference to the nature 
of the planets involved and of the planets that are in association with 
them. 

If the tenth bhava is strong, the effects must be predicted with reference 
to four ways of earning livelihood and wealth, i.e. 1) sovereignty; 2) 
appointment, 3) trade, 4) and agriculture. These become varied and 
multiplied very much according to the position and strength of the 
planets and the planets that are associated with them. 

7) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the eleventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the eleventh bhava, the Native will acquire 
wealth through his son or a dignified person or his brother. Here the 
caste or sex of the dignified person has to be determined from the 
nature of the planet that is the lord of the eleventh bhava, if this 
planet i.e. lord of the eleventh house, is Jupiter, the dignified person 
will be a Brahman; if it is Venus, the dignified person will be a female; 
if it is the Sun, the dignified person will be a king; if it is Mercury, the 
dignified person will be a businessman; if it is Mars, the dignified person 
will be a administrator; if it is the Moon, the dignified person will be a 
trader; if it is Saturn, the dignified person will be a low caste or a 
Mlecha or a Chandala, These planets will cause troubles as the result 
of their being the owners of malefic bhavas. 

The learned should take into his consideration the favourable or 
unfavourable tendencies of the planets and predict their influences 
and effects. An association of benefic will produce favourable and 
propitious results and the association of malefic will cause malevolent 
and unpropitious results. 

8) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the twelfth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the twelfth bhava during the time for the fruition of the 
yoga for diseases, the Native will have old age problems, mental 
aberration, wanderings of mind etc. During this period, the Native will 
be afflicted with idiocy, imbecility, jaundice and other diseases which 
are caused by an excess of bile. His father will become sickly, his 
children will have trouble and danger to their lives and he (Native) will 
be mentally worried, unhappy and gloomy and will incur the displeasure 
of his dignified person. If there is an association of a benefic planet, he 
will be progressing in his philosophical and metaphysical studies and 
will display more and more of his renunciation of worldly matters and 



108 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 



affairs and pleasures; he will have the comforts of the bed and 
spend his income in good and commendable ways. If there is an 
association of malefic planets, the expenditure will be in bad and 
objectionable ways and if there is Mixed (i.e., mixed) association of 
benefic and malefic planets, the expenditure will be on account of 
good and bad ways. If, in the above mentioned yoga, the Lord of 
, Ascendant (lord of the Ascendant) is weak, the Native will be poor and 
will be roaming about in distant places and will be tossed about without 
corresponding benefit. 

9) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the first bhavawith the Lord 
of Ascendant and with the association of a benefic planet, the Native 
will become the leader of men during the period of the lord of the fifth 
bhava, will become the leading person of his community and in family. 
He will be blessed with the acquisition of wealth, conveyances, etc., 
will undergo adoption in his youth and will have a few children. If the 
lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the Navamsa-Chart in the eighth 
etc. amsa (in ,thesixth, eighth and twelfth amsa -Rasisfrom the lord 
of the Lagna in the Navamsa-Chart) and is also weak, the Native will 
approach a very low status dignified person or government employee, 
will undergo no adoption and will not himself attain the status of a 
dignified person; if, however, there is the association of a benefic planet, 
the Native will make friends with dignified persons, will have the favour 
of kings, acquisition of wealth, and fruition of witch-crafts, and godly 
grace; if there is a yoga for asceticism or Sanyasa, the Native will 
become the head of a mutt with numerous disciples in attendance and 
persons offering him their presents; if however this planet (i.e., the 
lord of the fifth bhava) is weak, the Native will have a few and low 
disciples with small presents from devotes . 

10) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the second bhava in 
combination with the lord of the second bhava the members of the 
Native's family will be happy and comfortable, the Native will enjoy a 
good and sumptuous meal, his sayings or predictions will be fulfilled 
by the grace of God and he will some-times acquire wealth; if the lord 
of the fifth bhava is devoid of strength, these results will be on a very 
small scale; and these also will be the results if the lord of the fifth 
bhava is in the eighth etc. amsa (i.e., is in the Navamsa-Chart in the 
sixth, eighth or twelfth amsa or rasi from the lord of the second bhava 
in the Navamsa-Chart). 

1 1) If the lord of the fifth bhava is posited in the third bhava in combination 
with the lord of the third bhava, the Native will have a child during the 
period and sub-period of the lord of the fifth bhava; his brother will 
become famous and he himself will become a very great man during 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 109 

the period, if it occurs in the early part of his life; he will have ear- 
ornaments, will have peace and happiness of mind, courage, and 
strength of body; if however, the lord of the fifth bhava is weak, the 
Native will become weak in body, and this also will be the result of the 
lord of the fifth bhava if situated in the eighth etc. amsa (i.e. in the 
sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa or Rasis in the Navamsa-Chartfrorn the 
lord of the third bhava in the Navamsa-Chart). 

12) If the lord of the fifth bhava is situated in the fourth bhava in combination 
with its lord, the Native will, always enjoy comforts of conveyances 
etc., will, enjoy comforts and happiness through a industrialist, will 
have presents from kings and will be acquiring wealth and Vehicles on 
an increasing scale. If however, the lord of the fifth bhava is weak, the 
Native will be afflicted with loss of children. He will be a teacher to a 
dignified person who will go to his house for instruction, will obtain 
lands through a dignified person, and will also sometimes get Vehicles. 
If the lord of the fifth bhava is weak, the results will be on a small scale 
in general. If however, the lord of the fifth bhava is in the eighth etc. 
amsa (i.e. in the sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa or Rasis in the Navamsa- 
Chart from the lord of the fourth bhava in the Navamsa-Chart), the 
Native will not have even these small beneficial results. If, however, 
there is an association of benefic planets, the Native will become the 
king of many countries; will have much benefits through his high 
education and many Vehicles (conveyances). If, however the lord of 
the fifth bhava, is weak, these results will be on a very little scale, and 
the Native will be the king of a small country; and if there is a Raja 
yoga, the Native will have a very large, spacious and high palace etc. 
The learned should predict the various events by taking into account 
the nature, strength etc., of the planets involved and the nature of the 
sub-periods concerned and also the positions of the planets at birth 
and at the period covered by the prediction (i.e. during the Transit). 

Dasa of the lord of the 6 th house 

During the progress of the Dasa of the lord of the 6* house, the native 
could destroy all his enemies, by show of his strength; enjoy perfect wealth, 
be liberal minded, will be very powerful and be blessed with splendour and 
affluence. 

If the lord of the 6* house is weak, during his Dasa period, the native 
will suffer at the hands of the thieves, from many reverses, defeat, 
subjugation and many diseases. He will perform evil deeds and servile 
duties. He will be despised and defamed and receive wounds. 

6 th lord. During the periods of the lord of 6* who is strong and well 
placed, the native will defeat his enemies, succeed in litigation, clear off 



1 10 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

debts, will be free from ailments, do daring acts, become liberal, powerful 
and will live in all splendour and prosperity. 

If the lord of 6* is weak, badly placed or afflicted, during his periods, 
there will be misunderstandings with maternal uncles, Bad health or death 
to them, Bad health to the native, incurring of debts, litigations and failure 
in them, loss of property, defeat at the hands of enemies, etc. He will do 
wicked acts and even suffer imprisonment or punishment, danger from 
weapons and wounds is also possible. 

The Period of the Lord of the Sixth Bhava (from classics) 

1) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the sixth bhava in combination 
with benefic planets, the Native will always enjoy comforts and 
happiness during the period of the lord of the sixth bhava. The effects 
at the commencement of the period will be in conformity with the 
nature or attribute of the planets that are in conjunction with the lord 
of the sixth bhava. The effects will be unfavourable to this bhava during 
the sub-periods of the planets that are in combination with the lord of 
the sixth bhava and during the sub-periods of the other planets the 
period will produce comforts, happiness, acquisition of wealth, 
accomplishment of purpose or objects, fruition of endeavours and relief 
from the troubles and annoyances caused by enemies, greater income 
from lands, crops and Vehicles and also wearing apparels etc. 

If the lord of the sixth bhava is weak, the results of the period will be 
poor or very meagre. If the lord of the sixth bhava is in conjunction 
with the lord of the eighth or twelfth bhava, the period will yield much 
wealth throughout its period and will produce happiness. If the Lord of 
the sixth bhava is in the Kendra or Trikona amsa, the period will produce 
troubles from enemies etc. If the lord of the sixth bhava is in the sixth, 
eighth and twelfth amsa, the period with yield mixed results. 

2) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the seventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the seventh bhava, the Native's wife will 
sometimes have bad health; he will sometimes have happiness, relief 
from enemies in foreign places, interruption to auspicious ceremonies 
and realisation of good results. He is likely to have sickness either to 
himself or his wife and will have estrangement of feelings with his 
wife. These results will happen during the period and sub-period of 
these planets. If the Lagna Lord is weak in association with malefic, 
the Native will be unhealthy, will have troubles from his enemies, will 
incur displeasure, will receive blows, will contract debts, and will sustain 
bodily injuries, and loss of women. If the Lord of the sixth bhava is in 
the eighth etc. (i.e. 8*, 12* and 6 th ) amsa, the Native will have no 
misunderstanding with his wife. If the karaka of the seventh bhava is 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 111 

posited in the Kendra and Trikona amsa in conjunction with Rahu, the 
Native's wife will be subjected to calumny and slander and will be 
pointed out by the finger of scorn. If this karaka is weak and is situated 
in Pisoes sign, the Native will certainly marry for the second time due 
to misunderstanding with the first wife. If Venus, posited in the rasi of 
Mars or Saturn, is associated with or aspected by these planets, the 
Native will enjoy many women as the result of his quarrels with his 
wife. If the lord of the sixth bhava is in combination with the lord of 
the second house, the period of the lord of the sixth bhava will bring 
about the death of the Native during its currency. 

Thus, the effects of the lord of the sixth bhava should be decide with 
reference to the house position and planetary association, when the 
lord of the sixth bhava is situated in other bhavas. 

3) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the eighth bhava in 
combination with or aspect of, benefic planets, the lord of the sixth 
bhava will produce benevolent results during the sub-periods of these 
benefic. If the lord of the sixth bhava is situated in the Lagna, sixth 
and eighth houses, he will cause terrible and serious diseases and will 
also cause poverty and affliction from enemies during the sub-period 
of the Lord of Ascendant etc. 

If he is posited in the sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa and if the Lord of 
Ascendant occupies benefic amsa, diseases will be cured and troubles 
from enemies will be obviated. If the lord of the sixth bhava is in 
combination with the Lord of Ascendant in the rasi Chart or amsa 
Chart, the Native will certainly never be extricated from the cruel 
clutches of his enemies and diseases. The planet that is associated 
with the lord of the sixth bhava in the eighth bhava will cause death or 
sickness to the Native during its sub-period. 

4) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the ninth bhava in combination 
with malefic and if the karaka of the ninth bhava is strong, the father 
of the Native will have troubles from his enemies and diseases; the 
Native's enemies will grow in number and strength; his patrimony will 
deteriorate and his ancestral customs and honours will decline during 
the period and sub-period. If the lord of the sixth bhava is in conjunction 
with the karaka of the ninth bhava, his father will die. 

If the lord of the ninth bhava is in combination with the karaka of 9 th 
house in the eighth bhava and if the lord of the sixth bhava is associated 
with or aspected by the lord the eighth bhava even in. the ninth bhava, 
the Natives father will die before his birth; the death of the father 
should be determined with reference to such yogas. If the lord of the 
seventh bhava also is associated in such yoga, the father will meet 



112 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

with death in a foreign place. If the lord of the ninth bhava is combined 
with the lord of the sixth bhava only, the Native and his father will not 
freely associate (be rather inimical) with each other. 

5) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the tenth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the tenth bhava, the Native will have to face interruption 
in his daily duties and will do detestable deeds. His avocation, will be 
of a disgraceful character; he will have king's or state's displeasure; 
will run into ignominy and his mother will fall sick during her conception. 
If the Moon is conjunction with Rahu, his mother will contract disease 
and if these planets are however in the sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa 
with benefic, his mother's sickness will be of a moderate degree; good 
results will ensue during the period of a benefic and bad results will 
follow during the period of a malefic and all these results will be in 
accordance with the characteristics of the planets concerned. 

6) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the eleventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the eleventh bhava, the lord of the sixth 
bhava will prove detrimental to the means of gains during his period 
and sub-period; if he is in association with a benefic, the Native may 
have gains sometimes through his maternal uncle and he may 
sometimes have misunderstandings with his elder brother. If the lord 
of the sixth bhava is situated in the eighth etc. (i.e., eighth, twelfth 
and sixth) amsa, the results will be quite contrary to those recited 
above. If the Lagna Lord is strong, the Native will score victory over 
his enemies. The result must be inferred always with reference to the 
nature, house-position and association of the planets. 

7) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the twelfth house in 
combination with the lord of the twelfth bhava, the Native's enemy will 
be ruined and the Native will sometimes commit misdeeds or wickedness 
during the commencement of the period of the Lord of 6 th house. This 
Lord of 6* house will produce sickness and evil during the sub-period 
of the planet, with whom he is conjoined in the twelfth bhava. 

The period of the lord of the sixth bhava, if he is combined with a 
benefic, will mostly produce good fortune. If the Lord of 6* house is 
situated in the eighth etc., (i.e., eighth, twelfth and sixth) amsa, the 
result will be poor; but the result will be fully favourable, if he is posited 
in Trikona amsa. 

8) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in Lagna in combination with 
the Lord of Ascendant, the Native will suffer from diseases during the 
period of the Lord of 6* house, and he will have deformities, sores in 
his mouth and also troubles from kings. If Rahu is in conjunction with 
Lord of 6 th house, the Native will be troubled by thieves and will be 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 113 

handcuffed through thieves. If the Sun and the Moon are devoid of 
power, the Native will undergo problems as the result of his poverty. If 
Lord of 6* house is posited in the sixth, eighth and twelfth amsa and 
if the Lord of Ascendant is situated in his own amsa in combination 
with benefic, the effects described above will surely be of a moderate 
degree. If the Lord of Ascendant is in combination with the lords of the 
sixth, eighth and twelfth bhavas, he will cause leprosy. If the Lord of 
Ascendant is situated close to the Lagna-bhava or Lagna-amsa, the 
period of the Lord of 6* house will cause troubles from foes, disease 
and, penury in a gradually increasing degree, without causing relief 
from them or death. 

9) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the second bhava in 
combination with the lord of the secqnd bhava, the Native will 
experience quarrels daily in his house, Mil have misunderstandings 
with the members of his family, untimely meals, expenditure through 
enemies, tooth-ache, sore eye, ulcers, wounds etc. If a benefic planet 
is combination with the Lord of 6* housp, the native will sometimes 
have happiness and comfort, and will sometimes incur expenditure on 
account of wounds and ulcers: if the Lord of 6* house is in conjunction 
with both benefic and malefic planets, these results will be of a mixed 
nature; if the Lord of 6* house is in combination with malefic, the 
results will always be good. If the Lagna Lord is in conjunction with 
Lord of 6* house, in second house, the period of the Lord of 6* house 
will cause death to the Native in the sub-period of the Lord of Ascendant 
and bad results will be produced during the boyhood of the Native. 

10) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the third bhava in combination 
with the lord of third bhava, the Native's brother will become his enemy; 
the Native will suffer from ear-ache and Ear-disease etc., will incur 
expenditure on account of his enemies and will sometimes have a 
terrible hissing or singing sound in his ears and will some-times be 
dejected or disheartened. If the Lord of 6* house is associated with 
benefic, the Native will have a mixture of good and bad results. If the 
Lord of 6* house is posited in the eighth etc. (i.e. eighth, twelfth and 
sixth) amsa, the results will be of a mixed nature i.e., both good and 
bad). If 6* lord is in the Kendra and trikona amsa, the results will be of 
the same nature as described already above (i.e. shall be bad). If the 
Karaka (i.e., Karaka for the third house iie., Mars) is weak, the Native's 
brother will have sickness. If Lord of 6* house is in combination with a 
Maraka planet (i.e. death-inflicting planet), the lord of the sixth bhava 
will cause death during his period. 

11) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the fourth bhava and if the 
Moon is in combination with Rahu, the Native's mother will be morally 



114 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Syst 

substandard and will become sickly in her old age; if then, Mars is 
weak, his lands will be misappropriated by his enemies; if then Mercury 
is weak, his education will have interruptions; if then Venus is devoid 
of strength, the Native will have troubles from Vehicles (i.e. 
conveyances). 

If the lord of the fourth bhava is strong, the Native, if a woman, will 
surely have widowhood. If the lord of the sixth bhava and the Lord of 
Ascendant are inimical to each other or in the 6* & 8 th positions from 
each, the Native's mother will be an abandoned woman. If there is a 
combination of benefic, the results will be of a mixed nature, if benefices 
are in combination with the lord of the sixth bhava, the results will be 
mixed; and if there is a combination of the malefic with the lord of the 
sixth bhava, the results will be of a different nature and there will be 
loss of assets and crops and agriculture will be an unprofitable concern. 

12) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in the fifth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the fifth bhava the Native will make enemies of his 
dignified persons and either of his sons or father; his sons will either 
fall ill or meet with impediments in their career; the Native will have 
interruptions in the performance of Japa and worship of his deity, will 
get himself entangled in unnecessary and unprofitable controversies 
or disputations. If the Lord of 6* house is situated in the eighth etc. 
(i.e. eighth, twelfth and sixth) amsa, the results will be poor; if there is 
a conjunction of benefic planets with the Lord of 6* house, the results 
will be of a mixed nature; if there is a conjunction of malefic planets, 
the Native will either lose children or will sometimes have no children 
at all. 

13) If the lord of the sixth bhava is posited in Kendra and Trikona houses 
and if the Lord of Ascendant is devoid of strength, the Native will have 
the combination of being imprisoned and handcuffed and will be afraid 
of Government. The cause for being handcuffed will be determined 
with reference to the planets that are in conjunction with, or in aspect 
of, the Lord of 6* house and that are the owners of the house occupied 
by the Lord of 6 th house. If the lord of the sixth bhava and the first 
bhava are in combination with each other in a house, the nature of the

life or his wife will die soon. The wife will die in the period or sub- 
period of the Lord of 7 th house or she will become inimical to her 
husband. 

2) If the lord of the seventh bhava is posited in the eighth bhava in 
combination with a malefic and if the karaka planet is weak, the period

while making predictions.

commencement of the period of the Lord of rhouse, will have conjugal 
felicity and will acquire wealth or conveyance in a distant place through

of benefic, predict good to children and receipt of letters etc, by the 
Native from his dignified persons who have gone to foreign places and

the Lord of 7* house is situated in the eighth etc. (i.e. sixth, eighth

of 7* house is weak, the results will be on a poor scale.

results will be moderate. If the Lord of 7* house is in the eighth etc, 
(i.e., sixth, eighth and twelfth) amsa, the results will be of a different 
character. One should take into account the effects of the planets that 
are in association with the Lord of 7 th house for correct predictive 
analysis.

or statutory procedure or his creditor will usurp his landed property 
after persecuting him for the debts due to him. If the Moon is weak 
the Native's mother will be ruined. If Lord of 8* house is weak or is

yoga etc.

eighth bhava is posited in Kendra and Trikona bhavas, his period will 
produce bad or evil results and misfortunes. If the lord of the eighth

combination with the lord seventh bhava, the Native's wife will fall ill. 
If the Lord of 8* house is a malefic, the Native himself will fall ill or if

Lord of 7* house and the Lord of Ascendant are both strong, the 
period of the Lord of 8* house will mostly do good. 

13) General:- 

Ifthe lord of the eighth bhava is posited in the sixth bhava, the 
Native will be worried by the fear or trouble from his enemies 
during the period of the Lord of 8* house. 

If the Lord of 8* house is in the twelfth bhava, the period will 
cause much expenditure to the Native in several ways. 

If the Lord of 8* house is in the eighth bhava, his period will 
produce sorrow, misery, poverty, fear and uneasiness of mind. 

If he is in combination with benefic, his period will do good. If the 
Lord of 8* house is a nature benefic planet, he will produce Mixed 

results. 

The Lord of 8* house will similarly yield results in his amsa positions 
also. If the lord or the rasi occupied by the Lord of 8* house is 
posited in Kendra and Trikona houses and is also there in associatbn 
with benefic, he will produce good, but will do harm to the bhava 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 123 

occupied by him. The same results will follow even with-respect- 
to amsa Chart. 

First the results of a period should be decided in this way and 
then the results of the sub-period should be determined. 

There is something to be specially considered while deciding the 
effects of the Lord of 8 th house. The period and sub-period of the 
Lord of 8* house, who is in combination with a benefic will do 
good. The period of a malefic planet that is in combination with 
the Lord of 8* house will do good. Even a benefic planet that is in 
Kendra and Trikona houses in combination with the Lord of 8* 
house, with a malefic planet also there, will produce bad results in 
his own sub-period in the period of the Lord of 8* house and will 
cause bad health to the Native and to his relatives, unsteady mind, 
disease to the Native's mother and disgrace to his wife. If there is 
the combination of a benefic, the bad results will be reduced. If 
the Lord of 8* house is a benefic, there is no defect thereby. If the 
lord of the rasi occupied by the Lord of 8* house, is in combination 
with the Lord of 8* house, the lord of the period will cause sorrow, 
misery and poverty and the lord of the sub-period will similarly 
produce sorrow, misery etc. 

Dasa of the lord of the 9 th house 

During the Dasa period of the lord of the 9* house, the native will be 
blessed with the company of his wife, sons, grand children and relations, 
continuous prosperity, happiness and wealth; act in noble ways, enjoy state 
favour, pay homage to Brahmins and gods. 

When the lord of the 9* house is weak and his Dasa period is in 
operation, the native will have to face the displeasure of the deity who was 
worshipped formerly -even something untoward may happen to him; his 
wife and children may too suffer; this native will also indulge in wicked 
deeds, one of his elders or his father may pass away and may lead a life of 
penury. 

9 th lord. When the lord of 9* is strong, and well placed, during his 
periods the person will enjoy happiness and comforts in the company of his 
beloved ones. He will do virtuous deeds and will be nobly disposed, faithful 
and truthful. His wealth will increase and he will receive favours from elders 
and superiors or from Government. His fame and popularity willincrease 
and he may even become a minister or adviser to the State. The affairs of 
the father will have a smooth flow. 

If the lord of 9* is weak and afflicted, the native will develop materialistic 
outlook, be impious, hate elders and preceptors, be cruel and wicked. He 
bse reputation, and scandals will crop up. Wife and children will suffer 



124 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

ill health and an elderly person in the family (father?) will die. He will 
always be in want and unfortunate in all his attempts. 

The Period of the Lord of the Ninth Bhava. (Ninth House) (from 
classics) 

1) If the lord of the ninth bhava is posited in the ninth bhava in combination 
with or aspected by benefic planets, the period of the Lord of 9* 
house {i.e. lord of the ninth bhava) will augment the wealth of the 
Native, and also that of his father and will cause expenditure through 
charily. The effects of the period will vary according to the nature of 
the planets that are in combination with the Lord of 9* house. If 
malefic are conjoined with the Lord of 9* house, his wealth will 
deteriorate, or his father may die and he will become poor, and unsteady 
in his mind. If the Lord of 9* house is weak, the Native will have a little 
wealth and the result will be the same, even if the Lord of 9* house is 
posited in the eighth etc. amsa. 

2) If the lord of the ninth bhava is posited in the tenth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the tenth bhava and a benefic, the Native, during this 
period, will get wealth through Kings or Government and achieve much 
reputation, and will lead a religious life, will do charitable deeds such 
as the sinking of a well in charity etc. and will have a hand in the 
administrative machinery of the country; 

If the Lord of 9* house is weak, the Native will perform mean and 
disgraceful deeds; if the Lord of 9* house is in combination with malefic, 
the Native will be engaged in detestable or ignoble pursuits and his 
occupation may sometimes be spoiled. He will be engaged in wicked 
or vicious deeds, will associate himself with people of low caste and 
will loose his occupation at the instance of the Government. He will be 
afraid of trouble from the Government and his assets etc. will be 
destroyed. 

3) If the lord of the ninth bhava is posited in the eleventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the eleventh bhava, the Native will have 
gain through his father and business. Ifthe Sun is powerful, his father 
will wield power and influence. If Rahujs in combination there, his 
father will be famous and the Native will acquire much wealth through 
his father. He will have gains in the period of the Lad of 9* house 
through the influence of the planet, that- is in combination with him. If 
the Lord of 9* house is weak, the results will be on a poor scale. If the 
planet that is in combination with the Lord of 9* house is a malefic, 
the Native will incur loss. 

4) If the lord of the ninth bhava is posited in the twelfth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the twelfth bhava, the wealth of the 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 125 

Native will decrease, his father will have troubles and he will incur 
expenditure through charity during his period. If a benefic is in 
combination with the Lord of 9* house, the Native may sometimes 
reside in a foreign place and acquire wealth there, or his father will 
proceed to a distant country. If the karaka planet is in conjunction with 
a benefic, his father will become famous and powerful and if this planet 
is on the other hand in conjunction with a malefic, either his father or 
he will undergo troubles. If the Lord of 9 th house is in the eighth etc. 
amsa, the result will be of Mixed nature and the results will be the 
same, even when the Lord of 9* house is weak. 

5) If the Lord of 9* house is posited in the Ascendant-bhava in combination 
with the Ascendant lord and a benefic, the Native will, during the 
period of the Lord of 9* house, acquire wealth, conveyances and the 
powers or status of a king or a minister. His patrimony will flourish to 
a high degree. He will protect or maintain many people daily and will 
assume an important place in the administration of his country. If the 
Lord of 9* house is weak, the results will be of a poor degree; and 
even these poor results will not occur, if the Lord of 9 th house is in the 
eighth etc., amsa. 

If Mars happen to be the Lord of 9* house the Native will have enormous 
landed property and he will get the post of a commander-in-chief of 
forces. If the Lord of 9* house is in conjunction with Rahu, the Native 
will be a minister under a Yavanas King. If the Lord of 9* house is the 
Moon, the Native will be the custodian of a treasury or will be a treasury 
officer. 

6) If the Lord of 9* house is posited in the second bhava in combination 
with the lord of the second bhava, the Native will be the lord of a very 
great wealth; his income will exceed a lakh, his words will be a valued 
everywhere, he will improve his family very much and he will have 
good and palatable dishes. If malefic are in combination with the Lord 
of 9* house, the results will be poor; or the period will cause the 
Native's death, if there is a Mrithyu yoga during the period. If the Lord 
of 9* house is in the eighth etc., amsa, the results will be different. 
You will have to take also into account the effects of the planets, that 
are in conjunction with the Lord of 9 th house. 

7) If the Lord of 9* house is posited in the third bhava in combination 
with the lord of the third bhava, the period of the Lord of 9* house will 
increase the wealth and assets belonging to the Native or his father, 
and will also increase the fortunes of the Native's brother and will 
sometimes produce gains and happiness to the Native through music 
and art. If the Lord of 9* house is weak or is posited in the eighth etc. 
amsa, the results will be poor. 



126 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

8) If the Lord of 9* house is situated in the fourth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the fourth bhava, and if Mars is powerful, the Native 
will have increase of wealth through lands. If Venus is powerful in 
birth chart, the Native gets conveyances and Vehicles etc., and will be 
honoured by public with garland, sandal paste, fragrant etc. If Mercury 
is powerful, the Native will get wealth through his learning, and if 
Jupiter is powerful, he will attain the status of a king or minister. If 
Saturn and Rahu are powerful, the Native will be honoured and 
respected by Mlecha and industrialist and dignified persons, thus the 
effects of Dasa of 9* lord should be predicted. 

9) If the lord of the ninth bhava is posited in the fifth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the fifth bhava, the Native will enjoy happiness etc., 
through his father when the combination for realisation occurs or will 
be patronised by a rich persons. If the Lord of 9* house is associated 
with the Ascendant lord, the Native will himself become dignified. During 
the period of the Lord of 5 th house, he will enjoy much happiness or 
his son, being a very wise man, will become an assistant to a minister 
or a King with symbols of royal dignity and grandeur. 

10) If the lord of the ninth bhava is posited in the sixth bhava in combination 
with the Lord of 6* house and also a benefic, the period of the Lord of 
9* house will produce auspicious effects and the Native's source of 
income will be bettered by an appointment of power or elevation of 
post in a court of justice. The Native will protect many servants, will be 
rich, will be possessed of conveyances and wealth, his wealth will go 
on increasing and he may sometimes inherit the wealth of his grand- 
parents. 

If Mars is in his own house, he will acquire wealth through lands. If 
Jupiter is in combination with them, the Native will have enormous 
riches. If the Sun is in combination with them, the Native will earn 
money through his learning or by being a scribe. If Rahu is in 
combination with them, the Native will be master of wealth belonging 
to thieves. If Saturn is in combination, the Native will always be an 
officer-in-charge of punishment or will be the head of officers, provided 
with Government official seals or of ambassadors. If the Lord of 9* 
house is weak, or posited in the eighth etc. amsa, the results will be 
poor. 

11) If the lord of the ninth bhava is posited in the seventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the seventh bhava and has also a benefic 
yoga, the Native's wealth will be growing; he will sometimes acquire 
wealth in a foreign place, or his father will either be a minister or 
friend of a king in a foreign land, and the wealth of the family will 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 127 

increase thereby and the Native will be one born in a rich family and 
will therefore be happy, possessed of all means of comfort, convenience 
and luxury. He will enjoy pleasures through amorous women, perfumery 
and garlands etc. 

If the Lord of 9* house is weak, the results will be poor and they will 
be the same, even when the Lord of 9* house is posited in the eighth 
etc. amsa. If Mars is in combination with them, the Native will acquire 
lands by living in a foreign place. If there is a combination with Jupiter, 
the Native will amass money. If Venus is in combination, he will derive 
happiness and comfort through the help of women. 

12) If the lord of the ninth bhava is posited in the eighth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the eighth bhava, there will be destruction 
of wealth, or certainly the death of the father of the Native, or sorrow 
and misery due to poverty. If these planets are situated in a movable 
rasi, the Native will be wandering without any advantage in a foreign 
place. If there is a beneficyoga, the results will be of a mixed nature. 

If the Lord of 9* house is weak, the Native will be afflicted with poverty, 
his body will become weak, through sorrow and the results should be 
predicted according to the bad combinations as mentioned already. If 
the Lord of 9* house is in debilitation or combust or in an inimical rasi, 
he will always produce sorrow. The results of a planet's period and 
sub-period should be wisely determined with reference to the nature 
and significations of the planets involved as per rules already set fourth 
above and also by taking into account the good or bad combinations 
and the planetary positions. 

Dasa of the lord of the 10 th house

achieve great success in any undertaking begun by him, lead a happy life, 
attain great fame, settle himself on a permanent position, will be tactful 
and of amiable disposition and enjoy great respect. 

When the Dasa of the lord of the 1 0* house, who is weak, is in progress 
the native may engage himself in fruitless enterprises; may suffer from 
bss of honour; he may be a crook in his acts; be in exile; pass through a 
chain of unfortunate happenings; He may lead a miserable life and suffer 
accordingly.

the person may lose his profession or suffer loss in business. He will incur 
displeasure from superiors or State. He will lose position and status, and 
professional worries will increase, take to long journeys, lead a wicked life 
and be miserable. 

The Period of the Lord of the Tenth Bhava. (Tenth House) (from 
classics) 

1) If the lord of the tenth bhava (i.e. Raajyaathipathi) is posited in the 
tenth or eleventh bhava in combination with benefic and also the lord 
of the eleventh bhava (i.e. Lord of ll^housejthe Native will surely be 
blessed with kingly power and status, he will become very famous, will 
be much honoured everywhere, will be endowed with competency 
and numerous armies, will be held in much esteem by all classes of 
people. He will be interested in charitable undertakings and institutions 
and will have Raja yoga. If the Lord of 1 0* house is weak, the results 
will be poor and the Native will have poor gains in his occupation or 
business and will get a poor promotion in his appointment. 

If the planet concerned (i.e. lord of the tenth bhava-Dasamathipathi) 
is Mars, the Native will get wealth through taxes or assessments etc. 
and lands. 

If it is Jupiter, the Native will rise in official cadre. 

If it is Venus, he will have conveyances and ornaments. 

If it is Mercury, he will be successful in his study and examinations, 
and 

thus, the results should be divined with much thought and consideration. 
These results would be spoiled if there is a malefic combination with 
the Lord of 1 th house or if he is in the eighth etc. amsa. 

2) If the lord of the tenth bhava is in the twelfth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the twelfth bhava (i.e. lord of the twelfth bhava- 
Vayathipathi) and has also a malefic yoga, the Native will have disgrace 
and ignominy or will be removed from service or occupation or will be 
reduced in official cadre or will have a set-back in his business or 
occupation etc. 

If there is a benefic yoga, the Native will be employed in connection 
with chanting of Vedas and religious rites. If there is a malefic yoga, 
he will follow the occupation of a Menial. If the Lord of 10* house is a 
malefic planet, the Native will wander to a great distance unprofitable 

3) If the lord of the tenth bhava is in the Ascendarrt-bhava in combination 
with the lord of the Ascendant and'has a benefic yoga, the Native will 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 129 

have much fame and name, will be the embodiment of kingly power 
and influence, will certainly become an illustrious minister of a king or 
a very great official and will be interested in charitable and noble 
pursuits. 

If the Lord of 10* house is weak, the results will be poor and if he is 
posited in the eighth etc. amsa, even these poor results will not happen 
(i.e. will be reduced to nothing). If there is a malefic yoga, the results 
will be spoiled; sometimes the Native will be put to disgrace; he will 
sometimes receive gifts offered in bad or inauspicious ceremonies; if 
the planet in the said malefic yoga is Saturn and if he is powerful, the 
gift will be a buffalo; if the planet concerned is the Sun, the gift will be 
a cat; if it is Mars, the gift will be a sheep etc. and if there is a benefic 
yoga, by the association of a benefic planet the gift must be considered 
to be in the shape of a desirable thing. 

4) If the lord of the tenth bhava is posited in the second bhava in 
combination with the lord of the second bhava and has a benefic yoga 
there will be acquisition of wealth to the Native, he will be known to 
the public as a rich man, will be the chief and influential member of his 
family and his word will be honoured and respected. If there is a Raja- 
yoga, the Native will get wealth through the Government or by means 
of an appointment; his servants will be ever ready and vigilant to carry 
out his commands or orders; he will protect many people and he will 
feed many persons. If the Lord of 10* house is posited in the eighth 
etc. amsa and is weak, the results mentioned before will be on a 
moderate scale. If there is a combination of malefic, the results will be 
bad, his family members will have troubles, he will be afflicted with 
penury, disrepute, and untimely meals and will achieve notoriety for 
uttering falsehood. The astrologer should remember the qualities and 
significations of the planets and include them while reading events 
that which happen in the period and sub-periods of the planets. 

5) If the lord of the tenth bhava is posited in the third bhava in combination 
with the lord of the third bhava and benefic, the Native will achieve 
fame for his deeds, he will rise in his occupation or post will become 
famous for his artistic talents, or bravery and his brother will be 
renowned. The strength of the karaka planet should be determined 
and included in the results also. If the Lord of 1 0* house is weak, the 
results will be poor and results will be the-same (i.e. poor), when the 
Lord of 10* house is posited in the eighth etc. amsa. 

6) If the lord of the tenth bhava is posited in the fourth bhava, the Native 
will live with happiness and glory by his lands, which will yield a good 
produce. If there is a benefic yoga, he will acquire much reputation 



130 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

through agriculture; will become famous as one bom of a good family 
and his mother would come from a remarkable family. 

Thus, the effects must be inferred intelligently. If there is a malefic 
yoga, it will produce harm and misfortune. If there is a mixture of 
benefic and malefic yogas, the results will be of a mixed nature. If the 
Lord of 10* house is weak the effects will be poor. 

7) If the lord of the tenth bhava is posited in the fifth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the fifth bhava and has a benefic yoga, the Native will 
be blessed with a kingdom or minister-ship in the period of the Lord of 
1 0* house. He will achieve his aspirations and will become a famous 
and wealthy person. If these planets are posited in Rasis which are 
friendly to each other, the effects described already will mostly occur. 
If these planets are inimical to each other or in the eighth place (i.e. in 
amsa chakra) from each other, the effects will be poor. Everything 
should be well considered and then predicted. 

8) If the lord of the tenth bhava is posited in the sixth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the sixth bhava, the Native will become the head of a 
court of law. He will be employed there for some time or his maternal 
uncle will be famous and influential. The Native may be employed in 
army or may follow medical profession. These results may happen if 
these planets are strong. If there is a malefic yoga, the Native may 
pursue a mean occupation and may sometimes be an official provided 
with Government official seal or be may sometimes be employed in an 
embassy and he will sometimes be fed in a Menials house. The 
occupation that he will follow will be according to the nature of the 
planets concerned. He will suffer loss in trade or he will be engaged in 
performing Sradhas-POOJA for departed souls, in which case it may 
happen sometimes on account of Saturn. The results must be 
determined in the period with reference to benefic or malefic yoga. 

9) If the lord of the tenth bhava is posited in the seventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the seventh bhava, the Native's wife will 
be one born in a good family, he will sometimes become renowned in 
a foreign land or will sometimes earn his livelihood in a foreign place. 
He may sometimes earn his living through his wife, he will be sometimes 
interested in pilgrimages or he will be sometimes employed in a transport 
department. If there is a malefic yoga, he will eke out his livelihood 
with much difficulty in a foreign place, mostly will eat in funeral 
ceremonies, and he will be poor, will marry in an ignoble and low 
family, or his Wife will become separated from him. The results must 
be predicted in accordance with the nature of the planets concerned in 
a period or sub-period. 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 131 

10) If the lord of the tenth bhava is posited in the eighth bhava, in 
combination with the lord of the eighth bhava, the Native will be always 
interested in wicked and vicious deeds, his occupation will be 
endangered or lost, but will not be lost, if there is a benefic yoga. His 
agriculture will be interrupted or spoiled, his lands will be damaged, 
his education will be interrupted and his conveyances or vehicles will 
be ruined, if there is a benefic yoga, these effects will be on a moderate 
scale and if there is a malefic yoga, the effects will be poor. - 

11) If the lord of the tenth bhava is posited in the ninth bhava in combination 
with the lord of the ninth bhava and if Jupiter is weak, the Native's 
daily duties and rites will be interrupted. If Jupiter is strong, the Native 
will certainly do good deeds, will be a rich person in his own country, 
will be famous, will be loved and honoured by his emperor and will be 
happy through his appointment and his father will be an illustrious 
person. 

If Mars is powerful, his father will have enormous lands free from 
tax. 

If Jupiter is powerful, his father will rise in his appointment. 

If Venus is powerful, the Native will have jewels and conveyances. 

If Mercury is powerful, the Native will be blessed with advantages 
through his education or learning. 

If the Moon is powerful, the Native will be a treasurer or a cultivator 
of fields or gardens. 

If the Sun is powerful, the Native will be a Government servant or 
a physician. 

If Saturn is powerful, the Native will be a government servant. 

These results should be predicted according to the strength of the 
planets. 

12) One should weigh the strength of the planets skilfully and venture his 
prediction. Good results will happen when there is a benefic yoga. If 
there is a malefic yoga, the results will be bad and the native will 
follow mean and low profession, will approach mean and low class 
people and will be put to shame. If the Lord of 10* house is strong 
and if the lord of the rasi occupied by the lord of the tenth bhava is 
also strong, the results will be good and auspicious; if otherwise, the 
results will be contrary. 

Thus, the results of the periods should be derived with reference to 
the strength of the planets.

in the period of the Lord of 1 2* house; and he will have expenditure in 
the period of the benefic planet that is in combination with the Lord of

powerful, the Native's income will be more than his expenditure; the 
comforts of bed linen will be in proportion to the degree of the yoga. 
The Native will be happy, will always pursue a good and virtuous 
profession, will be engaged in metaphysical and Vedanta investigations 
and will be in the company of yogis and Sadhus. If the Lagna-Lord is

3) If the lord of the twelfth bhava is posited in the third bhava in 
combination with the lord of the third bhava, the Native will always 
have an ever-increasing expenditure and his brothers will be ruined. If 
there is a benefic yoga, the effect will be of a mixed nature and if the 
Lord of twelfth bhava in a benefic yoga and is in association with the 
lords of the sixth and eighth bhavas, his Period will produce comforts 
and conveniences of vehicles or conveyances.

amsa, the results will be poor and if the planets are malefic, even then 
the results will be poor.

will be of a mixed nature; if there is a malefic yoga, there will be no 
child born to the Native or his children will be ruined or he will sometimes 
have bad or undesirable children, will sometimes incur the displeasure 
of a entrepreneur, his father will have difficulties or sometimes the 
Native will have fear of trouble due to political disturbances and his 
occupation may be spoiled. 

6) If the lord of the twelfth bhava is posited in the sixth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the sixth bhava, the Period of the Lord of 
twelfth bhava will be responsible for good and auspicious ceremonies 
or occurrences; these results will be augmented if there is a combination 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 137 

with lord of eighth bhava also and the results will be the same for a 
benefic yoga or even when the Lord of twelfth bhava is posited in the 
eighth etc. amsa. 

7) If the lord of the twelfth bhava is posited in the seventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the seventh bhava, there is danger to the 
Natives wife; if there is a yoga producing death, his wife will die and 
he will sometimes live in a foreign place. If there is a benefic yoga, 
there will be acquisition of money and if there is a malefic yoga, the 
Native will always have sorrow, uneasiness, unprofitable wanderings, 
sickness and insult his wife. 

8) If the lord of the twelfth bhava is posited in the eighth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the eighth bhava, the Native will have 
pleasure and pain in equal degrees. If there is a benefic yoga, there 
will be happiness, if there is yoga by the combination of the Lord of 
sixth house, the Period will produce more good and the results of the 
Period will be modified according to the nature of the planet in 
combination with the lord of the twelfth bhava. 

9) If the lord of the twelfth bhava is posited in the ninth bhava, the 
Native's occupation will be spoiled; if then the lord of the twelfth bhava 
is in combination with the lord of the ninth bhava, the results will be 
moderate, the Native will be interested in good deeds and thereby will 
incur some expenditure and his appointment will be endangered. If 
there is a benefic yoga the results will be of a mixed nature. The 
effects of a particular planet, will be produced when it's Period or sub- 
Period runs. 

10) If the lord of the twelfth bhava is posited in the tenth bhava in 
combination with the lord of the tenth bhava, the Native's patrimony 
will be ruined and there will sometimes be expenditure through charity; 
if there is a benefic yoga, the expenditure will be on account of 
enjoyment and in virtuous ways, such as gifting and construction of 
watch towers. 

11) If the lord of the twelfth bhava is posited in the eleventh bhava in 
combination with the lord of the eleventh bhava there is danger or 
interruption to gains; if the planet is benefic, the expenditure will be in 
good ways; and if there is a malefic yoga, the expenditure will be 
caused by bad deeds and enemies. The loss of wealth will be caused 
in ways, which are in accordance with the nature of the planet 
concerned; the wealth will at times get reduced on account of 
misunderstandings with elder brother or business or on account of the 
yoga for poverty and sometimes the gain and loss will be equal. Thus, 
the effects of a Period should be predicted, taking into account the 



138 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Syste 

nature of the lord of the Period, the nature, of karaka and Lordship 
signification of the planets in association with the lord of the Period. 
The effects of the Period should also be predicted with reference to 
the Kanaka and Lordship signification ofthe lord of the sign, occupied 
by the lord ofthe Period. 

12) As regards the other positions also (i.e. the positions in the other 
bhavas, than the eleventh bhava) the effects should be determined 
with reference to the position of the lord of the rasi containing the 
bhava in question. If the lord of the twelfth bhava is posited in a bhava 
and is a benefic (i.e. by Lordship) he will produce good results; if he is 
a benefic and also a malefic (i.e. by Lordship) he will produce mixed 
results; if he is a double malefic (i.e. by Lordship of two bad bhavas), 
the results will be bad. A planet, whether a benefic or a malefic, will 
produce good results if he is the lord of Angles and Trine houses at the 
same time; if he is the lord of a Kendra house only, be will produce 
. moderate results. The lords ofthe second, third and eleventh bhavas 
are producers of good and bad effects; the lords ofthe sixth, eighth 
and twelfth bhavas are malefic. If out of the two bhavas of a planet, 
one is good and the other is bad, the results will be of mixed nature. 
Thus the nature of a planet, whether benefic or malefic, should be 
determined with reference to the bhava Lordship and also with reference 
to the eight kinds of planetary strength described earlier. Thus, the 
nature of benefic yoga, malefic yoga and mixed yoga, should be 
determined. 

A malefic yoga is useless and it will cause always expenditure, debt 
and entanglement in vices and wicked ways; a Mixed yoga will produce 
mixed results according to the nature ofthe planets. 

The effects of Rahu and Ketu 

1) Rahu and Ketu are always the enemies of the Sun and the Moon and 
are always moving, eagerly expecting opportunities to swallow the 
Sun and the Moon. The Sun and the Moon become weak when eclipsed 
at the places of Rahu and Ketu, Rahu and Ketu become weak when in 
combination with the Sun and the Moon. Rahu and Ketu give their 
results in their Periods and sub-Periods according to the nature ofthe 
planets, that are in combination with them or that aspect them and 
according to the strength ofthe planets in whose Rasi or Navamsa, 
they are posited. 

If they are associated with benefic planets they yield benefic results, if 
they are in association with malefic they produce bad results. They 
have no effects of their own. As they are the enemies ofthe Sun and 
the Moon, who are the only luminaries out ofthe planets (i.e. they 



Chapter 02: Vimsoltari Dasa System of Predictions ' 139 

have no intrinsic or independent effects and their effects are borrowed 
or usurped from the planets that are in association with them or that 
are the lords of the Rasis occupied by them in Rasi and Navamsa 
charts). Learned should infer their effects according to the nature of 
the lords of the Rasis occupied by them. They will produce good or 
bad results according to the rasi occupied by them whether it is benefic 
or malefic of these two. Rahu will produce bad effects when it is in 
Kendra and Trikona positions; when in the second bhava, it will use 
expenditure and trouble to members of the family; when in the fourth 
bhava, it will cause diseases and disgrace to mother; when in the fifth 
bhava, it will cause danger to children; when in the sixth bhava, it will 
cause fear through enemies etc. and troubles or dangers from thieves, 
snakes and wind; when in the seventh bhava, it will produce danger to 
wife and cause theft while in a foreign place; when in the eighth bhava, 
it will produce a serious sickness or unnatural death, or sufferings; 
when in the ninth bhava, it will cause troubles to father and 
ungratefulness to preceptor etc; when in the tenth bhava, it will cause 
the Native to follow undesirable occupation and when auspicious in 
the tenth bhava, it will give him a sacred bath in the Ganges etc; when 
in the eleventh bhava, it will cause a set-back to gains and when in the 
twelfth bhava, itwill cause all sorts of expenditure. Only a summery of 
effects has been described here. These also are the results of Ketu 
and Ketu effects will be the effects of the lord of the rasi occupied by 
him. 

The above mentioned are a few of the Effects of the various Major 
periods when the lords of houses operate in them. Many modifications 
with respect to individual horoscopes will have to be made before 
actual events are determined. It is necessary to know when exactly 
during the Major period some of these Effects will be realised. 

All planets except the Sun and Moon own two signs in the zodiac. 
Therefore, there will be two houses owned by a planet in a horoscope. 
As such, they should produce the Effects of affairs indicated by two 
houses. Does the planet operate the results simultaneously? Unless 
we know the answer to this question, we shall not be able to make 
correct predictions. Therefore let us examine the sequence of operation 
of house Effects. 

Sequence of Operation of Effects 

1. During the periods of a planet's operation, the first half shall produce 
Effects pertaining to the house it owns which comes first when counted 
from Lagna. The second half of the Major period shall produce results 
signified by the house that comes second. 



140 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

Let us illustrate it by an example. Suppose in a horoscope, Jupiter is 
the lord of 2 nd and ll^houses. During his Major period, he shall produce 
Effects pertaining to the 2 nd house during the first half. 
During the second half, he shall produce results pertaining to the 1 1 th 
house. 

2. Planets which own two houses do not produce equal amount of results 
pertaining to both the houses they own. The results pertaining to the 
houses which happen to be their Moolatrikona signs shall be more 
predominant than the other. The Moolatrikona signs of planets are 
Sun-Leo; Moon-Taurus; Mars-Aries; Mercury-Virgo; Jupiter-Sagittarius; 
Venus-Libra; Saturn-Aquarius; Rahu-Cancer; Ketu-Gemini and 
Sagittarius. 

Modifications of Effects 

The Effects produced during the periods of planets, are general in 
nature, extend of the good, and bad should be determined after careful 
consideration ofthe following rules. 

A plant benefic by its occupation in a house shall do maximum good 
effects if the house happens to be its exaltation sign or own sign. If that be 
a friendly sign, the Effects shall be felt only to moderate intensity. 

If it be a neutral sign, the effects shall be only neutral and shall not be 
much realised. If it be an inimical or depression sign of the planet, the 
good effects shall not be felt at all. 

If the planet be malefic in nature due to occupation in the house, if 
that house happens to be its exaltation or own sign, the results shall be 
almost neutral and shall not be felt. If it happens to be a neutral sign, the 
evil results shall be felt to some extent. If it happens to be an inimical or 
depression sign, the evil results shall be felt with maximum intensity. 

In considering the degree of benefic or malefic results of planets 
according to their position due care should be taken to see whether the 
planet is a benefic, neutral or a malefic towards the native due to ownership. 
A combined study of all these should be made and the results should be 
modified accordingly. 

How the Effects Are Realised 

The following rules may be applied in timing the events.- 

AS to when the results of planetary periods due to their natural 
governance over certain affairs, or due to their ownership of certain houses 
and lastly due to their position in certain houses ofthe horoscope are to be 
realised, so that correct inference may be drawn. 



Chapter 02; Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 141 

1 . Planets in their Main periods, sub-periods and inter-periods produce 
benefic or malefic results pertaining to their natural affairs, according 
as they are benefic or malefic towards the native. 

2. They produce results pertaining to their ownership of houses in the 
horoscope during their Main periods only, 

3. They produce results due to their occupation and aspect towards certain 
houses during the course of their sub-periods only. 

4. They produce results pertaining to the house they occupy reckoned 
from the sub-lord during their sub-sub-periods.

Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 151 



IF THE SUN BE IN CANCER AT BIRTH 

The Sun Period will be marked by jealousy and possibly some enmity 
on the part of people whom he considers to be his friends. This will be 
caused by his promotion to a position of authority and responsibility, possibly 
over the heads of friends and associates or in competition with them. He is 
apt during this period, to become somewhat more nervous and excitable 
than usual and should strive to overcome this tendency and to remain calm 
in all situations. If a man, he will have much contact with women at this 
time, at home, in a social way and in business. If a woman, she may marry 
during this period or have an affair. 

IF THE SUN BE IN LEO AT BIRTH 

This is a period of desire for quiet and solitude. An urge to live in the 
country rather than in the city, will be manifest, a longing for remote places. 
If the individual purchases a farm or takes up farming as a means of livelihood 
or as a business during the Sun Period, he will be very successful in this 
pursuit.

The Sun period will be one of contentment and happiness, especially 
in domestic life. The individual will enjoy his home and its surroundings. He 
will make contact with neighbours and friends, and particularly with older

restricted, possibly enforced idleness will be encountered. Loss of position 
and money is likely. He may even experience poverty and lack of proper 
food and the necessities of life. Added to these physical restrictions, his 
mind is anxious and worried and he is most unhappy and miserable, 
particularly as he is almost wholly dependent on others during these years. 

IF THE SUN BE IN AQUARIUS AT BIRTH 

A time of quarrels and disputes, litigation and argument during which, 
unless helped by other conditions, the individual will seldom be victorious. 
His enemies will take this opportunity to embarrass him and it would be 
better if any issues at stake could be postponed rather than joined. Even in 
his domestic relationships there will be disagreements and 
misunderstandings, some-times actual opposition and antagonism. As if 
these conditions were not sufficient, he also will suffer from some heat 
complaint which will be aggravated by outbursts of temper and the general 
tension of mind and body produced by the continual bickering which marks 
this period. 

IF THE SUN BE IN PISCES AT BIRTH 

The health will be the chief concern of this individual during the Sun 
period of his life. He will suffer from a general rundown condition due to 
principally to gastric disorders. These may become as acute as to require a 
stomach operation or treatment for ulcers. Diet and health should be watched 
carefully before this period starts and some effort made several years

According to the Moon sign occupied at birth, the following conditions 
and problems will confront the individual at that time of his life, which 
corresponds with the Main Period of the Moon. 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 159 



IFTHE MOON BE IN ARIES AT BIRTH 

A period of journeys and travels, long and short, Visits to foreign 
countries or many trips within the confines of own country. Also a period of 
thought along religious paths, with contacts with people connected with 
some religious movement or activity. 

IFTHE MOON BE IN TAURUS AT BIRTH 

A fortunate period all around, one in which the individual should be 
active and push forward, since enterprises started or completed during this 
period will be generally successful. By making the most of opportunities 
and contacts during this period, the individual could rise in whatever station 
of life he may be situated, and should reach a position of authority and 
responsibility. The purchases of automobiles or other vehicles of 
transportation are likely to be made during this period. 

IFTHE MOON BE IN GEMINI AT BIRTH 

This is a period for making best use of his social contacts, communication 
skills, and exchange of ideas. If sufficiently educated, the person may write 
articles, books, or give lectures. He may come in contact with publishers or 
writers or be instrumental in signing contracts. Generally, this period will 
be marked by literary and educational activities. 

IFTHE MOON BE IN CANCER AT BIRTH 

If the Moon is in Cancer at birth, the main period of the Moon will be 
marked by a tendency toward domesticity. The individual will live in a place 
which is either very rocky or is surrounded by mountains, or high ground 
and trees. He will have domestic animals around him according to his means 
and he will spend more money on animals than he will at any other time in 
his life. There is some danger during this period of contracting a secret 
disease and every care should be taken to avoid contagion. 

IFTHE MOON BE IN LEO AT BIRTH 

Not a good period for the health of the individual. Sickness is likely to 
be a serious handicap to general welfare and must be avoided by extra 
care and precaution if possible, since otherwise this period presents 
opportunities for progress, especially financially, Business affairs will prosper 
and promotion in position, increase in trade, or success in a professional 
career will be found to come easily and with little effort. The individual will 
receive the respect and admiration of his associates. 



160 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 



IF THE MOON BE IN VIRGO AT BIRTH 

If the individual is not yet married, he is very likely to marry during this 
period. If he is already married, he will be unfaithful to his marriage partner, 
and be in serious danger of separation from her. His spirits are high during 
this period, and he chafes at the bonds of domesticity. He will be rather 
fortunate at this period if his affairs take him to foreign countries, but 
although he will make money, he is likely not to save it. 

IF THE MOON BE IN LIBRA AT BIRTH 

He lives in hopes during this period, seeming not to be able to complete 
anything, or to be continually frustrated in everything he undertakes. 
Association with the opposite sex may take on the colour of intrigue and 
unless he is particularly cautious will lead to open scandal. He is liable to 
find himself the victim of some racket, which uses a woman as a decoy, 
and may have to pay blackmail in the form of coin or services which are 
unworthy. Keep to the straight and narrow path is the best advice to those 
living in this period. 

IF THE MOON BE IN SCORPIO AT BIRTH 

A particularly unfortunate period, during which the cards seem, stacked 
against the person with Moon in Scorpio at birth. He will be far from happy 
during this period. He will be discontented, continually worried over finances, 
and may become very bitter and disgruntled with the world and the people 
in it. He will become estranged from his relatives and may be separated 
entirely from his family. He may experience poverty at certain times during 
this period. Unless he is particularly careful of his diet for some years prior 
to the beginning of this period, afunctional disorder of the stomach may 
assert itself at this time, and it may become so aggravated that an operation 
will be found necessary. 

IF THE MOON BE IN SAGITTARIUS AT BIRTH 

During this period the individual must not expect to benefit from the 
voluntary deeds of others. His friends will not help him financially, not 
because they do not wish to, but rather because they are unable to do so. 
Expected legacies or bequests from family or relatives will not materialize, 
in fact may be lost entirely. Moreover, this is a period of vitality and through 
his determined efforts the individual can and usually will attract for setf the 
good things of life. If he makes a concerted effort, his finances will be 
considerably improved. 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 161 



IF THE MOON BE IN CAPRICORN AT BIRTH 

A period of growth and productivity, with an overall improvement in all 
walks of life. If up to this time the individual has no children, he will have 
an addition to the family of one or more children, either of his own or 
through adoption. He will add to his wealth. He will purchase real estate 
and generally accumulate possessions, become a man of substance in 
relation to his community and environment. 

IFTHE MOON BE IN AQUARIUS AT BIRTH 

This is a period of reckless expenditure. The individual is prone to 
spend much more than he earns and will have great difficulty in paying his 
debts. A close curb should be kept on these tendencies and a person entering 
this period should carefully budget his expenses and live within his income. 
The urge towards hard reckless living and towards dissipation of his 
resources, not only his money but his health as well, is strong and can only 
be held in check by an application of will power. 

IFTHE MOON BE IN PISCES AT BIRTH 

From a health standpoint, this period may be almost tragic. The 
individual will be a source of worry and anxiety to his family at that time. 
Many individuals with Moon in Pisces at birth, during the Moon period, 
contract spinal meningitis or infantile paralysis, and unless great care is 
taken, there is difficulty in recovering. The chances of contracting this disease 
and of recovery from it, will depend in large measure, on the aspects which 
other planets make to the Moon. They may either aggravate or modify 
what seems to be inherent in the conditions which confront the individual 
during this period. 

Note: The conditions given for each of the planetary main periods are 
general conditions, prevalent throughout the duration of the period, but 
that since each period is divided into sub-periods or Sub-period dasa, there 
will be an ebb and flow to these conditions or a direct contradiction with 
tfiem for certain shorter intervals during the main period. 

These modifications or contradictions will depend for their quality and 
intensity upon the relationship which exists in the birth chart, between the 
Planet whose main period is under consideration and the Planet which 
affects the sub-period. 

E.g. for instance, Moon and Mars were in bad aspect (say 6* or 8* 
aspect) at birth, the Moon being afflicted by Mars, then even though on the 
whole the Main Period of the Moon was a fortunate one, yet for the duration 
of the Mars sub-period (which is seven months out of the 10 years of the 
Moon period in the Vimsottari divisions, there would be present some very 



162 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

adverse conditions, which might seem to contradict or at least seriously 
modify the fortunate influences of the Main Period. The reverse would of 
course, be true if the sub-period under consideration were that of a Planet 
in good aspect to the Planet of the Main Period.

depending in which partofthe Mars Period the accident occurs, In business 
he will be very successful. He will be aggressive and dominating and because 
of his efforts and industry he should rise during this period to a position of 
responsibility and authority. 



168 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 



IF MARS BE IN TAURUS AT BIRTH 

The individual seems to undergo a sort of reformation. He may not 
have been a bad character up to this time, but yet his religious instincts 
and feelings seem to undergo a stimulation during these years. His life 
begins to be coloured by religious thoughts and concepts and he becomes 
actively engaged in some religious activity. This may or may not be orthodox 
in the strict sense of the word but at least it will conform with the pattern 
of many of those around him. 

IF MARS BE IN GEMINI AT BIRTH 

The Mars period will be a very active one, crowded with change and a 
variety of events, There will be many short trips and journeys by land. 
There will be on the part of the individual an avid longing to see new 
things, to acquire knowledge of current events. He will study and his mind 
will be very actively engaged on many subjects. He will develop the artistic 
side of his nature. He will be extravagant with money and will spend all he 
earns and more. During this period, there will be some disagreement with 
his family, particularly his father, and they, may quarrel and separate for a 
time. 

IF MARS BE IN CANCER AT BIRTH 

If any inharmonious conditions formerly existed in the home and 
domestic life of the individual, they will come to a crisis during this period 
of his life. If none existed previously, then this period will be marked by 
disturbances in his home, quarrels with his wife, and family, leading 
eventually to separation from them. Probably as a sort of an antidote or 
relief from these domestic troubles, he becomes interested in flower, gardens, 
or orchards, and is likely to be found pruning his trees, while his wife is 
scolding inside. 

IF MARS BE IN LEO AT BIRTH 

Also a period of separation from the family and children not so much 
as a result of disputes or quarrels but rather from the fact that during this 
period the individual is busy with all sorts of outside interest. He may go in 
for politics, but at any rate will be found leading or organizing some 
community or civic organization which makes many demands on his time 
and effort. He will be more or less a public figure within his own community. 
He should be careful at this time of falls, as the results of a bad fall are apt 
to be serious. Also, he will be more than ordinarily susceptible to accident 
as the result of fire. 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 169 



IF MARS BE IN VIRGO AT BIRTH 

A time for thought and study for the native. The individual during this 
period takes stock of self, subjects himself more than usual to rigid self- 
analysis. He checks up on his habits and behaviour and while not- being 
sanctimonious or prudish, he is meticulous in his actions and is prone to 
think carefully before embarking on any course of action. He will study 
philosophy and comparative religion and order his life accordingly. He is 
apt to be a cranky on food, will enjoy cooking himself, and will develop the 
taste of an epicure, being at the same time extremely careful not to over- 
indulge. He will be interested in and may observe carefully the effect of 
diet on the mental states. 

IF MARS BE IN LIBRA AT BIRTH 

If, up to this time, the individual has remained a bachelor, he will be 
almost sure to marry during this period, unless other indications in the 
chart are against his doing so. At any rate, he will think a lot of being 
married and will become engaged or may have an affair. If he is unemployed 
and seeking a position, now is the time to leave no stone unturned because 
he will have less trouble during this period. In fact, many offers may come 
to him atthistime. He must, however, take care of his health during this 
period, as his resistance to disease will be much lower than usual. 

IF MARS BE IN SCORPIO AT BIRTH 

The purchase of land, particularly farm land, will be the most important 
feature of this period. If the individual takes up farming atthistime, he will 
be most successful, not only supporting himself from the produce, but also 
becoming well known by reason of the excellence of his farm products. As 
a business it will thrive and bring eventual independence, 

IF MARS BE IN SAGITTARIUS AT BIRTH 

Not a good period for lawsuits, litigations or disputes of any kind, but 
the individual is likely to be faced with these conditions nevertheless. He 
will be involved particularly with family affair and his relatives will be against 
him. He will live in a large family and there will be very little in his life at this 
time which does not bring family matters to the forefront. 

IF MARS BE IN CAPRICORN AT BIRTH 

The Mars period will be a most fortunate one. All matters will prosper. 
A most opportune period in which to embark on new enterprises, change 
positions, apply for promotion. If there is any litigation, this is the time to 
press for a decision. Law suits will be successfully conducted, disputes will 
be amicably settled and profitably. An overall very happy and fortunate 
period. 



1 70 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systei 

IF MARS BE IN AQUARIUS AT BIRTH 

A period during which the individual seems to be extravagantly reckless 
in everything he does. His extravagances quickly get him into debt and he 
seems to lose all sense of responsibility. He will borrow money, knowing, it 
is quite impossible for him to return it, and indeed with no intention quite 
often of ever repaying it. His domestic life is very unsettled and happy in 
consequence, and throughout this period his actions are careless and 
thoughtless. 

IF MARS BE IN PISCES AT BIRTH 

High living and extravagance mark this period. The individual will indulge 
to excess in all the good things of life. Desire for children, which seems to 
be paramount, will be thwarted through the disability of the marriage partner 
or of the individual himself. Disappointment in this regard may be the 
underlying cause of his indulgence. There will be much travel in foreign 
countries, The result of over-indulgence in things to eat and drink is chronic 
skin affections such as hives, acne, pimples, eczema.

particularly as applied to land and property. Legal disputes regarding such 
matters should be taken up during this period as they will be successful 
and profitable. 

IF SATURN BE in GEMINI AT BIRTH 

Not a good position for Saturn. The period will be marked by a tendency 
on the part of the individual to associate with shady and irresponsible 
characters. He may even stoop to theft or at least the procuring of money 
dishonestly. If ordinarily the correspondences with other planets in his chart 
are conducive to good traits of character, during this period he may become 
a habitual of stealing. His romantic nature may lead him into shady and 
undesirable associations with the opposite sex and if the other planets in 
his chart seem to strengthen the testimony, he may even be involved as a 
tout or profit from the business of prostitution.

A period of happiness and contentment especially in domestic and 
home life. The individual will be surrounded by friends whom he likes and 
who are fond of him and will be of assistance to him. He must be more 
than ordinarily careful of his health during this period however, and 
particularly he must guard against undue eye-strain, since he will have 
trouble with his eyes, his right eye especially.

THE MAIN PERIOD OF MERCURY AND ITS SUB- 
PERIODS 

Duration of Period- Vimsottari - 17years 

The conditions surrounding the individual during the Mercury Period 
of his life will vary according to the Sign in which Mercury is placed in his 
birth chart as follows:- 

IF MERCURY BE IN ARIES AT BIRTH 

A unsettled and irresponsible period. There will be many changes of 
residence and of work. The individual, if an employee, will change his 
position often; if he has his own business, he will change from one type of 
business to another. It is a period of speculation and gambling. Everything 
is a gamble at this. His losses, however, will more than offset his gains. At 



/ 92 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Syster 

times he will need money so badly that he will be tempted to steal it. He is 
obliged to resort to lying and deceit in order to live. 

IF MERCURY BE IN TAURUS AT BIRTH 

The period will be of unrestrained behaviour and extravagance. The 
individual, on account of his utter lack of ideas regarding the value of 
money, will become a source of worry and anxiety to his family and friends. 
His parents will help him financially from time to time, but he will waste the 
money they give him on all sorts of foolish enterprises. His wife and children 
will suffer privation because of his recklessness. 

IF MERCURY BE IN GEMINI AT BIRTH 

The Mercury period will be on the whole a very happy one. The only 
incident of any importance during this period will be caused by a 
misunderstanding between the individual and his mother. This 
misunderstanding may develop into a dispute over money matters. If 
married, his domestic life will be pleasant and happy during this period. He 
will read a lot and take many short trips. 

IF MERCURY BE IN CANCER AT BIRTH 

The chief feature of this period will be a change of residence to foreign 
countries. The entire period will be spent away from the land of birth. Not 
just a question of travel, but rather of domicile. The native is quite likely to 
earn his living during this period by writing, more particularly the writing of 
poetry or of poetical or fanciful prose. His viewpoint on world affairs will be 
broadened and his attitude towards his fellow men will be humanitarian 
and universal. 

IF MERCURY BE IN LEO AT BIRTH 

Naturally the native with this position of Mercury will be courageous 
and will possess outstanding ability. This ability and courage will be called 
into play during this period and he will surmount great obstacles and rise 
to a position of power and influence. He will become widely known and 
respected in public Jife. However, his domestic life will be anything but 
happy and will not afford him a particularly pleasant background for his 
public activities. 

IF MERCURY BE IN VIRGO AT BIRTH 

This period will be one of aesthetic and cultural development. The 
individual will have a wide circle of artistic acquaintances, and will himself 
probably earn his living by artistic pursuits or writing. His cultural attainments 
will increase at this time to such an extent that, within the limitations of his 
chart and in proportion to the testimonies of other planets, he idealy becomes 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 193 

known as an author or poet. It is a good period and even his enemies will 
grudgingly grant him his due. 

IF MERCURY BE IN LIBRA AT BIRTH 

This will not be a good period on the whole. The health will be poor 
and there will be a tendency to lose weight. The individual may embark on 
some sort of designing carrer either in textiles, decorating or architecture, 
being drawn to these, however, because of lack of definite purpose or 
vision of his life's work rather than from any marked aptitude, and as a 
result he will be unsuccessful. 

IF MERCURY BE IN SCORPIO AT BIRTH 

A marked natural tendency towards extravagance becomes apparently 
uncontrollable during the Mercury period. Reckless, foolish and selfish 
expenditures succeed eventually in estranging the individual from his family 
and relatives. 

IF MERCURY BE IN SAGITTARIUS AT BIRTH 

A period of extravagance and loss of money. The individual seems to 
find it impossible to accumulate. He spends as fast as he earns. Investments 
turn out poorly. Speculations are disastrous. He will live alone, away from 
his family and relatives. Not a good period. 

IF MERCURY BE IN CAPRICORN AT BIRTH 

Continuous travel and many short journeys mark this period. One trip 
after another is taken, chiefly by land. During this period the native comes 
in contact with people who are his inferiors. He cultivates the society of 
those with whom he is aware of his own superiority. He succumbs to flattery. 
In company with these associates, he schemes against his employers and 
those who are in authority over him. He spends money foolishly in an 
endeavour to show off to those who flatter him. 

IF MERCURY BE IN AQUARIUS AT BIRTH 

Loss of money-loss of position-loss of belongings-changes of residence- 
in all a period of retrogression, a period of decadence. He will seek help 
from his friends who will deceive and mislead him. He will sufferfrom the 
treachery of those who seem to be closest to him. An overall unhappy 
period. 

IF MERCURY BE IN PISCES AT BIRTH 

A period of losses, through illness. The health will be impaired; some 
ailment will become chronic. The individual will take to his bed and his 
illness will be costly. Doctors and hospital bills will take his earnings and his 



194 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Svste 

capital. He may have to remain in an institution for a long period even 
extending into the next period, or permanently, depending on other 
testimony. 



RAHU & KETU DASA 

Effects during Major period of Rahu and Ketu 

Now let us explain the signs etc., of Rahu and Ketu so that the Effects 
of their Period may be ascertained. 

The wise maintain that Rahu occupying Virgo, Pisces or Scorpio in a 
birth chart bestow upon the native, during his Dasa, honour and happiness, 
lordships of lands, vehicles and attendants. All these, however, are liable to 
be taken away at the conclusion of the Dasa. 

During the Rahu Dasa the native takes to wicked means or suffers 
from the terrible ailment beyond diagnose; loses wife and children. There 
is danger of being poisoned and trouble from enemies and suffers from 
diseases of the eyes and head. The native faces opposition from friends 
and cultivators too and acquires displeasure of the kings. 

Rahu period- with reference to their natural governance over 
certain affairs- 

1. If Rahu is strong, benefic and well placed, during his Major period 
there will be accumulation of wealth, gains from business, prosperity 
or promotion in profession, gain of position of command and respect, 
and general happiness. 

2. If Rahu is weak, malefic and badly placed, there will be loss of wealth, 
quarrels and disputes, criminal actions, wanderings, poverty, ill health 
to wife and children or their death, death of elderly members in the 
family, contagious diseases, etc. 

3. The exaltation sign of Rahu is Scorpio and for Ketu it is Taurus and the 
Moolatrikona signs are respectively Sagittarius and Gemini. Own sign 
of Rahu is Aquarius and of Ketu is Scorpio. 

Some have reckoned Virgo and Pisces signs respectively. 

4. If Rahu is exalted in the nativity: - 

Its Period will be extremely favourable and wealth, prosperity etc., is 
attained. Ambitions are accomplished through friends and king 
(Government), possibility of conveyance and son, construction of new 
residence, religious feelings, festivity, Royal recognition in the foreign 
land, decorative items, Jewellery etc., are also achieved. 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 195 

5. If Rahu is also aspected by and in conjunction with the benefic planets, 
posited in Angles, Trines the ll^orthe 3 rd house and with auspicious 
sign- gives property, land etc. and happiness is achieved with the 
blessing of king. Also recognition from the head of the family and 
welfare of house become possible. 

6. If Rahu is posited in the 8* or the 1 2* house-the result of the Period is 

painful. 

7. If Rahu has connection with the malefic planets and is conjunct with 
'Maraka' house- 

The result will be shifting of the native from place to place, mental 
agony, death of wife and son, stale food etc. 

Note: In the beginning of Period, physical stress and loss of wealth 
and agriculture produce, be expected and 

In the middle position of the Period, the native receives comforts and 
also wealth (profits) from the foreign countries. 

In the last portion of the Period, distress, change of place and mental 
stresses and strains will be felt. 

The under mentioned are the effects of major periods of Rahu 
with reference to the various combinations or occupation of signs 
by Rahu :- 

RESULTS OF RAHU MAJOR PERIOD. 

Rahu in exalted in Taurus and Ketu in Scorpio, Rahu has Moolatrikona 
in Cancer, and Aries as his friendly sign. 

The 7* from Rahu is the Moolatrikona and friendly house of Ketu 
respectively. The Major Period of Rahu in the 6 th and 8* produces misery.

and grains. 

Rahu in Debilitation- fear from authority, fires and money bsses 
due to thieves, possibility of imprisonment including gallows, poisoning 
effect from some drug or disease or food item.

Rahu in Cancer, Taurus or Aries will give money, education and 
pleasure and recognition from kings and pleasure from wife, servants and 
happiness to his soul. 

Rahu in Virgo, Pisces and Sagittarius- gives children, wife, lordship 
over the country, human conveyances, and in the end loss of all.

fear from kings, and deception by thieves, venereal complaints, asthma, 
consumption and urinal troubles.

and bad food, ill-mannered wife and worthless children. 

Note: Rahu in the commencement gives sorrow, in the middle, 
reputation and happiness and change of place in the end and loss of Guru, 
parents, etc. 

THE MAIN PERIOD OF RAHU AND ITS SUB-PERIODS 

Duration of Period- Vimshotari-18 years. 

Unlike the periods of the Planets, the importance of the Zodiacal Sign 
in which Rahu is found at birth is overshadowed by the importance of the 
House in which he is placed. 

The House positions of Rahu and of Ketu are far more important than 
the Sign positions, Let us have an outline of the events and conditions 
peculiar to the Rahu and Ketu periods in terms of House as well as Sign 
positions. 

In Hindu Astrology the beginning of each House is a Mid-point of a 
house i.e., hallway between the cusp of the House and the cusp of the 
preceding House as per western method, while the end of each House is a 
point halfway between the cusp of the House and the cusp of the succeeding 
House. This is most important when determining the House positions of 
any planet or the House positions of any significators in the Birth chart, 
such as Rahu and Ketu. 

RAHU IN THE ZODIACAL SIGNS 

The period of Rahu is not a fortunate one, unless in the native's birth 
chart it is extremely well placed. The period is a painful and a troublesome 
one. It is usually accompanied by poverty and disease. The morals become 



Chapter 02: Vimsottari Dasa System of Predictions 197 

loose and this condition may result in actions, which may have serious 
consequences, even to the extent that the native may commit a crime 
during this period, if Rahu be badly placed or aspected. 

Usually the first part of the period is favourable or at least not as 
unfortunate as the latter part, in which many tragic events are likely to 
occur. The native while associating with honourable and respected people, 
who like him and are very well disposed towards him, still becomes entangled 
in all sorts of trouble and his high hopes fall to ruin. Imprisonment, poisoning, 
enforced travel in foreign countries may occur during this period and it is 
very important to note the position of Rahu in the birth chart as to house, 
sign and aspect, particularly its relationship with the Sun and the Moon. 

Rahu, however, is exalted in the sign Taurus and if he be found there, 
all the bad effects will be mitigated to a great extent. 

If Rahu be in Taurus or Cancer in the life chart, then when the native 
is going through Rahu period, conditions will be greatly improved-there will 
be a gain in wealth-opportunities will present themselves through which 
the education will be broadened-there will be some promotion or honour in 
the business or profession -if not married, the native will marry-his servants 
or subordinates will be honest and loyal and the native will enjoy good 
health throughout this period. 

If Rahu be in Pisces, Virgo or Sagittarius in the life chart, that also is 
good during Rahu period providing it is not placed badly as to house or 
badly aspected. If it is favourably placed in house position and well aspected, 
its position in Pisces, Virgo or Sagittarius will give a male child and some 
rise in position-gain through death of brother. 

If, however, Rahu be in Sagittarius or Virgo, badly placed as to house 
or badly aspected, then conditions will be extremely bad. There will be a 
loss of health and family; the occupation will be a dangerous one; there 
will be much deceit and treachery on the part of enemies. The native may 
suffer injury from gangsters or be one himself; he will have to work very 
hard to make an honest living, at times not having enough to eat or having 
to subsist on food of very bad quality, He will of necessity be forced to do 
menial work; his health will be bad and he will suffer from some venereal 
disease, asthma, tuberculosis or disorder of the glands. His marriage partner 
will cause him trouble and he will have wicked children. 

If Rahu is found in the Asterisms Krittika, Uttaror Uttarasadha in the 
birth chart, such position will intensify the bad effects of the Rahu period. 

In the following table is shown the relative general effects of the Signs, 
where Rahu is found:-

some friend or close relative. In spite of this he will always be short of 
money.

favourable results. If the said planet is set or is in its fall, the effect will 
be mixed. 

2. When the Period and sub-period belonging to two planets both of 
which occupy or own the 8 th , the 12 th or the 6 th house are in progress, 
the effect will be inauspicious. 

3. During the Dasa period of an inimical planet and the sub-period of a 
planet ruling the 3 rd , the 5 th or the 7 th asterism counted from the natal 
Nakshatra is in progress or the sub-period of the lord owning the Sign 
occupied by the Moon or the 8 th house there from is passing, the 
native will be troubled by thieves and enemies and pass through much 
distress. 

4. When in the order of main Dasas is:- 

the 4 th Dasa belonging to Saturn, for person born in Mars Dasa 

the 6 th Dasa belonging to Jupiter, for person born in Venus Dasa 

the 5 th Dasa belonging to Mars, for person born in Ketu Dasa 

the 5 th Dasa belonging to Rahu, for person born in Venus Dasa 

the Dasa period of a planet situated in the end of a sign, or - 
owning the Dusthana like the 6 th , 8 th or the 12 th 

every one of these is going to bring misery and prove dangerous. 

5. When Mars occupies an Gemini or Pisces sign or his exaltation sign 
identical with the 10 th or the 11 lh house, his Dasa period will bestow 
upon the native a kingdom. After defeating his enemies, he is sure to 



Chapter 03: Assessing the Effects of Sub-Periods of a Planet 219 

become a famous king possessing a large number of vehicles and a 
large army; and feeding many people. 

6. When Venus, neither set nor conjunct with a malefic, is in his own or 
exaltation sign identical with the 12 th , 10 th orthe ll th house,the native 
during its Dasa period will acquire many gems and precious stones, 
gain intellectual insight, become greatly effluent and be praised by 
many people. 

7. When the benefic are placed in their depression, inimical, the 6 th or 
the 12 th houses, they produce untoward results, whereas malefic placed 
in similar situation give in their Dasa period incalculable miseries. 

8. During the Dasa period of a planet, 

if the sub-period belongs to an unfriendly planet to the Dasa Lord 
(main ruling planet) or 

to a planet occupying the 6 th or the Dusthana or 

to a planet unfriendly to the lord of the Ascendant 

the native should expect danger from his enemies and loss or 
change of position; even the friends should be expected to become 
hostile to him. 

9. Whichever House reckoned from the lord of Major Period is occupied 
by the lord of the sub-period, it is only the result arising from that 
House that will come to pass in that sub-period, and if the lord of the 
sub-period happens to be the 6 th , 8 th or the 12 th from the Main period 
Lord, the result will be most unpleasant, where as the remaining House 
Lords will give favourable effects. 

10. If a planet is exalted then it shows full benefic result. If a planet is in 
its 'Moolatrikona', then it shows three fourth good effects. 

If a planet is in own sign then it shows half benefic results. 

If a planet is in the sign of a friend then its effects is one fourth. 

If a benefic planet is in the sign of an enemy then it will show very 
scanty good effect and 

If a benefic planet is posited in its sign of debilitation then the 
good results will be almost nil. 

If a malefic is debilitated then it will show 100% negative effects. 

If a malefic is in the sign of an enemy then it will show 75% 
malefic effect. 

If a malefic is placed in a friendly house, then gives only half of 
the bad results. If a malefic is in own sign then gives only 25% 
bad effects. 



220 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

If a malefic is in the "Moolatrikona" sign then it will show only one 
eighth negative results and 

If a malefic is exalted then the bad effect will be nil. 

If a planet is combust then it shows the effect as if it is posited in 
its sign of debilitation. 

These proportions are related to benefic or lords of the benefic 
Houses. 

So far as the malefic planets or lords of malefic houses are 
concerned, the result will be just the opposite. When a planet is in 
combustion or within proximity of the Sun, its result will be identical 
with the one in its depression. 

1 1 . When (a) Jupiter, (b) the lord of the house where the Moon is posited 
in and (c) the lord of the Ascendant occupy the 4 th house from the 
Ascendant, the middle portion of the life of the native will be good. 

Those planets which occupy the Prishtodaya Signs give good results in 
the end of life; those in Ubhayodaya signs give good results in the 
middle of life; and those in the Srishodaya Signs, give in the beginning 
of life. 

12. Find out the weakest amongst the planets :- 

1. Saturn, 2. Mandi, 3. Rahu, 4. The lord of the 22 nd Drekkana, 5. The 
lord of the 8 th house, and 6 th house. The lords of the Navamsa signs, 
occupied by these planets. 

It is only the Dasa of that weakest planet, which is going to prove fatal 
and the native will die when Saturn during. his transit passes through a 
Dusthana i.e. the 6 th , 8 th or the 12 th house with respect to it. 

13. Out of the two sets of planets, viz.:- 

1) The lord of the house where in the lord ofthe 8 th is posited, and 

2) The lord ofthe Navamsa occupied by the lord of the 8 th house and 

3) The lords of the 22 nd Drekkana and the Lord of the rising Drekkana, 

Ascertain which planet in each pair is stronger. When the Dasa period 
of this stronger planet is ripening, and when Jupiter is traversing through 
the sign and Navamsa occupied by the lord of the 8 th house or its trine 
position, the death ofthe native may take place. 

14. When a planet, whose Major period is running, that planet at the 
same time, transits over his Own-house, exaltation or a friendly house, 
he promotes the prosperity ofthe house, it represents when reckoned 
from the Ascendant provided the said planet possesses full strength at 
the birth time as well. 



Chapter 03: Assessing the Effects of Sub-Periods of a Planet 221 

15. If a planet, whose Major period is running, happens to be weak, eclipsed 
by the Sun, in its depression or inimical house in a nativity, that planet 
during his transit over any house, causes total destruction of that 
House. 

16. When the Moon transits over a sign which happens to be the exaltation 
sign of the lord of the Dasa, or a friendly house, the 3 rd , the 6 th , the 
10 th , the 1 1 th , a Trine or the 7 th house with respect to the lord of the 
Major period, the result will be happy. Should the position of the Moon 
during her transit is different from what has been stated above the 
result is most unpleasant. 

17. Should a planet, whose sub-period is running, during the course of his 
transit at the time pass over his depression or inimical house or become 
eclipsed, the native will suffer greatly. Should this planet pass through 
his own house, exaltation house or be retrograde, the result will be 

good. 

18. The good effects of a planet, whose sub-period is auspicious, will be 
manifested when the Sun in his transit traverses over the exaltation 
sign of the said planet. Similar result will be experienced by the native 
if Jupiter transits the place. Further, the planet whose sub-period is 
inauspicious causing bad or evil effects the result will be felt when the 
Sun transits over the depression or inimical sign of the sub-period 
lord. 

19. Rahu gives good or bad effects depending upon the nature of the 
planet he associates with. That planet, though good and benefic by 
himself, will, due to his association with Rahu, especially cause evil 
effects during the concluding period of his Dasa. 

Â£0. The 2 nd and the 7 th houses are said to be two Maraka Houses i.e. 
death inflicting places in any birth chart. When the lord of these or the 
planets occupying them are powerful they inflict death during their 
Dasas. If the lord of the 8 th or that of the 12 th house is weak death of 
the native may be expected during the sub-period of either of them. 

â  21 . The Dasa of the planet owning an Angle will be unfavourable if he is 
auspicious and it will be favourable if he happens to be inauspicious, 
.i^ The Dasa of all the planets who own the Trines (1,5,9) is auspicious. 
The lord of the 3 rd , the 6 th and the 11 th houses even if they are auspicious 
will cause evil only. The lord of the 8 th house, should he also own the 
Ascendant will prove auspicious. The Sun or the Moon, even when 
they own the 8 1n house, gives only good effects. 

22. When the lord of the Trine occupies an Angle and that of the Angle, a 
Trine House itwill be very auspicious lorthe native. These two planets 



222 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology: Dasa Systems 

during their sub-period in each other's Dasas will enrich the effects of 
each other and so co-operate to make the period auspicious. 

23. All the planets do not give good or bad effects to the native, according 
to the Houses they own, during the progress of their own sub-periods 
in their respective Major Period. 

Find out all those planets, which are related to the particular planet, 
whose Dasa is under examination. Also note the planets, if any, who 
are similarly situated (whether for good or bad) i.e. holding a position 
co-ordinate to the one under consideration. 

It is only in the Sub-period Dasas or sub-periods of these planets that 
this original planet is related will show his effect in his main Dasa. 

24. The lords of an Angular house and a Trine house should they be by 
themselves capable of causing evil, by being owners of other bad 
house, become powerful by their mere relationship in the Chart, to 
produce Yoga and they make the person concerned prosperous. 

25. When out of the lords of the 5 th and 9 th , one of them is related to a 
powerful planet owning an Angle, he becomes a Yogkaraka and powerful 
enough to promote the prosperity and well-being of the native. 

593 When the lord of an Angle is in conjunction with the lord of the Trine 
both of them become powerful enough to promote the prosperity of 
the man concerned. Should the lord of another Trine House also be 
related, the native's prosperity shall be never-ending. 

27. When planets, even if by themselves they are malefic, if related to a 
Yoga karaka planet capable of producing prosperity, they produce good 
effects promoting affluence and happiness during their sub-period. 

28. The lord of a Trine house gives, during his Major period and the sub- 
period of the lord of an Angular house, good effects. Even if these two 
planets are not in anyway related, they will not cause any harm. 

29. Should Jupiter and Venus happen to own Angular Houses, they become 
powerful to cause harm. Should they also occupy the Maraka places 
(2 nd & 7 th houses) they become powerful and cause death of the native 
during their Dasa & Sub-period. 

30. Should Mercury own an Angular house, he becomes less powerful 
than Jupiter or Venus in doing harm. The Moon, in such a condition, 
comes nextto Mercury. Evil planets when owning Angles become more 
and more auspicious in their effects. 

31 . Should Rahu or Ketu occupy an Angular or Trine House, they become 
Yoga karakas and instrumental to cause good to the man concerned 



Chapter 03: Assessing the Effects of Sub-Periods of a Planet 223 



provided they are related to the lord of either the Angular or Trine 
house. 

32. Should Rahu or Ketu occupy a house belonging to benefic and is not 
connected with any planet, he becomes good and produces auspicious 
results in his sub-period in the Major period of the said planet. It may 
also be said that when Rahu or Ketu has no connection but occupy an 
auspicious house (Angle-Trine), he gives good effects when the sub- 
period of the Yogkaraka planet is ripening in his Major period. 

33. During the Major period of a Yoga karaka planet, the Rajyoga operates 
when the sub-period of the Maraka planet is progressing. The sub- 
period of inauspicious planets which succeeds those in their turn add 
to the same. 

34. The following planetary positions in a birth chart cause greatest misery 
to the person concerned :- 

a) The planet posited in the 8 th house; 

b) The planet aspecting it; 

c) The lord of the 8 th house; 

d) The lord of the 22 nd Drekkana from the Ascendant and 

e) The planet owning the sign occupied by Mandi. 

But the weakest of these is responsible for causing the demise of the 
native and this may happen in his Dasa or Sub-period. 

35. The Dasa of a planet is said to be Avarohini (descending) when the 
said planet begins to descend from his exaltation sign; while that of a 
planet in friend or exaltation house is called Madhya or middling. The 
Dasa of a planet proceeding from his debilitation is termed Arohini or 
ascending. The Dasa of a planet that is actually in his depression or 
when he is moving from this point of full inimical sign or in his depression 
or inimical Amsa proves to be worst. 

36. Even when a planet is eclipsed or is placed in its depression or inimical 
house but occupies a benefic sign or Amsa, its Dasa can safely be said 
to give mixed effects and is certainly capable of giving good results in 
the last half of the Dasa period. 

37. Demise of the relative indicated by the House under reference may be 
said to take place in the Major period of the planet in the 12 th house 
counted from that house or of the planet owning it, which ever is 
weaker. 

For instance, a weak lord of the 2 nd house is posited in the 9 th . The 2 nd 
house is the 12 th (Vyayesh) to the 3 rd . This 3 rd house stands for the 



224 Encyclopedia of Vedic As trology: Dasa Sys terns 

younger brother or the sister. Again the 9 th is the 12 th (Vyayesh) to the 
10 th house representing the father of the native. This weak lord of the 
2 nd may cause the demise of the brother or that of the father in his 
main ruling or sub-period. Thus a weak planet in his Dasa or Sub- 
period causes destruction of both the houses which happen to be the 
12 th by ownership or by placement. 

38. Should the lord of the Dasa in his transit pass through the Ascendant, 
the 3 rd , the 6 th , the 10 th or the 1 1 th house from it (Ascendant) or if the 
lord of the Dasa comes in the 7 th place of the Ascendant i.e., the 7 ,h 
house, or when a friendly or an auspicious planet comes to the 

â¢ Ascendant the Dasa proves beneficial at that time. 

39. During the several periods over which a Dasa may continue, the good 
or bad effect is to be ascertained after referring to the particular house 
reckoned from the Moon, which the lord of the Dasa may occupy 
during the course of its progress through its orbit. 

The Moon gives auspicious results when in transit: 1 - 

Moon is in the house of a friend of the lord of the Dasa; or 

In the exaltation house of the latter or in the 7 th houses, Trine or 

In any one of the Upachaya (3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11) houses with 
reference to the lord of the Dasa. 

The favourable positions of Moon are referred above, in other 
houses Moon shows evil results. 

The positive sign occupied by the Moon also represent Ascendant, 2 nd , 
ll^houseetc, in the nativity. Then Moon in anyone of these auspicious 
positions should promote prosperity with reference to the House 
indicated by the sign occupied. So far as the inauspicious positions (6, 
8, 12) are concerned, the House represented by the negative sign 
occupied by the Moon suffers loss.

opposite direction. Even a malefic planet situated 4 th from the planet having 
its main ruling period will give good results, if it occupies a position of 
strength such as being in its own sign or in its sign of exaltation. 

On the other hand even a benefic planet located in 4 th from the planet 
having its main ruling period, will give bad results, if it is not located in a

10 th house representing the father of the native. This weak lord of the 
2 nd may cause the demise of the brother or that of the father in his 
main ruling or sub-period. Thus a weak planet in his Dasa or Sub- 
period causes destruction of both the houses which happen to be the 
12 th by ownership or by placement.

when it is not located in its exaltation sign, own sign, friendly sign or in 
good Vargas. 



Chapter 03: Assessing the Effects of Sub-Periods of a Planet 227 

During the sub period of a malefic planet located with the sub-period 
lord or 2Â°Â° or 3 rd to it one gets sorrow but if the sub-period lord is a benefic 
the results are good for the native. 

There is much sorrow, and bss of position, eyes, relatives, sons, wealth,

During the sub and main periods of benefic planets the native gets 
position, fine clothes, conveyance, and ornaments. 

During the main ruling period of a malefic and the sub ruling period of 
a benefic the native first gets good results and then bad results. 

During the main ruling period of a benefic and the sub ruling period of 
a malefic the native gets trouble first and then comforts. 

In cases where there are many contradictory factors the results forthe 
majority should be declared. Where factors are equal the results earlier & 
later should be predicted as detailed. 

Sub-Divisions of Dasas and Their Effects 

Now let us know how to reduce a Dasa period into its sub-periods 
(Sub-periods) and their further sub-sub-divisions (Sub-periods) along with 
their respective effects. All that has been stated as effects, with respect to 
any planet, should be expected to occur in the Planefs Dasa, in his sub- 
period and in his sub-sub-period (Sub-period). 

Multiply the years of a planet's Mahadasa by the years of the planet 
that's Sub-period is sought. Divide this product by 120. The quotient will 
denote the years of the Sub-period, Multiply the remainder by 12 and 
divide the result by 120. The quotient obtained now will stand for months, 
further multiply the remainder by 30 and divide it by 120. This quotient will 
give the days, and so on. 

This very procedure has to be adopted for calculating the sub-periods 
in an Sub-period, or their further sub-divisions. In any Dasa, the order or 
the sub-periods (Sub-periods) is similar to that in the Dasa and the first 
sub-period (Sub-period) will commence with that of its lord. 

Note: Bhukti or Sub-period is the sub-period of a Mahadasa or Main 
or Major period and sub-Sub-period is the sub-period of a Sub-period. A 
Major period consists Of 9 (nine) sub-periods ruled by the nine planets and 
each sub-period is similarly covered by nine Sub-sub-periods and each 
sub-Sub-period by nine Sukshma-Dasa and each Sukshma by nine Prana- 
Dasa Each Major period begins with the sub-period ruled by the same 
planet ruling the Dasa. This rule also applies to Sub-period, Sukshma and 



228 Encyclopedia of Vedic Astrology : Dasa Systems 

Prana The sequence of Sub-period and up to Prana, etc., is the same order 
as that of the Mahadasa. 

The method of finding out the sub-period in any Major period is very 
simple. Multiply the figures of the Mahadasa with that of the planet whose 
sub-period is to be found out. The last figure in the product always stands 
for the decimal of the month and the rest represents the total number of 
the months. Suppose we want to know the Sun Bhukti in Jupiter Mahadasa.

Positions) 

During the main ruling period of the Sun located in the Ascendant and 
the sub periods of Mars. Saturn. Ketu and Rahu the native gets sorrow & 
loss of ruling powers, wealth and property. 

(This would be the result when the planets Marsietc., are in "Agochar" 
position i.e. are ill placed from the Sun & weak. If however they are in 
"Gochar" they give good results. 

A planet in its own sign, in its sign of exaltation, in its friends sign, not 
eclipsed by the Sun, not situated in the 6 th , 8 th or l^house is technically 
called in Gochar. 

If it is eclipsed in debilitation sign, and in sign otherthan its Mooltrikona 
sign or otherthan a friends sign and when located in 6*, 8 th , or 12* 
house is bad and is technically called "Yam Gochar")

strong the native gets much comfort; If the planets having sub period are 
not "Gochar place" the results are bad i.e. sorrow etc. 

(The academic education & its extent and quality have to be determined 
from the 2 nd house of the horoscope i.e. through the nature of influence 
falling on the second house & its lord and its significator -Mercury). 

In that event, the sub period of Mars located anywhere will harm the 
right eye, if sun in the 2 nd house is having its main ruling period. In case, 
where Mars is strong and aspecting also the Sun in the 2 a house, injury to 
the right eye is a certainty. The reason is that Mars in such a case will have 
double malefic influence on the factors representing the right eye viz the 
2 nd house and the planet Sun. 

As regards the "Gochar place" position of the planets having their sub 
period, we are of the opinion that the benefit or harm to the house occupied 
by the main Period lord would be much when the planets having their sub 
periods are strong, for then their influence, good or bad, will be more 
effective.)

Chapter 04 

Avasthas (State) of Planets 
& Their Effects 



A. VARIOUS TYPE OF AVASTHAS (STATE) OF PLANETS 
AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE NATIVE 

In the Vedic or Hindu Astrology the ancient Seers have mentioned, 
various type of Avasthas or state, of the nine planets including Nodes (i.e. 
Rahu and Ketu), to determine quantitatively the nature of auspicious or 
inauspicious effects which a planet will be capable of conferring on a Native, 
not only during native's life span but also in their period or sub-periods etc. 
Each of these Avasthas has a name, which is broadly symbolic of the type 
of effects expected from the respective planet (which is in that state). The 
method of finding out the state of a planet differs in each type of grouping 
of state or Avastha. 

THE SHAYANAADI etc. TWELVE AVASTHAS 

Shayana (Repose, laying down), Upavesha (Worshiping or sitting), 
Netrapani (Washing eyes/ face), Prakasa (radiating), Gamana (going), 
Agamana (Coming), Sabhagatha (In assembly), Agama (homeward bound), 
Bhojana (Taking food), Nrityalipsa (Engrossed in dancing), Kauthuka 
(Amusement) and Nidra (Sleep), these are the names of the twelve Avasthas 
of the Planets. 



Chapter 04: Avasthas (State) of Planets <& Their Effects 337 



To find out the particular Avastha of a planet we have to proceed as 
follows: 

The serial number of the Nakshatra in which the Planet is situated is to 
be multiplied by the serial number of the respective Planet, (Sun-1, Moon- 
2, Mars-3, Mercury-4 T Jupiter-5, Venus-6, Saturn-7, Rahu-8, Ketu-9) then 
the product is to be multiplied by the Navamsa serial number in which the 
Planet is posited. To this resultant figure is added the serial number of the^ 
present Moon Nakshatra, the Ishta Ghatis and the serial number of the 
Ascendant sign. Afterthisthe resultant is to be divided by 12, and then the 
remainder will tell the SHAYANAADI Avasthas: 

Notes: Suppose the native was born in the Hasta Nakshatra 5 Ghatis 
Pala after the sunrise in the Cancer Ascendant. At this Ishta Kalaortime, 
the Sun's longitude was 2/5/10/15 and the moon's longitude) was 5/9/14/ 
27. 

Due to the Sun's longitude to be 2/5/10/15 Sun will be in the Mrigasiras 
Nakshatra. Therefore the serial no. of Mrigasiras isto be multiplied by that 
of the Sun. The product of these will be 5 x 1 =5. 

This product isto be multiplied by the serial no. of Navamsa in which 
the Sun is situated. The product will be 5x 8 = 40. To this figure (40) isto 
be added the serial no. of the birth Nakshatra which is 13 and the birth 
Lagna (the serial no. of the natal Ascendant which is 4). The summation 
will be 40 + 1 3 + 4 = 57. It is divided by 1 2, then the remainder comes to 
nine. The 9 th is the Bhojana Avastha. Therefore it is the Bhojana Avastha 
of the Sun. 

In order to know the Chesta of the Avastha: 

4. The remainder which came by the above method should be multiplied 
by this very figure (the remainder). The product is to be added the 
number of the first letter of the name and the resultant should be 
multiplied by 12. In the remainder are to be added the Kshepakanka 
of the Planets for the Sun etc. Su (5), Mo (2), Ma (2), Me (3), Ju (5), 
Ve (3), Sa (3), Ra (4), Ke (4) and this isto be multiplied by 3. If the 
remainder is 1 then it is Drishti, if 2 it is Cheshta, if it is Vicheshta.

In the notes of the 3 rd shloka we arrived at the Bhojana Avastha of the 
Sun. There the remainder was 9. Therefore multiplying the remainder 
9 by 9 we get 8 1 . To 81 is added the SWARANKAS of the first letter of 
the native's name (popular) Hari Om 'Ha 7 and thus we get 81 +5=86. 
it is divided by 12. The remainder comes to be 2. To it is added the 
Kshepakanka of the Sun 5 and the figure comes to be 2+5 =7. Dividing 
it by 3 we get the remainder 1. Therefore, it is the Drishti Chesta. 

In the given example. We should say that there was the Sun's Drishti 
Chesta which was in his Bhojana Avastha. 

The effects of the various Chesta are: 

Drishti Chesta (1 st ) will give moderate effects. 

Chesta (2 nd ) will give complete effects.
