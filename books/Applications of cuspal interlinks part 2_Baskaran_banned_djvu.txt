“ SANDHANAM “ 


| have the privilege of knowing Shri 
K.Baskaran of Madurai, for a few years. | have 
watched him making good predictions through his 
wonderful system of Interlinks theory in Modern 
Astrology which has its roots in the well known 
Krishnamoorthy Pathathi method of Sublord theory. 


He has propagated hundreds of interesting 
points to substantiate his conviction that only the 12 
cusps with their interlinks are responsible to carry out 
the events in one's life rather than the planetary 
significations as many of the traditional astrologers 
believe. 


| am sure that this work will be well received 
in the world of astrologers of the new Millennium as a 
useful tool for successful predictions. 


| wish Shri K.Baskaran all the very best in his 
keen research works in this field.

FOREWORD 


Astrology has deep roots in the history of 
mankind and we hear many success stories of 
the ability of the astrologers to predict the future 
events with great precision. However, for every 
successful prediction that we hear, there are 
many dozens of inaccurate predictions. Then 
we hear that in addition to the knowledge of the 
rules of astrology (| do not know how many 
hundreds are there), one should have divine 
grace to give predictions. If it is based on 
divine grace, then the doubt arises whether it is 
a scientific method. 


While, | was interested in astrology only 
as a bystander, a few years ago ! had an 
opportunity to meet Sri K. Baskaran of Madurai 
and get exposed to the enchanting world of 
astrological predictions. In fact, with his 
guidance, | was able to make accurate 
predictions for the simple questions like "When 
can | meet a person?" and tothe more advanced 
questions like "What is the nature of disease?" 


Vill 
etc. His method is unique and the rules are much 
simpler. He blended the concepts of Kalapurusha 
Thathva and the Placidus system of house 
divisions elegantly into his basic theory of Cuspal 
Inter Links. When one applies cuspal interlinks 
directly, one is bound to meet situations where 
the same planet is connected to more than a 
single cusp. This gives rise to "complex effects". 
Death of child on the day of inauguration of a 
new house, birth of child and death of mother, 
etc., are examples well known to all of us. The 
cuspal links, which cause such effects, are clearly 
brought out by studying compound links and | 
think this prompted him to bring out the present 
book. 


Mr Baskaran is a person who is willing to 
share his knowledge unlike many others. With 
his love for the subject of astrology, his years of 
experience in studying and carrying out research, 
he has written this excellent book " Applications 
of Cuspal Interlinks" | had an opportunity to 
go through this book and J see that he has 
presented such a complicated subject in a very 
lucid manner by taking a sample horoscope. 
While the possible number of combinations is 
extremely large, the style of presentation helps 
one to evaluate new cases with confidence and 
develop explanations for new combinations and 
situations. 


IX 


/ am very confident that this book, 
along with its previous two companion 
books, is going to be a handy reference 
book for all serious students of astrology 
who are interestedin giving accurate 
predictions. |! am confident that this book 
will certainly get the same great reception 
from fellow astrologers as his previous 
books did. 


Mr. S.Gnanasambandan who is also a 
personal friend of mine, deserves all the praise 
for doing a great job of translating the text into 
English.

TO THE READERS 


Shri A.R.BALAN 


Jeeva Nagar | St, 

Jaihindpuram, 

Madurai -625 011. 
Friends, 


We_ have just entered into the new 
millennium with new questions and challenges 
placed before astrology. This science of 
futurology, has to prove its validity and 
credibility as with any other science. The 
science of calculation in astrology Was made 
to perfection by Prof Shri K.S.K. But still 
something was required to be appended as 
astrologers have been facing certain difficulties 
in predictions with the usual significators. 
Some of them even went to the extent of 
substituting with the tradition based ideas for 
predictions. But, Shri K.Baskaran, with his 
faithful study, has proceeded for solutions to 
complicated and complex questions of modern 
day life with the use of Cuspal interlinks based 
on the prime concepts of Prof Shri K.S. 
Krishnamoorthy to evolve a new and novel 
system of astrology as "Krishnamoorthy - 
Baskaran" (KB system). 


Xl 
| feel proud about my disciple Shri 
K.Baskaran all the time, and this present work 
is really going to glitter as a jewel in the crown. 
He has indeed opened a floodgate for all the 
modern thinking astrologers to delve in 
gleefully to quench their thirst in this great 
science. It is my desire now to request all the 
dear readers to take up and carry on with this 
research work for the benefit of humanity in 
general. Itis with great appreciation that | must 
herewith record about the support, suggestions 
and able guidance of Mr S.P.Khullar in the 
format of this book. 


| should also appreciate the efforts 
of Shri S.Gnanasambandan, Senior 
Announcer, AIR, Madurai and Shri J.Rama 
Subramaniam for their commitment in 
bringing out this translation work. They have 
properly understood the inner meanings of 
what Shri K.Baskaran intended to say and 
elaborated the same according to the point 
of view of readers. | pray God Almighty to let 
the spirit of this team to continue in all their 
future efforts. 

Good luck.

NOTE OF TRANSLATORS 


Dear friends, 

Astrology is amidst the recent 
controversies for its possible inclusion as a 
branch of study in universities. It has been 
condemned by its critics as an act of saffronizing 
the education system with Hindu 
fundamentalism. If we know what had happened 
to other empricial sciences, we ourselves would 
not demand for such a dogmatic inclusion of 
Astrology as a subject of study, as it could only 
defeat the very purpose and the significance of 
astrology. 


But our concern here is the science- 
worthiness of astrology as rightly questioned by 
its critics. Though it is painful to admit, it is a fact 
that the present day astrology could never 
withstand before the specifications for 
deeming it as a science. Even if Astrology could 
succeed in finding a place as a faculty of study 
in universities due to the political patronage that 
it may possibly gain, we don't believe that the 
traditional astrologers would be generous enough 
to award due credit to Shri R.Gopalakrishna 
Rao(Meena) & to the Jothida Marthand Shri 
K.S.Krishnamoorthy. What is more painful to 
us is the fact even the so called followers of Shri 
K.S.K have not rendered due justice to his 


Xlll 
teachings. "The objectives are often defeated 
when they are institutionalized", is the prime 
propogation of Shri J.Krishnamoorthy, the 
popular philosopher of our times. Unfortunately 
this was what had happened also to the 
teachings of Shri K.S.K,. The non-availability of 
calculators and computers and lack of needed 
proofs to withdraw courageously and 
scientifically from the remains of a set of 
traditional concepts like aspects, retrogression 
etc., have limited Prof K.S.K., to leave certain 
shortcomings in his methodology. 


Only in this context, Shri K.Bhaskaran, 
the author of this book, is to be appreciated for 
his contrubitions for the enlightenment of the 
teachings of his guru, Shri K.S.K by innovating 
the theory of "Cuspal Interlinks”. At this 
moment, we feel really very proud for being the 
associates of this unique astrological work, 
"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks". We are 
aware that this book would stand as a milestone 
in the history of astrological researches. There 
were a few such attempts, in the footsteps of Late 
Shri K.S.K,. The basic differernce between such 
earlier attempts and this book lies in the 
scientific, the complete and the rational approach 
in applying the principles of astrology with the 
use of “Kaalamsas or Sublords". 


XIV 


After the release of the previous book, 
"Principles of Cuspal Interlinks", there were 
a few murmurs by a set of KP followers who 
preferred to show themselves as the saviours of 
the sanctum sanctity of KP system rather than 
upholding it as a system of science. We believe 
that the god of times would make them to accept 
and realize the contributions of Shri 
K.Bhaskaran, in the times to come. We are 
confident that the readers would find this book 
as a completely different and thoroughly useful 
one on astrology. 

Good Luck

CHART 


(Please refer to the Example Chart) 


In studying the Ascendant-dependant 
matters of every house, first of all, it is 
mandatory to assess the potential of the 
ascendant before analyzing the strength of any 
house. Note the starlord of the sublord of each 
cusp and study its position of favour to the asc 
and not to themselves. Only to the matters of 
their own entity, the position of favour is to be 
studied to themselves. 


Personal capacity to think and act, gain 
or loss of energy, attraction, pleasures and 
character are the prime significations of the i house, 
the Asc.

VI HOUSE 
HOUSE OF SUCCESS 


Service, Servants, Pet animals, Loans, 


Debts, House for rent, Herbal Plants, Success 
or Favourable scope in speculations, Sports and 
Games, Gamblings, Hurdles and problems, 
Theft, Dangers, Prison, Handicrafts etc are some 
of the significations of the 6th house, that are 
unrelated to the Asc. 


To simplify, the above significations are 


being re-classified and listed below, as the 
significations that are meant to link with the 
remaining houses: 


Diseases, Success, Self-endeavours 
Money raised through Loans 

Litigations 

Purchases 

Compromise in Litigations, Cure from 
diseases, Feasts 

Service, Servants and Subordinates, 
Separation 

Excessive Food, Bank Loans 

Worries caused by Loans, Litigations & 
Diseases, Hard labour 

Success in research, Financial crisis 


“Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 7 


due to loans, Break-down in profession 
due to servants 

X: Service as Profession, Promotion 

Xl: - Success in Litigations 

XII: Allergy, Inactive, Clearing debts, Divorce, 
Investment by acquiring loans, Changes 
in service conditions 


The VI house is a house of favour to 
nouses 2,4,6,8 & 10, while it remains neutral to 
houses 1,5 & 9; and would unsettle the 
significations of houses 3,7,11 &12. This could 
be experienced when the sublord of the 
respective houses remain inthe star or the sub 
of the sublord of the VI cusp. In return these 
houses would stand as means to execute the 
significations of the 6th house and would 
perform as follows: 


| onVl: Diseases caused by one's own 
thoughts and acts 

Il onVI: Diseases in Eyes & Throat 

Ill onVI: Diseases in Blood Veins, Nerves and 
Sensory organs 

IV onVI: Diseases in Heart, Lungs, Kidney and 
Glands 

V onVl: Diseases in Blood cells or Uterus, Viral 


“Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 8 
fever 

Vi onVi: Diseases caused by Food, Dress, 
Medicines and Labour 

VilonVl: Contagious Diseases, Climatic & 
Veneral Diseases 

VillonVi: Sudden diseases, Blocks and Death 

IXonVl: Genetical disorders, Malfunction or 
changes in organs, Swelling 

X onVvi: Professional diseases, Excessive 
production inside body. 

Xl onVi: Viral fever, Improper care and attention 

XllonVI: Secret diseases, Coma 


Inreverse, houses 1, 5,9 & 12 would deny 
the prospects of the 6th house as they happen 
to be 8,12, 4 & 7 to the 6th house; houses 2, 4, 
6, 8 & 10 would favour the functioning of the 6th 
house whereas houses 3, 7, 11 would remain 
as neutral to the 6th house. The above could be 
possible when the sublord of the 6th cusp 
remain inthe star or the sub of the sublord of 
the respective houses. In return the 6th house, 
while acting as a carrier of the significations of 
the concerned houses, would register its 
reactions in executing the same, which are as 
follows: 


“Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 9 


Vl onAsc: Diseases caused by Food Habits 

Vion Il: Resistance to Diseases 

Vion Ill: Deficiency in Energy 

Vion IV: Prolonged Illness 

Vion V: Cure from diseases by Prayers 

Vion VI: Diseases caused by workload 

Vion Vil: Steady increase in diseases 

VI onVill: Sudden developments in diseases 
and damages to organs 

Vion IX: Changes in Appearance and 
Structure, Medical science 

Vion X: Excessive Production by organs 

Vion Xl: Temporary diseases, Medical 
Research 

Vl on XIl: Diseases leading to Hospitalization 


Generally the VI house is a house of 
diseases. While it is linked with the VIII house, 
the diseases would lead to damages in the 
organs of the body. Houses 6, 8 & 12 would give 
stress, pain and hospitalization; houses 3, 6, 8 
& 12 would jointly denote the removal of such 
parts of the body or amputations and 1, 3, 6, 8 & 
12 would make a person as a handicapped 
person. 1, 4, 6, 8 & 12 would make a person to 
become handicapped by way of accidents. 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 10 
POTENTIAL of the VI HOUSE: 


In this chart, the sublord of the VI house 
Sun is in the star of Venus, the sublord of the 
12th house and in the sub of Rahu, the sublord 
of 7th house. Sub negates the star; Hence, the 
6th house as it is linked to the 7th house, 
becomes stronger to its own significations. 


Planets Moon & Mars are in the star of 
Sun, to become the permanent carriers of the 
6th house. Rahu is in the sub of Sun, to be a 
second line significator of the 6th house. 


PLANETARY SIGNIFICATIONS: 


SUN: 12: Troubles and Hardships from 
Govi, Tax dues, Uncleared debts, Controls by Govt. 


5: Awards by Govt,. Agreements with 
Govt, Statusful Son,Lack of needed interests in 
love makings. 


11: Gifts from govt, Friendship with civil 
servants, Gains and success in public life etc. 


Moon and Mars are the tow planets which 
reside in the star of Sun, the 6th sublord. 


MOON: Diseases caused by water and 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks" 11 
blood, Speedy loans and successes. 


MARS: Diseases in muscles and blood 
red cells, Troubles caused by heat, Interest in 
pungent foods 


While the significations of Sun remains 
permanent as the sublord of the 6th house, the 
significations of Moon and Mars would come to 
the forefront during their respective DBA periods. 


ASC on VI: 


Asc is a house of danger to the 6th house. 
In this chart, Mars, the sublord of the Asc, 
remains in the star of Sun, the 6th sublord and in 
the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord, to stand for 
the combined significations of houses 1,6 & 7 or 
of houses 8,1 &2 tothe 6th house, and thus to 
render a favourable scope for the unrelated 
significations of the 6th house to the Asc. 


Principles of the interlinks of the Asc, when 
happen to link with the 6th house are listed below: 


6,2: Considerable progress in financial 
conditions, Money through self efforts 

6,3: Diseases in Audio-visual sensory organs, 
Litigations, Leaving the native place 


"Applications of Cuspal_Interlinks” 12 


6,4: Landlord, Service in House, Vehicles and 
Lands, Agriculture 

6,5: Compromise in problems, Medi-Cure, 
Temporary Jobs 

6,7: Separation from Wife/Husband 

6,8: Hard labour, Sudden failure of organs 

6,9: Change of profession, Living with the 
2nd Wife/Husband after Separation/ 
Divorce 

6,10: Statusful job, Permanent job 

6,11: Bold and courageous efforts 

6,12: Hospitalization, Separation of the partner, 
Secret acts 


In this chart, since the Asc is linked with 
6 & 7, a favourable linkage to the significations 
of the 6th house, the Asc would increase the 
diseases and would bring success in 
litigations etc., during the DBA periods of Mars 
while it also transits in the star of Sun, the 6th 
sublord. When an Asc is linked with the 6th 
house, it is in such a_ position to receive the 
unfavourable results of the 6th house and would 
also denote taking medicines and wearing new 
dresses etc,. 


"Applications of Cnspal_Interlinks” 13 
VI on ASC: 


General principles of linkage of the VI 
house with the Asc are as follows: 


1,1: status in service 

1,2: Status and income through service 
1,3: Status and popularity in service 

1,4: Status and production skills in service 
1,5: Status as supervisor 

1,6: Status for managerial skills 

1,7: Status in administrative skills 

1,8: Status through hard labour 

1,9: Status in management 

1,10: Status in responsible capacities 
1,11: Status in legal affairs and knowledge 
1,12: Status in capital management 


VI house, a neutral house to the Asc, by 
carrying 12,5 & 11 in its bag, becomes an 
unfavourable house to the Asc and would give 
temporary diseases and troubles of loans etc 
during the DBA periods of Sun, while it transits 
in the star of Mars, the Asc sublord. 


"Applications of Cuspal Iterlinks” 14 
Il on VI: 


ll house is a house of favour to the 6th 
house. In this chart, Mercury the Il sublord 
transits in the star of Venus, the 12th sublord 
and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord, to stand 
forthe combined significations of houses 2, 12 
& 7 or of houses 9, 7 & 2 to the 6th house, and 
thus would retain its scope of favours to the VI 
house. 


Principles of the interlinks of the Il house, 
when happen to link with the 6th house are listed 
below: 


6,1 : Spendings with money in hand 

6,3: Interests on deposits 

6,4: Converting money as properties 

6,5: Income through service in Arts and 
Culture

POTENTIAL OF THE Vi! HOUSE: 


In this example chart, Rahu, the sublord 
of the VII house is in its own star but in the sub of 
Sun, the sublord ofthe 6th house to weaken the 
potential of the VII house. 


6 is a house of denial to the 7th house; 
Does it mean here that the native could not marry 
at all? As far as the matter of marriage is 
concerned, only if both the Asc and the VII house 
are denied with their opposing houses of 
marriage and sexual pleasures {Houses 4, 6, 
10 & 12} we have to presume that the event of 
marriage would be denied. Here the Asc sublord 
Mars is in the star of Sun, the 6th sublord but in 
the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord to gain a favour 
for the event of marriage. 


However, in this chapter, we have to 
confine ourselves to the study of the prospects 
of the VII house with the remaining 11 houses; 
Hence, the principles to marriage and the 
procedures to time the event of marriage would 
be dealt in PART II of this book with the use of 
few other examples. 


Since the potential of the VIE house is very 
weak, the married life of the native is not going 
to be a bed of roses for him. 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 45 


RAH: High frequency in sexual contacts, 
Relationships with other social groups 
[community, to be specific] Contagious Diseases, 
Gains through strangers and foreigners etc 
(PCI:P.N 33) 


Planets which are in the star or sub of 
Rahu are: Moon, Mars & Mercury. 


MOON: Young partner, Speedy copulation, 
Perturbed mind, Flexibility etc. (PCI:P.N 23) 


MARS: Perverted and Abnormal interest 
in sexual contacts, Troubles caused by enemies 
(PCI:P.N 25) 


MER Secret notes, Repetitive in copulation 
etc (PCI:P.N 27) 


While the significations of Rahu would 
remain permanent during the entire life span of 
the native, the significations of Moon, Mars and 
Mercury would come to the forefront during2 their 
respective DBA periods. 


ASC on VII: 
Asc is an unfavourable house to the 7th 


house. In this chart, Mars, the sublord of the 
Ascis in the star of Sun, the 6th sublord, butin 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 46 


the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. Now Asc 
becomes 12 & 1 to the 7th house. Though the 
star indicates a house of negation to the 7th 
house, the sub favours the 7th house; Hence in 
this chart, Asc becomes neutral to the 7th house. 


Principles of interlinks when Asc is linked 
to the 7th house: 


7,2: Murder or Harassment to W/H, Expecting 
Dowry 

7,3: W/H to the likes of the native 

7,4: Lack of Attachment causing an unhappy 
atmosphere to W/H 

7,5: Abound in love and affection to satisfy W/H 

7,6: Inclination to leave and troubles caused to

7,11: Love and Affection by partner to satisfy 
native 

7,12:Sickness of W/H, Tendancy of W/H to leave 
the native, Troubles caused by W/H 


In this chart, Asc as it carries 6 & 7 or 12 


“Applications of Cuspal Interlinks’ 47 


& 1 to the 7th house, would render the native 
troubles in married life and misunderstandings 
with wife and would force him to be away from 
his wife during the DBA periods of Mars, while 
Mars also transits in the star of Rahu, the 7th 
sublord. 

Vil on ASC: 


General principles of linkage of the VII 
house with the Asc are as follows: 


1,1: Cordial and Loving Attitude of W/H 

1,2: Cordial Attitude of W/H with short life 

1,3: W/H as per the likings of the native 

1,4,; Attachment of W/H towards the joint 
family of native 

1,5: Affectionate W/H 

1,6: Loathsome Attitude of W/H

1,10: Dissatisfaction of native towards W/H 

1,11: Happy and Harmonious partner 

1,12: Expenses incurred and losses by W/H 


VIl house as an unfavourable house to 
the Asc, as it carries the combined 
significations of houses 7 &6 with it, would drag 


"Applications of Cuspal Interfinks” 48 


the native into ego clashes with his wife or the 
people whom he happens to meet during the DBA 
periods of Rahu, while it is also in transit of the 
star of Mars, the sublord of the Asc; This 
combination would also enable the native to win 
over his partners or wife. 


II on VII: 


Il house is a house of danger to the VII 
house. Mercury, the sublord of the II house is in 
the star of Venus, the 12th sublord and in the 
sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. Houses 12 & 7 
are houses 6 & 1 tothe VII. Now the Il house 
becomes an unfavourable house to the 
health-related matters of the VII house but would 
stand as favourable to the materialistic benefits 
of the 7th house. 


Principles of interlinks when Il house is 
linked to the 7th house: 


7,1: Welcoming Financial Assistance from 
others 

7,3: Improvement in Financial Status with the 
Assistance of others 

7,4: Increasing Communications & Assistance 
within the Family 

7,5: Joint family, Cordial atmosphere in the 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 49 
Family 

7,6: Troubles to W/H caused by the members 
of the Family 

7,8: Problems in Family caused by lack of 
flexibility among members of the Family

Illegal affairs, Financial crisis 

7,10: Business partnership with members of the 
same Family 

7,11: Friendly attitude of the Family to render 
needed helps and co-operation to the 
native 

7,12: Leaving W/H as persuaded by the 
members of the Family 


Since the Il house is 12 & 7 in this chart, 
wife of the native would be quarrelsome in 
nature in spite of the financial assistance 
provided by the native. This signification also 
refers to the secret problems caused by his wife. 
Dangers to the life of wife and illhealth caused 
to wife could also happen during the DBA 
periods of Mercury, the sublord of the II house, 
while it also transits in the star of Rahu, the 
sublord of the VII house.

houses 7 & 6 with it, would enable the native to 
gain through partner or wife during the DBA 
periods of Rahu, while it is also in transit of the 
star of Mercury, the sublord of the II house. 


Ill on VII: 


Ill house, a house of favour to the VII 
house. Mars, the sublord of the Ill house is in 
the star of Sun, the 6th sublord and in the sub 
of Rahu, the 7th sublord. Hence the Ill house 
turns into an unfavourable house to the 7th 
house, by becoming 12 & 1 to the 7th. 


Principles of interlinks when the III house 
is linked to the 7th house: 


7,1: Lack of Financial interests by W/H, 
Possible Illegal Affairs of W/H

to the 7th house, by being an unfavourable

1,5, 7, 9& 11 while it would act against the 
houses 2, 3, 6 & 10; It would remain neutral to 
houses 4, 8 & 12. When the sublords of these 
houses remain in the star or the sub of the 
sublord of the IX house, the above effects of 
the 9th house could be studied in a chart. In 
reply, such houses, as the agents of the 9th 
house tend to register their reactions which are 
as follows:

Education 

Il on IX: Study of Voice and Speech in 
Education, Linguistics

HIGHER EDUCATION & IX HOUSE: 


Higher education is an Asc related 
karaka of the IX house. Whether a person may 
get educated or not could be studied with the 
use of the potential of the IX cuspal sublord to 
the Asc. In this example chart, the IX sublord 
is Moon which is in the star of Sun, the 6th 
cuspal sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th 
cuspal sublord. Houses 6 & 7 would remain as 
houses 6 & 7 to the Asc. Hence, the potential 
of the IX house, to its Asc related significations, 
remains only as neutral or moderate. 


For the study to identify the specific field 
of education, we can use our usual format. The 
professional courses are meant for providing 
professional opportunities to students. Only a 
small percentage of people choose different 
professions that are not related to their higher 
studies. Generally to study a professional 
course, the sublord of the 9th house must 
remain in the star or the sub of houses VI 
{Service} or the X house {Profession} or the 
XII house {Il profession}.

Practicioner of Traditional Medicines 

Xl: Master in E/M fields 

XII: Researcher in E/M fields 


The above indicate the nature and the 


quantum of the technical knowledge that a 
person would hold as qualification. Let us once 
again use the bhava karaka or the cuspal 
significations in further re-classification of the 
engineering field:

Radiology and Electrology 

Vill: Surgical Equipments, Sanitary 
Engineering 

IX: | Aeronautical or Marine Engineering, 
Space Technology 

X: Production Technology 

XI: Polymer Technology 

Xll: Mines Engineering 


Thus, when the 4th or the 9th house is 
linked to the VI or the X or the XII house, the 
educational qualification would standas means 
of career. 


i) Let us note down the planets which 
are in the star or the sub of 4th or the 9th house 
as the case may be. 


ii) Now let us note down the cusps, 
wherein the said planets appear as lords of star 
or sub or subsub. 


Say, if a planet A is the sublord of the 
6th house; also let us say that the native gets 
to study medical science or science about 
diseases.

iii) The Dasa period of the planet A, 
which is sublord to the 6th house alone and is 
in the star or the sub of the 9th house, would 
enable the native to study medical science as 
per its planetary significations. 


If Planet A is SUN : The Skeletal system 
MOO: The Circulatory system 
MAR: The Muscular system 
MER: The Neuro system 
JUP: The Reproductive system 
VEN: The Glands in the body 
SAT: The Excretory system 
RAH: The Respiratory system 
KET: The Digestive system 


iv) If the said planet A happens to be 
the starlord or the sublord or the subsublord to 
houses other than the 6th house, then a set of 
combined significations of all those houses that 
are linked, is to be derived. For example

v) Generally the Il house would denote 
eyes. houses 2, 3 & 6 are to be related to the 
IX house to become an Ophthalmologist. But 
within the field of Ophthalmology itself, we 
could find a variety of doctors in any popular 
eye hospital.

vi) Only after this stage, we can start 
studying the planetary significations of the lords 
of the current DBA, for the precise prediction 
about the field of study by native. Higher 
studies would also get varied according to the 
changes in the DBA periods. Now-a-days, a 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 122 


person, who has initially joined in a particular 
course, all of a sudden {8th house ?} 
discontinues it and joins in a different course 
and subsequently gets qualified. These 
changes are subject to the changes in the DBA 
periods, 


vii) There may be more than a single 
planet in the star or the sub of the sublord of 
the IX house. These planets would naturally 
be lords ofthe star or the sub of different cusps. 
If planet A is lord to 2 & 6 and planet B is lord 
to 1 & 5, then the native would naturally study 
two different courses in the respective bhukthi 
periods of planets A & B. In medical science, 
the degree of MBBS {6th house alone} is a 
common course offered to all the students. But 
after successfully completeing the MBBS 
degree, doctors opt for specialisation in 
different fields, as per the cuspal interlinks of 
the Bhukthi lord or the DASA lord in the case 
of intersection of two different dasas. 


viii) In the case of a qualified doctor in 
traditional medicine the 9th house must get 
linked to the 9th house itself. In the case of 
unqualified practicioners of Indian medicines, 
the 8th house will have a link with the 10th 
house, { 8th by being 12th to the 9th house, 
negates legal recognition to their medical 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 123 
knowledge} 


ix) The linkage of the IX house to the X, 
makes a person a doctor; linkage to the IV 
house limits a person to a nurse. Thus we have 
to apply principles of cuspal interlinks suitably 
with common sense in determining about the 
education and profession. 


Houses 1,5,7,9 &11 would be favourable 
to the 9th house, while houses 12,3,4 & 8 stand 
unfavourable to the significations of the IX 
house. The remaining houses 2, 6, 10 would 
remain neutral to the 1X house. This could be 
possible when the sublord of the IX house 
remain in the star or the sub of the respective 
houses. In reply, as an agent to the respective 
houses, the kX house would register its 
reactions on the respective houses. {Please 
refer the table Of classification of significations 
of the 9th house as meant to link with the 12 
houses} 


POTENTIAL OF THE IX HOUSE: 


In this example chart, the IX sublord is 
Moon, which is in the star of Sun, the 6th 
sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. 
Houses 6 & 7 would become houses 10 & 11 
to the 9th house to favour the IX house. Hence 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 124 


in this example chart, the IX house is 
potentially strong. 


Here, the readers may raise their eye 
brows in a doubt as how this native had been 
denied with higher education. Houses IV, IX & 
Xl combinedly denote the education of a 
person; IV renders basic education; IX renders 
higher education while the XI makes one to 
excel in education. XI follows what the IX has 
rendered while the IX would improve what the 
IV has rendered. Moreover, education is an Asc 
related signification of these houses. Hence the 
favour is to be calculated only to the Asc {6& 
7, in this example, not a favourable 
combination to the Asc}. 


Also in this chart, the IV house is weak 
to give him the basic education. As the basic 
education has been denied, naturally the IX 
house would be limited to act for the 
remaining significations only. 


Moon is the 9th sublord. The karakas of 
the Moon, meant for the IX house are. 


Research capabilities, Speedy 
Journeys, Status inherited from Mother, 
Wisdom through listening etc,. 


"Applications of Cuspal tterlinks” 125 


In this example chart, Venus is the only 
planet which is in the star of Moon. 


By being the 12th sublord Venus would 
render financial difficulties and troubles caused 
by women, research in the fields of arts and 
culture etc,. 


While the significations of Moon remain 
permanent during the entire life span of the 
native, the significations of Venus would come 
to the fore- front during its DBA periods on the 
IX house matters. 

ASC on IX: 


Asc is a naturally favourable house to 
the IX house. In this chart, the sublord of the 
Asc is Mars which is in the star of Sun, the 6th 
sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. 
Houses 6 &7 combinedly would neutralize the 
IX house matters. Hence in this chart, the Asc 
is a neutral house to the IX house. 


The principles of linkage of the Asc with 
the IX house are: 


9,2: Financial Troubles by way of Illegal 
Affairs 
9,3: Long Journeys, Communications

in Foreign Life 

Professional Education and Educating 
oneself to Professional Requirements 

Success in Research works, 
Satisfactions 

Life Abroad, Secret Research, 
Investigations, Absconding from the 
native place 


In this example chart, the Asc is 6 & 7 


or to say, 10 & 11 to the 9th house. Hence the 
native would undertake journeys with his wife 
or partner or friends and would communicate 
through wife or partner or friends during the 


"Applications of Cyspal_tnterlinks” 127 
DBA periods of Mars, while it is also in transit 
of the star of Moon, the 9th sublord. 


IXon ASC: 


General principles of linkage of the IX 
house on the Asc are as follows; 


1,1. Judges 
12 Treasurers of temples, Religious 
Centres 


13 Spy of Foreign Countries 

1,4 Respectable Teachers 

15 Priests 

1, Finance Controllers 

1,7. Administrators 

18 Investigators 

19 Politicians and National leaders 
1,16: Holders of Honorary Posts 
1,1'1: Research Professors 

1,12: Exporters 


IX house, a house of favour to the Asc, 
as itcarries 6 & 7 with it, would become a 
neutral house to the significations of the Asc. 
Hence the native would face problems like 
illhealth, contagious diseases, and food 
poisoning while undertaking long journeys 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 128 


during the DBA periods of Moon, while it 
transits in the star of Mars, the sublord of the 
Asc 

llon IX: 


Il house is a neutral house to the IX 
house. Inthis chart, the sublord of the I| house 
is Mercury, which is in the star of Venus , the 
12th sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th 
sublord. Houses 12 & 7 combinedly would 
favour the IX house matters, in this chart. 


The principles of linkage ofthe II house 
with the IX house are: 


9,1: Financial crisis caused by 
Misadventures of the native 

9,3: Mortgaging the Gold, Valuables or 
Properties 

9,4: Conversion of Money into Properties 
and subsequent Financial Crisis 

9,5: Severe Crisis in Finance, Living in 
Platforms 

9,6: Financial Troubles caused by undue 
Expenditure on Medical Treatment or by 
Excessive Borrowings. Labour without 
Salary or Wages 

9,7: Living with the Financial Assistance of 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 129 
others 

9,8: Financial Crisis caused by outstandings 

9,10: Financial Crisis in Business Ventures 

9,11: Not exposing the Financial Crisis and 
acting as a financially sound person 
before others 

9,12: Financial Crisis by Excessive 
Investments or by the Second 
Profession 


In this example chart, the Il house is 12 
& 7 orto say, 4 & 11 to the 9th house. Hence 
the native would face financial crisis by 
excessive investments and in second 
profession and could manage the affairs with 
social assistance during the DBA periods of 
Mercury, while it is also in transit of the star of 
Moon, the 9th sublord.

2,17: In-charge of Temple Properties and 
Valuables 

2,12: Auditor of Temple Accounts 


IX house, an unfavourable house to 
the Il house, as it carries 6 & 7 with it, 
would become a_ favourable house to the 
significations of the Il house. Hence the 
native would be able to gain through 
ancestral properties, illegitimate activities, 
communications etc during the DBA periods 
of Moon, while it transits in the star of Mercury, 
the II sublord. 

Il on IX: 


Il] house is an unfavourable house to 
the IX house. In this chart, the sublord of the 
Ill house is Mars which is in the star of Sun, 
the 6th sublord and inthe sub of Rahu, the 7th

DBA periods of Moon, while it transits in the 
star of Saturn, the VIII sublord. 


X on IX: 


X house is a neutral house to the IX 
house. In this chart, the sublord of the X house 
is Mercury, which is in the star of Venus, the 
12th sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th 
sublord. Houses 12 & 7 combinedly would 
favour the IX house matters, in this chart. 


The principles of linkage of the X house 
with the IX house are: 


9,1: Difficulties in Profession caused by 
attempts to raise the Image and 
Prestige 

9,2: Financial Crisis in Profession 

9,3: Difficulties in Profession caused by 
recent changes 

9,4: Problems in Manufacturings

of 2nd Business 


In this example chart, the X house is 12 
& 7 orto say, 4 & 11 to the 9th house. Hence 
the native would face problems in both his first 
and second professions during’the DBA 
periods of Mercury, while it is also in transit of 
the star of Moon, the 9th sublord. 


IX on X: 


General principles of linkage of the IX 
house with the X house are as follows: 


10,1 Head of Educational Institutions 

10,2 Cashier in Education Department 

10,3. Clerk in Education Department 

10,4 Teachers

IX house, a house of negation to the X 
house, with its 6 & 7, would remain a neutral 
house to the significations of the X house. 
Hence the native would face changes in his 
professional life during the DBA periods of 
Moon, while it transits in the star of 
Mercury, the X sublord. 


Xl on IX: 


XI house is a favourable house to the IX 
house. In this chart, the sublord of the XI house 
is Jupiter, which is in the star and the sub of 
Mercury, the sublord of houses 2,4 10, which 
combinedly would not favour the IX house 
matters, in this chart.

Resigning the First Job after getting a 
Second Job as desired 


In this example chart, the XI house is 2, 


4 & 10 or to say, 6, 8 & 2 to the 9th house. 
Hence the native would undertake research 
works and journeys with friends and would 
depart from the first profession during the DBA 
periods of Jupiter, while it is also in transit of 
the star of Moon, the 9th sublord.

11,11: Legally Valid 3rd Marriage 

11,12: Lawful Release after Punishments 


IX house, a favourable house to the XI] 
house, as it carries 6 & 7 with it, would modify 
into an unfavourable house to the significations 
of the XI house. Hence the native would be 
troubled through illegitimate affairs and remain 
stagnant in research works during the DBA 
periods of Moon, while it also transits in the 
star of Jupiter, the XI sublord.

XII house is an unfavourable house to 
the IX house. In this chart, the sublord of the 
XII house is Venus which is in the star of Moon, 
the 9th sublord and in its own sub, the 12th 
sublord. Houses 9 & 12 combinedly would not 
favour the IX house matters, in this chart. 


The principles of linkage ofthe XII house 
with the IX house are: 


9,1: Changes in the Body due to the Process 
of Medical Treatment 

9,2: Financial Crisis caused by Secret 
Activities 

9,3: Foreign Life, Running away from the 
native, Research Education 

9,4: Obstructions caused by Second

by Excessive Interest in Second 
Profession, Success in Secret Activities 


In this example chart, the XII house is 9 
& 12 or to say, 1 & 4 to the 9th house. Hence 
the native would face financial crisis due to 
inactive second profession during the DBA 
periods of Venus, while it is also in transit of 
the star of Moon, the 9th sublord.

General principles of linkage of the IX

IX house, a neutral house to the XIl 
house, as it carries 6 & 7 with it, would 
become an unfavourable house to the 
significations of the XII house. Hence the 
native would be able to gain success through 
research but the expenditure would get 
increased due to illegal activities during the 
DBA periods of Moon, while it transits in the 
star of Venus, the XII sublord.

X house would be a favourable house to 
houses 2, 6, 8, 10 & 12 while it would negate the 
prospects of the houses 3, 4, 7 & 11; it would 
remain neutral to the houses 1,5 & 9. This may 
happen when the sublord of the concerned 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 157 


houses remain in the star or the sub of the sublord 
of the X cusp. In reply, these cusps tend to 
register their reactions on the X cusp according 
to their respective significations, as mentioned 
above. 


Houses 2, 6, 8, 10 &12 would stand as 
favourable to the X house while houses 4, 5 &9 
would be unfavourable. Asc is an exception as 
far as to the significations of the X house is 
concerned. Houses 3, 7 & 11 would remain 
neutral to the X house. In reply, the X house 
provides reactions on these houses, which are 
as follows: 


Xon_ f Status through Profession 

Xon_ Il: Income through Profession 

Xon Ill: Transfer or Assistance from others 
in Profession 

Xon lV: Motives and Jealousy in Profession

Xon XI: Higher Posts

"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 158 
"POTENTIAL" of the X HOUSE: 


The sublord of the X house would always 
remain in a star and a sub. This starlord and the 
sublord may appear as cuspal sublords of a few 
houses. In this example chart, the X sublord is 
Mercury, which is in the star of Venus, the 12th 
sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. 
Houses 12 & 7 would be houses 3 & 10 to the X 
house, not an unfavourable combination. But 
houses 12 & 7 are not favourable to the Asc. 
Hence, the profession would not bring 
reputation or status to the native. 


10th sublord when it is connected to the 
12th house, would multiply the scope of 
professional opportunities and would lead the 
native to start a second venture. Since the link is 
also with the 7th house, the native either could 
do self-ventures or could act as a free-lancer and 
would suffer in the end. The native could never 
be in service as the 6th house, the house of 
service, is not linked by the X house. 


The sublord of the X house, Mercury 
signifies Contracts, Accounts, Agencies, 
Brokerage etc 


Now, can we study the second angle of 
the question of profession? In this example chart, 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 159 


Jupiter is the only planet, which is in the star and 
the sub of Mercury, the X sublord. Jupiter is the 
sublord of houses 5 & 11. Hence houses 5 & 11 
are in direct linkage with the X house. 


5th house, would enable the native to 
choose a feather from the numerous fields of arts 
as his profession. 11th house would enable the 
native to get due satisfaction in his profession. 


Jupiter: Devotion and God-fearing, 
Brilliance, Faithful (5 & 11) friends, Scholar 
(PCI - P.N 28, 29) 


While the pre-settings of the X sublord 
Mercury is permanent during the entire life-span 
of the native, the planet Jupiter, the resident in 
the star and the sub of Mercury would enable 
the native to reach professional heights during 
its DBA periods. 

ASC&X 


Asc is an unfavourable house to the X 
house. But Asc, because by being so, is an 
exception by not doing any misfavours to other 
houses. The Asc sublord Mars, in this example 
case, is inthe star of Sun, the 6th sublord and in 
the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. Houses 6 & 7 
would become houses 9 & 10 to the X house, to 
mean that the Asc would become a favourable 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 160 
house to the matters of the X house. 


The principles of linkage of the Asc on the 
X house are as follows: 


10,1: Profession as per Self-Thoughts 

10,2: Profession in which Voice is used 

10,3: Profession in Communication Fields 

10,4: Profession suitable to Education 

10,5: Profession in the fields of Arts and 
Culture 

10,6: Profession in the fields of Medical 
Science, Foods 

10,7: Profession in the field of Management 

10,8: Profession in the field of Criminology 

10,9: Profession by holding Honorary Posts 

10,10: Profession and personality with Status 
and Respect 

10,11: Profession as a Leader of a Team 

10,12: Profession in the fields of Inspection 
and Research 


Here Asc is not directly linked with the X 
house. But the planet Mars, must sail across the 
stars of Mercury for about 20 days in every 
semester. Hence the sublord of the Asc, Mars 
would have to render something or the other to 


"Applications of Cuspal Iterlinks” 161 


the X house to justify its Gochara or Transit 
linkage. 6th house means permanency, success 
and assistance from others; 7th house means 
social contacts and self ventures. Hence during 
the DBA periods of Mars, when it happens to 
transit in the star of Mercury, the X sublord, would 
enable the native to take initiatives to gain 
success and assistance from others and would 
mould the character of the native as suited to 
receive new social relations. 


X on Asc 


General principles of linkage of the X 
house with the Asc are as follows: 


1,1: Status through Profession 

1,2: Status and Finance through Profession 

1,3: Status through Courageous Efforts in 
Profession 

14:  Statusful Profession wherein Company 
Quarters and Vehicle would be provided 

1,5: Statusful Posts in the field of Arts and 
Culture 

1,6: Statusful posts in the field of Medical 
Science 

1,7: Statusful Social Service as Profession 

1,8: Notorious Militant and Terrorist 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 162 


1,9: Honesty and Respect in Profession 

1,10: Adviser in the field of his own Profession 
1,11: Status and Job Satisfaction in Profession 
1,12: Status but crooked thoughts in Profession 


Generally X house is a neutral house to 
the Asc. But in this example, the X sublord 
Mercury, because it is in Venus star, the 12th 
sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord 
and thus being a significator for houses 12 & 7, 
not a holy combination to the significations of the 
Asc, would disable the native to capitalize on his 
professional opportunities, during the DBA 
periods of Mercury, while it also transits in the 
star of Mars, the Asc sublord.

General principles of linkage of the II

Il house is 5th to the Xth house. Hence it 
is generally a favourable house to the X house. 
But in this example chart, the sublord of the Il 
house Mercury is in the star of Venus, the sublord 
of the 12th house and in the sub of Rahu, the 
sublord of the 7th house. Houses 12 & 7 are 
houses 3 & 10 to the X house to remain a 
neutral house. Since Mercury is supposed to 
cause difficulties and losses to the native during 
its DBA periods, would do the same by way of 
professional ventures during its transit in its own 
star. Excessive investments, attempts to do 
second ventures would bring losses for him.

and thus being a significator for houses 12 & 7,

enable the native to professional income or gains 
during the DBA periods of Mercury, while it 
transits in own star.

Mi house is neutral to the X house. Mars,

Here IIl house is not directly linked with 
the X house. But the planet Mars, must sail across 
the star of Mercury for about 20 days in every

Mars would have to render something or the other 
to the X house to justify its Gochara or Transit 
linkage. 6th house means permanency, success 
and assistance from others; 7th house means 
social contacts and self ventures. Hence during 
the DBA periods of Mars, when it happens to 
transit in the star of Mercury, the X sublord, would 
enable the native to communicate for success 
and assistance from others and would enable 
him to undertake short journeys for professional 
purposes.

Generally X house is a house of danger 


to the Ili house. In this example, the X sublord 
Mercury is in Venus star, the 12th sublord and in 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 168 


the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord and thus being 
a significator for houses 12 & 7, ortosay 10&5 
to the Ill house, would give needed mental 
courage and ability to communicate and express 
to avail professional opportunities during the DBA 
periods of Mercury, while it transits in the star of 
Mars, the III sublord.

General principles of linkage of the IV

IV house is unfavourable to the70th 
house. But in this example chart, the sublord of 
the IV house Mercury is in the star of Venus, the 
sublord of the 12th house and in the sub of Rahu, 
the sublord of the 7th house. Houses 12 & 7 are 
houses 3 & 10 to the X house to get confined to 
a neutral house. Since Mercury is supposed to 
cause difficulties and losses to the native during 
its DBA periods, would do the same by way of 
purchasing machineries or vehicles or 
properties in connection with professional needs 
during its transit in its own star. Excessive 
investments and attempts to do second ventures 
would stand as means of incurring losses for him.

Generally X house is unfavourable to the

Mercury, because it is in Venus star, the 12th 
sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord 
and thus being a significator for houses 12 & 7, 
or to say houses 9 & 4 to the IV house, would 
enable the native to make professional income

V house is house of danger to the 10th 
house. Hence it is generally an unfavourable 
house to the X house. But in this example chart, 
since the sublord of the V house Jupiter is in the 
star and sub of Mercury, the cuspal sublord of 
houses 2, 4 & 40, or to say houses 5, 7 & 1to the 
X house, it gets modified into a favourable house. 
Hence, the native could purchase properties with 
the income from profession during the DBA 
periods of Jupiter, the 5th sublord while it is also 
in transit in the star of Mercury, the X sublord.

Generally X house is a neutral house to 


the V house. But in this example, the X sublord 
Mercury, because it is in Venus star, the 12th 
sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord 
and thus being a significator for houses 12 & 7, 
or to say houses 8 & 3 to the V house, would

force the native to incur losses in artistic 
profession, to face breaks in profession, and 
expenditure by way of children during the DBA 
periods of Mercury, while it transits in the star of 
Jupiter, the V sublord.

12th sublord and in the sub of Jupiter, the sublord 
of houses 5 & 11, or to say houses 3, 8 & 2 to the 
X house to remain as a favourable house. Hence, 
the native could succeed in developing his 
professional opportunities and could maintain a 
higher degree of cordiality in profession during 
the DBA periods of Sun, the 6th sublord while it 
is also in transit in the star of Mercury, the X

Generally X house is favourable to the VI 
house. In this example, the X sublord Mercury, 
because it is in Venus star, the 12th sublord and 
in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord and thus 
being a significator for houses 12 & 7, or to say 
houses 7 & 2 to the VI house, would enable the

Vil house is neutral to the 10th house. But 
in this example chart, since the sublord of the VII 
house Rahu is in its own star and in the sub of 
Sun, the 6th sublord, orto say, houses 10 & 9to 
the X house to get modified into a favourable 
house. Since itis 7 & 6, it would negate the Asc 
to have frequent social relationships. Hence, the 
native could have only a limited scope in his 
profession during the DBA periods of Rahu, the 
7th sublord while it is also in transit in the star of 
Mercury, the X sublord.

VII house. But in this example, the X sublord 
Mercury, because it is in Venus star, the 12th

and thus being a significator for houses 12 & 7, 
or-to say houses 6 & 1 to the VII house, would 
enable the native to have frequent visits of

sublord of houses 1 & 3 and in the sub of Jupiter, 
the sublord of houses 5 & 11, or to say houses 4, 
6, 8 & 2 to the X house to become a neutral 
house. Though the native would unexpectedly 
be able to meet more number of customers and

profession during the DBA periods of 
Saturn, the 8th sublord while it is also in transit in 
the star of Mercury, the X sublord.

Generally X house is favourable to the VIII 
house. But in this example, the X sublord 
Mercury, because it is in Venus star, the 12th 
sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord 
and thus being a significator for houses 12 & 7, 
or to say houses 5 & 12 to the yj|| house, would 
force the native to render hard labour in winning 
his daily bread in professional life during the DBA 
periods of Mercury, while it also transits in the

sublord of the IX house Moon is in the star of 
Sun, the 6th sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 
7th sublord, or to say as significator of houses 9 
& 10 to the X house, the IX house becomes a 
favourable house. Hence, the native could 
carry-out research in his profession and could 
gain reasonably in his professional life during the 
DBA periods of Moon, the 9th sublord while it is 
also in transit in the star of Mercury, the X sublord.

house. But in this example, the X sublord 
Mercury, because it is in Venus star, the 12th 
sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord 
and thus being a significator for houses 12 & 7, 
or to say houses 4 & 11 to the IX house, would 
force the native to face losses from unknown 
persons in his professional life and would 
educate himself out of his personal 
experience and make gains in his research 
activities during the DBA periods of Mercury, while 
it also transits in the star of Moon, the IX sublord. 


“Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 183 
XonX: 


As detailed in the paragraph for the 
potential of the X house, the X house when linked 
temporarily to the X house, by way of transit, 
would further weaken the professional life of the 
native; It would induce the native to make 
excessive investments and would make him 
incompetent to face his professional opponents.

house Jupiter is in the star and sub of Mercury, 
the cuspal sublord of houses 2, 4 & 10, or to say 
houses 5, 7 & 1 to the X house, it modifies into a

Mercury is in Venus star, the 12th sublord and in 
the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord and thus being 
a significator for houses 12 & 7, orto say houses

during the DBA periods of Mercury, while it 
transits in the star of Jupiter, the XI sublord. It 
would also bring litigations on properties and

While Jupiter and Mercury, the planets that 
happen to have a direct linkage with the X house,

It is humanly impossible to provide details 
for all these combinations. | would be thankful to 
people who could spend much of their time and 
efforts in compiling these classifications of 
approximately 40 million interlinks. Then alone 
we can single out or identify the profession of 
each and everyone of the 6000 millions of people 
who are presently living in our globe with the use 
of 40 million options. 


The questions which are generally asked 
by a person about profession can broadly be 
classified as follows: 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 194 
Category 1: 


a) Will be in service or business? 
b) Can lI attain financial, social or 
administrative status in my profession? 
Cc) Will | continue in the same profession? 
d) Will | face difficulties in my professional 
career? 
Catergory 2: 


a) Will | serve in Education Department, 
Health Department, Defence services, 
Communica tion department, 
Journalism, Information technology, 
Banking etc.,? 


b) Will | run my own manufacturing unit or 
will | remain as a trader only ? 


C) Will | be carrying out my profession as a 
commission agent? 


Questions of category | are related to the 
potential of the X cusp, i.e., they can be answered 
by studying the linkage of the X cuspal sublord 
with the other cusps. { Pl.refer PCI -pages 
159-164} 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” . 195 


i) Study of the sign, star and sub in which the 
starlord of the sublord of the X cusp is placed. 


ii) Study of the placement of the starlord of the 
X cusp as either the starlord or the sublord 
of other cusps. 


iii) Of course, we also need to study, especially 
for financial and other status, the potential of 
the Asc, Il house, the VI house or the VII 
house etc., 


Questions of category 2, can be answered 
by studying the linkage of other cusps with the X 
house and also the planets which are placed in 
the star or the sub of the X cuspal sublord. 


As studied in the earlier chapter for the 
"IX house’, educational qualifications would stand 
as means of professional opportunities only if the 
IV or the IX or the XI house is related to the X 
house. So, 75 % our present day population 
would not be doing jobs that are related to their 
educational qualifications. 


Only ifthe Asc or the X house is linked to 
the X house, then one could become a 
respectable person in his profession. (Just 17 % 
of the population) 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks” 196 


Only if the XI house is linked to the X 
house, then one could gain job satisfaction. (Only 
8.3 % of the population) 


One may not be running a Dasa that is 
related to the X Bhava. We need notjump into a 
hasty conclusion that the professional life of the 
person would remain in dark. Find out if there is 
a possibility of relief by studying with the use of 
subsublord or the starlord of the X cusp and its 
residents; It is enough if the Dasa remains 
somehow neutral to the X house to permit the 
respective bhukthies of planets that are 
favourable to the X house to provide success and 
much needed relief to the person. 


Eventhough the potential of the X house 
and the potential of the current Dasa and the 
subsequent Dasa are unfavourable to render 
professional success, we may opt for the the 
study of the 12th house for a possible relief. 
Whatever be it, as astrologers, we must always 
be good to give hopes and confidence to our 
clients as doctors would do to their patients. It is 
better not to reveal the truths of unfavourable 
potentials to our clients as | feel that it is our 
social responsibility to keep the spirit of our 
clients alive. Our wisdom is only a drop of ocean 
before the all pervasive Almighty.

Since the IX house is carrying a 
combination of 7 & 6 with it to act on the XI 
house, the native would face financial difficulties 
and would be urged to clear debts during the 
DBA periods of Moon, the IX sublord whenever 
it happens to transit in the star of Jupiter, the 
11th sublord.

9,12: Success in research works, Troubles in jobs 


XI house is favourable to the IX house. In 
this chart, the sublord of the XI house, since it 
carries 2, 4 & 10 with it, would induce the native 
to have illegal romantic affairs with persons who 
are already known to him during the DBA 
periods of Jupiter, the X! sublord, while it also 
happens to transit in the star of Moon, the sublord 
of the IX house. 

Xon Xl: 


X house is a house of negation to the XI 
house. in this example, the sublord of the X 
house, Mercury is in the star of Venus, the 
12th sublord and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th 
sublord. Houses 12 & 7 would respectively 
become houses 2 & 9 to the XI house to get 
modified into a neutral house. 


General principles of linkage of the X

Since the X house is carrying a 
combination of 12 & 7 with it to act on the Xl 
house, the native would face cordial relationships 
with his wife during the DBA periods of Mercury, 
the X sublord whenever it happens to transit in 
the star of Jupiter, the 171th sublord.

XI house is neutral to the X house. In this 
chart, the sublord of the XI house, since it 
carries 2, 4 & 10 with it, would lead to the 
failures in love affairs and would denote the 
illhealth of his children during the DBA periods 
of Jupiter, the XI sublord, while it also happens 
to transit in the star of Mercury, the X sublord. 


Xl on Xl: 


As discussed in the paragraph of 
"Potential of the XI house", the sublord of the 
Xl house Jupiter, whenever it happens to 
transit in its own star would enable the native to 
succeed in self efforts and make him to commit 
in the fields of lands, vehicles and properties etc,.

Since the XII house is carrying a 
combination of 9 & 12 with it to act on the XI 
house, the native would have a chance to 
increase his knowledge and wisdom and would 
get an involvement in research works and could 
find him amidst happiness and joy during the 
DBA periods of Venus, the XII sublord whenever 
it happens to transit in the star of Jupiter, the 
11th sublord.

Xl house is a house of negation to the XI 
house. But in this chart, Jupiter, the sublord of 
the XI house, since it carries 2, 4 & 10 with it, 
would induce the native to succeed in research 
works and to gain from profitable investments 
during the DBA periods of Jupiter, the XI sublord, 
while it also happens to transit in the star of 
Venus, the XII sublord.

The planets Sun and Saturn are in the sub 
of Jupiter, the 11th sublord. Hence Sun and 
Saturn are permanently tied with the XI house. 
So during their respective DBA periods they 
would act for the significations of the Xl 
house. The remaining 6 planets, during their 
respective DBA periods, though they are not 
linked to the XI house directly, at the time when 
they happen to transit in the star of Jupiter, the 
Xl sublord, would act on the XI house, 
accordingly.

XII house would be favourable to houses 
2,4,8,10 & 12 and would remain neutral to houses 
3,7 & 11. 12th house would be unfavourable to 
houses 1,5, 6 & 9. The same could be possible, 
when the sublord of the concerned cusps 
happen to remain in the star or the sub of the 
sublord of the XII house. In return, these houses 
would react on the XII house as per their 
significations cited above {Refer paragraph of 
reclassifications}. 


Houses 2, 4, 8, 10 & 12 would be 
favourable to the XII house, while houses 1, 5 & 
9 would remain neutral. However, houses 3, 6, 
7 & 11 would deny the significations of the XIl 
house. This could be possible when the sublord 
of the XII house happen to remain in the star or 
the sub of the sublord of the concerned cusps. 
In return, the XII house would register its mark 
on the concerned cusps, which are as follows: 


Xllon tl: = Secrecy in Life 
Xllon Il: Secret Money 
Allon lll: Secret Informations 


Xllon IV: Secret Properties

XIl on Vil: Secret Partner 

Xll on VIII: Secret Troubles, Dangers 

Xll on IX: Secret Journey 

Xll on X: Secret Profession 

Xll on Xl: Secret Satisfactions 


POTENTIAL OF THE XII HOUSE: 


In this example chart, the sublord of the 
XIl is Venus. It resides in the star of Moon, the 
9th sublord and in its own sub (12). Hence, 
potentially, the XII house is strong to itself in this 
chart. 


VENUS: Troubles and Expenses caused 
by Women, Research in the field of arts, Secret 
intrests etc 


SUN, MERCURY and KETU are the 
planets, which are in the star of Venus. 


SUN: Diseases in Bone, Government 
Loans, Subsidies, Heat-borne body, Litigations 


MERCURY: Clarity in Expression, Utility 
Instruments, Double-toned Voice 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 234 
KETU: Robbery and Theft, Subversive 
and Secret Plannings, Underground Acts etc,. 


While the significations of Venus remain 
permanent during the entire life-span of the 
native as far as to the significations of the 12th 
house is concerned, the significations of SUN, 
MERCURY & KETU would also come to the 
fore front during their respective DBA periods. 


Asc on XIl 


Asc is neutral to the XII house. But to draw 
specifications of this general rule to this example 
chart, we start studying the Asc sublord, Mars. It 
resides in the star of Sun, the 6th sublord and in 
the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. Houses 6 & 7 
would become houses 7 & 8, the opposing 
houses to the 12th house. 


The general principles of linkage of the 
Asc with the XIl house are as follows: 


12,1: Secret Activities with the use of Self- 
Prestige 

12,2: Secret Investments 

12,3: Secret Documents 

12,4: Secret Property 

12,5: Secret Gamblings 


"Applications ef Cuspai Interlinks” 235

12,9: Secret Illegal Affairs 

12,10: Secret Second Profession 

12,11: Happiness in Secret Activities 
12,12: Secret Worries, Secret Labour 


Hence, in this chart, the sublord of the Asc, 
Mars, whenever it happens to transit in the star 
of Venus, the 12th sublord, would lead to 
clear-off his debts by acquiring further loans 
during its DBA periods. 


XII on Asc: 


The significations of the 12th house while 
it happens to link with the Asc are, as follows: 


1,2: Money and Materials through Self-Efforts 

1,3: Living at a Far-off Place by leaving the 
native 

1,4: Profession in Lands, Vehicles and 
Properties at native place

1,9: Long Journeys, Research Education 

1,10: Branches of Ventures through Self Efforts 

1,11: Expenses or Investments on interested 
Fields 

1,12: Terrorism, Absconding from native, 


In this example chart, the 12th house, a 
house of negation to the Asc, through its sublord 
Venus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, during the 
DBA periods of Venus, when it also transits in 
the star of Mars, the sublord of the Asc would 
enable the native to take up long journeys or 
foreign travels. 

llon Xl 


Il house is favourable to the XII house. 
Mercury, the sublord of the II house in this chart, 
resides in the star of Venus, the sublord of the 
12th house and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th 
sublord. Houses 12 & 7 would become 1 & 8 to 
the 12th house to become an unfavourable

Hence, in this chart, the sublord of the II 
Mercury, as it carries 6 & 7 orto say 7 & 


8 to the 12th house, would draw the native to 
mortgage hisvaluables and jewels whenever it 
happens to transit in the star of Venus, the 12th 
sublord, during its DBA periods. 


"Applications of Cuspai interlinks” 238 
XII on OI:

2,12: Further Investments 


In this example chart, the 12th house, 
house of favour to the Il house, through its 
sublordVenus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, 
during the DBA periods of Venus, when it also 
transits in the star of Mercury, the Il sublord, would 
enable the native to get repayment of 
outstanding money or articles that were lent. 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 239 
Ill on Xl 


lll is an unfavourable house to the XIl 
house. But to draw specifications of this general 
rule to this example chart, we start studying the 
lil sublord. Mars, the sublord of the Ill house, 
resides in the star of Sun, the 6th sublord and in 
the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. Houses 6 & 7 
would become houses 7 & 8, the opposing 
houses to the 12th house. 


General principles of linkage of the Ill 
house with the XII house are as follows: 


12,1: Secret Oaths 

12,2: Capital Documents or Share Certificates 
12,3: Cheques, Certificates and Documents 
12,4: Receipt of Documents of Properties 
12,5: Learning Secret Arts

12,10: Second Profession - a Business Venture 
12,11: Return of Mortgaged Property

Hence, in this chart, the sublord of the III 
house, Mars, as it carries 6 & 7 with it, whenever 
it happens to transit in the star of Venus, the 12th 
sublord, would lead to loss of properties and 
holdings during its DBA periods.

The significations of the XII house while it 
happens to link with the Ill house are cited as 
follows: 


3,1: | Rejecting Information and

“Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 241 
3,12: Sale of Properties 


In this example chart, the 12th house, 
house of neutrality to the Ill house, through 
itssublord Venus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, 
during the DBA periods of Venus, when it also 
transits in the star of Mars, the sublord of the Ill 
house would enable the native to reach an 
accord to sell properties or liquidation of 
investments. 

IV on XIl 


IV house is a favourable house to the XIl 
house. Mercury, the sublord of the IV house in 
this chart, resides in the star of Venus, the sublord 
of the12th house and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th 
sublord. Houses 12 & 7 would become 1 & 8 to 
the 12th house to modify into an unfavourable 
house. 


General principles of linkage of the IV 
house with the XII house are as follows: 


12,1: Status and Respect through Investments 
in Properties 

12,2: Profits through Investments in Properties 

12,3: Disposal of Properties

12,12: Reinvestments in LVHPs 


Hence, in this chart, the sublord of the IV 
house, Mercury, as it carries 6 & 7 orto say 7 & 
8 to the 12th house, would enable the native 
tomake investments in properties, lands and 
household articles etc, whenever it happens to

during its' DBA periods.

to IV house, through Venus, carries 9 & 12 with 
it. Hence, during the DBA periods of Venus, when 
it also transits in the star of Mercury, the II sublord, 
would enable the native to make further 
investments in the properties that were 
purchased already. 


V on Xil 


V house is neutral to XII house. Jupiter, 
the sublord of the V house in this chart, resides 
in the star and sub of Mercury, the sublord of 
houses 2, 4 & 10. Houses 2, 4 & 10 would 
become 3, 5 & 11 to the 12th house to modify 
into a highly favourable house.

Hence, in this chart, the sublord of the VI 
house, Sun, as it carries 12,5 & 11 orto say 1,6 
& 12 to the 12th house, would enable the native 
to dispose the loans, to undertake medical 
treatments to get cured from diseases and would 
provide better service conditions whenever it 
happens to transit in the star of Venus, the 12th 
sublord, during its DBA periods. 


Xll on VI: 


The significations of the XII house while it 
happens to link with the VI house are, as 
follows: 


6,1 Medical Treatment 

6,2 Investments through Borrowings 

6,3 _ Loss of Properties for Loans 

6,4 Purchase of Properties through Loans 

6,5 Gamblings and Speculation with Loans 

6,6 Loans from Investments 

6,7 Medical Treatment to Wife by acquiring 
Loans 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 248 


6,8: Losses due to Excessive Loans 

6,9: Difficulties due to change in Profession 

6,10: Two different natures of Profession 

6,11: Hard labour in interested fields of 
Profession 


In this example chart, the 12th house, 
house of opposition to the VI house, through its 
sublord Venus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, 
during the DBA periods of Venus, when it also 
transits in the star of Sun, the VI sublord, would 
increase the loans of the native and the workload 
of the 2nd profession further to severing the 
diseases due to improper medical treatment. 


Vil on Xil 


VII house is a house of danger to the XIl 
house. Rahu, the sublord of the VII house in this 
chart, resides in its own star, but in the sub of 
Sun, the sublord of 6th cusp. Houses 7 & 6 would 
become 8 & 7 to the 12th house to remain as an 
unfavourable house. 


General principles of linkage of the VII 
house with the XII house are as follows: 


12,1: Secret Disturbances through Enemies 
12,2: Financial Assistance by Life/Business

Hence, in this chart, the sublord of the VII 
Rahu, as it carries 7 & 6 or to say 8 & 7 to 


the 12th house, would render difficulties from 
opposite sex, cause for disharmony in family life 
and would lead to health problems to wife 
whenever Rahu happens to transit in the star of 
Venus, the 12th sublord, during Rahu DBA 
periods. 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 250 
XIl on VII:

In this chart, the 12th house, a neutral 
house to the VIl house, through its sublord 
Venus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, during the 
DBA periods of Venus, when it also transits in 
the star of Rahu, the sublord of the VII house 
would trouble the course of the 2nd profession 
added to a favourable atmosphere to the 
partners or the other parties. 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 251 
Vill on XIl 


Vill house is a house of favour to the XII 
house. Saturn, the sublord of the VIII house in 
this chart, resides in the star of Mars, the sublord 
of houses 1 & 3 and in the sub of Jupiter, the 
sublord of houses 5 & 11. Houses 1, 3, 5 & 11 
would become 2, 4, 6 & 12 to the 12th house to 
become an unfavourable house. 


General principles of linkage of the VIII 
house with the XII house are as follows: 


12,1: Unexpected Threats 

12,2: Unexpected Investments 

12,3: Unexpectedly missing the Documents

Hence, in this chart, the sublord of the VIII 
house, Saturn, as it carries 1,3, 5 & 11 orto say 
2, 4,6 & 12 to the 12th house, would lead to 
change of residence, loss of properties and 
holdings whenever it happens to transit in the 
star of Venus, the 12th sublord, during the DBA 
periods of Saturn. 

XII on VIII 


The significations of the XII house while it

"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 253 


house of favour to the VIIl house, through its 
sublord Venus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, 
during the DBA periods of Venus, when it also 
transits in the star the of Saturn, the sublord of 
the VIII house would call for secret troubles and 
agony. 

IX on XIl 


IX house is a neutral house to the XIl 
house. Moon, the sublord of the IX house in this 
chart, resides in the star of Sun, the 6th sublord, 
and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. Houses 
9, 6 & 7 would become 10, 7 & 8 to the 12th 
house to become an unfavourable house. 


General principles of linkage of the IX 
house with the XII house are as follows: 


12,1: Status and Respect through Research 
Works 

12,2: Loss of money in Illegal Affairs 

12,3: Foreign Journeys 

12,4: Research Education

Hence, in this chart, the sublord of the IX 
house, Moon, as it carries 9,6& 7 or to say 10, 7 
& 8 to the 12th house, would lead to disharmony 
with wife caused by the illegal affairs of the 
native and would enable the native to succeed 
in his research efforts and long journeys 
whenever it happens to transit in the star of 
Venus, the 12th sublord, during its DBA periods. 


XIl on IX: 


The significations of the XII house while it

In this chart, the 12th house, an 
unfavourable house to the IX house, through its 
sublord Venus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, 
during the DBA periods of Venus, when it also 
transits in the star of Moon, the IX sublord would 
enable the native to discover hidden things of 
life and to undertake long journeys. 


Xon XIil 


X house is a favourable house to the XIl 
house. Mercury, the sublord of the X house in 
this chart, resides in the star of Venus, the sublord 
of the 12th house and in the sub of Rahu, the 
7th sublord. Houses 12 & 7 would become 1 & 8 
to the 12th house to modify into an unfavourable 
house. 


General principles of linkage of the X

Mercury, as itcarries 12 & 7orto say 1 & 


8 to the 12th house, would force the native to 
incur losses by way of initiating a second 
profession whenever it happens to transit in the

In.this chart, the 12th house, a house of 
favour to the X house, through its sublord 
Venus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, during the 
DBA periods of Venus, when it also transits in 
the star of Mercury, the sublord of the X house 
would enable the native to to suffer through 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 258 
financial hurdles in his second line of business. 


XI on XII 


X! house is a house of negation to the XI 
house. Jupiter, the XI sublord in this chart, 
resides in the star and sub of Mercury, the sublord 
of houses 2, 4 & 10. Houses 2, 4 & 10 would 
become 3, 5 & 11 to the 12th, to modify into a 
totally favourable house. 


General principles of linkage of the Xl 
house with the XII house are as follows: 


12,1: Status and Respect earned as desired, 
through Secret Activities 

12,2: Profits in Investments as Planned 

12,3: Breach of Agreements as Planned

Hence, in this chart, the XI sublord 
Jupiter as it carries 2, 4 & 10 orto say 3, 5 & 11 
to the 12th house, would enable the native to get 
good returns from the investments made 
whenever it happens to transit in the star of 
Venus, the 12th sublord, during the DBA periods 
of Jupiter.

11,12: Secret Investments 


In this example chart, the 12th house, a 
neutral house to the XI house, through its sublord 
Venus, carries 9 & 12 with it. Hence, during the 
DBA periods of Venus, when it also transits in 
the star of Jupiter, the sublord of the XI house 
would render troubles to the first profession by 
way of the process of installation of the 2nd 
profession. 

Xll on Xl 


As discussed in the para of "Potential of 
the XII house", the XII sublord Venus is very 
strong to itself to assure the prospects of the 
second profession alongwith increased 
investments and expenditures during its DBA 
periods at the time when it also transits in its own 
Star.

Venus is the cuspal sublord of the 12th 
house. The planets Sun, Mercury and Ketu are 
in the star of Venus; Hence these planets are 
directly linked tothe 12th house and they, in some 
or the other way would act for the significations 
of the 12th house whereas the remaining 5 
planets, during their respective DBA 
periods, would also actforthe 12th house, when 
they happen io transit in the star of Venus, the

DBAS & TRANSIT 


We have come to the last chapter of 
PART-I of "Applications of Cuspai Interlinks". So 
far we have studied the applications of cuspai 
interlinks with its three dimensions, such as the 
Natal Potential, the Dasa Potential and the 
Transit. These three are the inseparable 
components of a Triangle to render results. 


A: In every chapter, the Paragraph of 
"Potential of ...House" has detailed the natal 
strength of that house. 

For example: 


ASC : MAR (6 &7 to ASC) : Weak 


ll: MER (11 &6toll) : Average 
Il: MAR (4&5 to Ill) : Strong 
IV MER (9 &4 to IV) : Average 
V JUP (10,12, 6 to V) : Weak 
Vi SUN (7,12 & 6 to VI) : Weak 
Vil RAH (1 & 12 to Vil) : Weak 
VIN =SAT = (6,8,10& 4 to VIM) : Weak 
IX MOO (10& 11 to Ix) : Strong 
Xx MER (3 & 10 to X) : Average 


Xl JUP (4,6&12toXl)  : Weak 
XII VEN (10 &1 to XIl) : Strong 


Oe 


"Applications of Cuspai_Interlinks” 263 


Only Houses 3, 9 & 12 are Strong. 
Houses 2, 4 & 10 are Neutral (Average) 


Houses 1, 5, 6, 7,8 &11 are Weak. 


B:In Planetary significations we have 
studied the strength of each planet to that 
particular house as per the following table.

C: Every planet always transits in a star 
and a sub. The said planet through its starlord 
and the sublord obtains linkage to the houses of 
significations of the concerned starlord and the 
sublord. Please remember that the starlord 
shows the involvement and the sublord shows 
the result. 


For example, Sun as the 6th sublord 
(12,5,11) in this chart, if it transits in the stars of 


KET 2_ : Eamed income 

VEN 12_ : Investments through borrowings 

SUN 6 :; Loans 

MOO 9 © : Financial crisis arising out of 
excessive borrowings 

MAR 1,3 : Diseases 

RAH 7 _ : Disputes with wife 

JUP 5,11: Assistance from friends and 
agreements 

SAT 8 _ : Increase in loans and diseases 

MER:2,4 &10: Professional success 


These are only the trend and the involve- 
ment but the actuals are rendered only by the 
sublords.

and it would go on upto the Venus-Ketu. 
With its significations of 6, 12, 5 & 11 while in 
Ketu star, Venus sub acts on 2 & 12 to mean the 
native making reinvestments by acquiring loans. 
However, Sun, during its transit in the star of Ketu, 
would restrict and confine its involvement only to 
the Il house. If the native is not running the DBAS 
periods of Sun then we need not bother about 
the transit of Sun at all. 


However, there may arise a situation when 
we would have to concern about the transit of 
Sun for predicting the lesser important events of 
life, i.e., during Sun star days. 


Also that Moon, during the course of its 
transit in the stars of the remaining 8 planets other 
than that of Sun, would transit in Sun bhukti, 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 267 


i.e., almost once in every day. Moon would 
transit in Sun antara for 9 times ( approximately 
for not more than 12 minutes) in a star day and 
in Sun sookshma for 81 times (approximately for 
not more than 2 minutes) in a starday. It is more 
than enough for the planet Sun, to cater through 
these 81 opportunities to register its role as the 
6th cuspai sublord in the daily life of the native, 
by influencing on his food habits, dressing sense, 
receiving assistance from friends, petty 
differences with his wife etc., 


This is how all the 9 planets act on the 
daily life of a person through the transit of Moon 
in their respective star and sub.

"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 269 

Thus, all the 9 planets as agents of the 
42 Bhavas act at every moment of our life. Or in 
other words, every small event of life would come 
to stage only when all the 9 planets combinedly 
act for the same. 


Since "PART I” has been conceived as a 
book of general study, we have not discussed 
much about the noteworthy events of life, such 
as date of marriage, child birth, death of a 
parent, major accidents, professional success etc 
of the native through this example chart. Of 
course, | hope that the readers would also 
understand the fact that these things could not 
be meaningfully explained with only one example 
chart. Hence, with your co-operation, | would like 
to reserve my explanations about these details 
for PART Il of this book, "Applications of Cuspai 
Interlinks - Specific studies" with various example 
charts. 


However, let us analyze this chart in a 
different angle. We have so far studied this 
horoscope from "IN to OUT" method, i.e., from 
natal potential we have derived the predicitions 
for all the DBAS periods. We can also study this 
horoscope from the other way too, i.e., "OUT to 
IN", from the current DBAS to predictions. 


For example, on 01.01.2002, at about 7 


“Applications of Cuspai_Interlinks” 270 
am, the native would be running 


1. RAH DASA 

2. MOO BHUKTHI 

3. VEN ANTARA 

4. JUP SOOKSHMA 


DASA: 


Dasa lord Rahu is the sublord of the 7th 
housé and transits in its own star and in the sub 
of Sun. By being the cuspai sublord, the Dasalord 
Rahu would Signify the matters of the 7th house 
and would drive the native to commit and involve 
in the significations of the 7th house. But due to 
its residence in the sub of Sun, the sublord of 
the 6th house, being the 12th to the 7th, these 
involvements would face hurdles and difficulties: 


Does it mean that, the Dasalord would 
always be troubling the native? Here comes the 
answer from TRANSIT. 


DL-Rahu: 02 D 28 Min Gemini: MAR star 
(1,3), KET sub (2). 


Rahu, the 7th sublord, as a carrier of 7 & 
6 with it always, is at present transiting in the 
star of Mars, 1 & 3 and in the sub of Ketu, the 
resident in || Bhava. 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 271 


There would be communication problems 
between husband and wife, as signified by the 
Dasalord. 

BHUKTHI: 


Bhukthi lord is Moon, the sublord of the 
9th house and is in the star of Sun, the 6th sublord 
and in the sub of Rahu, the 7th sublord. 


Bhukthi lord, by being the 9th sublord, a 
favourable house to the 7th house, which is 
being strongly signified by the Dasalord, favours 
and stands in accordance with the Dasalord for 
a collective execution of involvements in the 7th 
house matters. Since Moon resides in the star of 
Sun, the 6th sublord, it is also going to trouble 
like Rahu to the 7th house matters. The sublord 
of Moon is Rahu, the 7th sublord. Here 7th 
becomes the II house to the 6th to strengthen 
the 6th house matters. 


These results are common for 18 months. 
But drawing this general nature to specify events 
of a day, we have to study the transit of the 
Bhukthi lord, Moon. it transits in PUSHYA & 
ASHLESHA stars, the stars of Saturn and 
Mercury on 01.01.2002. Saturn denotes the 8th 
house. 8th house is favourable to 6th house to 
favour the natural potential of the planet Moon. 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 272 

Since the 9th sublord Moon transits in the 
star of 8th sublord, he is destined to face 
disagreements with others. 


ANTARA: 


Venus is the Antara lord. It is the 12th 
sublord and resides in the star of the 9th sublord. 
Hence houses 9 & 12 would be operated during 
Venus Antaras. Houses 9 & 12 become houses 
4 & 7 to the 6th house, the combined 
signification of the Rahu Dasa & the Moon 
Bhukthi. So the Antara would try to put a break 
on the combined effects of the DB lords. 


Venus Antara would run for about 3 
months in Rahu Dasa, Moon Bhukthi. During 
these 90 days, Venus would nearly transit in 6 to 
7 stars. On 01.01.2002, the planet Venus is in 
13 D 21 M in SAGITTARIUS. It is very strong 
with its natal natures, as it is in its own star and 
sub. Hence the planet Venus would reflect its 
natural and natal strength for the native in secret 
and illegal involvements. 


SOOKSHMA: 
Jupiter is the sookshma lord. It is the 


sublord of houses 5 & 11. Houses 5 & 11 would 
become 12 & 6 to the 6th house, the 


“Applications of Cuspai I nterlinks "273 


signification of the DB lords; Houses 5 & 11 would 
become 9 & 3 to the 9th house, the 
signification of the Antara Lord. Hence Jupiter 
tends to be on the side of Venus , the AL. Jupiter 
sookshma would last for 12 days in Venus Antara. 
On 1.1.2002, the planet Jupiter is in 16D 47 M in 
GEMINI, to stay in Rahu star, Venus sub. Jupiter 
is in the star of DL and in the sub of AL. Sub is 
stronger than the star and hence Jupiter would 
stick to its standings with Venus. 


DL Rahu & BL Moon are on the one side 
and AL Venus & SL Jupiter are on the other side 
to the 6th house significations. 


Sookshma forces the native to suffer with 
disharmony in his family life. 


STAR DAY: 


Let us put aside for sometime the fact that 
Moon is the Bhukthi lord. In the series of DBAS 
periods, stardays are the minute parts. Here on 
01.01.2002, Moon transits in Saturn star from the 
early morning and enters into Mercury star at 
around 9 pm. So the whole day is in the control 
of Saturn. 


274 
DASALORD of the DAY: 


Saturn is the cuspai sublord of the 8th 
house and it always carries 1, 3, 5 & 11 with it. 


Saturn, is in the star of Moon (9) and in 
the sub of Jupiter (5 & 11) would enable the 
native to gain new acquaintances. 


BHUKTHI LORDs: 


KET signifies Il house upto 06.57 am 


VEN al 10.37 
SUN Vl 11.43 
MOO IX 01.33 pm 
MAR I, tll 02.50 
RAH vil 06.08 
JUP V, XI 09.04 pm 


During these periods the general trend 
would be according to their natural significations, 
provided their current transits also favour their 


natal natures. Let us see about the transits on 
01.01.2002 at 0700 Hrs: 


Star Sub 
KET isin KET VEN (2812) - Strong 
VEN isin VEN VEN _ (12*) - Strong 


SUN isin VEN MOO (12&9)  -Weak 
MOO isin SAT VEN (8&12) -Weak 
MAR isin JUP SAT (5, 11 &8) -Weak 
RAH isin MAR KET (1,3&2) -Weak 
JUP isin RAH VEN (9&12) — -Neutral 


Transit-wise, Venus is the strongest 
planet. Events that happen during Venus bhukthi, 
that is from 6.57 to 10.37 am are the events to 
mark in the diary of the native's life for 
01.01.2002. 


Thus we can also extend our study to the 
ANTARAS of the DAY and to the SOOKSHMAS 
of the day. 


LAGNAS ({ Ascendants ) : 


The earth revolves about itself once a day 
to mean that there would arise all the twelve signs 
as ascendanis of each day. These ascendants 
also denote a point or two in Out life. 


In this example chart 


Vrischiga/Scorpio is the... Ascendant sign 
Dhanus/Sagittarius.......... Il 
Makara/Capricorn ........ Ill 
Kumbha/Aquarius........... IV 


Meena/Pisces................. V 


Mesha/Aries................0... VI 
Rishabha/Taurus............. Vil 
Mithuna/Gemini.............. VII 
Kataka/Cancer................ IX 
Simha/Leo.................... X 
KanniNVirgo..............0...... Xl 
Thula/Libra.....0...00..000000... Xil 


For the matters of the daily routine, the 
sign, that is rising as Ascendant in the east would 
denote the significations of that concerned 
Bhava. If the planet Moon coincides with the 
series of lords of the Ascendant, then the event 
matures into a reality. 


CONCLUSION 
About PART II: 


Part Il of the "Applications of Cuspai 
interlinks" would contain the study of different 
charts for a single question. For example we may 
have to study the prospects of marriage, 
married life and children or the prospects of 
employment opportunities and professional 
success etc., As you know, these are not easy 
questions to answer. For these questions, only 
when we .become familiar with a set of 
horoscopes, we can easily formulate a uniform 


"Applications of Cuspai_Interlinks” 277 
methodology of applications of Cuspai Interlinks. 


About PART Ill: 


In my early days of astrological studies, |! 
was more interested in the study of smaller 
events oi life and the daily routines. There are 
more than a few hundred questions before us 
for the study of our day-to-day life. 


1. Willthe person turn-up ? 

2. Could I meet her ? 

3. Could | get loans ? 

4, When will the expected person return back ? 
5. Will | receive the expected message ? 

6. When will | catch ihe bus ? 

7. When will | reach the destination ? 

8. Will | get my lunch in time ? 

9. When could | finish the work? 

10. When will | receive the payment? and so on. 


As you know, ihese things could be 
studied by the Natal Chart also. But drawing a 
specification by narrowing down the DBAS 
periods, and study of the Star of the Day and 
Bhukthies, antaras, sookshmas and the 
corresponding sign, star and sub of the 
Ascendant, is laborious and time-consuming. For 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 278 


these cases of daily routines, we may opt for the 
study of horary charts. In Part Ill, ! have opted to 
detail the study of the horary charts alone. 


Points to ponder: 


The Principles of Zodiac or Kalachakra 
gain an importance in denoting the style of an 
event. The planets and kalachakra unitedly 
determine the various types and kinds of 
persons and events whom the native happens 
to meet in a single day. From this example chart, 
on 1.1.2002, since it is a Saturn star day, 1, 3, 5 
& 11 would be in operation for him. It means 
that the matters such as communication, 
happiness, short journeys, mutual agreements 
and harmony are due to happen. Whaat kind of 
joy and with what kind of persons would also be 
determined by the corresponding Ascendant and 
the sign TAURUS, the sign in which 
Saturn, the starlord of the day of transit of Moon 
is positioned. 


Presume that the the native is a small 
vendor. If so, why should a person who has 
travelled more than a thousand kilometres across 
the country happen to meet him to buy a packet 
of cigarettes? Why should a retired officer of 
ITS cadre and a famous astrologer of our times 
converse through telephone at a particular time? 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 279 
Why at all do we receive wrong calls sometimes? 


It is due to the rise and fall of not only the 
12 signs, but also due to all the 27 stars and 243 
“Kaalamsaas” or subs in a single day. Every sign 
or star or sub has its own style. These factors 
should also be taken into account for accurately 
pinpointing the details of an event. 


The native lives with his wife for nearly 
three quarters of his life; The native gains a few 
friends and maintains their friendship for more 
than half of his life period. The native enters into 
a successful business agreement with a partner 
for a few years. The native establishes a 
business contact with a person for a few months. 
The native enjoys the company of a person for a 
few days. The native co-travels occassionally with 
an outstanding personality or a VIP for a 
duration of a few minutes. The native buys a pair 
of bananas from a street vendor within a few 
seconds. The native meets with a pedestrian, in 
accidents for a few micro-seconds. All these 
persons and the personalities are generally 
denoted by the VII Bhava. How to distinguish or 
to differentiate each one with the other? 


Vil Bhava - Permanent and legal ties 
IX Bhava - Illegal ties with unknown persons 
X| Bhava - Persons who come to share the 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 280 


joy of the moment 
Ill Bhava - Persons as commercial contacts 
IV Bhava - Artistes and others 


i} Persons, who had their birth in the stars 
of the 7th cuspai point establish permanency in 
relations. For example, in this chart, the 7th house 
is "VEN-MOO-RAH-MER". Mercury borns and 
Rahu borns would prolong their relations with this 
native for a longer period. 


ii) The native is currently running Rahu 
dasa. Persons born in Rahu star would sail along 
with the native for almost during this Rahu dasa. 


iii) Persons born in Moon star would come, 
meet and may live with the native till the end of 
this current bhukthi period. 


iv) Current Antara is that of Venus. The 
native would meet the Venus borns, of course to 
stand as means for the wasteful expenditures of 
the native (12). 


v) Current Sookshma lord is Jupiter and 
the Jupiter borns would also be met by the 


native. 


vi) Current starday(01.01.2002) is Saturn. 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” 281 


People born in Saturn star or of lower strata would 
be met by the native on 01.01.2002. 


vii) Between 10.30 am to 11.40 am on 
01.01.2002, the native would meet with persons 
born in Sun stars, or with civil servants or 
orthopaedicians etc. 


Why do these persons carry a chance to 
meet with the native? Because they would also 
be running their own respective and matching 
DBAS. 


Imagine that the native travels in a bus 
and he occupies the middle seat of a three seater. 
The person who sits on his right side is denoted 
by the Il house. That is why in Hindu marriages 
wife is asked to stand or sit on the right side of 
the husband. The person who sits on his left side 
is denoted by the XII house. The person who is 
sitting on the left side leaves his seat and finds a 
better seat in the bus after a few minutes. It is 
so, because the sub, the star and the sign of the 
Asc have moved in this duration. 


The co-author and the driving force of this 
book, Shri S.P.Khullar, |.1.S., used to ask this 
author to attempt to detail the astrological mode 
of distinction between the younger brother and 
the father-in-law as both fall in the category of 


"Applications of Cuspal Interlinks" 282 
the Itl house, between the wife and the second 
child (VII house), between the second wife and 
the third child or the grandchild (iX house), etc., 


It is not generally advisable to study the 
details of these relatives with the use of the 
horoscope of a person under study. Readers 
would have noticed that in all the preceding 
chapters, we had never attempted to make 
separate predictions for anybody other than the 
native himself. For example, even in the chapter 
for the VII house, we have only discussed the 
prospects and problems to be experienced only 
by the native, rendered by the wife, the partner 
or the society. 


But, as a part of our study of astrological 
concepts and cuspai interlinks, | know that, | have 
an obligation to share some of my experiences 
and views, though they are subject to certain 
limitations. 


All the social relationships of a person 
could be classified into two catagories : 


1. Relationship of the Asc, as acquired 
directly by the native: Father, Mother, Brothers 
and Sisters, Sons, Daughters and Wife or Wives. 
These relationships, are denoted by Asc and the 
respective houses. 


"Applications of Cuspai Interlinks” = 283 


2. Second tier of relationships such as 
in-laws, are acquired relationships through the 
prime tier of relatives. For example, Father- 
in-law is a relationship acquired through wife that 
is the 7th house. While 1 & 3 are in operation, it 
stands for younger brother. While 7 & 3 are in 
operation, it denotes about his father-in law. 1 & 
9 denotes either father or the second wife while 
5 & 9 denotes the grandson. 


Now even in the prime-tier of relationships, 
the 7th house denotes wife and the second child. 
Many people live with their second child even 
after the death of their wives. In our modern times 
quite a few people abort the second pregnancy 
and live happily with their wives and first child. 
How could it be? When the Dasa denotes 1 & 7 
and a set of unfavourable results to 1 & 7, then it 
is due to wife. When the DASA denotes 1,5 & 7 
and a set of unfavourable results, it is due to the 
second child. Ifit is 1,3 then it is younger brother. 
Ifit is 1,3 & 5, then it is second younger brother. 
Ifitis 1 & 5 itis the first child. Ifit is 3, 5 & 11, 
then it is wife of the second younger brother. 
When itis 5 & 11, it is first daughter-in-law. When 
itis 7 & 5, it is elder brother in law. 4 & 6 denote 
aunty while 7 & 10 denotes mother-in-law. 9 & 
11 denotes sister of the father while 5 & 11 
denotes the second grandchild. 


These complexities could better be 
handled with the use of current DBAS and 
transit and not with the Natal potentials; Of 
course, astrologers of the 21 st century would not 
find these kinds of troubles in the coming future 
as the Indian joint family system is slowly made 
to wither by small and compact family norms. 


| would once again like to remind the 
readers that I have only multiplied the scope of 
distinctions of events with the use of cuspai 
interlinks and | am aware that nothing is 
complete in itself. | would like to advocate the 
readers to confine the use of principles of cuspai 
interlinks aS a means and a way to proceed 
further in a scientific and rational direction.
