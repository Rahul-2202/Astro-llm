GOCHAR PHALADEEP1KA 

Torch on Transit of Planets 



Dr. U.S. Pulippani 

(Sundara Varada Chary) 



FOREWORD 

I write this Foreword at a time when there appears a grow- 
ing awareness, acceptability and belief in Hindu Jyotish. This has 
been further stimulated primarily by Astrological Magazine and 
books of Dr. B,V. Raman; secondly, by the weekend classes run by 
numerous Chapters of Indian Council of Astrological Sciences, now 
over 18, and thirdly, by the computerised horoscopes. 

The highly educated students and lovers of astrology, no 
doubt, are influenced by "Chamatkaars" of astrology but they are 
also keen to know the niceties, nuances and rationale behind these 
"Chamatkaars". Correct astrological predictions falling in the cat- 
egory of "Chamatkaars" are based on correct astrological data pa- 
tiently verified by the learned astrologer, his deep knowledge of 
the subject, his "Vaaksiddhi" and " Vaakshuddhi". In order to know 
the niceties and nuances and rationale behind such "Chamatkaars" 
one has to study Parashar Horashastra, Sarwarth Chintamani, 
Uttarkalamxit and some good books on transit. 

1 myself was in search of agood book to appreciate the impact 
of planetary transits, its impact on various Parashari and Jaimini 
dasas. I read articles of Sh .U.S. Pulippani in the Astrological Maga- 
zine on transits of Jupiter and Saturn. The first reading created a 
vivid interest and the second reading prompted me to get the 
articles photo-copied for circulation to students in my lecture on 
"Planetary Transits" in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, New Delhi way 
back in 1989. When Sh. U.S. Pulippani met me for the first time I 
requested him that he should write an appropriate book covering 
all the principles given in Phal Deepika and other astrological 
literature specifically in Tamil, relating to transit in corelation with 
dasa. The reason was Paryaya (cycle) of Jupiter and Saturn in 
addition to Moortinimaya, transit through "Nakshatras" and other 
usual and known features of planetary transits. What is Paryaya? 
One cycle of transit of Jupiter or Saturn is one Paryaya (cycle). The 



vi'ii/Forcword 

planets do not give similar transitory results in all ages, for you 
could not expect a person to marry when he is of two years of age 
or when above 85 or 90 years of age. Results arc thus bound to 
vary. For this reason the Paryayas (cycles) introduced a nicety in 
the transit results. These Paryayas (cycles) of transit of Jupiter, 
Saturn, Rahu andKetu make a world of difference in different ages. 

Every Astrologer knows that transit of Sun is bad in first, sec- 
ond, fourth, fifth, eighth and nineth from the natal Moon. "Which 
is the worst transit of the Sun out of the aforesaid houses? "has not 
been clearly stated in the books on transit. But the author on the 
authority of a Tamil text, informs the reader that transit of the Sun 
in the fifth house may be the worst. 

Nor such books clarify, what shall be the effect of transits on 
eclipse points in lagna or in other houses and how their adverse 
impacts would be moderated oraggravated by the aspect of bencfic 
or molafic transitory aspects. 

This book "TORCH ON TRANSIT" is the third book of Sh. 
U.S. Pulippani. He has already written two unusual books on 
"Panchpakshi" relating to "Prashna Shasta" and "ICHING", the 
Chinese 'Ramala Shastra". The learned author in this book has 
taken into consideration following niceties and nuances of 
planetary transits: 

(i) Paryayas of Saturn and Jupiter for laying emphasis on the 
age of "Patra" out of Dcsh Koal and Patra; 

(ii) Shukla and Krishna Paksha-wise, Gocharphal culled out Sum 
Tamil text "SUNDARANANDAR JODHIKA KAV1YAM" 

(iii) Effects of retrogression of planets; 

(iv) Effects of "Purolattas" and "Prusthalatta"; 

(v) Table of Tripataka Chakra to identify three planets who rule 
each year in the life cycle of 108 years. 

(vi) Identification of the worst transits; and 

(vii) Modification of worst "Dasa Phal" and "Dina Phol" results 
by the counter-balancing effects of planetary transit. 

The learned author has also illustrated the principles 
mentioned in the book by giving illustrations. 

I am happy to hear from Sh. U.S. Pulippani that in next edition 



Foreword I ix 

he will also include "Sarvatobhadra Chakra" and other Chakras 
which may throw more light on planetary transits and their impact 
on individuals. 

This book is meant for "Guna Grahnk' lovers and students of 
astrology as well as learned Aacharys in Hindu Jyotish and all 
will benefit and feel obliged to Sh. U.S. Pulippani for this work 
focussing on fine points of planetary transits and thus, providing 
a precision instrument in the hands of astrology lovers.

PREFACE 

As heavenly will would have it, I am prompted to produce 
this book 'TORCH ON TRANSIT" (GOCHARA PHALDEEPIKA) 
for the benefit of students of Astrology as well as others who are 
in the line. I have been contributing articles on "Transit of Jupiter", 
and 'Transit of Saturn" in the Astrological Magazine since 1980. 
Astrological Magtizinepublishcs my articles whenever Jupiter and 
Saturn enter new signs of Zodiac. As it occurred to mc, I had 
established specific pattern on transit result through various tables 
quantifying both separate and cumulative quantum of transit re- 
sults for Jupiter and Saturn. This includes conventional and special 
aspects of results of transit of main planets, received wide 
recognition among the readers of the Astrological Magazine. More 
or less this is considered as a standardised way of knowing transit 
results which included, among other things, Moorthi Nirnaya, 
Stellar Occupational Effects of Planets, Cyclic Effects of Jupiter (first 
time introduced to the English readers by me). Various ways of 
delineation of SadeSathiSani, Afdashtma, Asthma Sanictc including 
vedha and Vipareetha Vedha places forplanets etc. 

For the first time I have also introduced to the English readers 
the Transit results of planets separately for Shukla Paksha and 
Krushna Paksha which is not found any where in Sanskrit Texts 
except in one of the ancient Tamil Text "SUNDARANANDAR 
JODHIKA KAVIYAM" and in the present new book of mine (in 
English). 

After ten years of my articles of transit of Jupiter and Saturn 
having been popularised among the readers by providential force, 
I have drawn into the Indian Council of Astrological Sciences as 
National Secretary in April 1990. A month later I went to Badri 
Nath and met Justice S.N. Kapoor who surprised me by saying 
that he took Xerox copies of my articles and distributed them 
among the students of Astrology in his Lecture on 'Transit of 



xu / Preface 

Planets", since there was no such informative literature on the 
subject in English though many books were available. Since then, 
he has been persuading me to write a book un "Transit of Planets" 
(running to about three hundred pages)? 

Last time when I was in Delhi, Shri M.N. Kedar, another friend 
of mine, who is National Vice President of ICAS, and one of the 
prominent men who established ICAS, requested me to translate 
my Tamil book to English or at least compile all my articles on 
Jupiter and Saturn published so far. But this Second proposal will 
not give full picture of transits and, hence, 1 thought it is the right 
time to produce this independent book on "Transit" which is the 
English form of my original Tamil version, which I have now 
completed. This version includes among other things all basic 
principles of Astrology including features of Lagna, bad and good. 
Planets of each Lagna, difference between Badaka and Maraka, 
scientific way of delineation of Dasa bhukthis, formula for deciding 
longevity approximately etc. I think that this will also serve as a 
standard textbook especially for the student of Astrology on the 
subject "Transit." It is to be noted that transit results for Shukla 
and Krishna Paksha for each planet is given for the first time on 
Transit subject. 

After early five decades of learning in the field of Astrology I 
am convinced that: 

1. The permanent features of various aspects of life are reflected 
in the Natal Chart of an individual. 

2. These features are distributed by Dasa Bhukthis and Transit 
results both of which are based on Natal Moon signs (The 
former on the birth Star and the later on Moon sign). 

3. In a way, the present trend of life of an individual indicated 
by the Natal Chart is projected by Dasa Bhukthi results, but, 
through the window of transit results which modify final 
pattern of trend of life enjoyed by the native from time to 
time. 

4. Hence Transit results is the final focus point on which 
prediction is to be based, of course, with the background of 
basic horoscopes and Dasa Bhukthi. 



Preface f xiii 

All the above contemplations have gone in shaping this book. 

Now 1 remember with great regard and reverence Dr. B.V. 
Raman, the legend, stalwart on Astrology, founders, National 
President of ICAS, who is. also my Manasik Guru. His "Hindu 
Predictive Astrology 1 ' was the starting point of my learning in 
Astrology and remains even now my guiding star, since it includes 
all features. 

Next 1 thank Sri K. Jagannathan, my wife's cousine who cor- 
rected the technical part of the book, and who initiated me into 
the science of Astrology. 

Next 1 thank Shri A.V. Sundaram, my Joint Secretary who 
was instrumental to drag me into ICAS. He still remains to be a 
safety valve for my sensitive pattern of nature and guides me now 
and then. 

Last but not the least, 1 want to thnnk Shri S.N. Kapoor, who 
is one of my well wishers and who gave me inspiration and 
Foreword of this book providing a nutshell review. 

1 have to thank specially Shri MJ>L Kedar who is one of my 
dearest friends and well wishers who has arranged for publication 
of this book through Alpha Publication. 

1 remember with respect and honour my spiritual guru who 
is also my Guru in Astrology, Shri Kupusamy Achari, who 
imparted me details of special features in branches of Astrology 
available in Tamil texts.

PREFACE TO THRID EDITION 

Quite sometime back when. I first read earlier edition of this 
book, the contents of the book looked quite impressive. The treatise 
not only contains well known principles of Astrology and transit 
of planets but also the wisdom and experience of thinkers of 
Astrology from south not available to English readers. The reaction 
then was that the book could be revised to make it lucid and 
concise. 

The third edition of "Gochar Phaladcepika" has been 
thoroughly revised keeping soul of the original intact. The text 
has been rewritten at places, the material has been rearranged and 
some information has been presented in tabular from. It is hoped 
that this book in its present from will be linked by learned readers.

Chapter One 



GENERAL 



The point of the zodiac rising at the eastern Horizon when a 
man is born, is called Lagna or Ascendant. The position of the 
planets incorporated in relation to this point in various Zodiacal 
signs is generally called as 'Jathaka' or horoscope. While the Lagna 
can be considered as 'soul', the Rasi occupied by Moon can be 
understood as body. Moon sign of the chart is generally called as 
Janma Rasi (Chandra Rasi and the birth star is called 'Janma 
Nakshatra'). The day-to-day effects caused by transitory motion of 
the planets with reference to Janma Rasi and Janma Nakshahatra is 
called 'Gochara Phala' or transit results of planets. The results are 
also co-related to 12 Bhavas in relation to Janma Rasi for day-to- 
day life trends. Since the commencement of actual life is denoted 
by Lagna, it is called Soul. But the planets travel each of the 12 
Rasis and 27 stars and produce effects in relation to Lagna and Janma 
Rasi. The permanent position of planets at the time of birth in 
relation to Lagna signifies the strength and inherent features of 
various aspects of life that are in store for native. This cannot be 
changed. But the effects produced thereafter in relation to Janma 
Rasi by the planetary positions at various times in day-to-day affairs 
of life is called Gochara, which keeps on changing every moment. 

Both while dealing with the permanent features of Horoscope 
and the effect of planets for day-to-day affairs, the 12 Bhavas, 
reckoned from lagna for the former and from Janma Rasi in 
reference to the latter give the result of various aspects of life. 

We have to note a significant difference between planet and 
stars. Planets are bodies in constant motion having definite cycles 
of time during which these appear to revolve through the Zodiac. 
But stars are fixed, which emit a particular pattern of cosmic rays 



2 GodurPhaLidcqpika 

from their permanent positions. The cumulative cyclic effect of 
movement of planets over that of Rasis and the Nakshatras (fixed 
Stars) produce the change in day-to-day affairs, fn a way we can 
conclude that the effect of planets on human life can be judged in 3 

ways. 

1) The permanent features of the chart with reference 
to lagna indicates the individual's permanent features of life. 

2) The result of directional effect of planets based on 
the birth stars or Janma Nakshatra, from the time of birth 
throughout the life in succession, is termed as 'Dasha Bukthi' which 
distributes the promise in the horoscope during the periods of 
'Dasha Bukthi 1 of planets. It is to be seen that while calculation of 
Dasha Bukhti is from one's Janma Nakshatra Gochara Phala is 
related to the Natal sign of Moon's or Janma Rasi in the chart. Thus 
both are reckoned from Moon's position. Hence Moon's position is 
given prime importance in Gochara Phala or transit. The result of 
Dasha Bukthi and Gochara or Transit have to be weighed and given 
proper importance in deciding the results of the trend of the life 
during particular period. 

Any action of a human being is prompted by the mind. The 
Moon represents mind. As Such, this is the prime reason for 
considering Moon sign for Gochara result. The Dasha Bukthi result, 
in fact can be called as Directional Astrology in Vedic Astrology. 
The directional astrology in the West considers the imagined 
planetary positions in progression in relation to radical point of 
planets, ascendants etc. This cannot be termed as more scientific 
since there is no Dasha Bukthi system in the western astrology. 
Directional astrology of Hindus is unique since it takes its clues 
from Moon position at birth and gives the results through the 
allotted periods of planets throughout the life in relation to their 
Lordship, signification, etc. Transit results are also unique in Hindu 
Astrology since it gives the day-to-day results taking its base from 
the Moon sign. Hereafter we will dwell in detail regarding the 
results of transit of planets after outlining the basic principles. 



Chapter Two 



GRAHA SHEELA OR PLANETARY 
SIGNIFICATION 



In Vcdic Astrology, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, 
Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are the 9 planets. Out of these, Rahu 
and Ketu are shadow planets called Chhaya Grahas. The 
apparent paths of planets are contained within a celestial belt called 
Zodiac. 

The apparent path of Sun is called the ecliptic that is Centre 
Line of the Zodiac. When Moon revolves round the Earth during 
its motion through the zodiac, it cuts the ecliptic at two points, which 
arc called nodal points. The North Nodal point is called Northern 
Node or Dragon's head which, in Vedic Astrology is known as 
'Rahu 1 , while the South Nodal point is called Southern Node or 
Dragon's tail which, is called 'Ketu'. Over these points the shadow 
of our earth falls and produces peculiar malefic effects. Hence these 
arc accepted as planets in Astrology. Out of these two, Rahu's effect 
is said to be that of Saturn and Ketu's that of Mars. Now we will 
outline the details of various attributes or significations of these 
planets to enable us to predict, based on these. 

1 . Sun — Father, soul, medicine and medicinal treatment, science, 
politics, help from government, governmental status, fame, honour, 
courage, mental strength, valour, health, longevity, electricity, right 
eye etc. 

In radical Horoscope Sun gives benefic results in 3, 6, 10 and 
11th houses from Lagna. At the same time, if other planets are placed 
in 12th, 6th, 4th and 5th houses, he will not give benefic results. 
This is called Jathaka Vedha, The Vedha points in transit are 
explained separately as Gochara Vedha. Sun docs not suffer Vedha 
due to Saturn. Sun is bad in 12th, 6th, 4th, and 5th house in birth 



4 GocharFhahdeepika 

horoscope, if at the same time other planets arc in 3rd, 6th, 10th and 
1 1th houses, the bad results get nullified. This is Viloma Vedha. Sun 
is strong during mid-noon and in the 10th house as well as during 
his Northern course. The good or bad effects of Sun will reflect in 
life of individuals from 22nd to 24th year. In transit, Sun gives good 
or bad results five days earlier to the day of entry into a new Rasi in 
Transit. 

2* Moon — Mother, feelings, sleep, good finance, comfort through 
vehicles, female and benefit from them, long travels, 
good smell, glow of the face, sharp intellect, beauty, long life, left 
eye etc. 

When Moon is placed in 1,3, 6, 7, 10 and 11th houses from 
Lagna in radical horoscopes, he gives good results. Jataka Vedha 
houses are 5th, 9th, 12th, 2nd, 4th and 8th houses. Similarly Viloma 
Vedha should be understood as in the case of Sun. Moon is strong 
during Dakshinayana, in 4th house, during night. When travelling 
through Stars Rohini, Sravana, Punarvasu, Vishaka and 
Poorvabhadrapada, he gives always good results, but bad results 
when travelling through Stars Krithika, Uttara Phalguna, Jycshta, 
Utharashada and Revathi. He gives good or bad effects from the 
age 24 to 26 and one hour twelve minutes earlier to his entry to a 
new Rasi. He is also strong when he approaches the end of Rasi. 

He is also strong from Shukla Paksha Ekadashi to Krishna 
Paksha Panchami, from 6th Lunar day of Krishna Paksha to 10th 
Lunar day of Krishna Paksha and again from 6th Lunar day of 
Shukla Paksha to 10th Lunar day of Shukla Paksha, Moon is called 
Madhyama Chandra where he gives moderate results. Poorna 
Chandra is benefic while Ksheena Chandra is malefic. 

3. Mars — Brothers (particularly younger ones), courage, valour, 
strength of the body, quarrel, war, leadership, commander-in-chief, 
earth, landed property, wounds due to weapon, fire ClC v robbery, 
theft, anger, scandal, police department, medical science, science 
in general, dental treatment, work of gold and blacksmith, 
metallurgy and metallurgical engineering, death, soldiers etc. It also 
denotes urgent desires, opposition and cousins. 

Mars gives good results in 3rd, 6th and llthplaces from Lagna. 
and Jataka Vedha places are 12th, 5th and 9th. Conversely, Viloma 
Vedha positions should be understood. 



Graha Shoela or Planetary Sigmfictitian 5 

Mars is strong in his week day, in his Navamsa, in Rasis Meena, 
Vrischika, Makara, Kumbha, Mesha, in the South direction, in the 
beginning of a Rasi and in the 10th place from Lagna. He gives the 
results of a Rasi 8 days before entering a new Rasi and his results 
between the 28th to 32nd years of age. 

4. Mercury — Keen intellect, heavy reading habit, inquisitiveness 
to know everything, eloquence in speech, clever, well educated,

pertaining to such things, sprouting trees, plants, gemmology, white 
magic, nephew, maternal uncle etc. 

Mercury gives good results in 5th, 3rd, 6th, 1st, 9th and 12th 
houses and Jataka Vedha in 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th and 11th places. 
Opposite to above are Viloma Vedha places. Mercury is strong in 
his own Rasi, navamsa, in his week day, in Sagittarius and in 
Uttarayana. He is good while passing through Ashlesha, Jyeshta, 
Revathi, Rohini, Hastha and Sravana Nakshatras; and bad through 
Aridra, Swathi, Pushya, Anuradha, Chiira and Makha. 

He starts giving results 7 days before his entry into a new Rasi. 
He is also strong in 10th and 7th Houses. He gives his effects 
between 32nd and 35th year of age in one's life and while passing 
through whole star or house indicated during transit. 

5. Jupiter — High standards of life, wealth, riches, birth of 
children, happiness, knowledge, intellect, good qualities, advising,

diseases pertaining to Gulma, Sleshma, etc. 

Jupiter gives good results in 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th houses. 
At the same time, if other planets are placed in 12th, 4th, 3rd, 10th 
and 8th places, the good results are cancelled. Conversely, Viloma 
Vedha positions should be understood, Jupiter gives good results 
in Cancer, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Aquarius and Pisces. He gives good 
results also in his own vargas, his week days, during Uttarayana 
and during dawn and twilight (sandhyas). He is also strong when 
he is in Lagna. Jupiter does not give good results when he is 
retrograde, Athichari or combust. He gives good results in the stars 
UtharashadaPunarvasu, Utharabhadrapada, and Vishaka. He gives 
bad results when he passes through Aridra, Sathabisha, Hastha and 
swathi. He gives Ml results when he is in mid-Rasi. He gives results 
two months before entry into a new Rasi. He takes one year to transit 
a full sign and gives good results in the middle two months of the 
year.

Cmha Shceta or Planetary Signification 1 

Revathi, Krithika, Swathi and Aridra but in the stars Bharani, Poorva 
palguni, Poorvashada, Mrugasirsha, Chitra and Dhanista stars. But 
the bad results in his own stars will be less compared to those in 
other stars. He is especially strong in the Rasi Libra. If he is placed 
in kendra in a horoscope he is said to remove crorcs of Dosh^s. He 
gives results from 25th to 28th years age, 7 days before his entry

Saturn is good in 3rd, 6th and 11th houses, from Moon and

in later houses and other planets are in former set of houses, the 
bad results of Saturn in the later set of houses will be cancelled.

Ashtama Sani, Ardhashtama Sani, SadesathiSani and in many other

Graha Sheela or Planetary Signification 15 

Some more important information regarding the nine planets 
arc given below, 

1. Jupiter and Venus are benefics, Venus gives the pleasures 
of this world where as Jupiter gives spiritual traits, things pertaining 
to the next world or Moksha, attachment towards Bhakthi, Yoga, 
Swarga-Sukha to be enjoyed after this world etc. Venus makes men 
selfish while Jupiter shapes men with sacrificing ideal mind, 
servitude to the human society and looking to the welfare of others. 

2. Saturn and Mars are malefic planets. Though Saturn is the 
most malefic, his shaping of men will end in good. He makes him 
ideal human after giving him all pains, sorrows, difficulties etc. 
But Mars gives anger, intention to revenge, provocations, negative 
emotions which are ultimately bad. 

3. Rahu is a shadowy planet and Ketu is Rahu's part. 
Hence Ketu is less malefic than Rahu and gives more benefic results. 

4. Whichever planet is strongest in a horoscope, the 
native is predominantly endowed with the nature of that planet. 

5. In Kaliyuga, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are very strong planets. 
Mithuna and Kanya are Thrikona Sthanas of Rahu and Ketu, 
Makara and Kumba for Mars and Saturn, and for other planets 
Simha and Dhanus. Thrikona here means the most benefic sign for 
a planet. The exaltation, debilitation, Svvaskshethra etc, are not to 
be linked here. 

6. In a horoscope, houses from Lagna to 6th are below horizon 
and are in invisible half of the chart, Lagna is just rising at the 
earstern point. Planets in these houses are less powerful either to 
give benefic or malefic results, i.e. the planets in the visible half 
from 7th to 12th are more powerful to give benefic or malefic results. 

Based on this principle, when transit results are seen from 
Moon sign, planets that are placed from 7th to 12th from Janma 
Rasi are capable of giving enhanced malefic or benefic results. Quite 
contrary to this the planets between 1 to 6 houses will give less 
benefic or adverse results. 

For example, Jupiter in transit is benefic in 2, 5, 7, 9 and 11th 
houses from Moon. Out of these he will be more benefic in houses 
which are 7th to 12th house from Lagna. 



16 GocharPhaladeeprka 

Similarly for Saturn, adversity in 1,2, 4 and 5th will get reduced 
and in 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12th places, will be intensified. 

7. In houses of friends, own places and in exaltation, benefic 
effects will be more. They give madhyama phala in Janma Rasis 
and in enemy's and Neecha Rasis, malefic results are more . 

8. Affliction caused by planets are, Ravi face and head, Moon 
neck, Mars stomach and back, Mercury hands, Jupiter in hips and 
knees, Venus genitals and Saturn feet. Rahu acts as Saturn and Ketu 
as Mars in this respect. 

9. In transit, the planets are stronger in descending order 
Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Moon and Sun. 

10. Planet aspected by benefic becomes stronger. 

11. In exaltation a planet has full strength, 3/4th in Moola 
Thrikona, half own house, l/4th in friend's house, 1/8 th in Sama 
Rasi and in Neecha Rasi, its strength will be of 1/16 i.e., weakest 
state. Moon and Venus are strong in even signs namely Rishaba, 
Karke, Virgo, Scorpio, Makara and Meena. The remaining planets 
i.e., Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Rahu and Ketu are strong 
in the odd Rasis. 

12. In a horoscope, Lagna is cast, 7th is west, 4th is North and 
10th is South. Mercury and Venus arc strong in Lagna, Sukra and 
Moon are strong in 4th house, Saturn is strong in 7th house and 
Sun and Mars are strong in 10th house. 

13. Malefics are strong in Krishna Paksha and benefics in Shukla 
Paksha. 

14. According to Jaimini, the planet at the highest degree is 
called Athmakaraka. A planet in 1,4, 7, lOtlt from Athmakaraka 
is.strongest. Planets in 2, 5, 8, 11th, houses (Panapara) arc next in 
strength and possesss strength 50% to that of Kendra planets. Planets 
in Apoklim houses i.e. : 3, 6, 9 and 12th are the weakest equivalent 
to 25% strength. 

Second from Sun, a planet attains higher speed said to be ' 
Atichari', in 3rd it is normal while in 4th it is 'Mand' (slow). During 
his stay in 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th sign it is retrograde, in 9th and 10th 



GrahaSheela or Planetary Signification 17 

it is kutil (stationary) and in 11th and 12th planet is again Atichari. 
The duration for the above motions can be known from Almanac 
or panchanga. 

15. What is called Avastha phala of planets is also taken into 
account in transit as in predictive Astrology. 

Planets in odd rasis, if placed in first 6 degrees, are supposed to 
be in 'Batya' Avastha, in next 6 degrees in Kumar Awastha 
(adolescent), 12* 18° in Yuva Awastha (youth) in next six degree 
(18-24) Vridha Awastha and in next 6 degress (24 to 30) in Mrita 
(dead) state. The condition of planets will be in the reverse order in 
the even Rasis. Full results will be given by planets in prime youth 
state. Planets in the state of old age generally give negligible results. 
Planets in dead stage will be as good as dead. 

16. Combust, retrograde, direct and Atichara motions of planets 
have different effects. Planets within certain degree to Sun is called 
combust. When a planet, after conjunction, parts away from Sun it 
is said to be rising. There is no retrograde motion to Sun and Moon. 
Rahu and Ketu are always retrograde. Hence for above 4 planets 
there is no difference in results due to their motional difference. 

A malefic planet in retrograde motion becomes worse and a 
beneflc planet gives better results as compared to its normal motion. 

17. Under ordinary conditions the benefic results of planets are 

as under. 

(i) Full Moon, Jupiter and Venus are beneflcs. 

(ii) Venus is 3/4 benefic. 

(iii) Mercury is 1/4 benefic. 

(iv) Waning Moon (from Krishnashtami to Shukla 
Panchami) is 1/4 benefic. 

(v) When waning Moon joins Mercury, he is only 1/8 
benefic. 

(vi) During transit where a planet has to give good results 
the quantum can be computed according to paras.1-16. 



1 8 GodiarFhQladeepika 

18. The malefic quantum of planets- : 

(i) Saturn, Ketu and Rahu are fully malefic. 

(ii) Mars is 3/4 malefic. 

(iii) Sun is 1/2 malefic, 

(iv) When Mercury joins Moon, both are 1/4 malefic. 

(v) Jupiter conjunct with Rahu becomes full malefic. 

The quantum of adverse results due to placement of malefic 
planets can be calculated as above. But when they are due to give 
good results due to placement the quantum is full. 

In this way the net transit results of a planet good or bad have 
to be computed according to the conditions metioned in para 1 to 
18 above.

They are spiritualists and attached to yoga, meditation etc They 
are found to be adept in music, dance, drama etc. They get much 
disturbed by tragedies. They are cunning. They will concentrate 
on supernatural and occult things. Their professions will always 
belong to mental faculties. Their professions are also connected 
with water (sea, fishery etc.), film industry, education department 
etc. 

Though initially they will labour and achieve all comforts in 
life. They should be careful against hidden enemies. 

They may suffer from eye and ear troubles and problems related 
to excess mucus. During the age of 3, 4, 7 and 12, they get afflicted 
with cough, fever, diseases connected with over heat of body etc. 
They also suffer often from prolonged periods of worries. At the 
age of 86, due to the above health and mental problems during the 
Lunar month of Karkataka, on a Saturday conciding with Vishaka 
Star and during Krishna Paksha, at the time of Sun set, they may 
pass away. If they cross tliis hurdle they may live up to 100 years. 

Descriptions given above about the 12 Lagnas are based on 
Tamil Maranagandi Shasthra and from observations. 

Other important points of the 12 Lagnas are given below: 

1. Mesha : 0° to 3*1® and if Mars is well fortified, it will give 
benefic results. 

2. Rishaba: Middle age and old age periods will be satisfactory 
and the native will have an easy going life if they are born 
between 13°-20 to 16°-41X The standard of their life will be high. If 
Venus is in Lagna or in 7th, then also life will be of very high 
standard. 

3. Mithuna: Those born between 26M0' to 30°-00' will have a 
very high standard of living. If Mercury is in Lagna life will be still 
better. 

4. Karka : Like the 1-ord of l^agna Moon, the life of those born 
in this Lagna will also be with ups and downs, just like waxing and 
waning periods of Moon. These people are submissive to their wives. 
If these people arc born from (K to 3°-20 f , their life will be of very 
high standards. 

5. Simha : They arc attached to their mothers. If they are born 
from 13°-20' to 16°-40', they will have very high standard of living 



34 GcxftarFhabdtL'pika 

6. Kanya : Those bom from 26M0' to 30°-00' will lead good 
life with all comforts. 

7. Tula : They will be very happy during the last portion of 
their life. Those born from 0°- to 3° -Iff will lead a better life. 

8. Vrischika : Native will be sick during their younger age. 
Those born between 13°-20' to 16°-4Q' will have better standards of 
life. 

9. Dhanu : Those bom between 26°-40' to 30°-00' will live 
happily with high standards of life. 

10. Makara : Most of these people may face scandals allegedly 
with wicked women much older to them and lead better life when 
Lagna is between 0° to 3°-20\ 

11. Kumbha : Those bom from 13°~20'to 16°-40will have high 
standards of life. 

12. Meena : These people do not work hard but get help from 
connections. Those bom between 26*-40 / to30*-00'willbe happy. If 
Jupiter is strong in Lagna their life will be still better. 

Each Rasi indicates a limb of Kala Purusha. In whichever Rasi 
malefic planets are placed, that limb will be inflicted with some 
defect or disease. 

Simha is puthra sthana for Kala Purusha. If malefics are placed 
there, the children will suffer, similarly if malefic results are indicated 
by transiting planets there will be puthra dosha. 

If Dhanu happens to be strong and subhasthana in a horoscope 
and the Lord Jupiter is also well placed, native will have faith in 
religion and orthodoxy. He may undertake many foreign travels. 
Similarly if good results are indicated here by transiting planets, 
such foreign travels will be happy and successful. 

The native may gain monetary benefits through the men 
belonging to the caste indicated by the Rasi which happens to be in 
Labha Sthana. 

When in a chart more planets are placed in male Rasis, they 
will be strong type like males, even if in signs the native is like 
female the same convention applies to transit results. 



Details about the Twelve Lagnus 35 

When Jupiter and Venus are in odd signs they are more benefic 
while Mars and Saturn in even signs give more malefic results. This 
applies to both transit results and for birth charts. 

There are rasis which are blind during day, and those which are 
blind during night. If one of these happen to be and from Lagna 
and its Lord gets affected by malefic planetary influence aspect clc. 
eye sight will get affected. This will also apply to lame Rasis, limbless 
(kabandha with head) rasis etc. 

Planets in movable signs will give results in the beginning, in 
moveable signs in the middle and in fixed signs at the end. This 
will apply to transit as well as dasa bukthi results. This is how the 
judgement of various features and aspects of life have to be made 
with reference points so far enumerated. 



Chapter Five 



THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF 
THE TWELVE BHAVAS 



Previous chapters have described about planets and signs and 
also dwelt into the details of the characteristics of those born in 12 

Lagnas. 

Any one of the 12 Rasis can become Lagna. The 12 signs 
reckoned from the Lagna are called Bhavas, which indicate various 
aspects of life .For example, Lagna generally indicates nature, shape, 
aptitude, health in general, well being etc. of the individual and 
12th Bhava will indicate expenditure, foreign land, liberation or 
Moksha clc. As in Natal chart, transit results are also determined 
with reference to those 12 Bhavas. For example if in transit, Saturn 
is 5th house for Kanya Rasi born people, the children may fall sick 
and there could bad time for them. Children may go aggressive 
against the native during the time. If Jupiter is in 5th, the native 
will have good children and he will be very happy. Therefore 
significations (Karakatwas) of the 12 Bhawas should be clearly 
understood. 

I st BHAVA (Lagna or Shareera Bhava) 

The Physical the body of the native, its aura, shape, wealth, 
stomach, head, jewels, thinking, mental worries, beauty, fame, 
happiness, longevity, taste, good habit, to protect somebody, 
profession, body development (pushti), sleep, dream, hair in the 
head, the five senses etc. 

During transit, suppose Saturn is in Lagna, the signification 
detailed above will be affected.

with difficulty and agony accruing to mother etc. are indicated by 
third Bhava. 

Third is 8th to 8th. Hence this is accepted as 2nd Ayusthana. 
Longevity can also be seen from 3rd bhava. If in transit, benefic 
planet is in 3rd from Moon sign, the time will be dangerous to

Chapter Six 



BENEFIC AND MALEFIC PLANETS 



The natural benefic and malefic planets, have already been 
explained in Chapter 2. Here, it is proposed to give some details 
about functional beneficiences and maleficence. Malefic planets give 
benefic results under certain circumstances and vice-versa. 
According to each Lagna lordship of different Bhavas changes. Thus 
even natural benefic planets get bad lordship and malefic planets 
own a good Bhava. Therefore bad and good nature of planets has 
to be decided with reference to each of the Lagnas. We will explain 
the same. 

(1) Position of Moon 

(a) Those who are born during waxing Moon period i.e., 
Shukla Paksha; 

Jupiter, waxing Moon are fully benefic 

Venus is 3/4 benefic 

Mercury is 1/2 benefic 

Mars and Sun are 1/4 benefic 

Saturn, Rahu, Ketu and planets connected to them are 

malefic s. 

(b) Those born during Krishna Paksha 
Saturn, Rahu, Ketu are fully benefic 
Sun and Mars 3/4 benefic 
Mercury 1/2 benefic 

Venus 1/4 benefic 

Jupiter and Moon -totally malefic 

Venus 3/4 malefic 

Mercury 1/2 malefic 

Sun and Mars 1/4 malefic 



Benefic and Malefic Planets 



43 



Note : The above rules are applied with reference to certain 
special conditions. 

(2) Maraka Sthana and Marakas: Maraka is the word derived 
from the word Mrithyu, which means the planet which 
causes mrithyu or death. 

Hence maraka is death inflicting planet. 

Maraka : We have to judge a horoscope and find out the 
longevity group to which Jataka belongs. Horoscope can identify 
poornayu jataka (full life of 100 years) madhyamayu jathaka (60 
years) and Alpayu jathaka (32 years and Jess) With limit of longevity 
completed, the dasabukthi coinciding, the period of the planet who 
is maraka, native may pass away. 

(a) Marakas for chara or movable lagna are 2nd and 7th Lords, for 
sthira lagna, 3rd and 8th Lords and for Ubaya Lagna, 7th and 
11th Lords. 

(b) For Madhyamayu Jataka 3rd* 5th, 6th Lord dasasprove Maraka. 
For Alpayu native 1st and 3rd Lords dasas may become Maraka. 
For Dheerghayu persons dasas of 7th and 9th Lords may inflict 
Maraka tva. 

(c) If 1st, 8lh and 10th Lord are strong longevity may be counted 
upto 100 years. (Dheerghayu) 

If two planets are strong out of the above, the longevity may be 
medium or up to 60 years (Madhyayu Supper side) 

If only one planet is strong out the three, the life span will only 
be half of the above or 32 years, (madhyayu lower side) 

If all the three planets are weak, it will be Alpayu (i.e., only up 
to 12 years. 

3. Badhakadipati: For Chara or moveable lagna 1 1th Lord, for 
fixed sign 9th Lord for dual sign 7th Lord is badhaka thipati.

There is difference between Maraka and Badhaka. Maroka is 
death inflicting but, Badhak indicates difficulties, impediments 
obstructions, sorrows, miseries, etc. except death. Badhaka sthana 
is a bad place for any planet. The Bhava where badhakathipatis is 
placed and planets aspected or conjoined with Badhakathipati gets 
afflicted. 

THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR PLANETS TO BECOME 
FUNCTIONAL BENEFIC OR MALEFIC 



(a) Natural benefic planet owning kendra becomes neutral. 
But if he owns a kona also, he becomes benefic. 

• If natural malefic becomes Kendradipati they become 
neutral and are said to give no bad results. 

• At the same time, the Kendrndipnthis should not own 
the 6th, 8th and 12th houses. 

(b) Benefic or malefic planet if owns n trikona, act as benefic, but 
if a trikonadipati also owns sixth hosue, gives mixed results. 

(c) Lagna Lord also a Kendradipati, is benefic. But Lords of 6th, 
8th and 12th if also happen to own Lagna, then their malefic 
effect gets reduced. 

• If 4th and 10th Lords (whether natural malefic or Benefic) 



Benefic and Malefic Planets 4 5 

happen to Own Lagna also, give both good and bad results. 

• For Simha, Thula and Kumbha Lagna, Mars, Merury and 
Venus are benefics as owner of one of the trikona. 

(d) 7th Lord is maraka even if he is natural benefic and acts as 
malefic. Except Saturn, the other planets who also become 7th 
Lord , are neither benefic nor malefic. 

• If 2nd and 12th Lords are benefic when they do not 
possess Lordship of 3, 6, or , 8th but have connection with 
trikona. 

• 2nd Lord, even with benefic aspect will be considered as 
maraka. As maraka, if benefic, will give moderate results. 

(e) Trikona Lords are stronger from Lagna 5th to 9th Lords in that 
order. 

• In the same way the kendra's Lords 1, 4, 7, 10 gain strength 
in the order given. 

• If one planet gets lordship of 5th and 4th and the other that 
of 9th and 10th, the latter will be more benefic. 

• Amongst trishadaya houses malefic effect grow from 3, 6, 
toll. 

• Malefics will be less malefic if they own kendra and trikona 

simultaneously. 

(0 When a planet owns 8th and Lagna placed in own sign are 
not malefic. As 8th Lord any other planet generally gives 
malefic results. 

• 1/ 3rd, 6th, 8th Lords, are also kendrathipati, and get 
connection with thrikonathipath, they give good results. 

(g) 5th and 9th Lords are yoga karakas. When a planet owns both 
a kendra and a kona, he is parama yoga karaka. Lagna is neither 
a kona nor a kendra. Its lords are neither benefic nor malefic. 
But Lagna Lord will protect the native. 

• If a yoga-karaka also owns 8th house the benefic nature 
will get reduced. 

(h) Natural malefic planets getting 7th Lordship are no more 
Marakas. 



46 GocharFhaLideepika 

Benefics like Mercury and Moon become ordinary marakas. If 
the 7th Lord is Jupiter or Venus and connected with malefic, they 
become strong marakas. 

(i) When a benefic planet becomes 7th Lord, he is strong Maraka. 
In this respect Venus is stronger than Moon, Moon is stronger 
than Mercury and strongest is Jupiter, If malefics get 
Marakatva by Lordship of 7th or 2nd house their marakatva is 
much reduced. 

(j) If benefic planets get thrikona lordship and join malefic owning 
kendras, strong Raja Yoga is formed but during bhukthi and 
antharas of 7th Lord they give Rajayoga in the beginning, then 
inflict marakatva. 

(k) Sun and Moon are not malefic as 8th Lord. Other planets as 
8th Lords, even if they are in own houses, are malefics. 

(1) Rahu and Ketu give the results of the Bhavas they occupy. If 
they are not joined with any other planet, they give the results 
of the lord of Bhava they occupy. Intrikona, they give benefic 
results. 

In 12th house give moderately good results. In 3, 6 and 11th 
they are malefics, where they join trikonadhipati, they become 
benefics equivalent to yoga karaka. 

If Rahu and Ketu are in kendra and konas and are joined with 
other kona-kendra lords respectively, they will be considered as 
yoga karakas. 

If Rahu and Ketu are alone in 3rd, 6th and 11th, during Antaras 
of benefics, extreme malefic results occur. They give malefic results 
during the period of malefics and good results during the period of 
benefics. If Rahu and Ketu are alone in 2nd and 7th, they are 
ATHIMARAKA which means more evil and powerful maraka. But 
since they do not possess kendrathipathya dosha they are little bit 
weaker in their malefic influence. But if they are either in 3, 6, 11 or 
in 2, 8, 12 and joined with marakas, they themselves become 
marakas. 

(m) If 3rd, 6th and 11th Lords (not having Kendra/Kona Lordship) 
are connected with other yoga karakas, they give mixed results, 

(n) Out of 2nd and the 7th, the latter is stronger maraka. A maraka 



Ekmfic and Malefic Ffanvts 47 

alone does not give marakatva unless joined with another 
malefic. 

(o) When Saturn joins the marakas, he derives the power of 
marakatva from them, and becomes capable to inflict 
markatva. 

(p) When kendra/konadipatis are joined but one of them is 
maraka as well as thrikonadipati duing their dasa bukthi, they 
give mixed results. If a maraka also becomes a kendradipati 
he becomes a definite maraka. 

(q) Maraka planets do not kill during the periods of planeLs which 
are connected to them. But they will kill during the dasa bukthi 
of maleflcs not connected with them. 

(r) Strong 10th 9th Lords (even when they become 
Dustanadhipatis) if conjoin they give powerful Raja yoga. In 
this context out of 9th and 10th Lords only one planet gets 
Dustanathipathya, 

(s) If Rahu and Ketu are in 3th, 6th, 8th and 11th houses from 
Lagna and at the same time in 2nd or 8th from Moon, they 
become marakas. Ifmalefics, Jupiter and Venus arc connected 
with them, they also become marakas. But there is exception 
for Rahu in Rishaba. 

(t) Meena Rahu, if in 2nd or 8th from Moon, becomes maraka. 
But if he is 8th or 10th he will give only malefic results but will 
not have marakatva 

When malefics pass though maraka places from Chandra lagna 
in transit we can definitely expect the bad results. This information 
can be helpful injudgement ofbothplanetaryinfluences and transit 
result on native. 

For example, the dasa of the badhakatipati is bad. The planets 
conjoined with or aspected by badhakatipati may also become 
malefic. The bhava occupied or aspected by badhakatipati may 
cause difficulties. Planet placed in badhakasthana causes negative 
influences with reference to the Bhava or Bhavas he owns. 

This is how we have to judge the malefic and benefic results of 
planets from various angles. The essence of the benefic and malefic 
influence so far discussed is incorporated in the table given ahead 
for various Lagnas.

Chapter Seven 



LONGEVITY 



The life pattern of an individual like profession, financial status, 
wife, health, life span etc., follows the inherent features promised 
in his horoscope. These come to meet the individual through planets 
during their transit and directional periods called Dasa Bukthis at 
various stages of life. On any given day in individual's life both 
Dasa Bukthi transit have effects and a combined result may give 
better judgernet in respect of trend of life. But to be able to enjoy all 
these the life span is very important for an individual. If it is long 
life then only all these are possible. 

But in Astrology Ayu Nirnaya or computing life span has always 
been a riddle. It has to be computed on the net average of life spans 
arrived under various heads such as Amsayurdaya, Lagnayurdaya, 
Pindayurdaya, Ashtavargayurdaya, Naisargika-yurdaya etc. But to 
do all these calculations and arrive at a correct life span, even with 
computers is difficult. 

However, our ancient Tamil authors have given some dictums 
for assessing the life span, which is close to the true one. 

When dasa bukthi and transit promises is good the period will 
be moderate. If both are bad the period will be bad. During such a 
bad period, when the estimated life span coincides with the dasa of 
a maraka planet together with bad transit, death may occur. It is 
actually the Gochara or transit that gives the definite indication of 
timing of events. 

Now we will take up ways of computing life span by 
approximations as given by Tamil sages. Before that we take up 
certain other factors. Generally we follow Vimshothari dasa system. 
The cumulative period of 9 planets is 120 years. That means 
poomayu is 120 years. But due to various factors we are now 



52 GxharritiLdivpiki 

considering only 100 years as the full life span. This is also confirmed 
by Vedic mantras. In daily Sandhya Vandhana ritual, during Surya 
Namaskar, we say: 

Pashyema sharadhah shatam 

Shrunuvama sharadhah shatam 

Nandama sharadhah shatam 

Modama sharadhah shatam 

Jeevema sharadhah shatam 

We pray to Lord Surya to let our vision be good and sharp up 
to 100 years, let us hear clearly for 100 years, let us be happy for 
100 years, let us rejoice for 100 years and let us live for 100 years. 

Through these prayers the author has fixed 100 years as 
poornayu and starts at lower level from 60 to 75 and above. 36 to 
60 years is Madhyamayu and up to 32 years it is Alpayu. The 
following combinations are given in the ancient Tamil palm leaf 
manuscripts to assess the Ayu. 

1. If 8th Lord is either in 12th or 9th, one lives upto 100 years. 

2. If 8th Lord is in 8th or 1 1th, one lives up to 75 years. 

3. If 8th Lord is in 6th house, one lives up to 50 years. 

4. If 8th Lord is in 4th, 10th and 7th houses, the span of life will 
be very short i.e., Alpayu. 

5. If a chart has one or more of Pancha Maha Purusha Yogas, 
person lives longer. When life span is categorised in the above 
five groups, some conditions as given below also are stipulated 
in ancient Tamil texts. 

If Lagnadhipati, the Lord of the sign occupied by Moon, the 
Eighth Lord, the Ayush Karaka Saturn, the Lord of the sign occupied 
by Saturn and Jupiter all these six planets are friends and well placed 
in the chart, the native will live for hundred years. According to 
the deficiency occurring due to one or more of these six planets, 
100 years can be modified as under. 

For example poomayush is 75years, assuming that the 8th Lord 
is in the 1 lthhouse, and that in the same chart, out of the six planets 
4 are strong and well placed. Then 75 years will get reduced further 
by following approximation. 

75 y- 4/6 = 50 years. 

So the life span of the native will be 50 years. 



Chapter Eight 



RECONCILIATION OF TRANSIT AND 
DASA BUKTHI 

The life on earth begins when an individual is bom. How the 
life further evolves in various aspects is indicated by the directional 
results Dasa Bukthi which is based on the Janma Nakshathra. Transit 
are also reckoned from Moon sign. Hence it can be seen that both 
are based on position of Moon at birth. 

It can therefore be said that Transit influence and Dasa Bukthi 
results are interlinked 

In the previous chapters it has been discussed that: 

a. If both transit and Dasa Bukti indicate good results, the period 
will be very good. 

b. If one of them indicates good and the other bad time the results 
will be mixed. 

c. If both indicate bad results, the period will be very bad. 

But we cannot ascertain the effect of the dasas in detail unless 
transit, good or bad are fully understood. The present work does 
not give scope for analysis in detail of Dasas, Bukthis and Antaras. 
Therefore some salient features of dasa system are explained here, 
as required in the present context. 

I. DASAS BASED ON TARADHIPATYA 

As we all know, first dasa is based on birth star second dasa of 
2nd star, third star will be that of the third star and so on. The 27 
stais are distributed in cycles of 9 stars. For a span of 120 years of 
the complete dasa period, these 9 stars take turn and dasa periods 
are owned by 9 planets in a particular order. We also know that 



54 (kxharPfa&ideepikii 

each planet is alloted 3 stars. Counting from the birth star these 
nine stars are called Janma, Sampat Vipath, Kshema, Pratyak 
Daivanukula, Vadha or Nidhana, Mitra and Parama Maitra Tara. 
These names repeat again in the next two cycles of 9 stars each. 
Thus 3 cycles cover 27 stars. Thus first dasa will be that of birth 
star, second that of Sampath Tara and so on. 

The nature of the results of the Taras will be in accordance with 
name of star as can be seen from below: 

1st dasa of Janma Nakshatra — will give moderate results. 

2nd dasa of Sampat Tara, As the name implies, the dasa will 
give good results and financial status may increase. 

3rd dasa of Vipat Tara, in this dasa, impediments, difficulties, 
dangerous accidents etc. may take place. 

4th dasa is that of Kshema Tara. This will give all comforts, 
peace of mind and progress in all walks of life. 

5th dasa will be that of Prathyak Tara there may be opposition, 
enemity, impediments, difficulties, etc. 

6th dasa of Daivanukula Tara, will give good results, by way of 
spontaneous fulfilment of everything and help from others etc. 

7th dasa that of Vadha or Nidhana Tara, is worst of the dasas, 
and will give very bad and dangerous results. This even causes 
death, if 7 l/2years Saturn also jointly runs in 3rd round. 

8th dasa is that of Maithra Tara. This dasa will be moderately 
good. There may be external help etc. 

9th dasa is called Parama Maithra Dasa. This dasa will also be 
good to a greater extent than that of 8th. 

These are only general indications. The dasa by themselves will 
be prosperous or evil according to the nature of the Lords of Dasa 
Bukthis antaras etc. This will be moderated by catagory of Tara as 
given above to a certain extent. It may further be modified by the 
transit. 

As seen above, 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th dasas produce ill effects. It 
is noted that one may not live the life span of all dasas. Now, the 
views regarding dasas with reference to particular planet are 
explained below: 



Reconciliation of Transit and Dasa Bukthi 55 

2. MISCONCEPTION REGARDING DASAS OF 
PLANETS THAT COME IN PARTICULAR ORDER 
SAID TO CAUSE MARAKA EFFECT 

Some of the texts declare (Phala Deepika and Tamil 
Jathakalankara) that the following dashas may cause death if they 
come in the order given. 

Saturn Dasa comes as 4th. 
or Mars Dasa is 5th Dasa, 
or Jupiter Dasa as 6th Dasa, 
or Rahu Dasa as 7th Dasa, 

In the above texts nothing is said about Sun, Moon, Ketu and 
Venus Dasas. Is there no power for other planets to inflict 
Marakatva? * 

If we dwell deep into it there may be no truth. If Saturn has 4th 
Dasa, native should have born in Mars Dasa and Shani Dasha may 
start dasa from 36 to 40 years of his age. If the chart belongs to 
Poornayu Jataka, then he may not even pass away during 7th dasa. 
The same explanation applies to other dasas mentioned above. If 
Rahu Dasa falls as 7th dasa, native should have been born in 
Mercury Dasa and may be nearing 67th year during span of Rahu 
Dasa. If he belongs to alpayu group he might have passed away 
earlier. 
Here we should clearly understand: 

(a) Category of life span the native belongs (alpayu, madhyamayu 
and poornayu). 

(b) If Maraka Dasa Bukthi falls at the particular end of life span 
and malefic transit such as 3rd Jupiter, Janma Sani in 7Vi years, 
etc. coincide. 

If both the above mentioned cond itions are met with and Saturn 
as 4th dasa, Mars as 5th dasa etc. come at the same time then the 
native will certainly pass away. 

It is in the above context we have to interpret the dictum 
mentioned above. 

3. HOW MARAKA ACTS WHEN OTHER DASAS COME 

(a) If a native passes through dasas not menioned above the same 
rule applies viz qualified Maraka Dasha and life span as well 
as evil transit then only death occurs. 



56 GocharFhihdeeptkz 

(b) 8th Lord, the planet in 8th, the planet aspecting the 8th house, 
22nd decanate Lord from Lagna, 64th Navamsadhipati, and 
the enemy of 8th Lord are very significant since dasas 
belonging to these planets are called CHHIDRA' Dasa (period 
in which holes develop). These periods are said to be very bad 
and may cause death, if other two conditions do not coincide 
with the life span. 

4. OTHER CONDITIONS REGARDING DASAS 

(a) The 4th, 7th and 10th arc Kendras. The dasas of Kendra Lords 
will not be good. But if malefic planet becomes Kendradhipati, 
good results may be expected. 

(b) The 1st, 5th and 9th are thrikonas. The Lords of these konas 
benefic or malefic, during their dasas will be favourable. 

(c) 3rd, 6th and 11th Lords dasas will be evil only in respect of 
health. 

Out of these 6th Lords Dasa gives malefic results, 11th Lord 
Dasa is a qualified maraka dasa, but gives financial status. As he 
gives prosperity even as a qualified maraka he may inflict death. 
For a fixed Lagna, the third lord is not a qualified maraka. 

If 8th Lord is also Lagna Lord, his dasa as the 8th Lord will not 
inflict any danger to life. Sun and Moon are not malefics even if 
they own 8th houses. 

5. DASAS OF PLANETS OWNING 12 BHAVAS 

1. Dasas of Lagna Lord will give wealth as well as normal good 
results. 

2 During Dasas of 2nd Lord, one gets money, peaceful home 
etc., as a maraka he may inflict death, if the judged life span is 
over during later portion of this dasa. 

3. Dasas of 3rd Lord is good. 

4. In Dasas of 4th, Lord plots, new home, vehicles, academic 
excellence etc* are obtained. 

5. Dasas of 5th Lord is responsible for development of intellectual 
keenness, higher education as also progeny. 



Reconciliation of Transit and Dasa Bukthi 57 

6. Dasas of 6th Lord may give trouble through enemies, diseases, 
loans etc. 

7. In Dasas 7th Lord native encounters, unnecessary misery and 
sorrow. For Ubhaya Lagna, if other conditions match then it 
may also inflict Marakatava. 

8. The dasa of 8th Lord, native faces litigation, incurable disease 
and subject to other conditions Marakatva. 

9. The dasa of 9th Lord will bestow all benefic results, how- 
ever, for fixed Lagna it may turn Maraka. 

10. Dasa of 10th Lord, one get status and fame, 

1 1. Dasa of 11th Lord gives over ail gain of money and may 
also be Maraka especially for chara Lagnas. 

12. Dasa of 12th Lord may bring disease, illness, damage to one's 
belongings etc. to native. 

6. THE OTHER POINT REGARDING DASAS 

(a) Dasas of planets in kendra give full results (1, 4, 7, 10) 

Dasas of planets in panaparas (2, 5,8,- 11) will give 1 12 results. 
Dasas of Planets in apoklima (3, 6, 9, 12) give only 1 /4 results. 

(b) Planets in Sheershodaya rasis give results during the beginning 
of their dasas, planets in Pristhodaya rasis during end of the 
dasa and Planets in Rasi Ubhayodaya in the middle of dasa. 

(c) Unit value ofresults will be 1, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4,1 /Sand l/16of 
dasa results by planets in exaltation, Moolathrikona, own 
house, friends house, enemy's house and in debilitation sign, 

(d) If Rahu and Ketu are alone in Rasis, they should be 
considered as owner of that Rasi and give dasa and other 
results accordingly, 

(e) Take the Rasi where dasa Lord is placed at the time of beginning 
of the dasa. He gives first results of that bhava and followed 
by other bhavas in succession for all the 12 bhavas. For this 
purpose the dasa period may be divided into 12 equal parts. 

(f) In the dasa of Vakra planet (Retrograde) generally there will 
be loss of money, comforts, unwanted transfer, foreign travel 



S8 Gxhv-Fhahdeepika 

under compulsion etc. When he becomes direct there will be 
name, fame, honour, high status etc. When he goes forward in 
6th, 8th, 12th bhavas, bad results follow. 

7. THE JUDGEMENT OF A DASA. TERMED AS 
BODHAKA, VEDHAKA, POSHAKAND KARAKA 

Dashas can be examined in yet another way. Dasha planet are 
interrelated to each other in a particular manner and modify the 
results as given below: 

(a) Bodhaka: a planet which helps the dasanatha to give full 
results. If a bodhaka comes as bukthi antara natha dasanath 
gives his benefic results. 

(b) Vcdhaka: The dasa of a vedhaka planet obstructs the dasa 
natha to give the results during latter's bhukthi etc. 

(c) Poshaka: Poshaka is the ripener of dasa results during its 
antara etc. Such periods will be doubly benefic and he adds 
his own results to that of dasanatha. 

(d) Karaka : Karaka supports the Dasa Lord and other planet to 
give their results. He also adds to the results of the dasanatha. 

This is how each Dasha Lord comes across bhukti nath who 
helps or obstructs the results of dashanatha. They also similarly 
make planets in transit to give good results. The following table 
shows the details of Bodhaka, Vedhaka, Poshaka and Karaka. 

Rahu and Ketu do not influence as Bodhaka, Vedhaka etc.

The above Bodhaka, Vedhaka, Poshaka and Karaka are also 
considered in an alternative way as explained as below. Here a 
planet is termed as Bodhaka, Vedhaka etc. based on its position in 
a specified bhava from the planet in question:

Note: P shows planet which takes the role of Pachaka, Bodhaka 
etc. and B shows the bhava where P is placed from the planet under 
consideration. 

In the first method (Tablc-5) different planets act as Bodhaka, 
Vedhaka, Poshaka and Karaka for each of the 7 dasas excepting 
Rahu and Ketu. In the table for instance for Sun Dasa Mars is 
Bodhaka, Venus Vedhaka, Saturn Poshaka and Jupiter Karaka. But 
the alternative way of interpreting these terminologies differ from 
the first method in that, different planets act separately as Bodhaka 
etc. for each dasa in the first method. 

In the second method (Table-6) a planet positioned in specified 
bhava from a particular planet becomes Bodhaka, Poshaka etc. 
This gives room to understand that Bodhaka etc. are not only 
to be considered for Dasa Bukthi but also in judgment of 
horoscopes. Referring to the table Saturn in 6th from Sun acts as 
Poshaka. There could be two interpretations to this: 

(a) that Saturn is Poshaka for Sun's dasa if he is in 6th from Sun 
and gives good results, during own bukthi. 

(b) that Saturn will improve the results for Sun as owner of a 
particular bhava say, for Simha Lagna, if Sun is in Vrishabha 



60 Gorfwr Plwladtxpika 

and Saturn is in Tula, Saturn improves the results of Sun as 
Lagna Lord apart frombeing in 10th from Lagna will give the 
native status, fame etc. Thus the alternative method works for 
Dasa Bukthi as well as for judgement of horoscopes. 

OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POINTS 

1. The planets combust and defeated in Graha Yuddha reduce 
benefic results similar to retrograde planets. 

2. In the dasas of debilitated or of a planet in inimical sign, the 
native goes outside his place or country under compulsion. 
He will be away from his relatives, friends, shall have enmity 
with others, suffering due to diseases, unnecessary arguments 
with others, risky events, accidents etc. 

3. Sun and Moon do not behave as marakas. But at the same 
time, if the transit is very bad, there is possibility of death of 
the native. 



Chapter Nine 



EFFECT OF MR1TYUBHAG 
AWASTHA ETC. 



I. MRITYUBHAGAS— 

When planets travel through the 12 Rasis, they pass through 
certain degrees in each Rasi which are called MrityuBhagas. In transit 
when a planet gives malefic result in a certain Rasi from Moon sign, 
at the same time, the said planet passes through Mrithyu Bhagas 
and period of Maraka is running, then there is possibility of passing 
away of the native. Sade Sathi specially in the middle portion of 
Janma Sana, Maraka period when Saturn, Dasanatha, or Maraka 
Planet, one or more of them pass through respective Mrithyubhagas 
then the native's death is more probable. 

MrithyuBhagas of 12 Rasis with reference to each planet is

In table 8 positive degrees are given for Lagna and Moon, If 
these degrees fall in Lagna then one can safely say that the life of 
the native will be very happy. Similarly, when Moon passes through 
his positive degrees in all the 12 Rasis, the native feels elevated in 
spirit and happy. The transiting planet or Dasa planets will give 
more or less benefic results during the travel of Moon through these 
positive degrees. 

2. Modification of transit results due to Awastha of planets. 



(a) Awasthas of planets are given in Table 9.

Planets in Balyavastha give 1 /4 results 
Planets in prime youth give full results 
Planers in Vruddha or old age have evil effects 

If a Maraka is in dead Awastha death or death like results are 
possible. If planets pass through these Awasthas, similar effect are 
expected. In case the transiting planets are to give bad results when 
they are in good Awasthas, 'the bad results are reduced by 1/4,1/2, 
3/4 or full according to their Awasthas. But when they pass through 
the Death Awastha, they may cause death more certainly than said 
in the case of transiting planets where they indicate good results, as 
discussed above. 

(b) There is yet another way of finding out Awasthas of planets. 
These are as follows for odd signs: 

Jaghrutha Awastha - (Waking state) 0-10 

Swapna Awastha - (Dreaming state) 11 -20 

Sushupti Awastha - (Deep sleep) 21-30 

The order will reverse in the case of female rasis. 

Sushupli Awastha - (Deep sleep state) 0-10 

Swapna Awastha - (Dreaming state) 11-20 

Jagrutha Awastha - (Waking state) 21-30 

A planet in dreaming state gives mixed results with more 
towards maleficence. 

A planet in sushupthi state, is bad but in Jagrut Awastha good. 

The transit results get modified as discussed in the previous 
classification of Avasthas i.e., Balya, Kumaraetc.

3. GRAHA RASIS, TITHIS ETC. 

Generally it is believed that when Moon passes through 8thfrom 
natal Moon, it is called Chandrashtamaand there will be melancholy, 
ordeals, troubles, losses etc. 

But in experience it is seen that it is not so for the all rasis. 
Contrary to this quite good results arc seen in some cases. 

Trouble monger Rasis are called GHATA Rasis. These rasis in 
Tamil are called as Paattu' rasis or suffering Rasis. In Table 10 
trouble monger Rasis for each of the 12 Moon signs along with Ghata 
months, Lunar date, yoga, karana, Nakshatra, week day, and the 
bad yamas on each week day are also given. When daily Gochara 
results are estimated this aspect also needs consideration to arrive 
at net transit results.

TITHI-SHOONYA AND GOCHARA 

From Prathama (both Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha up 
to the 14th Lunar date) two signs are said to attain shoonya (Vacuum 
or nothingness) on that day. The planets who are the Lords of these 
signs, also get nothingness. Therefore, during that particular day if 
Shoonva planets in transit passing through benefic or maletic result 
giving sign from Moon, the net result gets cancelled. This is how 
transit results get modified.

There is no shoonya tithis for full Moon and Amavasya. If Loads 
of shoonya rasis are in Rasis owned by malefic planets or in Rasis 
where they give malefic results or joined with malefic planets, they 
will give good results only. 

Conversely if they are in Rasis where they give good results, or 
when they are alone or conjoined with benefic planets, they give 
bad results. 



Chapter Ten 

FUNDAMENTALS OF GOCHARA 
PHALA (TRANSIT) 



It is a common praticc to judge transit results from ones' Moon 
sign i.e., Janma Rasi. The reasons for considering Moon for Transit 
results have already been explained earlier. So far the basic principles 
of Vedic Astrology have been discussed, which are to be understood 
to judge and quantify Gochara or Transit results. 

We shall see how transit of planets, in signs reckoned from natal 
Moon sign affects the individual. For instance we want to know 
the transit results on a particular day. From Fanchanga position of 
planets in different Rasis can be seen. Good or evil results will 
depend upon placement of the planet from Moon sign as per the 
dictums of Gochara Phala enumerated by our ancients which are 
explained in this book in the following chapters. If more planets 
indicate good results, the day will be very good. Opposite effect 
will come to pass in case of evil transits. The Dasha Bhukti should 
also be checked. Effect will be after consideration of both as follows: 

(a) If both the Dasa Bukthi and transit arc good then the day will 
be very 'good, 

(b) If one is bad and the other indicates good, then the day will 
have mixed effects. 

(c) If both indicate evil, then the day will be very bad. 

Above results further modified by other special traditional and 
conventional ways are explained below in brief and will be discussed 
in detail where required, later. 

MOORTI NIRNAYA: When a planet is entering a new sign from 
previous one, the transit Moon will be in a particular sign from 
natal Moon. Position of transit moon from the natal sign is' noted. 



68 GocharPha!adeqydka 

Based on this, the planet is said to transit the new sign, as 
Swarnamoorthy (gold) or Rajatamoorty (silver) or Tambramoorty 
(copper) or Lohnmoorty (iron). 

GOCHARA VEDHA AND VIPAREETHA: General Gochara as 
seen from natal Moon gets further modified or cancelled due to the 
presence of some planet in a specified sign. When benefic 
results get cancelled, it is called Gochara Vedha and if bad effects 
get nullified it is Vipareetha Vedha. This will also be explained in a 
separate chapter. 

STELLAR OCCUPATIONAL RESULTS : During transit each 
planet passes through particular star counted from the birth starof 
the native. When a planet occupies particular star from one's birth 
star, trouble giving tranist is through 1st (Janma), 3rd (Vipat), and 
5th (Prathyak),7th (Vadha), the good results in 2nd {Sampath), 4th 
(Kshema), 6th (Deivanukula), 8th (Maitra) and 9th (Parama Maitra), 
This is called Nakshathradipathya Gochara phala and will be 
explained separately in detail. 

NAKSHATRA ANGA PHALA : The Planet travel through 
twenty seven stars during their journey in all the 12 Rasis. Different 
limbs of the body have been assigned to the stars. Therefore when 
planets benefic or malefic pass through the Nakshatras, one or the 
other part of the body gets affected. This is known as Nakshatra 
Anga phala. 

ASHTAKAVARGA PHALA-Ashtakavarga is a seperate branch 
and quantifies the capacity of planets and bhava to give benefic or 
ill effects. From basic Prastaraka chart, Bhinnastakavarga and 
Sarvastakavargas are calculated. The nature of the result by transit 
planet can be assessed when judged in Bhinnastak of individual 
planet or Sarvastakavarga. 

SAMAGAMAM OR DHRISHTI : There is yet another way of 
reconciliation of Gochara Phala. A planet may pass through its own 
radical position in the birth chart or over other planets. This is called 
Samagamam. 

In addition to this planet in transit may aspect its own position 
in the horoscope. This aspect has a special effect on transiting planet. 
This is called Drishti Phala. The transiting planets may not aspect 
itsown natal position, but some other bhavas. Here also the aspected 
bhava gets affected. 



Fundamentals of Gochara Phala (Transit) 69 

DASAMA SAM AG AMAM : In the natal horoscope of a person 
10th Bhava Madhya is called meridian. The aspect of the transiting 
planet over this point has a special effect based on the aspecting 
planet aspected bhava as well as presence of any planet in that 
bhava. This is called Dasama Samagama. 

VARSHA GRAHA GOCHARA : Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu 
stay longer time in a rasi, so thty are called Varsha Grahas giving 
long standing effect and leaves a great impact on the life. 

PARYAYA PHALA OR CYCLIC RESULTS OF VARSHA 
GRAHAS JUPITER 

Jupiter completes its passage through all the 12 Rasis roughly 
in 12 years. This cycle is called Paryaya or a round. In each cycle he 
is said to give specific effects in particular Rasis reckoned from 
one's Janma Rasi. Jupiter, passing through 1, 3,4, 6, 8, 10 and 12th 
houses from one's Janma Rasi is said to give bad results. Even among 
these bad results in each place there is some subtle difference. 

SATURN 

Saturn is stronger than Jupiter. He completes a round of 12 rasis 
very slowly in 30 years. He is good only in 3rd, 6th and 11th signs 
from one's birth Moon. In all other Rasis, he is malefic important 
among these is 7 1/2 years of Saturn Sadesathi. Saturn's passage 
through 4th and 8th houses is called Ardhasthama Sani & Kantak 
Sani respectively. 

This is how we can identify various effects of Gochara. General 
transit results get modified by moorthy nimaya, stellar occupation, 
Sadhe Sathi, Kantaka Sani etc. 

Hereafter in all following nine Chapters, the transit of each 
planet will be explained scperatcly based on traditional and ancient 
texts. These authoritative texts are : 

Sanskrit: Brihat-Samhita, Phala Deepika, Yavana Vakya, 
Vyavahara Jotisha Prakasika, Brigu Sutra, Chamatkar Chinthamani 
etc. 

Tamil : Authors' own palm leaf manuscripts initiated by his 
Gurus, Jyothisha Kalanjiyam, Periya Varushadhi Nool Pulippani 



70 GochvPhabdeepika 

Muni 300, Pulippani Mother Daughter EASAL (argument), 
Choodamani Ullamudaiyan, etc. 

All the texts have been consulted and the essence of the above 
texts is being given in the following pages. 

TRANSIT RESULTS ATA GLANCE (GOCHARA PHALA

I. TRANSIT OF RETROGRADE PLANETS 



1. Major planets Saturn, Jupiter and Mars produce con- 
siderable effect when transiting over the natal planets or sensitive 
points of natal chart. 

2. When retrograde planets arc stationary over the natal planet 
or sensitive points, the effects are powerful which results in some 
memorable events to occur either before or after the exact lime, 
they become stationary. 

3. Retrograde planet: When a retrograde planet is stationary 
before changing direction, it radiates great energy on earfh.This is 
more when it aspects the natal planets. Both retrograde and 
stationary planets are powerful in producing effects when they get 
direct but specially when the retrograde planets turn direct. 

4. A retrograde benefic planet when transits a favourable 
position will intensify the good results. If the position is 
unfavourable, the evil effects are reduced to minimum. 



Fundamentals of Gochara Phala (Transit) 15 

5. A retrograde malefic planet while transiting a favourable 
position will neutralise the benefic results while in an 
unfavourable position, the malefic results will be intensified. 

6, When a planet gets retrograde and enters the previous sign 
and then re-entors the orginal sign, behaves as triple transit. The 
transit effects will be all the time favourable or unfavourable, as 
the case may be, pertaining to the original sign occupied before the 
retrogression started. 

2. RESULTS OF LATTA 

(a) The following stars counted in forward direction from that 
occupied by a planet are called Forward Latta stars of the 
planets. 

1. Twelfth star from that occupied by Sun. 

2. Third star from that occupied by Mars. 

3. Sixth star from that occupied by Jupiter. 

4. Eighth star from that occupied by Saturn. 

These are called Puro Latta or forward Lattas. For example if 
Sun is in chitra the forward latta star 12th from that is Purva 
Bhadrqpnda. 

(b) The following stars counted in backward direction from that 
occupied by a planet called Rear Latta stars of the planets. 

1. Fifth star counted backwards from the star occupied by 
Venus. 

2. The 7th star from that occupied by Mercury. 

3. The 9th star from that occupied by Rahu and Ketu. 

4. The 22nd star from that occupied by Moon. 

These are called Prustha Lattas, For example, if mercury is in 
Jyestha the star Utthava Phalguni will receive backward Latta, The 
results will be: 

(a) If the Latta position on both the direction falls on the natal 
star, there will be sickess and worries. 

(b) During Sun's Latta over the natal star, the complete business 
will be ruined. 

(c) During the Latta of Jupiter over the natal star, there 
may be death, misery to some relation and fear as well as 
insecurity. 



76 GodwFhahdeepika 

(d) During the Latta of Rahu and Ketu over the natal star there 
will be difficulties of all kinds. 

(e) During the Latta of Venus over the natal star there will be 
quarrels. 

(f) During the Latta of Moon over the natal star, there will be 
humiliation and loss of honour. 

(g) During the Latta of Mercury on the natal star, there will be 
loss of status and other unwanted events. 

(h) During the Latta of Saturn over the natal star, there 
will be many difficulties and even danger to life 



Chapter Eleven 
TRANSIT RESULTS OF SUN 



PART ONE —SANSKRIT TEXTS 
BR1HAT SAMH1TA 

facnsrcf fs<fa fttfrfa ^ ^ ^m ^r^Rf ^5p ^i 

The Sun passing through the sign of the natal Moon causes 
fatigue, reduces wealth, brings about diseases of the bowels, and 
wearisome journeys. He causes, in the 2nd house, loss of wealth 
and happiness, eye diseases and deceit. In the 3rd house acquisition 
of a new position, advent of much wealth, happiness, sound health 
and destruction of enemies. In the 4th house, the Sun causes 
diseases, and constant impediments to the native in the enjoyment 
of conjugal happpiness. 

Tcftel: FJ: M<HH^ Uferiift ^fft tVllftolpMI: 

T&mh vn^qvij t^fii ^cpar h **rft Traill 

When the Sun passes through the 5th house, there will be 
innumerable troubles caused by illness and enemies; through the 
6th, he removes illness, enemies and grief; through the 7th, he causes 
wearisome travelling, stomach diseases, and humiliation; through 
the 8th, the person will suffer from illness and fright; and 
consequently his own wife will speak harshly to him. 



76 GxhvPhahdLxpika 

*ro 'yMdy ^m^s'i ^rfftrfe" -g^i 

When Sun passes through 9th from Moon sign, causes danger, 
poverty (or humiliation), disease and impediments to acquisition 
of wealth and undertakings; in the 10th house, a mighty task will 
be completed successfully, and all the projects will be carried to 
success. In the 1th house, the native will attain an illustrious position, 
honour, wealth and freedom from disease. When the Sun passes 
through the 12th house, the activities of only those of an ideal

86 GodurPtuhdecpikd 

Note: Sun stays in Rasi only for one month, hence when he 
passes through 3, 6, 10, 11th houses from Moon there will be 
good months. In addition to this, when Sun goes to his exaltation, 
or own house or friends house, similar results could be experienced, 
whatever may be that house from Mooru When he goes to enemy's 
houses or to his debilitation, whatever may be that house from 
Moon, he will suffer from health problem, difficulties etc. 
According to Jyothish Kalangiam in Tamil, good results will accrue, 
when Sun passes through his exaltation, own, or friendly 
houses even where Sun has to give bad results. Hence we may 
expect Sun to give good results in most of the months during the 
year. 

As a general rule, it is to be understood that a planet giving 
benefic results in transit if passes through its debiliatation, enemical 
houses, the benefic results get reduced and bad results, get intensi- 
fied. This should be judged properly and the cumulative monthly 
results should be understood according to benefic and malefic 
influence of all planets in transit.

Moon goes through a Rasi in 2 1/4 days and covers 12 Rasis 
roughly in 30 days from Janma Rasi. It is good in 7 places in the 
complete Zodiac which means that he will be good about 16 days 
in a month The good results are not continuous but intermittent. 
During the same time the other planets give cither good or bad 
results. Suppose we take the value of good results as one unit, other 
planet's contribution will be 8/9 success. Suppose the result of Moon 
on a certain day is good, and we take it as l,if we add 8/9 th portions 
of the benefic results of the other planets for that day, we may be 
able to arrive at the net good results on a particular day.

7. Saturn through seventh from Janma Rasi: 

This is also known as Kantaka Shani, worse than his 4th. The 
native will be under some trouble or other. There may be danger 
to the life of wife if Maraka Dasa and judged life span coincides. 
He may be displaced and transferred to places unwanted by him 
or demoted. Accidents may happen during travel. His cattle will 
get destroyed. His servants and attendants will leave him. He 
will lose his self respect and suffer humiliation. He will lose his 
status. Some have to earn their bread even by heavy labour, porter 
etc. The body will suffer from some deficiencies, sickness headache 
etc. He may have to undertake aimless travels. His mind will be 
eclipsed by some fear, hesitation etc. He may mourn somebody's 
death. He may suffer unusual hunger and appetite. He may suffer 
even for want of shelter. He may also be pushed to foreign land 
but to suffer only. 

8. Saturn through eighth from Janma Rasi 

This is also called Ashtama Kantaka Sani, and will give trouble 
equivalent to death. When Saturn is in 8th the native suffers acute 
stomach pain. There will be scarcity of money, unsteady life and 
his endeavours will fail. His catties get destroyed. His children 
will suffer due to various diseases like eye trouble. Friends will 
also have difficulties. He is harassed by government. There is 
fear of imprisonment restraints etc. If judged life span is complete 
and Maraka Dasa also runs, there may be danger to the life of the 
native. He will lose his respect, position and will be humiliated. 
He will also develop enmity with his wife. Several obstructions 
and impediments will come in his way. There will be wasteful 
expenditure. He may be trapped in litigation and pay fine. He 
will be transferred to unwanted place and also suffer in the new 
place. He will never hesitate to tell lies- He will be pushed to do 
all menial job. He may have to even starve for want of food. He 
may be associated with a wicked woman and there will be scandal 



170 GocharlliaLideepika 

and the native earns bad reputation. The grown up sons and 
daughters are also aggressive to the native. His words will carry 
no weight, next to 7Vi years of Saturn, this is most malefic place 
where Saturn is very bad. 

9. Saturn through ninth house from Janma Rasi 

Here also Saturn is said to give bad results. But according to 
ancient Tamil texts during these 2Vi years, the native enjoys the 
life of Aristocrat with all pomp and show, comforts and luxuries 
and status (Raja Yoga). All the efforts of the native succeed. The 
native will have liaison with new women and will have sexual 
pleasure through them. He will have high class vehicles and 
commanding position. He will have timely delicious food. Money 
will come from many sources. He will get attendants, servants 
etc. 

But as per traditional Sanskrit texts, Saturn in 9th also gives 
bad results. Money will be spent on unwanted, useless purposes. 
Good acts and constructive work will not earn him name. This 
will be Marak period for father or an elderly relative equivalent 
to him. If the judged life span coincides with Maraka Dasa at this 
time the native may have to perform post funeral rites of those 
elderly persons. (P1THRU SAMAH NITHYA DUKHAM Phala 
Deepika) The native will be plunging in some grief or other daily. 
Whatever bad results are told for in 8th most of them will also 
happen here. Many diseases will be afflicting the native. Accidents 
may happen. The sources of income will get dried. His Poorva 
Punya will not come to help. All good opportunities will be missed. 
Fortune will be blocked. Mind will indulge always in wicked and 
sinful acts. Summing up, the good results described in first part 
and the bad results mentioned now both jointly give moderate 
result. However there may be fear of imprisonment, separation 
from family etc. The native loses faith in God and religion. He 
will not follow daily religious rituals These bad results also should 
be expected along with good results given by tdmit texts outlined 
in the beginning. 

lO.Saturn through tenth house from Janma Rasi 

Status and job may be lost. The native will be subjected to 
black magic. There will always be an undcfinable fear lurking in 



Transit Results of Saturn 171 

the mind. Worries will multiply. The native becomes miserly. The 
native may undertake a pilgrimage to Benares (Thus may be 
sepcarated from the family for long intervals of time). The native 
will put forth hard labour with no gain or work for meagre pay 
and the family will suffer poverty. He will indulge in actitivies 
which are not paying. There will be all round failure. He will be 
afflicted by many diseases. He will be involved in some scandal 
and subjected to false accusation. He will lose his respect and will 
be subjected to humiliation. The mind will not be clear, and the 
native remains confused. 

11. Saturn through eleventh from Janma Rasi 

The native gets money from many sources. He will be cured 
from all diseases and gains good health. He will have new hopes 
and confidence, respect status in profession and promoted to higher 
posts. He may even become minister etc. A female child may be 
bom to him. His sex appetite will grow more and more. But that 
will be gratified (by wife and outside women). He will get all 
comforts and things of life to enjoy. Some may indulge in 
scandalous relationship with wicked women and the native may 
gain from them instead of being trapped by them. The native will 
become very rough and tough. He will get money belonging to 
others also. Many friends will help him. His house will be full of 
grain, provision, luxuries etc. 

1 2, Saturn through twelfth from Janma Rasi 

This is starting of Sndhe Saati. There will be poverty, loss in 
business, separation from family, aimless travels from place to 
place and long distance travels with no purpose, expenditure 
without control and more than the capacity of the native. All will 
disturb and spoil the life trend of the native. Mind will be clouded 
with worries and anxieties. He will become unemployed with no 
income, suffers poverty. He will neither be able to seek new 
employment due to difficulty of coming out of the prevailing 
compulsions and limitations. Whatever little money is left out will 
bo spent on unwanted expenses. If judged life span coincides 
termination with Maraka Dasa period and also with third or 4th 
round of Sadhe Sati then the native may pass away. Due to lack of 
clarity in mind, the native will not be able to decide anything and 



172 GocharPftihdcepika 

all his plans fail. His cattle will get destroyed. He will be transferred 
to unwanted place where there will be troubles and difficulties. 
New business ventures, partnerships, investments, standing 
security with others will all fail and result in losses. Saturn as 7VS 
years Saturn will tempt native to indulge and plan for such things 
and make him suffer. It is better to play safe in business during 
this period.

Chapter Eighteen 
TRANSIT RESULTS OF RAHU 



PART ONE 
TRANSIT RESULTS OF RAHU'S DETAILED READINGS 

Transit results of Rahu and Ketu arc not available in Sanskrit 
text. In the traditional Tamil texts TERIYA VARUSHADHI NOOL' 
and 'JODHIDAK KALANJIYAM' the transit results of Rahu and 
Ketu are given in brief. Based on the above and our own 
experience, we have illustrated the transits of Rahu and Ketu. 
Here the word 'experience' is used not on any new dictum of the 
writer but it is strictly brought out from the original expression 
of our ancient sages, that they have described in the texts, found 
out in various places. According to the saying that 'Sanivah Rahu' 
and r Kujavah Ketu' the results given for Saturn and Mars for transit 
by our ancient Rishis are mainly taken as guiding factor in giving 
readings for Rahu and Ketu. 

1. Rahu through Janma Rasi (Moon sign) 

There will be unsolved difficulties and problems. There will 
be losses, many undiagnosable diseases befitting Rahu may occur. 
But since sickness will not be deciphered, no treatment may be 
possible and this aspect will become a mater of serious mental 
worry. The native may suffer black magic since Rahu is karak for 
it. The period will also be bad for parents. 

2. Rahu through second house from Janma Rasi

proper thinking. Expenditure will go up with less or no income.

sound health. He gets acquaintance of a lady speaking other than 
the language of his own, and he gets pleasure and peace of mind 
and intelligence. He commands respect and honour at his own 
place. He will gain from his maternal uncle

He becomes enemy to others due to his argumentative nature 
and suffers many ordeals and difficulties as a consequence. His

coincides with maraka period there will be danger to life. If 3rd

only. He may resort to practice the discipline and code of religions 
other than his own. His mind will not engage in good and 
righteous deeds. This will be bad time for brothers, father and 
mother. He may practice black magic. On the whole, the period is 
not good for these people. 

10. Rahu through tenth house from Janma Rasi 

According to some texts bad results are given for Rahu in 
10th. But Tamil texts in this context state that if some other planet 
or planet(s) is/are there in the 10th, the results will be mixed. 
This reflects the idea that along with bad results, good results can 
also be expected. According to Tamil texts, there will be peaceful 
and happy life. But properties will go out from hands. The support 
given by government will be withdrawn. There will be transfer 
to unwanted place. The native will suffer from black magic. If 
Maraka Dasa coincides, there will be danger to life. He may also 
have to do post funeral rites to his parents (10th Rahu gives what 
is called Karma Dasa). There will be confusion in all spheres of 
life. The native may quarrel with his wife. He will not have timely 
food. His sleep gets spoiled due to worries. He will not have 
clear mind and capacity to make any decision. His 
memory weakens. As such we can come to the conclusion that 
according to Tamil texts all bad results will happen, during the 
second half. 

1 1. Rahu through eleventh from Janma Rasi: 

Here Rahu gives good results. Timely good food with sweets, 
will be available and money will come from many sources. Wife 
will be cured of her ill health. Her look will have a new glow and 
attraction. Children's health also improves and will be cheerful.

honour in the society. He develops faith and spiritual devotion

When compared to Rami, Ketu gives less malefic results in 10th. 
He may do religious Yajnas (sacrifices). He may undertake 
pilgrimage to holy places, temples etc. He may become head 
of some religious centre. The good and bad results occur to 
the native more or less similar to the Ketu dispositor in the radical 
chart. 

1 1. Ketu through eleventh house from Janma Rasi 

Here Ketu gives beneficial results in all ways. He will get 
good income from agriculture, will never fail to keep up his 
commitments and will succeed in all his enterprises. At home, all 
essential provisions and luxuries will flow in abundance. He will 
become VIP. He will succeed in many businesses. He may be given 
status in judiciary, may be promoted in his job, will get

native incurs losses in many ways. There will be heavy and 
uncontrolled expenditure. His relatives suffer due to various 
difficulties and sickness. He may suffer due to fire accidents and 
small pox, eye problem etc. His mind will be more on spritual 
side and he may become Sanyasi. He may not get 
conveyance facilities. There will be conflict and will get confusion 
in the family created by his relatives and friends. Ketu will confuse 
his mind at times. 12th house is called Moksha Sthana, Ketu is 
significator for spirituality and self-realisation. As such, when Ketu 
comes to 12th house from Janma Rasi, the native will experience 
self realisation. 

Note : The results of Rahu are more malefic in nature and it 
makes the native more attached towards worldly pleasure; 
whereas the results of Ketu are less malefic and the native 
contemplates on spiritual and devotional side. In Ketu, the benefic 
results are more than those of Rahu.

Chapter Twenty One 



ASPECTS IN TRANSIT 



In western system of astrology aspects, are taken different 
than what we take in vedic system. In Vedic astrology, we follow 
what the standard texts provide. For example all planets aspect 
7 th Rasi. Saturn, Mars, Jupiter have special aspects. This has been 
discussed earlier. 

In transit, the result of aspect has to be judged as follows. 

A planet when in transit gives good or bad results according 
to Rasi occupied by it from Janma Rasi or Birth Moon. This planet 
also aspects certain Rasi by general aspect or special aspect. These 
aspected Rasis or Bhavas if seen from Janma Rasi, give certain 
results by virtue of their aspects. These general transit results 
and aspect results should be well coordinated to give net result 
We have tabulated these results. The results of aspect are 
identified as follows. Let us consider Mesha Rasi where natal 
moon is placed and in Kataka, fourth from Moon, Sun transits. 
According to general dictum Sun in 4th is not good. But by 7th 
aspect to the 10th Rasi from the natal Moon (the 7th Kataka) Sun 
is said to give good results. Referencing to the table if you move 
across to where Sun is aspecting i.e 10th Bhava you will find that 
there will be promotion. This is the result of aspect. Here we 
should not consider the place where the planet is positioned, 
but we should consider the place where the pjrtnet aspects and 
see its position from radical Moon. The results of aspected Rasi 
plus the results of the rasi where the planet is placed should be 
jointly seen and net results declared. In the above case Sun's 
transit in 4th from radical Moon is bad but aspect of 10th house 
is good, Combined effect of both is good and bad and hence net 
effect is moderate and mixed.

CHAPTER TWENTY TWO 



GOCH ARA VEDHA AND VIPAREETHA 

VEDHA 



During transit planets give good results at certain places from 
Janma Rasi and adverse results in remaining houses. But at times 
results are cancelled by presence of some other planet or planets 
simultaneously, in some other spedfic houses from Janma Rasi. 
Such positions are called 'Vedha Sthana'. When good results are 
cancelled, it is called Gochara Vedha. The same is explained below: 

1. Gochar Vedha — From the Janma Rasi or the Birth Mcon 
sign places of benefic and corresponding 'Vedha' places for each 
place are given below;-

Explanation: Sun gives benefic results in the 3rd from Moon 
sign. At the same time any other planet, suppose Jupiter, is in 9th 
from Moon, the benefic results to be given by sun get cancelled 
by presence of Jupiter in 91h from Moon. In case Saturn is placed 
at 9th place, instead of Jupiter, the good results of Sun will not 
get cancelled as there are no Vedha between Sun and Saturn. 

Vipareetha Veda When a planet is to give malefic results in a 
certain place from Birth Moon sign, and if some other planet is 
positioned in specific other place from birth Moon sign, the malefic 
results of the planet is cancelled. This is called Vipareetha Vedha. 

Given below are the places where specific planet gives bad 
results and corresponding Vipareetha Vedha positions. 

Now to clarify, we give below the Vipareetha Vedha place 
the top place and explain below.

of Saturn 

Vipreetha vedha places are the same for Mars, Saturn and 
Ketu. 

There is no Vipareetha Vedha to Sun by Saturn and similarly 
for Mercury by Moon. 

The concept of Vipreetha Vedha is very useful . Suppose Saturn 
is 12th from Janma Rasi for a native this beginning of 7Vi years 
Sade Sathi and at the same time Jupiter is in 3rd from Janma Rasi. 
The evil effects of Saturn's transit will not be felt by the native 
during one year period when Jupiter is in 3rd from Janma Moon. 
In the same way other cases are to be understood. We have shown 
Vipareetha Vedha positions for all the nine planets above. There 
are other malefic transit positions than the ones shown above, 
but there are no corresponding Vipreetha Vedha positions. 
Therefore evil effects of this will be felt by native. 

For example there is no Vipareetha Vedha for Janma guru 
Therefore evil effects of this will be felt by native. If Sadhe Sati of 
Shani is running and Jupiter is not his 3rd, fast moving planets 
Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars move through the same bhava, 
there will be more ordeal during these short periods. This is how 
combined effects of transit are judged. 

• •• 



Chapter Twenty Three 



NAKSHATHRA VEDHA 



The good or evil effects of planetary transit through stars get 
neutralised by occupation of certain specified stars by planets 
reckoned from the stars occupied by the planet under 
consideration. This is called Nakshathra Vedha. These are in all 
16 (two each for the 7 planets and 2 jointly for the nodes) position 
as under:

In order to understand the above, suppose the Sun is in Aswini 
Nakshatra in the birth horoscope. The 9th Nakshatra therefrom 
is Aslesha. When Rahu or Ketu moves in Aslesha Nakshatra most 
of the good effects indicated by other planetary transit will be 
suspended and only malefic effects will come to pass. Again, the 
15th Nakshatra from Aswini is Swathi. When Ketu comes to move 
in Swathi, similar effects are expected. In the same way, the other 
Nakshatra Vedhas as above should not be ignored in considering 
any transit effect. It is a different matter, if the directional 
influences are particularly favourable to the native. 



Chapter Twenty Four 



TRANSIT STELLAR OCCUPATIONAL 

RESULTS 



Transit results so far explained at best can be defined as 
general. These results get modified by certain other factors. They 
are explained below: 

Nakshathra Gochara as found in Phala Deepika. 

1. Stellar occupational effect. 

2. Nakshathra Anga Phalam - occupation of certain parts of 
one's body during transit of planets. 

3. Moorthi Nirnaya method- This is based on the position of 
transit Moon from Natal Moon when any planet enters a new 
sign. This has been discussed in detail separately. 

NAKSHATRA GOCHARAM 
SAPTHASALAKA 



(IviKP^HiRdisft TO^f^TFirafai 

Draw seven lines horizontally (from west to east) and over 
them draw seven lines vertical. The 28 extremities or points 
reckoned from the north east are to be allotted to the 28 stars 
(includng Abhijit) counted from Krittika. If the star occupied by 
the Sun at the time happens to be the vedha asterism to the natal 



210

star, danger to life has to be foreseen, if to the Adhana Nakshatra, 
19th from Janmanakshatra, there will be fear and anxiety; if the 
10th from Janmanakshatra, loss of wealth will be the result Should 
however the Sun in the above positions be also assodated with a 
malefic, death can be expected.

If any one of the three asterims referred to above be thus 
marred by the occupation of other malefics (other than the Sun), 
death may happen; if by benefics, there will be no danger to life. 
Everything should be judged similarly. 

3wn+^yfaMiHvjj$ chifei<+> wor§ °wff&\ 



Transit Stellar Occupational Results 211 

If the 19th, 10th, 3rd, 1st, 23rd, 5th or 7th (all reckoned from 
the Janmatara) are afflicted by malefics during their transit, there 
will be danger to life. But if the planet be benetic, failure in business 
will be the only result. 

For Adhana, Karmarksha Vainasika etc, refer Jatakaparijata. 

^r+iPwd ^"cwi^gh *t*i-*mV wwwiftjfs^ii 

The three asterims (viz Janma Anujanma, Trijanma), 1st, 10th 
and 19th falling on a day identical with the Sun r s Sankramana 
(Sun r s entry into a new Rasi) or at a time when any of the other 
planets transit from one Rasi to another or when there is an edipse, 
unexpected occurrence, then death or a similar untoward event 
should be expected. 

Ulka denotes the 10th star from the one governed by the Sun 
(vide Kalaprakasika Ch XXXM : 116, Tanjore Edition). But 
Balabhadra says it is the 21st star counted from that occupied by 
the Sun. 

All the above may be special aspects of consideration of 
Gochara or Transit. The conventional special aspect should be both 
weighed along with Dasa bukthi and then the trend of life at 
particular time can be finally judged correctly. First we take up 
stellar occupational effect. 

Our zodiac is occupied by 12 Rasis and 27 stars. The 27 stars 
equally spread over the 12 Rasis at the rate 2 V4 stars for each Rasi. 
The 9 planets also pass through these 27 star one by one. While 
they pass through 12 Rasis, native is born in any one of these 
Rasis. Moon may be placed in any one of the 27 stars. The same 
star becomes our birth star or Janma Nakshathra and the Rasi in 
which the Moon is placed is called our Janma Rasi or Birth Moon 
sign. 

Stellar occupational effect is mainly considered in the 2 ways 
namely Stellar Occupation and Nakshatra Anga Phala 

I. Stellar Occupational Effect 

Native is born in any one of the 27 stars. This is called his 
Janma Nakshatra or birth star. At any time a planet is found to be 



212 



Godiv fliahdeepika 



transiting through a particular star, this star counted from birth 
star forms the basis of dedding good or bad results. There are 27 
stars. They are distributed in 3 cycles of 9 each as given below. 
The cyde repeats during the transit. 



1. Janma Nakshatra 

2. Sampath Nakshatra (Tara) 

3. Vipath Nakshatra (Tara) 

4. Kshema Tara (Nakshatra)

The planet may be occupying a star belonging to any one of 
the three cycles 1-9, 10-18 or 19-27. The count of star occupied by 
a planet reckoned from Janma Nakshatra may be in one of the 9 
stars in any of the three cycles. Suppose it is in 3 it is in Vipath 
Tara (first cycle). If it is in 12th star it is 3rd in the 2nd cycle, hence 
Vipath Tara. If it is in 21st star it is again 3rd star but in the third 
cycle. Accordingly for Janma Tara Aswini 3rd' 12th and 21st stars 
are Vipath Tara, and complete list of all the Tara's will be as given 
below in Table 15.

We can ascertain the net results of transit in the following 
way : 

The benefic planets (Venus, Jupiter and waxing Moon, Mercury 
if joined or aspected by the benefics) when passing through 
trikonas (5 and 9) from Janma Rasi and also posited in benefic 



214 GodwFhabdtvpika 

stars stated above will give very much bencfic results. If they 
pass through kendras (1, 4, 7, 10) and are also in benefic stars 
they give moderate good results. 

If these planets pass through benefic stars in other signs, they 
will not give good results. It will be neutral only. 

If Malefic planets (Sun, waning Moon, Mercury joined 
and aspected by malefics, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu) 
passes through 8th and 12th Rasis from Janma Rasi and also pass 
through malefic stars, their conventional malefic results will be 
intensified. 

If planets pass through Janma 5th, 9th Rasis (Trikonas) and 
also pass through malefic stars, there will be neutral results. If 
they transit benefic stars, the malefic results will be reduced and 
there will be practically no bad results. 

For example, we will take the case of Hasta Nakshatra born 
native. Suppose Venus passes 9th from Hasta and Rishaba rasi 
which has 9 quarters of 3 stars the later 3 quarters of Krithika, 4 
quarters of Rohini and first 2 quarters of Mrigasirsha. Say Venus 
is in Mrigasirisha, it happens to be 20th star from the Janma 
Nakshatra for the native under reference, which is Sampath Tara, 
Sampath Tara gives good results. Venus will be benefic by virtue 
of occupying Sampath Tara. Therefore, naturally good results of 
Venus will be intensified. 

We can also understand the stellar occupational results in yet 
another way. When a planet is expected to give conventional good 
results in transit but passes through Janma, Vipath, Prathyak and 
Vadha Tara, the malefic results will be moderate. During transit 
over Vipat, Prathyak and Vadha Tara, results will be malefic go 
on increasing. Similarly passage through Kshema, sampath, 
Deivanukula , Mithra, and Parama Maithra stars intensifies good 
effects more and more. 

II. Nakshatra anga phala 

According to this wc count the star over which planet is passing 
through from the birth star of a person upto 27th star 
continuously. These stars have been asssigned various limbs of 
the body of a native and planets is imagined to be passing through 
those limbs. In our ancient tradition, there is a way of ascertaining 
results for these passages of planets through stars.These results 
are shown below:

There is yet another way of knowing the stellar results. Find 
out in what week day your janma nakshatra falls. According to 
that the results of the month will either be good or bad. 

1. If it falls on Sunday - There will be travel 

throughout the month. 

2. If it falls on Monday - Good, timely delicious food. 

3. if it falls on Tuesday - He will be lazy. Accidents 

may occur due to fire, 

electricity. 

Fear in passing examination, 

confusion 

Timely delicious food, 

comforts, happiness, freeness. 

6. If it falls on Friday - Happiness. Freeness. 

7. If it falls on Saturday - There will be some trouble 

during the month. 

Let us see how Anga phala are seen: 

For example, let us take Chitra as birth star of a certain person. 
Suppose Saturn is passing through the Sravana star which is 9th 
from Chitra. For this the result is given as loss as he passes through 
Right leg. 

According to Choodamani Ullomudaiyan he will be in legs. 
For the result will be travel. 

If in conventional, transit analysis the planet gives good results 
and good in Panga Phala, the period will be very good. If one is 
good and the other is bad, the result will be moderate and if both 
are bad the result will be very bad.

MOORTHY NIRNAYA 



' Moorthy nirnaya is yet another method of judging results. 
This is judged on the basic position of transit Moon from natal 
Moon, when a planet goes to a new Rasi . 

1. When a planet is entering a new Rasi the Rasi occupied by 
transit Moon at that moment happens to be 1,6 and 11th 
from Janma Rasi, the planet is said to be Swarna Moorty 
(gold). 

2. If the Moon is in 2, 5 and 9th from one's Janma Rasi on that 
day, then the planet becomes Rajatha Moorty (silver). 

3. Likewise if Moon is in 3, 7, 10 from Janma Rasi, it becomes 
Tamra Moorthy (Copper). 

4. Moon in 8,4,12 from Natal Moon is Loh Moorthi (iron) 
The results for Moorthy Nirnaya is as follows: 

For Swarna Moorthy (Gold) good results 

For Rajatha Moorthy (Silver) 3/4 good 

For Thambra Moorthy (Copper) 1/2 good 

For Loha Moorthy (Iron) 1/4 good 

The above will be for benefic planets. But for the malefic 
planets, the result for Moorthy's are : 

1. Rajatha Moorthy good results 

2. Thambra Moorthy 3/4 good 

3. Loha Moorthy 1/2 good 

4. Swarna Moorthy 1/4 good 

The above is called special aspect and the method explained 
earlier is called conventional. When we combine both, the result 



220 GodivPhabdcqxki 

can be put under following categories: 

1. Benefic results as per conventional aspect. 

2. Malefic results as per conventional aspect. 

3. Benefic results as per special aSpect-Swarna Moorthy. 

4. Three quarter benefic results as per special aspect-Raj atha 
Moorthy. 

5. Half benefic results as per special aspect-Thambra Moorthy. 

6. Quarter benefic results as per special aspect-Loha Moorthy. 

7. Full benefic results as per both aspects, 

8. Full malefic results as per both aspects. 

Now we can quantify the results by analysis of the 6 kind of 
results according to both aspects quantify cumulative net results. 

If we take the full benefic results as one unit and allot 1/2 unit 
for special aspect, and we have to distribute this 1/2 unit for 4 
kinds of special aspects then we can have the net results as follows: 

1. Benefic results as per conventional aspect =0.500 

2. Malefic results as per conventional aspect = Nil 

3. Benefic for Swarna Moorthy = 0.500 

4. Benefic for Rajatha Moorthy = 0.250 

5. Benefic for Thambra Moorthy = 0.125 

6. Benefic for Loha Moorthy = 0.0625 
Now we will explain this by an example. 

On 9.1.1998 at 1.38 a.m. Jupiter entered Kumbha from Makara 
and Moon in Mesha. Due to this Jupiter becomes as various 
Moorthys as follows. 

1. Swarna Moorthy for Gemini, Scorpio and Aries Janma 
Rashis Quantum will be 1/2 

2. Rajatha Moorthy for Leo, Sagittarius and Pisces Janma 
Rashis Quantum will be 1 /4 



Sado SAti and Saturn s Various SpcciaJ Transitional Effects 221 

3. Thambra Moorthy for Cancer, Libra and Aquarius Janma 
Rashis Quantam will be 1/8 

4. He becomes Loha Moorthy for Virgo, Capricorn and 
Taurus Janma Rashis Quantum will be 1/16 

As explained earlier, we have taken the unit value of benefic 
results as one and out of 1/2 unit is fox the conventional aspect 
and 1/2 for the 4 Moorthy aspect which is further distributed 
among 4 Moorthys as shown above. Now when we consider both 
the aspects, the results are as follows. 

Jupiter's transit in 2, 5, 7, 9 and 11 from Janma Moon is good 
so for results are benefic Mesha (11) Mithuna (9) Simha (7) Tula 
(5) and Makara (2). This is according to conventional aspect. Now 
we will see how this gets modified due to Moorthy Nirnaya for 
different Janma Rashis. 

1. For Aries he becomes Swarna Moorthy. Hence Jupiter's 
conventional good results in Ilth from Moon get enhanced. 

2. For Mithuna also he becomes a Swarna" Moorthy. 
Jupiter's good results as per conventional aspects in 7th are 
increased considerably. 

3. For Simha, he becomes Rajatha Moorthy. Hence his 
benefic results as per conventional aspect in 7lh are increased 

considerably. 

4. For Tula, he is in 5th and becomes Thambra Moorthy so no 
Moorthy phala and his good results in 5th as per conventional 
aspect will get reduced slightly. 

5. For Capricorn people, he becomes as Loha Moorthy. 
Hence Jupiter's good results in second as per conventional 
aspect get greatly reduced. 

II. Jupiter gives bad results for the remaining 7 Rasis, Taurus, 
Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius. We 
will now see how the bad results get modified. 

1. Jupiter becomes Loha Moorthy for Taurus people. Jupiter 
gives bad results in 10 as per conventional aspect. Hence 
his bad results are intensified for these people. 



222 



GxharPhahdtypprka 



2. For Cancer Jupiter becomes Thambra Moorthy. The bad 
results as per conventional aspect for Jupiter in 8 get 
intensified considerably more. 

3. For Virgo people Jupiter goes to 6th house. Jupiter is Loha 
Moorthy. Hence the bad results of Jupiter on conventional 
aspect get greatly increased if not doubled. 

4. For Scorpio people Jupiter becomes Swarna Moorthy. Hence 
his bad results for these people in 4th as per conventional 
aspect get reduced more than 50% for these people. 

5. For Sagittarius born people Jupiter becomes Loha Moorthy. 
Jupiter on conventional side gives the worst of the results in 
3rd house. As Loha Moorthy he doubly increases the bad 
results. As such, these people will suffer the most among all 
Rasi people. 

6. Jupiter in 12th for Capricorn people gives bad results. Here 
also he becomes Loha Moorthy. Hence Jupiter's conventional 
bad results in 12 get doubly increased. Hence Capricorn 
people will also suffer very much. 

7. Jupiter is in Janma (1) for Aquarius Rasi Bom people. 
He becomes Thambra Moorthy for Aquarius this time. Hence 
the bad results. 

In this way we have to judge Moorthy and conventional aspect 
of Jupiter jointly for all the 12 Rasis. 

Now combining both the aspects, we can quantify the 
cumulative quantum benefic results as shown below:

In this way. the Transit result are judged on the basis of net 
effect. It can be seen that: 

1. Very good results are enjoyed by Mesha and Gemini 
people (according to both rules). 

2. Very bad results are suffered by Taurus and Virgo people 
according to both rules. Jupiter and Saturn are Varsha 
Grahas. Hence we can quantify net results by both aspects in 
this way. Readers are referred to see my article that appeared 
in Astrological magazine issue copy of which is furnished in 
the appendix for more comprehension. They may also refer 
to my articles regarding Saturn which appeared in 
Astrological magazine, also given in appendix. The Moorthy 
Nirnaya methods are gready explained in tamil texts only. 
But one of the Sanskrit text Vyavahara jyotisha Prakashika 
has given Moorthy results for Saturn alone. 



Chapter Twenty Six 

SADE S ATI AND SATURN'S VARIOUS 
SPECIAL TRANSITIONAL EFFECTS 



Saturn is the most malefic planet and is feared very much. 
Here his transit effects are studied from different angles. 

1. Ardhashtama or Kamtaka Sani (Saturn in 4th from Moon) 

2. Ashtama Sani (Saturn in 8th from Moon) 

3. 7 l /2 y ears Sade Sati Sani (Saturn in 12th, 1st and 
2nd from Moon sign) 

SADE SATI AND SATURN'S VARIOUS 
SPECIAL TRANSITIONAL EFFECTS 

~ ... r .«„..« «. .,««. — ... ^~ y w«.^ «..« 

remains in a Rasi for 2V2 years. He gives good results only in 3, 6 
and llthRasis from birth Moon. In all the other houses, he is 
malefic. This means that in one round of Saturn he gives good 
results 2V2 x 3 = 7Vj years 3/6/1 1 from Moon and in remaining 
9 Rasis, (22 V2 year) bad results. At this rate for 90 years life span 
he will complete 3 rounds and good results will be for 22 V2 years 
only, for most part of his life. Now we will see how the intensity 
of malefic results are distributed during his each round. 

1. He is good in 3, 6, 11th houses. 

2. In 5, 9 and 10th houses he gives moderately bad results. 

3. In 1th house called Ardhashtama or Kantaka Sani is 
considerably worse than in 5, 9 and 10th. 

4. In 8th, he is called Ashtama Sani. This is little bit worse and 
next for 7 x fi years of sadesathi and gives more bad results 
only. 



5. In 12 and 2nd houses it is first and last 2Vj years of 7'/^ 
years of Saturn. This is highly malefic which needs to be 
guarded well. 

6. Janma Sani is the period of 2V2 years when Saturn is in birth 
Moon sign and it is highly malefic period and dangerous 
even to life. 

Saturn gives worst results for 7'/2 only during the period of 
life, the bad results of Saturn in other Rasis will be endurable 
with some remedial measures. 

A detailed description in the chapter 17 on the transit of Saturn 
is given for the convenience of the natives. Out of these, Ashtama 
Sani and Ardhashtama Sani are called Kalyani and Laghu Kalyani 
in some texts prevalent in northern India. For Laghu Kalyani 
Ardhashtama Sani i.e. Saturn in 4th, the following results arc given. 

There will be diseases, enmity with relatives and friends, 
miseries, sorrows, unwanted wandering to various places without 
any aim and benefit and mental worries. 

During Ashtama Sani(KaIyan) there is fear of maraka, danger 
to life if judged life span coincides or sorrows and critical bad 
effects equivalent to death, sorrows, pain, fear of fire accidents, 
attacked by weapons and the like. 

Now we will look into the results and various aspects of Saturn 
7 l /i years of Sadesathi. 

It has already been stated that except 3,6 and 11th houses 
from Janma Rasi, in all other 9 houses, Saturn gives bad to worse 
results. Out of these he is worst as Janma Sani, the middle of 
Sadesathi. 

When vvc analyse the bad results which Sani gives as 
Arthashtama Sani, Knnta Sani, Ashtama Sani, only in 4 places his 
results arc very bad which comes to TO years including Janma 
Sani. For three rounds of Saturn, this comes to 30 years. There is 
a proverb in Tamil which says there is no body who has lived 
continuously happily for 30 years nor anybody who has 
continuously suffered for 30 years'. 

This dictum conveys the sense that Sani gives bad results for 
30 years in the whole life span of 90 years intermittently in 2V2 



226 GodurlTuihdeepika 

years periods. Out of all these only, the Janma Sani is worst and 
detrimental. Now we will sec 7 l /s years Saturn for Jataka of 
different Ayukanda. Madhyamayush Jathaka, will have 7 l /z years 
of Saturn Sadcsati twice but for Alpayus Jathaka once only. 

For the Deergayush Jataka, the first -ound of Saturn is called 
in Tamil as 'Mangu Sani' which means dull Sani. The next round 
of 7 l / 2 years of Saturn is called 'Pongu' Sani which means 
overflowing Sani. The third round Sa/ii is called 'Maraka' Sani 
which means death inflicting Sani. 

For a Jataka of more than 90 years life span even 4th round of 
Saturn's 7 1/2 years are possible. In such a case, the third round 
Saturn is called 'Kungu' Sani which means depressing Sani. Now 
we will look into the nature of these 4 rounds of Saturn. 

1. Mangu Sani : This can be also called manda (dull) Sani. 
During this period there will be many difficulties. There will be 
harassment from the government, many trials and ordeals 
including bad health, Education will be spoiled. 

2. Pongu Sani : This can be called as Fertile Sani. Auspicious 
functions like education, marriages, fruitful project work etc. may 
be finished by the native. 

The first part will however be bad and in the last part two 
parents may pass away. In this last part, all that is lost during 
sadesathi will be regained or compensated. 

3. Kungu Sani (frozen): This can be called depressing 
Saturn. During third round of Saturn's sadesathi, those who 
have poornayush will suffer from mental worries, agony, 
mourning, death of relatives, sonows, miseries. If judged life span 
is also coinciding, the native may even pass away. 

4. Marana Sani : This is very bad. If the native does not die 
during third round Saturn, then during this period if judged life 
span gets completed certainly passes away. 

Out of all the above 4 rounds only the 2 1/2 years of Janma 
Sani is very bad and critical and malefic results are maximum in 
each of the rounds. Tamil texts declare special results for this Janma 
Sani. There will be fear of death (during Janma Sani of 3rd round 
or 4th round) In other rounds, there will be petty quarrels, many 



Sade Sati and Saturn's Various Special Transitional Effects 227 

chronic diseases, humiliation, loss of self-respect, fear of death, 
mental agony, hysteria, confusion etc. 

5. Anga Sani : This comes under 7Vj yoars Saturn and 
is different from what has been told earlier under Nakshatra Anga 
Sani. Here the 7 J /j years period is distributed among various parts 
of the body. During 90 months, Saturn is supposed to pass one by 
one through certain parts of the body for specific period . 

1. In first 2*/2 years, Saturn passes through Head. 

2. In second 2V2 years, Saturn passes through Heart. 

3. In last 2V2 years, Saturn passes through Feet. 

Among above when Saturn crosses the heart in the middle 
2V2 years worst results are felt. 

There is a special interpretation of malefic results of Saturn 
and other planets during transit, in which each planet is said to 
give very bad results only in a single house specified among all 
the Rasis. The planet Saturn is said to give bad results specially 
during 7 V2 years as explained by ancient Tamil seer Pulippani in 
his Pulippani '30(K. We are giving below the Tamil verse in Roman 
script. 

Kelappa katakam than singamjanmam 
Kcduthi migachaivandadaa veadalundu 
Nalappa nalamagum matra rasi 
Narach chugamum .kittumadaa veattamundu 

The above verse explains the nature of 12 Rasis i.e. we have 
Charam (Movable) Sthiram (Fixed) and Ubhayam (Mutable). 
Mesham is Charam next Rishabam Sthiram and Mithunam 
Ubhayam and so on. 

7Vj years Saturn will be very bad to Chara Rasis falling under 
influence of Karakata, lesser malefic to Sthira Rasis starting from 
Simha but for Ubhaya Rasis not bad at all. In the above verse 
Katakam and Vrichikam are mentioned, Katakam means rasis in 
anti clockwise from upto kumbam belonging to Moon. There are 
only two Chara Rashis in this half, the Karkata and the Mesha. 
However, Mesha Rasi born people will not suffer very much in 
7V2 years Saturn. 



228 GodurlfabideepiJa 

Singham means rashis clockwise upto Makar belong to sun. 
Singam means the fixed rashis, one of this 6 Rasis belonging to 
Sun. In this group the fixed sign-Simha and Vrischika born people 
will suffer less than Chara Rasi bom natives in 7 l / 2 years Saturn. 

It is very clear that the natives of Ubhaya Rasis will be not 
effected by 7 l / 2 years Saturn. 

Theal' which means Vrischika, Rasi natives will suffer more 
than the natives of Simha Rasi. 

To summarise, 

1. Out of the Chara Rasi, Kataka born people will suffer most 
since Saturn is in opposition to Moon, Here we can say that 
he has left Mesha though its lord Mars is enemy to Saturn 
but Saturn gets debilitated here. So the conclusion is that out 
of the Chara Rasis only Kataka people will suffer the worst 
results. 

2. Lords of Simha and Vrishchika, Sun and Mars respec- 
tively, are inimical to Saturn. But Vrischika is next to Satums 
exaltation sign hence more powerful to do bad. We should 
understand that out of the fixed signs only Leo and Vrischika 
people will suffer next to the Chara Rasi bom people. 

3. All other Rasis people, especially belong to Ubhaya Rasi will 
not suffer the 7 x / 2 years Saturn much. Bad effects of Saturn 
will be in the order given below; 

a. Kataka only among Chara Rasis. 

b. Simha and Vrischika among Sthira Rasis. 

c. All the 12 Rasis when Saturn passes as Janma Sani. 

d.Thc 4 Ubhaya Rasis people will not suffer at all during 
7V2 years Saturn except for the middle 2'/2 years, as 
Janma Sani. 

The ancient Sage Pulippani has comprehensively covered 
details within the above four lines. 

Saturn's 7 l / 2 years results can be analysed in yet another way. 
The total 90 months period is distributed among the limbs of the 
native with specific results as given below:

It can be see from the above, in each round of the 7 1/2 years 
Saturn does not give bad results throughout 90 months. Thus out 
of 90 months more or less 60 months one good, only 4 months 
fatal and rest moderately bad. 

There is yet another set of interesting information indicating 
in which part of Sadhe Sati, Saturn is worst with reference to

If in the natal horoscope, Saturn is in one of the Kendra 7Vi 
years of Saturn will not give bad results. There is also another 
way of judging the results of V/i years Saturn. When IVi years 
Saturn begins, it is imagined to come on some vahana or animal 
vehicle. This is found out as shown below. Find put the star in 
which Moon is placed when Sadhe Sati starts. .This star should be 
from the Janma Nakshatra and divided by 9. 

The remainder decides the Vahana as follows: 



1. Ass 

2. Horse 

3. Elephant 

4. Buffalo 

5. Lion 

6. Jackal 

7. Crow 



Bad 

Success 

Comfort 

Moderate 

Destruction of enemies 

Mourning 

Conflict 

Gain 



8. Peacock 

9. Hamsa Comforts 

With the help of above information we can find out good or 
bad part of Sadhe Sati or results of Vahana will show net effect 
for the whole period. This will help to find out tendency either 
good or bad for the 7Vz years of Saturn. 

In this chapter delineation of 7Vi years period has been outlined 
in 10 different ways. By eliminating evil results we would notice 
that suffering period is very much reduced. 



Sade Sad and Saturn's Various Special Transitional Effects 231 

SATURN'S CYCLIC EFFECTS SANI PARYAYA PHALA 

So far, we have explained its cyclic effects with reference to 
7V4 years Saturn. Now we will discuss the same for all the 
12 places from Janma Rasi for the various rounds of Saturn. This 
is called Paryaya. 

FIRST PARYAYA OF SATURN 

During 1st Paryaya, Sani gives the following results: 

1. In first Rasi or Janma Rasi, this being child hood, the child 
suffers from infantile diseases. 

2. In the second Rasi, he gives the same results namely infantile 
diseases. ! 

3. In the third Rasi though Saturn is said to give very good 
results, he gives many difficulties. 

4. When he goes to 4th Rasi, though said to to be Ardhashtama, 
the difficulties will be lesser. According to Ashtaka Varga 
the effect will depend upon number of bindus. This has been 
discussed separately in detail. This may happen upto 10th 

year of age. 

5. When Saturn goes to 5th from Jaiuma Rasi there may be risk 
of danger to the life of mother (6, 7, 8th). When Saturn goes 
to 6th house from Janma Rasi, during that time if there is 
Maraka Dasa besides ashtamadhipathi bukthi running the 
body becomes weak and tired. Bad time and melancholous 
mood and displeasure from friends will come to pass. If in 
6th house from Janma Rasi, where the 1 1th Lord is in navamsa 
or in drekkana, then the mother may surely pass away. 

6. When Saturn passes through 7th house from Janma Rasi, there 
will be sickness to self or own brothers a^d sisters. Both in 
6th and 7th houses, there will be mental worry and hysteria 
like condition, unwanted change of place, unnecessary fear 
etc. The same thing will continue to prevail until satum crosses 
8th house from Moon. When Saturn passes through 9th Rasi 
from Moon, the native gets fame and name and will start his 
own earning. But generally in the first round, there will be 



232 Godufnu^c/ti^ifci 

poverty for Saturn's transit from Janma Rasi to 8th house. In 
9th house from Janma Rasi, there will be comforts. In 10th 
house from Janma Rasi, there will be friendship with a 
businessman or with a man who will help in the career. In 
the last portion of this 10th Rasi, marriage of the native may 
take place here after comforts, good employment or a 
thriving business. 

7. When Saturn goes to 11th from Janma Rasi, there will be 
friendship with a business man or the native gets a business 
partner or gets help from a friend for progress in job. 

8. When Saturn passes through 12th from Janma Rasi, the native 
may be up to 28th year, there will be mainly health problem 
which can be cured by adopting remedial measures. 

In the natal horoscope, during first round, if Saturn is 
Vargottama, there will be comforts and progress in education 
even up to 30th year of age and good Raja Yoga (good 
employment, marriage to partner of higher status, receipt of money 
etc.) will happen. By this time, the native may have reached nearly 
27th year of age. 

CYCLIC EFFECT IN SATURN'S SECOND ROUND 

1. In Janma Rasi there will be bodily comfort, easy going life, 
progress in business, partnership and friendship with VIPs, 
increase of income, name and fame. There may be enmity 
with brothers and sisters, division of property (Pithru or 
Paternal etc.) among brothers and danger to the life of 
brothers or sisters. 

2. When Saturn goes to the second house from Janma Rasi there 
will be comforts of high standard and happy days. 

3. When Saturn is in 3rd house from Janma Rasi, increase in 
income, copious supply of essentials in the house, provisions 
etc. are enjoyed. There will be progress in education, fame 
and name and little income to the mother or little income 
from mother to the native. 

4 When Saturn goes to 4th from Janma Rasi, there will be gain 
of money and birth of child, especially for a female. There 
will be comforts at home and out si^e. But senior paternal 



Side Sail and Saturn 's Various Special Transitional Effects 233 

relation may pass away and then* may be quarrels between 
paternal relations (Gnathis) for properties. 

5. When Saturn goes to 5th house from Janma Rasi there will 
be good income, sickness to the self, danger and bad time to

OTHER TRANSIT RESULTS OF SATURN 

Other points to be considered in Gochara results of Saturn: 

Where Sani in Gochara will be passing through the same Rasi 
where he is in natal chart, he will be going through 9 navamsas of 
that Rasi. Find out the navamsa and its Lord. Find out also which 
Bhavas navamsa Lord owns in the natal chart and also their 
karakatvas. These bhavas and karakatvas of the planet in question 
gets affected in addition to general transit results of Saturn. 

1. When Saturn passes through the Rasi or Navamsa where 
Sun is in natal chart, then there is danger to life of father or 
paternal relatives may have bad time. 

This is also true when Saturn happens to go through thrikona 
of the planets, the karakatvas of the planet get affected. Both 

these two factors affect the karakatvas. 

* 

2. When Saturn crosses the Rasi and 1 ' navamsas where 
Lagnadipati of the natal chart is placed, then the native gets 
bodily pain, sickness etc., 



Sade Sati and Sa rum's Various Special Transitional Effects 235 

3. When it crosses the Rasi containing lord of 2nd, there will be 
loss of money, bad health and danger to the life of wife, no 
food or no timely food. 

4. Similarly, if Saturn crosses the Rasi occupied by 3rd lords his 
navamsa and drekkana, there will be bad time to brothers 
or sisters, servants and ear trouble. 

5. Again, when Saturn crosses the 4th lord, there will be danger 
to the life of father, Guru and VIPs known to the native. 

6. Similarly, if Saturn crosses the 5th Lord, or he crosses the 
Rasi, Navamsa, and drekkana occupied by Jupiter, there will 
be passing away of children or bad time to them. His 
knowledge and discriminative power fails. 

7. Again when Saturn crosses 6th Lord his elder brother gets 
affected and may pass away or the relatives of elder brother 
will have bad condition. The native also falls sick. His 
maternal uncle gets affected and his relatives may also suffer. 

8. Similarly, if Saturn crosses 7th Lord, there will be danger to 
the life of native, impediments, difficulties during travel and 
decline in income. 

9. If Saturn crosses 8th Lord the native gets tired and weak, 
there will be danger to life and generally difficult time is 

indicated. 

10. If Satum crosses 9th Lord, there will be destruction of fortune

the life of the children. His name and reputation will be 
spoiled.

CYCLIC RESULTS OF JUPITER 

In the same way, Jupiter's results can be explained. He will 
give benefic results in most of the cases except Dusthanas. 

In general, it can be said that if Jupiter crosses crosses the 
Lagnadhipathi, Dasanath and their occupied Rasi and navamsa 
etc. there will be marriage, success in business, getting jobs and 
success in general; welfare will be achieved and there will be name 
and fame. 

Jupiter passes through the 12 signs of the zodiac in roughly 12 
year. Each round is called paryaya. In most cases Jupiter may not 
complete more than 6 paryayas in an individual's life. The effects 
of such paryaya are given below according to Tamil tradition are: 

Jupiter in his 1st round is is said to cause danger to life. If he 
is in 8th house. H is also said that the father will enjoy quite 
contrary results getting all comforts, elevation etc, while the native 
will suffer. 

If during the 2nd round Jupiter is in Aries or Taurus there 
will not be bad results if the above signs happen to be the 1st, 
3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th or 12th from the Moon-sign and there will be 
no good results in the other houses. This will apply to natives 
below 24 years. 

During the 3rd paryaya, he does good in the 1st, 4th, 5th, 
7th, 11th and 12th signs from one's Moonsign. 

During the 4th round in Janma Rasi, he gives fear from 
Goverment, gain of wealth in the 2nd and comforts in the 5th 
house, gain of property in the 9th and gain of money in the 11th 
and 12th houses from the Moon-sign. 

During the 5th round, he gives mental anxiety in Janma, gain 
of wealth in the 2nd and comforts in the 4th from the Moon-sign, 

During the 6th round, he gives good effects in the 2nd, 5th, 7 
th 9th and 11th houses from the Moon-sign and gives danger to 
life in the 8th provided there is a maraka dasa or the 3rd round of 
7Vi year transit of Saturn is on. 

For example, let us assume Jupiter is in Gemini during his 1st 
round for a person born during July 1930 from the Moon-sign 
virgo. When he passes through Taurus, the paryaya will end. When 
the native Ls 69 years of age Jupiter will be in 6th round. During 
this round jupiter is supposed to give good results in the 2nd, 5th, 



Sade Sati and Satum'sVarious SpecialTransitiorial Effects 237 

7th, 9th and 11th from the Moon sign as usual. If he passes through 
the 8th during this round and the period coincides with maraka 
Dasa, there will be danger to life which may happen when Jupiter 
passes through Aries 8th in this round viz. after June 1979. Cyclic 
results for the other age groups can be ascertained similarly.

Chapter Twenty Seven 



GOCHAR AND ASHTAKAVARG A 



The effect of transit of varions planets is known from Janma 
Rasi or Chandra lagna in Indian system. In the west Sun Lagna is 
taken as the starting point. In the natal Chart the point rising in 
the eastern horizon at the time of birth of a native is Lagna. This 
is taken as the reference point and different bhavas or houses 
depict different features and aspects of the life of a native. Wc 
also know good or bad position of different planets form Lagna. 
There is yet another way of looking at this. In which places a 
planet is good or evil from itself or "what one such favourable 
position of different planets from themselves in respect of a 
particular planet. This is an answer in a unique system of 
progression called 'Ashtakavarga' given by our sages. 

Ashta means eight, seven planets and lagna are considered to 
form 8 vargas or divisions. (Rahu and Ketu being Chaya Grahas 
are not considered in Ashtakavarga). These 7 planets, do good or 
evil from each of their own position for planet under consideration 
based on proven principles. The good places are called bindus 
and the bad places arc called 'rekhas' But generally good 
points arc projected and taken for consideration. Cumulatively 
all these bindus give a picture of good or bad results for each 
bhava as reflected in 'Ashtakavarga'. Readers may refer to any 
standard texts like Ashtakaharga System of Predictions 1 by Dr. 
B.V. Raman for more details. Here we consider the good bindus 
contributed by each planet in each bhava and the cumulative bindus 
or favourablepoints in each of the bhavas contributed by all planets. 
The former is called Binnashtak varga and the latter is called 
Sarvashtak varga. 



GocharandAshtakvarga 241 

To know the day-to-day results from Moon's position is a 
gross method . Ashtakavarga is very effectively used in Gochar 
analysis. This is being explained here. 

The total beneficial points are computed in Sarvashtak varga. 
This is further reduced by thrikona shodhana and ekadhipatya 
shodhana to know more definite results by adopting more 
sophisticated calculations. We will consider the Sarvashtak varga 
and Binnashtakavarga, and corelate them with transits. Let us 
understand how to analyse. 

1. First, Ashtakavarga results in each rasi or bhava. Each rasi 
contains 30 degrees, which is divided into 8 equal parts of 3"-45* 
each called Kakshal Each division is lorded by a planet in the 
following manner: 

1. T to 3 3 /*° -Saturn 



2. 


3%°

7tt°

3.

22 W 


- Mercury 


7. 


22W° 


to 


26 V*° 


- Moon 



8. 26%° to 30° - Lagna 

During the transit a planet in a rasi, if it is expected to give 
malefic result from the Janma rasi, but passes through the protion 
which has benefic bindus, then net result is good only. Conversely 
if the planet goes through the portion, where no benefic bindus 
are contributed by other planets, then only bad result will happen. 

We take an example of Kanya rasi native. Suppose Satumis 
moving in 4th house Dhanus and crosses 11° 15', of Mars. Moon 
in Saturn's Ashtakavarga has contributed benefic bindus, then 
until such time, Saturn finishes journey through the said portion 
of Mars, Saturn will give good results and there will be no 
Ardhashtama Shani's problems. But if Mars has not contributed 
benefic bindu in Dhanu, then the problems of Ardhashtama Sani 
will get intensified. Now let us take Meena lagna jathaka whose 
Sani Ashtavarga (called the Prashtarak) is given below.

In the above chart of Meena Lagna Mars has not contributed 
any benefic bindu in Dhanu. Hence Saturn's Ardhashtama Sanfs 
bad results will be intensified until he crosses 7°-30' to II °-15 f , 
the Mars portion in Dhanu. But take the case of Sun. He has 
contributed benefic bindus in Dhanu. So when Saturn crosses the 
portion 11M5' to 15° of Sun, the malefic result of Ardhashtama 
Sani will be considerably reduced. This can further be expanded. 
In Dhanu in addition to Sun, Moon and Lagna have also contributed 
benefic bindus. Hence wc can say when Satum passes through 
these three portions namely from 15° to IS -45" and 26°- 15' to 30° 
the Ardhashtama Sani's bad effects will be much reduced. 



Goc/ur. irxMsFi takvarga 243

contribution of each planet in Ashtakavarga.The results are to be 
seen in the Ashtakavarga of the planet concerned.

250 GochxPhahcUxpiki 

Find out the Rasi that has least bindus. Throughout the life 
when that Rasi rises as lagna each day, he will be suffering in one 
form or the other. Similarly when Sun crosses that Rasi during 
entire month, there will be untold miseries and difficulties. When 
this lagna rises each day, and Maraka dasa period also runs, there 
will be danger to life also. 

SARYASHTAKAVARGA GENERAL 

1 The Rasis having more "than Sarvashtaka 28 bindus, even 
though these Rasis are 6, 8 and 12th from Janma Rasis, 
whatever planet or planets crosses these Rasis, (though the 
planets are supposed to give malefic results) they will give 
benefic results. 

2, In Sun's Ashtakavarga, whichever Rasis contains more than 4 
(benefic) bindus, during lunar month when Sun transits such 
rasis it will prove to be beneficial and good for the native. 

3. Counting from the Rasi where sun is posited divide all the 
Rasis into 3 groups of 4 each. Total up the bindus in each 
group. Now divide a day of 12 hours into 3 parts. Find out 
which of the three groups contains more bindus. That part 
of the day where more bindus are there throughout the life 
will be very beneficial and good. Similarly the part of the 
day containing least of bindus, be bad. 

Based on this you can take up your major works during that 
part of the day which contains more bindus. For example we will 
take up a chart and its sarvashtakavarga. 



Coch*ir and Ashtakavarga 251 

In this chart form Sun when we total up the bindus of the 
three parts, the following total comes (Sun is in Mithun). 

1st part 4th to 7th = 95 bindus 
2nd part, 8th to 11th = 114 bindus 
3rd part, 12th to 3rd = 128 bindus 

On a day activities are from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. If we divide this 
12 hours by 3 the last 4 hours from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. will be more 
beneficial. 

But if you take the whole day of 24 hours each part contains 8 
hours. Hence the last part which contains more bindus will extend 
from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. next day. This period will also be more 
beneficial. 

4. When Saturn passes through the Rasi having least number 
of bindus in Sun's Ashtakavarga, there will be danger to life 
of father. Similarly when Saturn passes through the Rasi of 
least bindus in each of the respective Karak planet, the relative 
of native connected with particular karaka planet may face 
danger to life. Similarly if Saturn passes through the Rasi 
having least number of bindus in Lagna Ashtak Varga, the 
native himself faces danger to his life. 

5. When Moon passes through the Rasi having maximum bindus 
in his own Ashtakavarga, there will be benefic results. All 
efforts contemplated during this time will succeed. The girl 
of that Rasi will bo the best wife for the native. In this way 
relations with servant, son or daughter, one's mentor 
(Guru)can be found. Their Lagna or Rasis in the native's chart 
should contain maximum bindus in the Ashtakavarga of 
particular Karaka planet pertaining to each relative. For 
example Bhinnashtaka Venus, if the 'Lagna' of the wife or 
concubine coincides with the Rasi of maximum bindus in 
Ashtakavarga of Venus of native, she would prove to be 
good. 

6. Find out which are the Rasis having 6 and more bindus in 
Moon's Bhinnashtaka. If the native after night's sleep first 
sees the face of a relative or some one born those Rasis (having 
more than 6 bindus) they will be helping the native very 



252 Gocharrhaladeepika 

much and will be much cooperative with the native. 

7. When Moon passes through Rasis having no bindus in Moon's 
Ashtakavarga, the native falls ill and suffers due to various 
reasons. 

8. When Mars passes through the Rasi having maximum bindus 
in his own Ashtakavarga,the native may gain a lot. He sells 
or buys landed and house property etc, 

9. When Mercury passes through the Rasi having maximum 
bindus in his own Ashtakavarga if the native gets initiated 
during that time, in any mantra, the native's life will be very 
bright and happy throughout. 

10. Similarly when Jupiter passes through the Rasi having 
maximum bindus in his own Ashtakavarga there may be birth 
of child. If the native gets initiated in mantras, the life of the 
native will be very bright throughout. 

11- When Venus passes through the Rasi having maximum bindus 
in his own Ashtakavarga, he gets maximum sexual pleasure 
from his wife or other ladies. He gets luxurious articles for 
all comforts, clothing etc. 

12. In Sarvashtakavarga when Saturn passes through Rasis 
having least number of bindus there will be sickness and 
danger to life of the native. Similarly when Jupiter and other 
similar benefic planets pass through the Rasi having maximum 
number of bindus in Sarvashtakavarga the good things 
signified by those planets will be enjoyed by the native. 

13. If Lagna or Moon sign is having less than 25 bindus when 
Moon passes through those Rasis, unfavourable things will 
happen. In such times, it is better not to start any new job, 
work or project. 

14. Total up bindus from Lagna to the Rasi where Sani is 
positioned in Sarvashtakavarga multiply and divide it by 27, 
during the age indicated by the quotient, there may be 
affliction of chronic diseases and setbacks as well as critical 
conditions in many aspects of life.

Chapter Thirty 



TRANSIT AND ECLIPSES 



During revolutions of Sun, Moon and Earth in space when 
one of them comes in between, eclipses of Sun and Moon occur. 
These eclipses cause many kinds of changes in the species of the 
Earth. This is according to the Rasi, Star in which the eclipses 
occur from one's birth star or Rasi. 

These generally affect the significations the bhava where the 
eclipses occur counted from the position of Moon. When these 
are connected to Sun, Moon and 10th bhava it is found there will 
be destruction, mourning and at times death of the native. In this 
respect, the effects of solar eclipse will be found to be strong for 
as many years as duration of Solar eclipse in hours and as many 
months as the duration of the Lunar eclipse. 

Every one knows that solar eclipses occur on Amavashya and 
lunar eclipses occur only during full Moon days. This affects 
maternal uncle if it falls on Mercury. When it falls on Jupiter it 
affects one's children. When it falls on Venus, it affects wife and 
other female relatives. When it falls on Mars, it affects brothers 
etc. According to astrological dictum the following may be 
remembered. 

1. When lunar eclipse occurs over the Sphuta of Sun, the native 
suffers a lot and there is risk of very much critical condition 
for him. This will also prove detrimental to the father of the 
native. 

2. If this falls on Moon's Sphuta, there may be bad time to 
mother and danger even to her life. 

3. Solar and Lunar eclipses affect the people very much bom in 



Transit and Eclipses 273 

stars in which the eclipse occur, its previous star, the star 
that follows and also people born in Anu Janma, Trijanma 
stars of the above stars. Hence persons bom in these stars or 
Rasis should take to Parihara or remedial measures. 

Now we will be giving the results of eclipses occuring in 

various bhavas from Lagna.

may have long standing improvement in his efforts which 
may be completed. 

2. If the eclipses occur in 2nd bhava and if benefics are aspecting, 
one's finance will improve. During these time gaps, there 
may be success in speculation and gambling. If this is aspected 
by malefics, there may be heavy financial losses and failures 
in all planned projects. 

3. If the eclipses occur in 3rd bhava, and benefics aspect, life 
will progress through help of friends and relatives. You may 
get good news from many places. If malefics aspect there 
will be aimless and useless travels and there will be troubles 
through relatives and friends. 

4. When eclipses occur in 4th place, supported by benefics aspect 
there will be family happiness, freedom from worry, and 
peaceful condition at home. You may get help from parents. 
If malefic aspects there will be bad time and danger to life of 
parents. 

5. When eclipses occur in 5th house and benefics aspect) there 
will be all round happiness and progress for children. If 
malefics aspect children will suffer from ill health and diseases 
and their studies will be spoiled.

7. If the eclipse happens at 7th house and benefics aspects your 



274 GxharPtvdadeepika 

partners in business and profession will help you. You may 
get new social relationships and also gain by such 
connections. If aspected by malefics all the above aspects 
will get spoiled. In joint business, your partners will deceive 
you. In this condition you should not stand surety for others 
including your partners. 

8. If the eclipse happens in 8th house and aspected by benefics, 
there will be gain in share market, unexpected money from 
unexpeced sources, success in speculation and gambling. You 
may win law suits and get back your own old paternal 
properties. You may gain also from life insurance. If aspected 
by malefics, there will be failure, borrowing of money, loss 
of big amount of money etc. 

9. If the eclipses occur in 9th house and aspected by benefics 
there will be financial improvement at home, all and every 
good thing will happen. You may have chances of long air 
travels to foreign and inland and there may be gain and 
happiness due to them. But if aspected by malefics there may 
be accidents during travel and failure of health halfway. All 
endeavours will fail. 

10. When eclipse occurs in 10th house and aspected by benefics 
you may get high position in job or promotion. In your work 
place, work load on you will be reduced much and you may 
have easy going life at work. You may have many facilities 
and comfortsat work. If aspected by malefics you may commit

you in many difficulties and miseries, deceptions and failures 
will be more. During this time, you should identify true friend 
and ask for help only when you are convinced that they are 
your well wishers. 

12. When the eclipses occur in 12th house and aspected by 
benefics either his life will progress well with the help of 
others or the native may help others since this house also 



Transit and Eclipses 275 

indicates Karma. If the natives are employed in institutions, 
medical centres, and prisons he may be helped by others for 
betterment. If malefic planets aspect the same people who 
are said to help you will become the cause of your ill health 
and yourself may have to go to hospital. You may have to 
spend much for marriage of son or daughter or both. Due to 
malefic aspect there may be unwanted wasteful expenditure 
and loss of heavy amounts.

TRANSITS-MISCELLANEOUS 
INFORMATION 

J. GOCHARA EKARASI ASHUBA PHALA NIRNAY 

(Malefic transit result in only one of the many places) 

All the 9 planets give bad results in many places from Janma 
Rasi of individuals. Out of them it is said in ancient tamil verses 
that each planet gives worst results only in one place Janma Rasi 
and this should be feared and precautions taken. The verse is 
given in Roman script and translation given thereafter.

ACCORDING TO THIS VERSE 

1. Sun in transit gives bad results in 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 12th 
places from Janma Rasi. But among them he gives very bad

Transits-Miscellaneous Information 277 

3. Mars gives bad results except in 3, 6 and 11th from Janma 
Rasi. Out of these places he gives very bad results only in 
7th place. 

4. Mercury gives bad results in 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 
from Janma Rasi. Out of these he gives worst results 
in 2nd from Janma Rasi. 

5. Jupiter gives bad results in 1, 3, 4,6, 8, 10 and 12th 
places from Janma Rasi. Out of these he is most malefic in 
3rd from Janma Rasi.

Janma Rasi. The worst results are in its transit in 6th from 
Janma Rasi. 

7. Saturn gives bad results except 3, 6 and 11th houses 
from Janma Rasi, out of them he gives most evil results

need not be feared much. 

In the above verse the malefic results given by each of the 9 
planets are given in common as under.

Nakshathra, our ancient Rishis have, formulated what is called 



278 CkxfaPbaladwpika 

Varsha Dasa which gives the periods of Dasas for each year and 
have given methods to calculate these Dasas. Here also one's janma 
Nakshathra is taken into account in a different way. 

Here we should first know about our lunar years. In order to 
know Varsha Dasa, one should find out the star which falls on 
Poorvapaksha Prathama of Phalguna month (when Sun is in 
Meena) which roughly falls on 28th or 29th March each year. This 
is the beginning of Hindu Chandramana Varsha. From this date 
you have to calculate the start of Varsha Dhasa. Count the 
Nakshathra to the nakshathra falling on the above day (Phalguna 
Poorvapratama). Then multiply that number by 5 and divide by 
9, the balance from i to 9 should be taken and varsha dasa days 
allotted as under. (Here balance of O should be taken as 9).

Total 360-days 



Find out which Dasa comes first, and subsequently, other 
Dasas in the order given. For example let us take the man whose 
janma nakshatra is Chithra. Now we have to calculate Varsha 
Dhasa for the Hindu year, Bhagu Dhanya. The lunar year starts 
before the Solar year, the date being 28. 3.98 (Poorvapaksha 
Prathama).The day is Saturday. Since the man was bom during 
night, we should find out the star running during the birth time. 
In this case on 28.3.98 Uttara Badra Pada extends upto 138 p.m., 
hence the next star Revathi begins from that time and extends 
upto 1038 a.m. the next day 293.98. So during night (birth time 
being 11.36 p.m. on 3.7.1930) we have to count from Chithra to 



Transits-Miscellaneous Information 



279 



Revathi, both stars to be included. The number is 15 multiplied 
by 5 is equal to 75 and further when divided by 9 remainder is 3. 
Hence the third Dasa begins for him from the Chaithra Mesha 
Sankramana. Luni Solar year Bhagu Dhanya the days of dasas 
will be as follows. Since the rcmaindcrbeing 3 the third Jupiter 
Dasa begins for him. The duration to be counted and dates of 
beginning of each Dasa is being given below. The Hindu new 
year Bhagu Dhanya begins on 144.98 the Dasas will be as follows: 





From 


To 


1. Jupiter Dasa 


14.4.98 


12.6.1998 (58 days) 


2. Ketu Dasa 


13.6.1998 


3.7.1998 


3. Mercury Dasa 


4.7.98 


29.8.89 


4. Venus Dasa

9.11.98 


5. Saturn Dasa

7. Rahu Dasa

26.2.99 


8. Sun Dasa 


27.2.99 


16.3.99 


9. Mars Dasa 


17.3.99 


16.4.99 



The difference of 2 days is due to the fact that February is 
also counted 30 days for taking the year as of 360 days. The 
difference of these 5 days is to be divided in the ratio of dasas of 
each Dasa to the total 360. The difference is negligible for all 
practical purposes. The above table of Dasas will be correct. 

Varsha Dasa can also be calculated in yet another way. Here 
we have to take the degree in the Rasi where Sun is positioned 
during the birth of the native. For a man born on 3. 7.1930, the 
Sun was of 19° in Gemini. From this you have to add the days' of 
dasa. In the present case it starts with Jupiter Dasa and ends in 
Mars Dasa again nearing 3. 7.99 (from 3.7.19983 7.1999). Here we 
follow Nirayana only. The results for each of these Dasas are to 
be judged similar to the rules and conventions followed in 
Vimshottari Dasas. 

III. MASA DHASA..(MONTHLY DHASA) 

For this we have to find out the star falling on the day when 
the Hindu month begins. Count this from one's birth star. Multiply 



280 



Godwrfafodeepika 



the number by 7 and divide the total by 9. The remainder is the 
number of the first Masa Dhasa that begins. Follow the Dasas and 
duration as given below.

family and enmity, attack of 
weapons 


8. Venus Dasa 


5 


Gains of gems, jewels etc. 


9. Mars Dasa 


1.25 


Untimely food, conflict. 



For example, for the same Chithra star man if we want to 
know the Masa Dasa result in Chaitra month of coming Baghu 
Dhanya, the star on that day at the time of birth occurring again 
on that day is 11. .36 p.m. being Revathi. The star counted from 
Chitra to Revati being 15 multiplied by 7comes to 105 and divide 
by 9 remainder comes to 6. Hence the sixth dasa that of Moon 
will start and run for 23 days from (our Hindu days begins at 
sun rise) 6 a.m. on 14.4.98. This may last upto 12 Noon on 16.4.98. 
Hence according to the- result given he may gain money from 6 
a.m. of 14.4.98 to 12 Noon of 16.4.98 We have to add days for the 
subsequent dasas and know the results similarly in the order given 
above. 



IV. DHINA PHALA OR DAILY RESULT 

We have already explained this while we gave the readings of 



Transi&Miscelteneous ' Information 281 

transit results of Moon. However a traditional method knowing 
Chandra Phala is given here. Reckon from your birth star to the 
star falling on the particular day, for which you want to know the 
result. Add to this the days/ thithi from Prathama, and the week 
day from Sunday and divide by nine for the remainder the 
following results arc indicated : 

1. Worry and agony 

2. Good 

3. Receipt of bad news and bad, inauspicious words to be 
heard 

4. Meeting with relatives (coming as guests) 

5. Sex pleasure with wife or other ladies 

6. Conflict, confusion 

7. Confusion 

8. Being cheated, deceived 

9. Good news 

For example let us take the case of a man born on r Chitira r 
star. The date being 2.1.98. On 2.1.98: 

1. The star is Satabisha (after 4.00 pm, The result is wanted 
for the period after that time) 

2. Thithi is Threethiya 

3. Week day is Friday 

The following is the calculation, 

1. No. of stars to Sathabisha 

from birth star Chithra 11 

2. Thithi 3 

3. Week day 6 

20 



Dividing this by 9 we get remainder as 2 

For 2 the result is good news. Hence some letter telling good 



282 GocharPhaladeepika 

news may be received. 

We have to note that the birth star of the native is involved. 
By taking "the week day, the ruling planet of the day is considered. 
Tithi being taken indicates the strength which is the basis for transit 
result. Since it is divided by 9, we have to understand that 9 planets 
are considered. Involving all elements of timely planetary forces 
on the particular day, the results should be only precise and 
correct. Our ancients have formulated such system after deep 
research and deep thinking. 

QUANTIFIED TRANSIT RESULTS ON 
A PARTICULAR TRANSIT 

Quantified results Of all the nine planets, is one of the important 
way of getting the correct judgement of good or evil forces 
projected on us on a particular day. This has already been 
explained in earlier chapter where we have given the method of 
working transit results. Readers may refer to it.

Chart No. 3 

According to an ancient Tamil verse, it is stated that when 
Jupiter passes through the natal Moon sign, the native is deprived 
of his status and driven out of his place. This is also said to be 
true in the case of Lord Sri Rama. Actually the verse begins with 
his name 

2. 'JANMA RAMAR VANATHILE' 



Which means that when Jupiter was in Janma Rasi of Rama 
Jupiter crossed his natal Moon sign Cancer, he was asked to go to 
the Jungle . Another point in this is the transit Jupiter crossed his 
natal Jupiter and Moon which resulted in a great change. 

It is stated that in the beginning of the 14th year of his Vana 
Vasa his wife Seetha was abducted by Ravana. This means that by 
this time the Jupitcr has completed one round after he went to 
jungle and was in 3rd from natal Moon in Virgo. Jupitcr gives 
worse results in transit in 3rd house. The native suffers great 
humiliation.

Chart No. 4 

Now in modern times, we can apply the same rule of Jupiter 
crossing the natal Moon sign. In the above chart of Indian 
Independence. The natal Moon sign is Cancer. The principle is 
that the native is deprived of his status and driven out. But in the 
context of a country, the same cannot be applied but the occupant 
and the ruler is driven out when Jupiter crosses Cancer-the birth 
Moon sign. The following instance may be noted:

when Jupiter crossed the natal Moon sign of the Indian 
Indepcndece Chart. The transit Jupiter was also in oppostion to 
natal Jupiter and Saturn. This was also made further bad by 
running of 1st phase of Sade Sathi of Saturn which was in Leo, the

that Saturn was this time in Capricorn which is 4th from natal

Chapter Thirty Three 



THRIPATHA CHAKRA 



For persons born in 27 stars, during each year of their age, 3 
planets rule the year. If all the three planets are benefics, the year 
throughout will be good. If two of the planets are benefics and 
the other is malefic, the result will be good but at the same time 
there may also be problem to certain extent. If one planet alone is 
benefic and the remaining two are malefic, then the year will be 
mostly troublesome with intermittent good results. If all the three 
planets are malefic the complete year will be problematic. The 
native has to suffer a lot throughout the year. This calculation of 
knowing the results is prevalent mostly in northern districts of 
India. Since this qauantifies in a way, the results of ruling planets 
each year, it is also considered here under Gochar. Now let us see 
this method of knowing yearly results. 

1. Jupiter, Venus, waxing Moon, Mercury not connected 
with malefics are the benefics. 

2. Sun, Mars, waning Moon, Mercury connected with malefics, 
Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are malefics. 

3. Note down the Janma Nakshatra of the person. Note down 
the date and year of birth of the native which will give the 
present age. From that day particular new year of age begins. 
Tables have been given showing Janma Nakshatra, age for 
which results are required and rulers of the year. Age is to 
be selected out of the three given at the top and rulers of the 
year should be seen against the birth star. As an example let 
us take that the age of the native is at present 68 and his 
Janma Nakshatra is Chithra. Now look down under 



294 GodurFtuLideepika 

68 in the horizontal column and read against Chithra you 
find the planets Rahu, Ketu and Mars, all are malefics as 
rulers. Hence during this 68th year he will have completely 
bad results. However, in his 72 years you will sec that Lords 
arc Moon, and Jupiter, therefore this year will be very good. 
From the above we can see that. 

1. 68th year Lords arc Rahu, Ketu and Mars, a 

bad year 

2. 69th year Lords are Ketu, Mercury. Ketu 

Moderate only l/3rd good 
whenever Mercury's transit is not 

connected with malefics. 

» 

3. 70th year Lords are Venus, Mars and Moon. 

Here Venus will do good, Moon 
will do good when waxing that is 
for 6 months. Hence this year will 
be 50% good for the native. 

4. 71st year The Lords are Venus, Ketu and 

Mercury. Here only Venus is good 
and Mercury is good, whenever not 
connected with malefics, that is he 
functions as benefic planet for 50% 
of the year including Venus. Hence, 
he will have 50% good results and' 
50% bad results intermittently 

5. 72nd year Now take the 72nd year. The Lords 

are Moon and Jupiter, Here Moon 
will be good when he is waxing 
hence he is 50% good, Jupiter is 
good. Hence 1/3 +1/3+ 1/6 = 5/ 
6 the year will be good with 
intermittent good and bad periods. 
In this case, out of all the years 
from 68 to there will be more good 
results. 

We car. know the results in yet another way. For each age 3 
planets are given. These 3 planets can be given 4 months each in 
the year beginning with the first planet given in the order. Thus 



Thripatha Chakra 



295 



first planet gives result up to 4th month, second planet from 5 to 
8th months and third planet from 9th to 12th month in that year. 
Now with this in view if you look the case of the native given 

above. 

1. 68th year will prove completely bad. 

2. 69th year, the middle four months will only be good, 

3. 70th year, the Lords being Venus, Mars and Moon here first 
4 months will be good. 2nd 4 months will be very bad. During 
the third 4 months 2 months will be good with intermittent 
15 days period each whenever Moon is waxing. 

4. For 71st year also first 4 months wil be good, second 4 months 
will be bad (Ketu rules) anq 3rd 4 month say 50% i.e. 2 months 
period will be good 1 with intermittent gap whenever Mercury 
is not connected with any malefic. 

5. 72nd year, the second and third 4 months period will be 
very good. The Lord being benefic. But during the first 4 
months period 50% will be good with intermittent gaps when 
ever the lord Moon is through waxing phase. 

This is how, we can analyse the results for each year of the 
age for the native.

produced by ashuba grahas (malefic planets) gives bad results. 
All the nine planets have three types of vedha aspects as under 

In Sarvato Bhadra Chakra, speed of a planet is of vital 
importance because types of Vedha depends on speed in following 
manner: 

Motion- speed Vedha- Aspect 

— Direct motion — Normal speed Front 

— Direct motion — High speed (Atichari) Left 

— Retrograde motion - Backward Right 
Types of Vedha aspect 

The 9 planets have three types of Vedha aspect as under: 

— Sun, Moon, Rahu and Ketu can aspect in all the 3 direc- 
tions. 

Retrograde planet can aspect only on the right direction. 
Fast planet can aspect only on die left direction. Planet 
with normal speed can aspect in front direction only. 

— Front Vedha of a planet can only cause Vedha of star & 
pada in opposite direction. 

— Right side Vedha aspect by a retrograde planet can cause 
Vedha of all the five components. 

— Left side Vedha will also cause Vedha of all the five compo- 
nents. 

— Mars, Mer, Jup, Ven, Saturn, have Vedha aspect in one 
direction only depending on their speed. 

— As regards front Vedha by a planet some Sages suggested 

— that this Vedha should also cover the other 4 components. 

— Right and left Vedha aspects is always angular at 45° and 
causes Vedha of all components occupying vargas in that 
direction. 

Special Vedha Aspect 

— Planet in 4th pada of Bharani causes Vedha of 1st (First) 
pada of Krittika and A vowel (by left aspect). 



Sanatoflhadfiichafcra 321 

Planet in 4th pada of Aslesha causes Vedha of 1st pada of 
Anuradha and 'E' vowel (by left aspect). 

Planet in 4th pada of Sravan causes Vedha of 1st pada of 
Dhanistha and 'EE' vowel (by left aspect). 

Planet afflicting Aridra Star, the ku, ghaang, Chha conso- 
nants are also afflicted. 

Planet afflicting Hasta Star, the pu, sha, ana, tha, conso- 
nants are also afflicted. 

Planet affliction Purvashada Star, the Mu, Dha, Pha and 
adha consonants are also afflicted. 

These consonants are not provided in SBC. Hence their 
Vedha may be examined in this way. These (words) con- 
sonants belong to different pada of stars. 

Similarly planets occupying 4th pada of Bharani, Ashlesa, 
Visaka and Sravan cause Vedha of 5 f 10, 15, 30 Lunar Tithies 
and Saturday which is not possible in normal course. 

Bene fie planets :StrongMoon, unafflicted Mercury, Jupiter 
and Venus cause benefic vedha aspect only. 

Malefic Planets : Sun, Saturn, Mars, Rahu and Ketu, will 
cause malefic Vedha aspect only, although they may be in 
their own signs or even exaltation signs. They are 100% 
malefic. 

Moon is benefic when it is waxing. 

Mercury is benefic when it is alone, specially without any 
malefic planet. 

Vedha aspect of a planet is of 2 types. Macro-when a planet 
aspects a particular sign. Micro-when a planet aspect a 
particular pada of a Star. Pada Vedha is more effctive. 

Vedha by 2/3 planets in the same pada, the impact of vic- 
torious planet will prevail. Mars, Mer, Jup, Ven and Sat 
have only one aspect at a time depending on their speed. 

Malefic planet, if retrograde becomes highly malefic - 

200%. 

Benefic planet, if retrograde becomes highly benefic -200%. 

Malefic planet when it leaves the Vedha Star and shifts to 
another Star, it cannot give malefic results. 



322 GxhvPhahdeepiJta 

— Vedha of Lunar Tithi in bright half ( Shukla Paksha ) is 
100%, whereas Vedha in dark half is only 50% effective. 

— Each Tithi has its own consonant. So when Tithi has Vedha 
aspect, the consonant is also having Vedha automatically. 
Similarly, sign of a Tithi is also having Vedha 

— When a planet is causing Vedha of a particular sign, it's 
vowel consonant & Tithis are also having Vedha automati- 
cally. 

— Retrograde planet on first pada of Kritika, 4 l pada of 
Magha, 1 st pada of Anuradha, 1 stpadaofDhanistha causes 
Vedha of 4 Vowels- 5,10,15,30 Tithis & Saturday. 

Special Note on Vedha 

Vedha means a special relationship between the planet in 
motion and other celestial bodies, which arc fixed in the SBC of 
the native. Aspects by planet play important role in influencing 
human life, nations, commerce, trade, influencing agicultural 
products, market fluctuations. The benefic or malefic nature, it's 
motion (speed), its conjunction with other planets-when 2 planets 
occuping same longitude in a star or its pada or aspect by 2 planets 
occupying 2 different signs but planets opposite each other at a 
distance of 180 degree eg Sun 10 degree in Aries and Saturn 10 
degree in Libra. This aspect is most dangerous. 

In addition to the above, when birth star is not known, the 
vedhas aspect should be considered by the first letter of the indi- 
vidual name cither vowel or consonant. 

Total effect of vedha aspect of subha and subha planets are to 
be considered and the greater side will give good or bad result as 
may be indicated 

Example- 1 

1. Let us consider that retrograde Saturn is passing through 
the star "Rohini". Hence the Saturn causes right vedha 
affecting 'U'Vowcl and Aswini star. Hence the transit is bad 
for people having first name starting with TT vowel and 
also those born under Aswini star. 



San 'atoBhadrachakra 323 

If in the place of Saturn, Vedha is passing through the star 
Rohini, then the results will be very good. 

2. If in the above case, the planet is Athichari then Saturn will 
have left Side Vedha on the letter Va v Mithuna Rasi lettters 
'RA 'OU' the star Swathi, people having names starting with 
VA, ou RA, Mithuna Rasi also Swathi born people will have 
malefic results. 

Now let us take that Saturn is in ordinary transit , it aspects 
front side. It will affect the people born in Abhijit nakshathra. 
The result are as under for the front aspect. 

1. Front aspect of Sun causes worries. 

2. Front aspect of Mars results in loss of money. 

3. Sani similarly causes affliction of health and longevity. 

4. Rahu or Ketu causes impediments and obstruction. 

5. Waning Moon causes difficulties and full Moon causes bcnefic 
results (comforts, etc). 

6. Venus in similar position gives dress, jewels, vahana yoga 
and new vehicles. 

7. Mercury in the similar Vedha gives keen intellect, progress, 
especially through writing and publication of books. 

8. If Jupiter is causing vedha all benefic results, including 
comfort, enjoying luxuries , money, marriage, children, etc 
will be enjoyed. 

EXAMPLE-2 

Suppose Sun is placed in Aridra Star its aspect will be front 
aspect, this will affect Poorvasadha nakstra born people. 

In the same position, if waxing Moon is transiting it will also 
cause vedha to Poorvasadha people and will give them good 
results. Similarly, the results of vedha caused by other planets 
should be considered. 

The result of planet occupying the 27 stars and how they cause 
vedha is given below:

EXAMPLE-3 

Though we can work out actual examples for transit of all 
planets, for the present we will consider only Jupiter and Saturn. 

As on date 22-12-2000 Jupiter was transiting Krithika 4th padha 
retrograde gets direct motion on 25.01.2001 and passes to the star 
Rohini on 13.02.2001. In this case, the planet is retrograde. Hence 
his aspect will be towards right in creating vedha. 

(1) According to the standard texts, in this case the Jupiter 
create vedha to people bom in Bharani star people with the first 
letter of this first name in the vowel A people born in Rishaba 
rasi, people with the first letter of their name in the consonant TA 
as well as people born in Vishaka star by right side aspect. These 
people will have good results due to the vedha cealed. It should 
be noted that benefic planet (Jupiter in this case) give good results 
when they cause vedha to stars. When they are retrograde, it 
gives immense good results. 

Now let us take the case of an individulal whose birth star is 
Bharani. This man should get good results now creating vedha to 



328 Gocharlfakdeeptka 

third star by right side aspect due to Jupiter being in 2nd. Now 
Jupiter being retrograde, will give immense good results. Jupiter 
should give bad results in the conventional dictum the reverse 
results namely very good results should happen. This is is the 
uniqueness of Sarvatho Bhadra Chakra. 

2. Now take the case of Saturn. Saturn is malefic planet who 
gives evil results only to the constituents with which he produces 
vedha. He was retrograde in Krittika star. He becomes direct 
only on 25.01.2001, after which his malefic results get somewhat 
reduced. 

Saturn, for that matter any planet in Krittika star, produces 
vedha with same star given above for Jupiter. 

Now let us take the case of same man who is born in Bharani 
star. Saturn creates vedha to Bharani star with right side aspect. 

For Bharani people Saturn will be in second house from their 
rasi Krittika i.e. Sampath Thara from their birth star. Though this 
is last 2J5 years of Sadesathi begining in Sampath thara, he may 
minimise the bad result. But since he produces vedha with Bharani, 
effect will be malefic only. If retrograde in vedha, it gives double 
malefic results. Unfortunately since both these varsha grahas are 
in the same star and also retrograde and those good and bad 
results get cancelled. However we can conclude that as long as 
Jupiter will be in the star Krittika, Saturn's bad result as Sadesathi 
will not affect the native. This is a rare consideration only. Along 
with this, the effects produced on the planets by aspects over the 
Thithis, the rasis etc., of birth of the native can also be assessed 
and the nature of collective good and bad effectscanalsobejudged. 
However the prominent consideration is only of vedhas produced 
on rasis and birth stars. 



Chapter Thirty Five 



JUPITER'S TRANSIT IN GEMINI 



Jupiter's entry into a sign can bring about significant change 
both at the mundane and individual level. It has more impact 
especially with reference to his position from Janam rasi in the 
evil effects during the transit of Saturn, 

Jupiter entered Gemini on 15.6.2001 at 22.43 PM. His passage 
through the three Stars Mrigasira, Aridra, & Punarvasu was as 
follows: 

1. Mrigasira 3rd Pada 15.6.2001 

15.7.2001 

29.9.2001 

04.11.2001 

06.12.2001 

28.2.2002 

17.5.2002 



The transit of Jupiter affects people in four ways: 

1. The results of Jupiter of the cyclic transit of Jupiter. 

2. General conventional aspect. 

3. Effects due to Moorthi Nirnaya. 

4. Effects of stellar occupation of Jupiter with reference to 
one's birth star.

I. Cyclic Effects 

Jupiter passes through the 12 signs of the zodiac roughly in 12 
years. Each round is called a Paryayas. In most cases Jupiter may 
not complete more that 6 Paryayas in an individual's life time. 
The elfects of such paryayas are given below according to Tamil 
tradition. 

a. Jupiter in his 1st round is said to cause danger to life if he 
is in the 8th house. It is also said that the father will enjoy 
quite contrary results getting all comfort, elevation etc while 
the native will suffer. 

b. If during the 2nd round Jupiter is in Aries or Taurus there 
will not be bad results if the above sign happens to be the 
1st, 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th, or 12th from the moon sign and there 
will be no good results in tite other houses. This will apply 
to native below 24 years. 

c. During the 3rd Paryayas, he does good in the 1st, 4th, 
5th, 7th, 1 1th, and 12th signs from one's Moon-sign. 

d. During the 4th round in Janma Rasi he gets threat from 
Government, gain of wealth in the 2nd house, comforts in 
the 4th house, gain of property in the 9th house and gain of 
money in the 11th and 12th houses from the Moon sign. 

e. During the 5th round, he gives mental anxiety in Janma, 
gain of wealth in the 2nd and comfort in the 4th from the 
Moon sign. 

f. During the 6th round, he gives good effects in the 2nd, 
5lh, 7th, 9th and 11, houses from the Moon sign and gives 
dangers to life in the 8th (provided there is Maraka Dasa or 
the 3rd round of 7Vi year transit of Saturn is on). 

For example, let us assume Jupiter is in Gemini during his 1st 
round for a person born during July "W30 from the Moon sign 
Virgo. When he passes through Taurus, the Paryaya ended. In 
this 6th Paryaya, however, native did not suffer. Due to transit 
of Jupiter in 8th house during thus Paryaya, since there was neither 
Maraka Dasa nor 1 X A year. Saturn, and according to Ayurdaya, 
native has long life, there was no danger to life. 



Jupiter's Transit in Gemini 331 

2. General conventional Aspects 

a, Jupiter gives good result when he passes through the 2nd, 
5th, 7th, 9th and 11th signs from the Moon sign. The results 
can be described briefly as follows:- 

Jupiter in Gemini adds to wealth in 2nd house for Taurus 
people. He gives birth of children in 5th house for Aquarius 
pco-plc, marriage or harmonious conjugal life for Sagittarius 
people, help from father, and gain from travel etc. He gels 
gain in the 11th house for Leo born people. 

b. Jupiter is said to give bad results when he is in 1st, 3rd, 4th, 
6th, 8th, 10th and 12th from the Moon sign. As mentioned in 
one of the ancient Tamil works (vide AJvt. January 1998 issue, 
page 95) Jupiter gives the worst results in the 3rd house such 
as quarrels, fear of imprisonment, loss of respect and honour, 
humiliation, affliction from many diseases, danger to life etc. 
subject to other conditions to Aries bom people. 
According to another ancient Tamil work, Jupiter passing 
through the bad house from the Moon sign, gives results as 
follows. 

1. When Jupiter passes through Janma Rasi for Gemini people 
they will be forced to shift to unwanted places amounting to 
exile with fear of imprisonment and there may be danger to 
women from men 

2. When Jupiter passes through 3rd house, he gives very 
bad results compared to other houses. Those born in Aries 
may suffer fear of loss of life, if maraka period runs. There 
will also be loss of status. 

3. When Jupiter passes through 6th house for Capricorn 
people they will have to face false allegations and may have 
to endure untold sufferings. 

4. When Jupiter passes through the 8th house, Scorpio 
people will meet with loss of position and there will be danger 
to life if Maraka Dasa also coincides. 

5. When Jupiter passes through the 10th house, for Virgo 
people there will be financial difficulties, lack of resources 
and earnings will come down. Status will come down. 

6. When Jupiter passes through the 12th house for Cancer 
people, they will be subjected to loss of position and status. 



332 GodurFhaLidiXpika 

7. When Jupiter passes through the 4th house for Pisces 
people, they will be forced to go into exile (transferred to 
unwanted places) 

3. Moorthl Nirnaya 

This has already been discussed in detail earlier 

1. A planet become Swarna Moorthy when Moon is 
in 1, 6, 11th rasis from the birth Moon Birth Moon will be in 
sign pisces during his entry into Gemini. Jupiter becomes 
Swarna Moorthy for pisces, Taurus and Libra people . Due 
to this the bad results of Jupiter in 4th for pisces people will 
be much reduced and good result of Jupifer in 2nd and 9th 
for Taurus and Libra people will be enhanced, since benefic 
planet is said to give very good result as Swarna Moorthy. 

2. When Moon is in 2nd, 5th and 9th rasis from ones birth during 
the entry of a planet to a new rasi, he becomes Rajatha 
Moorthy. Jupiter becomes Rajatha Moorthy for Cancer, 
Scorpio and Aquarius people. Due to this the bad results of 
Jupiter in 12th for Cancer and 8th for Scorpio people 
respectively will be considerably reduced and good results 
of Jupiter in 5th for Aquarius will be enhanced, since Jupiter 
as Rajatha Moorthy is said to give beneficial results. 

3. When Moon is in 3rd, 7th and 10th from one's Birth Moon, 
during the entry of a planet into a new rasi he becomes 
Thambra Moorthy. So Jupiter becomes Thambara Moorthy to 
Gemini. Virgo and Capricorn. Due to this the bad results of 
Jupiter in Janmarasi 10th and 6th house for Gemini, Virgo and 
Capricorn people respectively, will be slightly reduced, since 
as Thambara Moorthy a planet is said to give moderate results. 

4. When the Moon is in the 4th, 8th and 12th from one's birth 
Moon during the entry of a planet into a new rasi, he becomes 
Loha Moorthi. Jupiter becomes Loha Moorthi for Aries, Leo, 
and Sagittarius born. The bad results of Jupiter in 3rd for 
Aries people will be much intensified, the good results of 
Jupiter in 11 th and respectively for Leo and Sagittarius born 
people will be reduced as Loha Moorthi Jupiter is said to 
give bad results. Out of these Aries people will suffer worst 



Jupiter's Transit in Gemini 333 

of these bad results since Jupiter in 3rd house will be giving 
already results according to conventional aspect, in addition 
Jupiter being Loha Moorthi will give bad results only. Hence 
difficulties and miseries will increase for such natives. 

Summing up, we may summarise the results of Jupiter in 
Gemini for the 12 Rasis as follows : 

Conventional Aspect 

Good results accrue to Taurus, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius and 
Aquarius people for Jupiter being in 2nd, 11, 9th, 7th & 5th houses 

respectively. 

Bad results accrue to other rasis namely, Aries, Gemini, Cancer, 
Virgo, Scorpio. Capricorn and Pisces people. 

Moorthi Nirnaya Aspect 

1. According to Moorthy Nirnaya very good result accrue to 
Taurus, Libra and Pisces people (Swarna Moorthy) 

2. Good results accrue to Cancer. Scorpio and Aquarius people 
(Rajatha Moorthy) 

3. Bad results accrue to Gemini, Virgo and Capricorn people 
(Thambara Moorthy) 

4. Very bad results accrue to Aries and Sagittarius people (Loha 
Moorthy) 

Combined Results of Both 

1. Rasis having very good results according to both aspects 
Taurus and Libra. 

2. Rasis having bad results according to both aspects Aries 
people only. 

3. The net good effect combining both the aspect for Jupiter's 
transit in Gemini can be quantified as follows. 

Taking the cumulative unit value for both the aspects and 
allotting 0.5 to each for the 4 Moorthy Nirnaya aspects can be 
allotted as below.

4. Stellar Occupational Aspects 

When a planet passes through the 1st (Janma), 3rd (vipat), 5th 
(pratynk), and the 7th (vadha or vaidhana) from the birth star the 
effects will be very bad. It will be specially detrimental to the 
native with reference to the Vadha star. The passage of a planet 
through the 2nd (Kampath) the 4th(Kshema)the 6th (Daivankula), 
the 8th (Maitra) and the 9th (Parama Maitra) from one's birth star 
will give good results. 

Table 25 shows these who get bad effects among all the 27 
stars with reference to transit of Jupiter during his stay in Gemini.

5. Nakshatra Anga Guru 

The details of Nakshatra Anga phala in general have already 
been discused. 

For Jupiter the result are assessed according to the part of the 
body through which Jupiter transits. Table 26 shows good and bad 
effects and the location of transit of Jupiter in the body giving such 
results. The above Table can be referred to for determining the 
distribution of the 27 stars over the body giving bad and good 
results. For example when Jupiter transit the first to third stars 
come under the head, it causes sorrow and destruction.

6. Neutralisation of Bad Effects (C.P.C.L) 

The bad effects due to Jupiter's movement through the 1st, 
3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th houses from ones Moon sign are 
said to get cancelled if any other planet or planet occupy certain 
houses causing vipareetha vedha. 

I 3 4 6 8 Ifi 12 

nil 7 5 nil 11 9 2 

1. When Jupiter passes through Janma Rasi and 6th from 
Janma Rasi viz. Mithuna and Makara, poeple suffer the 
bad results since there is no Vipareetha vedha for them. 

2. When Jupiter occupying 3rd, 4th, 8th, 10th and 12th places 
from their Janma Rasi, if some other planet occupy 7th, 5th, 
11th, 10th and 2nd from their Janma Rasi at the same time 
then Jupiter comes under Vipareeta Vedha for the entire 
period of transit. For example the bad effects of Jupiter in 
the 10th get cancelled by Saturn in 9th at the same time. 

For others planets, such period will be very short and for 
which the monthly forecasts may be referred to. 

Remedial Measures: 

1. Aries natives should perform remedial measures, since they 
will suffer from worst result due to Jupiter in the 3rd. They 
will also be under the last 2 1 /2 years of the 7^/2 years Saturn 
cycle, 

2. Gemini born people will have to take remedial measures 
for Janma Guru. They will also suffer due to Saturn in the 
12th which marks the first phase of the 7V2 years Saturn 
cycle. 

3. Cancer people should take remedial measures for Jupiter in 
12th . But Saturn in 11th for them give them very good results 
for the entire period. Hence they need not worry. 

4. Virgo people will suffer due to Jupiter in 10th, since he suffers 
Vipareetha vedha due to Saturn in 9th for the entire period 
thus cancelling the bad effects. Hence they need not worry. 

5. Scorpio people will have to take remedial measures, since 
Jupiter will be giving them very bad results in 8th, at the 
same time Saturn also in 7th will be very bad. Hence double 
suffering. Remedy is very much necessary. 



Jupiter's Transit in Gemini 339 

6. Capricorn people will have to take remedial measures due 
to Jupiter being in 6th and at the same time Saturn in 5th. 

7. Aries bom people will suffer due to Jupiter in 4th, But since 
Saturn in 3rd will at the same time give them good results, 
there will be no suffering. Hence remedy is not necessary. 

Stellar Occupation of Jupiter 

I. When Jupiter passes through Mrigaseera from 15. 6 .2001 
to 14.07.2001, since this is only a short period no remedial 
measures are needed. 

II. When Jupiter passes through the star Aridra 16. 7. 2001 
top 28. 9. 2001 again from 6. 2. 2002 to 17. 5. 2002. the following 
people have to take the remedy: 

1. Barani, Pubba and Poorvashada people will have to take 
remedies for passages of Jupiter through 5th star from birth 
star being transit through prathyaitara. Out of these, Barani 
people will alone suffer Pubba will have Jupiter in 11th and 
Poorvashada people in 7th respectively will give them good 
results. Hence they will not suffer. 

2. Rohini, and Sravana will suffer due to Jupiter in vipath tara. 
Out of these Hastha people will not suffer since Jupiter will 
suffer vedha due to Saturn in 9th. Rohini people will also not 
suffer being in 2nd. 

3. Aridhra, Swathi and Sathabisha people should take remedy 
due to Janamathara transit but Swathi and Sathabisha peo- 
ple need not worry since Jupiter will be in 9th and 5th respec- 
tively giving good results. Aridha people also should take to 
remedy. 

4. Ashlesha, Jeyestha and Rcvathi people will have to take to 
remedy due to Jupiter passing through Vadhathara. 

in. When the Jupiter passing through Punarvasu from 29.9.2001 
to 4.1.2001 and again from 18.5.2002 to 4.7.2002. 

1. Ashwini, Makha, Moola people will have to take to remedy 
for Jupiter's passage through Naidhanatara, which will give 
very bad results. Among these Makha people will not suffer 
since Jupiter will give them good results being 11th from 
their Moon sign. 

2, Similarly Moola people will not also suffer since Jupiter will 
be giving good results to them being in 7th for their Moon 
sign.

GocharFhiLickepika 



3. Krithika, Uthara Phalugni and Uttarashada people will suffer 
due to passage of Jupiter through Pratheyakthara which is 
bad. But Uttara Phalugni 1st pada, Uttarashada 1st pada 
people will not suffer bad results of Jupiter since he will be 
giving good results in 11th and 7th for them respectively. 
Similarly Krithika last three padha people will not suffer since 
Jupiter will be giving them good resists. Hence they need 
not take remedy. Others will have to take to remedial 
measures. 

4. Mrigaseera, Chitta, and Dhanishta people will have to take 
remedial measures. Since they will suffer passage of Jupiter 
through Vipaththara. Among these Chttra last 2 padas and 
Dhanishta last 2 padas people will not suffer due to Jupiter 
giving good result in 9th and 5th respectively. 

5. Punarvassu, Vishaka and Poorvabadra pada people should 
take to remedy for the bad results of passage of Jupiter 
through Janma Thara, Out of these Vishaka 1st 3 pada bom 
people will not suffer since Jupiter will be giving good results 
for them being in 9th. Poorvabadra 1st 3 padas people will 
not suffer due to Jupiter being in 5th for them will be giving 
good results only. 

Remedial Measures 

The following Yantra (talisman) has to be inscribed in a thin 
square plate of gold or copper of 1.25 inches size. This may be 
consecrated by chanting either of the following two Mantras for 
19,000 times in 40 days. This Yantra is from Yantra Chintamani. 
Thereafter, the plate, put in a talisman can be worn.

Chapter Thirty Six 



SUDH ARS ANA CHAKRA 



Sage Parasara has conceived the unique system of Sudharsana 
Chakra and its applications. He said that Lord Brahma himself 
evolved this system. This system will help in predicting exact 
results from the ascendant about various houses and for the 
persons from birth to death for each year, month and day. In this 
system three ascendants are used- first is the ascendant itself, 
second is the Chandra Lagna (Moon ascendant - the rasi where 
Moon is placed) and the third one is the Sun ascendant or the 
Surya Lagna (the rasi where Sun is placed). They are drawn one 
over other in three circles first inner the ascendant, the second 
one the Moon ascendant, and the third and the last one is the 
Surya Lagna. 

In this system, predictions are based on combining all the three 
lagnas with the position of planets remaining the same as at birth. 
Here the Sun is considered auspicious in the ascendant and 
inauspicious in other houses. The combined effects are judged by 
occupation of or aspect of benefic or malefic planets in each bhava 
from the three lagnas. If a particular bhava has more benefic 
influences in the combined system that will flourish. Contrarily if 
a bhava has more malefic influences according to this, that bhava 
gets totally bad effects. The main points of this system are as 
follows: 

1. The results of a particular bhava will be in accordance with 
occupation of planets either malefic and benefic. 

2. In the absence of a planet in a particular bhava the results 
are judged based on the aspects it receives. 

3. It is vital to judge the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of 
the planets in a house. If it is judged majority of planets prove 
auspicious for particular bhava, that bhava prospers and vice- 
versa. 



344 GodurrhalaiteipEka 

4. If a bhava has both the influences, the net effect on the bhava 
will be in accordance with more number of planets 
concentrating on the bhava either good or bad. 

5. The benefic and malefic influences on a bhava being 
equal, the results will be mixed. This condition applies to the 
previous item no. 4. 

6. If planets arc in more benefic vargas influene will be counted 
favourable and vice-versa. 

In the conventional system, we judge the horoscope from the 
birth ascendant. But very often results go wrong including dasa 
bhukthi periods. But when you combine all the three lagnas and 
consider the yoga karakas for each lagna, better results arc 
expected. The following are the observations when we apply the 
Sudharsana Chakra in the horoscope given. 

I . Judgement of Bhavas (chart-2 ch.32) 

First Bhava : There is no planet in the lagna. Moon is aspecting 
the lagna who has only two subha varghas. Lagna lord is in 
kendra, fourth house, who has four subha vargas. Out of the other 
two lagnas, Sun and Moon both belong to Mercury who has again 
achieved four subha varghas. Hence in a way the first bhava 
connected with lagna Sun and Moon are moderately auspicious. 
The native is hale and healthy and has achieved success in his life. 
He had ordeals in the way due to the aspect of Saturn over the 
Sun and Moon lagnas. But Saturn has attained five subha varghas. 
So in a way he is functionally benefic though naturally malefic. 
Hence his life will be more successful. 

Second Bhava : This is occupied by Mars in his own Rasi as 
well as Rahu. Mars has obtained six subha varghas and Rahu has 
obtained three subha varghas. Hence his family life will be good 
and peaceful and finance will also be little above average. The 
second bhava from Sun and Moon belongs to Moon and Venus 
respectively. Venus is in the former and Ketu is in the latter. Moon 
has obtained only two subha varghas

and Ketu has obtained three subha vargas. Uut second hnu.se from 
Moon lagna is aspected by Jupiter who is again in four subha 
vargas. Hencejudging the second house from all the three lagnas 
it can be said it is little above average. 

Fourth House: This is the pivot of the horoscope. This is 
occupied by Sun, Jupiter and Mercury and receives the aspect of 
Saturn. Sun has obtained six, Mercury four and Jupiter four subha 
vargas. The aspecting planet Saturn has obtained five subha vargas. 
As such, this is far above average on the benefic side. The native 
is a scholar in several languages, and in intellectual field. The 
fourth house from Sun is occupied by Moon who has obtained 
two subha vargas. The lord of the sign occupied by the Moon, 
Mercury has obtained four subha vargas, hence this has also gained 
more strength. Hence his home life is very good with all comforts 
and due to the Mercurial influence, he has keen intellect and 
judgement. Now take the fourth house from Moon, it is occupied 
by Saturn who has got five subha vargas. It is aspected by Sun, 
Jupiter and Mercury who have six, four, and four subha vargas 
respectively. So all these planets have gained more subha vargas. 
One among the aspecting planets Jupiter is the Lord of the sign 
fourth from the Moon who is a benefic. Hence this house has got 
the maximum benefic influences. As such this being the 10th from 
the birth lagna also in the second portion of his life, he has great 
achievement, success and shines as an author of several books 
and earns much reputation and fame. 

I have taken only three bhavas from the three lagnas to 
establish the truth behind the judgement of horoscope through 
Sudharsana Chakra, which is scientific and wonderful. We have 
taken only seven vargas for consideration. Even malefic planets 
become benefic by getting more subha vargas and makes the 
horoscope on the positive side which should be borne in mind. 
Similarly the other bhavas from all the three lagnas can be judged 
which will give a panoramic view of the whole life.

All the four kendras of this chart from lagna are concentrated 
with subha vargas and the lords are all positioned in kendras 
who have obtained more snbha vargas. There is Chathussagara 
Yoga (Lords of all kendras in Kendras only) and a Mahapurasha 
Yoga, caused by Mercury called Bhadhra Yoga, due to Saturnic 
influence over expected in his second part of life and the Badra 
yoga has made him learned and an intellectual. 



2. Dasabukthi 

1. Budhadasa of native started on 12.06.89. We consider Budha 
the dasa Lord as per Sudharsana Chakra. We have already 
explained about Budha while discussing the 4th house which may 
be referred again. He is more benefic of the chart. 

Budha is the Lord of 4th and 7th houses from lagna, being in 
his own house in kendra has created Bhadra Maha Purusa Yoga 
from Moon Lagna. He is again lagna and 10th Lord in his own 
kendra which is strongest of the 4th kendras. Here again he 
operates Badra Maha Purusa Yoga. 

Now, consider the Sun Lagna. He is in lagna itself in his own 
kendra again operating the Maha Purusa Yoga. 

The Badhakadhipathya dosha of Mercury considering from 
lagna is nullified by the aspect of malefic Saturn over Budha. As 
such this dasa is proving the most beneficial dasa considering all 
the three lagnas. 

Bhukthi: The natives Guru bukthi was from 2706.2001 to 
03.10.2003. Jupiter is in 4th kendra from lagna and again at 10th 
kendra from Moon lagna, similar to Mercury in the lagna kendra 
considering Sun lagna. As already stated in connection with 4th 
house under judgement ofbhava Jupiter has obtained more subha 
vargas. The dispositor Mercury has also obtained more subha 
vargas both being bukthi and dasa nathas. The aspecting Saturn 
on these planets has obtained 5 subha vargas out of 7 and has 
become benefic according to the Sudharsana Chakra principle. 
This Jupiter is lagna and 10th lord, from Sun lagna he is 7th and 
lOlhlord, from Moon langa he is 4th and 7th lord, so he strengthens 
all the four kendras. In this way Jupiter is proving the most benefic 
bukthi in the benefic dasa of Budha. We can say that he enjoyed 



Sudhaisana Chakra 349 

the best period of life during this period. Budha being intellectual 
planet influencing all the four kendras, so also the Jupiter. His 
illustrious, books were published. He had more income and 
enjoying all comforts of life. In this way we can discuss all the 
dasas and bukthis and arrive at a conclusion whether a particular 
dasa or bukthi will prove more benefic or malefic. 

3. Gochara 

Gochara results are considered only from Moon lagna. 
However according to Sudharasana Chakra principle wc will 
consider all the three lagnas and see what we can decide about 
the present trend of the life of the native. Here we will consider 
only major planets Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. 

1. Jupiter: Jupiter is 9th from Moon sign in 3rd from lagna 
and in 12th from Sun lagna as on 19.8.2000 Jupiter in 9th 
gives best results. Jupiter in 3rd from Lagna is moderately 
bad. He gives 1/3 benefic results. But considering him having 
obtained four more benefic vargas. His occupation in bad 
houses will also prove beneficial. 

2. Saturn : Saturn in 9th is bad from Moon sign, in 3rd from 
agna is very good, and in 12th from Sun lagna in a 
way gives the start of first two and half years of sadhe sati. 
Here again he proves 1/3 beneficial. But Saturn has obtained 
maximum benefic vargas six out of 7. Hence he will give the 
best results. 

3. Rahu : Rahu is in 10th from Moon lagna, in 4th from lagna 
and in lagna itself considering the Sun lagna. Hence in all the 
three cases he gives very bad results. But he has obtained 
three benefic vargas. 

4. Ketu : Similarly Ketu is in 4th from Moon lagna in 7th from 
Sun lagna and in 10th from lagna itself. Where he gives malefic 
results from all the three . Both Rahu and Ketu have obtained 
three benefic vargas out of 7. So they will give atleast 40% 
good results in any case. Putting up all these together we 
can decide the native can enjoy good results at least 70% 
considering the benefic vargasobtained by all the four planets. 



350 GocharPhaladeepfka 

4. Jeeva Sareera Principle 

Though this principle can be applied for judgement of 
horoscope, dasabukthi and gochara from all the three angles of 
Sudarsana Chakra principle explaining this in detail we will involve 
voluminous space. This may be advantageously applied to 
Gochara. In this system the Lord of the house where a planet 
transits become Jeeva planet and the lord of the house where 
Jeeva planet is situated is Sareera planet. When we take the case 
of Jupiter and Saturn transiting Taurus, its lord Venus was placed 
upto 26.08.2000, in Simha. Venus is the Jeeva planet The lord of 
house, where Venus is placed is Sun who Ls placed there itself. 
When these both planets Venus and Sun move through favourable 
bhavas from the three lagnas Jupiter and Saturn will give more 
benefic results. In transit results the Jeeva planet Venus gives 
benefic results in 9 places, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 / 9, 11 and 12th from Moon 
signs, or from the other two lagnas so to say for almost months in 
the year the results will be more benefic even in the case of malefic 
planets giving malefic results while in transit. Similarly the Sareera 
Lord can also be considered. In this way bad or good transit 
results get diluted and get a new shape with more percentage on 
the beneficial side in this case particularly, the other planets can 
also be judged like this. 

In the same way occupation of planets in constellations and 
occupation of constellation lords in some other constellations can 
be interpreted in terms of Jeeva and Sareera Frinciple. This will 
also involve more explanations. Readers themselves may consider 
and judge their results horn the principle given. 

5. Yearly, Monthly and Daily results according to Sudarsana 
Chakra Principle 

1 .The yearly results: In this system the 12 years beginning 
from the lagna will operate for each year from the date of birth. 
In the example the date of birth is 03.07.1930, the native was 
running 71st year after completing 5 cycles of 12 years each on 
2001. That was 11th year in the 6th cycle which belongs to 11th 
bhava from lagna between 03.07.2000 to 02.07.2001. The bhava 
lord is Saturn and is well placed (refer to our discussions earlier). 
Hence the native should enjoy good finance and comforts in this 
year. 



Sudharsana Chakra 35 1 

2,The monthly results: Let us consider 2nd months in the 
11th year of the 6th cycle so the first month starts from the 11th 
bhava and ends in 10th bhava on 02.07.2001. Here also the first 
month is influenced by Saturn the bhava lord. As such this month 
is very much fruitful upto 02,092000. From 03.09.2000 the 2nd 
month starts which operates 12th bhava, here also the lord being 
Saturn who has proved benefic by achieving more subha vargas, 
he proves more benefic and fruitful though ruling the 12 the 
bhava. Similarly each month should be judged by respective bhava 
lords and their obtaining subha vargas or vice-versa. 

3. The Daily Results : Now the month should be divided 
considering the 12 bhavas by 12 of 2 and 1/2 days each. Now in 
the 11th month the native was runing, as on 20.tl8.2000, the 8th 
2nd and 1/2 days portion of the 2nd month which started on 
03.08.2000 in the 11th year. Now counting horn 12th bhava which 
belongs to the 2nd month, the 8th gap of 2 and 1/2 days belong to 
7th bhava from Iagna. This operates upto 11.15 p.m. of 20.08.2000. 
The 7th lord Mercury has obtained the maximum benefic vargas, 
this 2 and 1/2 period will prove more benefic and satisfactory to 
the native. 

Similarly these 3 results may be judged with reference to Moon 
and Sun lagnas also. Peculiarly enough in this particular case the 
concerned planets from all the 3 lagnas occupy kendras and give 
similar benefic results only. 

Conclusion : The core principle of Sudarsana Chakra 
as explained by Sage Parashara is taken by mc as 
the main theory and 1 have explained this theory in my 
own way following traditional methods hitherto followed so far 
and in different ways. Going out of the tradition in certain cases 
to get best results in judgement which may please be borne in 
mind while going through this subject.
